1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,120
Today our goal is to focus on the

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:07,600
curriculum which is probably one of the

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,320
most important reasons why you will be

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,639
thinking about MFIN. And now for all of

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,759
you you're at a stage where you're

6
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:18,160
probably in you know in your senior or

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,080
junior year in undergrad or you're

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,680
working and you've been you know been in

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,680
the market for a few years and you're

10
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,800
thinking about coming back to some of

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,880
the fundamentals about the program. um

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,720
or you're just curious do you you know

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,680
you're exploring an MBA we're thinking

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,480
about an MIN um so you're at the right

15
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,280
place to learn more about our curriculum

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:43,200
today obviously uh a master of finance

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:45,840
program is um is is an uh is a pathway

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,160
to your career success and as Diane

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,039
mentioned you know we just had a session

20
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:54,079
on careers specifically but we do know

21
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,920
that in the world of Master of Finance

22
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,160
there are several programs that one can

23
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,239
consider consider and we believe that we

24
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,120
have a very unique curriculum and I'm so

25
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,960
excited to share that with you. So let's

26
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,560
start with uh something that I'm really

27
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:11,439
passionate about. I I have been in MIT

28
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,000
um for almost 14 years now. I I was in

29
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:17,119
the industry before that and what truly

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,520
keeps me excited about the opportunities

31
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:23,360
of working at MIT is is truly this

32
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,960
mission that guides the work we do. We,

33
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,280
you know, all the four of us here who

34
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,240
are, uh, on the call today, uh, are

35
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,759
excited and invested in, um, you know,

36
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:37,360
shaping future leaders, yourselves, um,

37
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:39,520
in a way that is grounded in ethics, in

38
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,320
principled innovation, in advanced

39
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,720
thinking, and that's exciting to me and

40
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:48,079
our curriculum reflects that aspect of

41
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:51,360
it. So, Master of Finance is part of a

42
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:54,079
portfolio of programs that the MIT Sloan

43
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,600
uh school offers. And this is a actually

44
00:01:54,079 --> 00:02:01,040
a really unique aspect of being in an

45
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,759
MIT class that your classmates are not

46
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,399
just folks who are from your own program

47
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:09,200
and in your age and stage group, but

48
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:11,520
from across uh different experience

49
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,360
levels, parts of the world. and it

50
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,480
really makes for a very dynamic

51
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,720
classroom experience which truly impacts

52
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,160
your learning education learning

53
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:24,319
opportunities here. So let's dive in

54
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,360
specifically to the Master of Finance

55
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:30,480
program. It is an 18month program that

56
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,040
starts in the summer uh and it has a

57
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,959
fall term, a spring term, a summer

58
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,680
internship and another fall term. So

59
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,760
that is typically the program. a handful

60
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,160
of folks go into the 12-month program

61
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,080
and we can talk a little bit about what

62
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,720
that is. Essentially, the degree

63
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,640
requirements are exactly the same. It's

64
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,840
just a much more compressed period of

65
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:54,720
time and it's well suited for students

66
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,959
who either have a job or are sponsored

67
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,720
or are very focused on what they're

68
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,840
trying to get out of their master of

69
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:05,920
finance. What I love about our

70
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:08,560
curriculum is that it it has a very

71
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,879
strong core that stands the test of

72
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,599
time. you know it was built by professor

73
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:16,000
Merton and professor low and you know um

74
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,239
stalwarts in the field who understand

75
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
that in order to have a master's degree

76
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,319
in finance there are some fundamental

77
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,640
principles and things about the markets

78
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:28,640
and tools you need to know but the

79
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,560
markets will keep evolving and um what

80
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,760
you need to know to be successful in

81
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,920
those markets um will be something that

82
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,920
we will teach through the electives. So

83
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:41,440
the beauty of our program is it's a

84
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:44,319
strong core that is not flexible but the

85
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,560
electives are and the pathways you can

86
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:49,360
create out of the program are

87
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:54,159
customizable tailored to your career

88
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:56,959
interests and that is extremely unique.

89
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:59,439
The most fundamental difference about an

90
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:02,480
MIT education is I would say this whole

91
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:05,680
notion of applying what you're learning.

92
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:09,439
It's it's um part of our ethos. It's

93
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,760
part of our um moto mens and manos which

94
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:15,120
means the mind and hand. And so action

95
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:18,479
learning or applicationbased

96
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,880
um coursework is something that is very

97
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,919
essential and is a required part of the

98
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:27,120
MIN experience. We also have some

99
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:29,120
interesting optional concentrations. uh

100
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,120
you can think of it as some kind of a

101
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:35,440
major maybe uh where you can drill down

102
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,160
on certain areas of finance that you

103
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,560
want to uh develop more specialized

104
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,040
skills and knowledge in. Um it's also

105
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,840
good to as a signaling tool for your

106
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:48,800
career purpose. Um and so we have five

107
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,440
of those. capital markets, corporate

108
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,600
finance, um social impact and climate

109
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:57,440
finance, financial engineering and a new

110
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,360
one that we introduced on fintech. So

111
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,520
that's kind of the summary at a high

112
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:05,840
level on the curricular side. That's

113
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:09,360
what we are focusing on today. Now

114
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,960
I can jump into um some of these I can

115
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,080
go through each and every single

116
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,759
concentration but I won't do that. So uh

117
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,240
you know I talked about the fintech

118
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,560
being a new concentration

119
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,919
um and uh you know so every

120
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,680
concentration is comprises of some

121
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:28,400
finance courses that you would like to

122
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,800
take or you would be required to take

123
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,039
and then a bunch of electives that are

124
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,880
not just finance but gives you much more

125
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:39,440
interdisciplinary way of thinking. So um

126
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,520
fintech for example there is a course

127
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,680
that we want all students to take which

128
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,199
is on consumer finance and fintech but

129
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,639
then you have these different

130
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:51,280
opportunities um to take courses from

131
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,759
VCs from financial engineering you can

132
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,320
go more advanced um you know analytics

133
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,639
and machine learning u new enterprises

134
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,800
is a fantastic course taught by our

135
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,720
Martin trust center for entrepreneurship

136
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,759
you typically will find a lot of MBAs

137
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,360
taking this course um fintech venture is

138
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,039
product design. Again, in product

139
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,199
design, you will actually see these are

140
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:13,360
mostly digital products that people look

141
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,680
uh working on, but you will also see

142
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:20,639
people from other uh degree programs

143
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:23,600
like you know um product uh from um sort

144
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:26,160
of undergrad from uh PhD students as

145
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,800
well. So it's very exciting to to be in

146
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,280
this sort of interdisciplinary space

147
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,680
where you are focusing on something you

148
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,000
are developing advanced skill sets but

149
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:39,199
you're also getting to take classes from

150
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,919
across Sloan courses as well as a

151
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:44,560
courses across MIT. So let's look at

152
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,639
another one. Um financial engineering

153
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,960
you know we have a very significant

154
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,759
number sometimes half the class is uh

155
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:54,400
looking at financial engineering

156
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:57,039
and uh we've got a very robust selection

157
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,440
of courses. This is uh starting with

158
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:03,039
your core right. I mean even in the core

159
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:05,520
we teach two um we have two coursework.

160
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:09,199
One in finance financial mathematics and

161
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:11,840
the other one in financial um analytics

162
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,520
and uh you're there are two versions of

163
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,840
that. There is a regular version and an

164
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,080
advanced version. If you are someone who

165
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,240
wants to pursue financial engineering,

166
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,560
maybe you're thinking about hedge funds,

167
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,400
quadrant trading, prop shops, you know,

168
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,520
as your future careers or even asset

169
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,680
management, investment management. Um I

170
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,000
often see our students uh venture into

171
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,360
the financial engineering world. Uh so

172
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,080
you would be taking these kind of

173
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:39,360
courses and then again there are um you

174
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:42,080
know as you see there are very advanced

175
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,639
finance electives for you to choose from

176
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,720
and then um you can take courses beyond

177
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,199
that. The machine learning and AI

178
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:52,319
courses listed over here. Some of them

179
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:55,440
are taught within uh by our finance

180
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,280
faculty. Some are taught at Sloan level

181
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,039
and then there are some that are you are

182
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,120
taking courses at computer science and

183
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:04,000
electrical engineering or at physics or

184
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,879
math and some uh you know a glimpse of

185
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,080
those courses are listed over here. So

186
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:14,560
it's really exciting uh opportunity for

187
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:18,000
you to develop capabilities um not only

188
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:20,720
through core and fundamental courses but

189
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,199
newer applicationbased courses

190
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,120
projectbased courses and then sitting in

191
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:28,400
classrooms where you're working with

192
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,400
MBAs and PhDs and then uh you know

193
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,919
undergrads and graduate students from

194
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:36,320
across the campus very vibrant

195
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,320
so um I'm not going to go through every

196
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,919
single concentration because you you

197
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,399
know there's there's climate a there's

198
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:45,040
climate action work that u our students

199
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:47,760
do there is you know corporate finance

200
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,240
uh but what I wanted to highlight about

201
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:53,680
students who uh you know are interested

202
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,600
in climate and sustainable finance is

203
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,600
again not only are they taking these

204
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,760
finance courses but they get the

205
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,640
opportunity to work with energy

206
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,080
initiatives at MIT um that particular

207
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,800
course or with the energy market

208
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,720
dynamics in a decarbonizing economy. I

209
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:12,240
think most likely this is a course that

210
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,240
is uh offered uh from one of the

211
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,040
engineering side of the campus. So it's

212
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,120
exa it's exciting that you can be in

213
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:22,320
this environment where you're learning

214
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,959
finance, you're learning tools, you're

215
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,760
learning how to think about business

216
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:31,519
problems, organizational problems and

217
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:33,920
then go as deep and quant as you want on

218
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,839
certain topics. Uh so that's just

219
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,320
fascinating.

220
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:41,519
So I thought what I'll do um because I

221
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:44,720
definitely want to go uh into questions

222
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:47,120
that you may have. Um but before we jump

223
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,680
into all the questions um let me give

224
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,240
you some an actual taste of what

225
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:55,839
students have done in the past because

226
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:58,640
that helps to understand and relate to

227
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:01,200
this whole gamut of coursework. Um

228
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,360
incidentally I mean I uh you know we we

229
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,000
did a study once to look at how many

230
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,000
possible electives or variety of

231
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,920
electives have our students taken and

232
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,720
it's um

233
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,959
from across 800 electives and and again

234
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:18,480
I I'll caveat that by saying there's not

235
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:22,480
800 electives in finance absolutely not

236
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:24,079
um but you know you're at MIT so if you

237
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,600
you know want to take a class in fluid

238
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:30,399
dynamics u you can do that so you know

239
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,560
And that's not going to be the whole um

240
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,160
listing of your coursework, but if

241
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,519
you're curious about something and if

242
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,760
you just want to take a couple of

243
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,920
courses outside of sort of the finance

244
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:43,279
and related fields, you're absolutely

245
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:45,760
welcome to do that. So, let's dive in

246
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:48,480
and see. Uh so, this is let me think uh

247
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,880
let's go back to that. Yeah. So, this

248
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:54,399
particular student I'm trying to

249
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:56,880
remember. Okay. So this student um you

250
00:10:54,399 --> 00:11:00,640
know is as comes from an engineering

251
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:03,040
background and uh his goal was if I

252
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:07,040
remember him correctly his goal was and

253
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:09,200
he is um working in a quant research um

254
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:12,640
capacity in an asset management company

255
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,880
right now. and he had he had a very

256
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,880
solid engineering background and he

257
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:21,279
wanted to kind of maximize as much

258
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:24,079
finance as he can uh do um in his two

259
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,920
years over here. In fact, if I remember

260
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,279
some of our conversations, he said, you

261
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,680
know, he was actually working in the

262
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:32,480
industry for a couple of years and his

263
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:35,600
goal for coming back to doing a master

264
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:38,160
of finance was actually to strengthen

265
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,000
his knowledge in finance fundamentals

266
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,079
and core and knowledge of markets

267
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,920
because he said I felt that if I really

268
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,880
want to commit to a career in this

269
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:50,720
field, I want to I want to strengthen my

270
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:53,360
understanding uh of finance. So

271
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,519
the courses you see listed over here are

272
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,920
not core courses. Core courses everyone

273
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,680
has to take. So here are some additional

274
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,240
courses that he took, some electives

275
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,480
that he took. Uh one the first one that

276
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,480
he took in the first fall it's uh about

277
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,399
understanding financial statements and

278
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,000
the other one is about making uh

279
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,839
decisions

280
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,600
and you know he's right now in an asset

281
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:16,000
management company. So obviously there's

282
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,800
a lot of kind of that strategic thinking

283
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,600
when you're using quant research into

284
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,839
asset allocation. Uh and then he did

285
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,720
finance lab. He did a phenomenal finance

286
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:29,120
lab project. He took uh the advanced

287
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:32,639
finance uh courses. He obviously took

288
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,560
asset management. You know any uh

289
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,399
investor is obviously going to learn a

290
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,959
little bit about crypto and blockchain.

291
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:42,079
And so he took the crypto course some

292
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:44,399
derivatives not surprisingly being a

293
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:47,040
good investor you you want to learn

294
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:49,360
about uh global economics and the

295
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:52,320
implications of that. So that's how he

296
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,760
kind of designed his coursework and an

297
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,240
interesting course that he took you'll

298
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,760
see corporations at crossroads. This is

299
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,839
something he took in his second fall

300
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,480
when he came back from his internship

301
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:05,839
and he said you know um this is a course

302
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:10,000
where uh senior leaders some seale

303
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:12,720
executives a lot of CEOs uh uh come to

304
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,560
the class and it's a close class

305
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:19,440
actually taught by our senior leadership

306
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:22,800
at MIT and uh the these these executives

307
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:26,240
discuss with students what difficulties

308
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:29,279
what what um real challenges they faced

309
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:31,279
at certain junctions of their career and

310
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:33,200
how they thought through that

311
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:35,120
decision-making. So again, this is a

312
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,440
really well-rounded

313
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,440
uh portfolio of courses where a student

314
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,160
with an engineering background, very

315
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:46,399
strong quants is pursuing a quantrol

316
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:49,440
right now really wanted to um strengthen

317
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:51,680
his understanding of finance and global

318
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,920
economics. Let's look at another co

319
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:57,440
another student.

320
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:59,279
Um this is a student who uh had a

321
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,000
certain amount of quant background but

322
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:04,639
not as much as the previous person we

323
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,720
were talking about. And so one of the

324
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:11,199
things you will notice is uh that this

325
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,440
student um they took a little bit more

326
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:16,880
coursework in

327
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:20,240
fun like economics uh decision-m

328
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:24,079
um programming uh if I remember this

329
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:26,160
person correctly um this person had a

330
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:28,320
very strong background in economics and

331
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,560
statistics but hadn't done enough

332
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,519
programming. So they actually took one

333
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:36,639
of the uh intro courses that computer

334
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:40,399
science department offers to sort of um

335
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:42,880
strengthen that aspect of um their um

336
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:45,839
programming skill sets. And again you'll

337
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:50,079
see the student also took a course of

338
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:54,720
leading in ambiguity. So what's exciting

339
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:57,440
is that our students absolutely focus on

340
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:00,480
the fundamentals. they develop some

341
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:04,720
extremely strong quantitative uh skill

342
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:08,079
sets. Um but they also don't do that in

343
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:10,399
the absence of the context in which

344
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:13,680
they're going to be uh you know working

345
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:16,320
in. So all of them we train our students

346
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,000
to think about not just your first job,

347
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,519
not just that you know I'm going to make

348
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,600
this crazy model and um just geek out on

349
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:27,120
it. Of course you can do that. But the

350
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:30,079
idea is how can you actually become a

351
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,160
finance leader in the future and you

352
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:35,519
know start thinking about some of the

353
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:38,560
more macro aspects uh of running an

354
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:42,720
organization while also studying the

355
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:45,279
depth of quantitative finance.

356
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:49,279
Do we have another example Rachel? Uh

357
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:51,920
probably not. So maybe at this point um

358
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:54,480
Katie, would you like to tell the

359
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:57,360
students about sort of the arc of how

360
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,920
this experience goes? I know that you

361
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,839
advise hundreds of MFN students and

362
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,360
you're probably more suited to talk a

363
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:06,800
little bit about that arc of that

364
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,639
experience. Yes, thank you so much. So

365
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,720
um as you will notice here, first and

366
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,480
foremost, we have a summer start. This

367
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,720
is really what sets the EMIN program

368
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,839
apart and sets our students up for

369
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,759
success by getting ahead of the game uh

370
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,320
in the summer term. This is an

371
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:25,040
accelerated abbreviated summer term that

372
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:28,000
takes place during July through August.

373
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:31,199
Uh that sets the foundation for your

374
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,839
learning at Sloan and more largely at

375
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:37,199
MIT. During the summer term, you will be

376
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:39,440
enrolled in um four courses which are

377
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:41,600
part of your mandatory core in the

378
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,560
program. And these courses will lay the

379
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,480
groundwork for more advanced studies and

380
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:49,199
those that you can tailor later on in

381
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,600
the program. After the summer term in

382
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:53,839
the fall, you will continue some of your

383
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,079
core studies with financial markets,

384
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,560
corporate finance, ethics, which is a

385
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:00,800
half-term course, and analytics. Here

386
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,199
you have the options for advanced or

387
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,039
regular analytics. Also during this

388
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,720
time, some students begin their action

389
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:10,160
learning uh requirement with a

390
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:12,400
proseminar or take electives. Following

391
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:16,319
that, this is when students really start

392
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:18,319
to dive in and curate their studies to

393
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,760
their specific career. They do this

394
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:22,079
through the type of action learning

395
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,439
requirements that they enroll in and the

396
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:26,480
projects that they're ultimately

397
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:28,400
assigned to as well as their restricted

398
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,960
electives and the more large electives

399
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:34,080
that they take at Sloan across MIT or

400
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:36,160
even crossregister for at Harvard.

401
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,559
This allows students to pursue a

402
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,880
concentration if they like, enroll in a

403
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,799
certificate program, or just deepen

404
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,200
their studies in an area that might be

405
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:47,039
suited for them in terms of their

406
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,799
recruiting for an internship or a

407
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:53,760
full-time position. So, uh, our unique

408
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:55,760
period um during January is part of AP,

409
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,720
which is independent activities period.

410
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:01,679
This is when, uh, our very popular

411
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,520
finance lab runs. Um, and then it goes

412
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:06,400
into the spring term, which runs from

413
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:09,039
February through May. After May,

414
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:12,480
students in our 18-month program, uh,

415
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:15,440
pursue their internships, and then

416
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,280
return in the fall for their final term.

417
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,520
At this time, this is when students in

418
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,360
the 18-month program would complete a

419
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,760
communications requirement, which is

420
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:26,320
really tailored to finance careers and

421
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,640
communicating the data and the

422
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:31,280
day-to-day work that you are doing. um

423
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,200
as well as finishing up their elective

424
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:36,000
studies and any additional

425
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,919
concentration, certificate or other

426
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,480
opportunities such as a thesis

427
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,160
independent study they may be pursuing.

428
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,400
Um students in the 18-month program

429
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,559
finish their studies in December and are

430
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:50,160
conferred in February and welcome back

431
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:51,679
to celebrate in um May or June of the

432
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,480
following year.

433
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:57,039
>> Thank you, Kitty. Thank you so much. And

434
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,919
all of this amazing experiences is

435
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:03,200
taught by our world-class faculty uh

436
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:06,880
comprising Nobel laureates, global

437
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:09,280
experts, practitioners in the field. um

438
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:13,280
you know the one of one of the new

439
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:16,960
courses in AI research in applications

440
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:19,360
AI and um research and um finance has

441
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:22,000
been launched by Hu Chen and Dennet

442
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:26,080
Kogan who's our faculty director as you

443
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,080
can see and again just fantastic courses

444
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:31,919
uh you know there were several questions

445
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:34,960
around how we stay on top of uh the

446
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,080
trends and how we evolve our curriculum

447
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,400
it's one of my favorite questions

448
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,880
questions uh to get because I love to

449
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,799
boast about how our courses keep

450
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,760
changing every year. You know, we have

451
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:47,840
this course list uh that um you know,

452
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:51,120
you're going to see on our on our

453
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:53,919
website and while the co core remains uh

454
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:56,640
sort of more or less the same in terms

455
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:59,760
of the coursework, the content changes,

456
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,679
but new courses are constantly added. Um

457
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:04,799
we've had you know four new courses in

458
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:06,720
AI and um this year that have been added

459
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:08,720
in sort of the intersections of AI and

460
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,080
finance in different ways and you know

461
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,160
one of them is being taught it's called

462
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,080
AI and money and it's being taught by

463
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:18,480
professor Gary Gensler who was the

464
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:20,320
former um chair of the SEC and his the

465
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,679
way he's thinking about the course is

466
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:26,320
how the presence of AI uh and its

467
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:28,480
influence on financial markets uh

468
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,720
requires you to develop more critical

469
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:33,919
thinking capabilities. On the other

470
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,919
hand, Professor Kogan and Professor Chen

471
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:40,000
has introduced an AI and machine

472
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:42,159
learning research course in um in in

473
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,320
finance where you're literally learning

474
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:48,159
how to model various types of uh you

475
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,400
know financial phenomenon and risks

476
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:52,720
using AI. So for example, there's a

477
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,320
course uh there's a you know team that

478
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,880
is looking at political risk and

479
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,679
volatility. There is a and sorry

480
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:02,159
political risk and firm valuation. there

481
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:05,679
is a team that is looking at uh trading

482
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:09,280
volume and uh volatility alpha you you

483
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:14,000
know so from very quant um applications

484
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:16,080
of AI to critical thinking uh using AI

485
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,039
uh it's just so exciting that our

486
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:21,120
coursework keeps changing and as you

487
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:24,480
know the fundamental aspect as I was

488
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:27,280
talking about is is um action learning

489
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:30,159
it's you know you have these amazing

490
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:32,640
courses that allow allow the students to

491
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:35,360
take the classroom learning in across

492
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,360
public and private markets into real

493
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,200
world projects um that you can do

494
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:42,159
throughout the year. So that's just so

495
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:44,159
phenomenal. So with that um Diane, is it

496
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:47,159
back to you and then we can pick up some

497
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,159
questions.

498
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,240
Yes, it is busy answering some of those

499
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,159
questions. That's great. Thank you all

500
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,960
for all these great questions that are

501
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:59,600
coming in. um we are working very hard

502
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:02,240
to get to all of them. Um but I know

503
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,960
that um for many of you hopefully this

504
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,600
has inspired you even further in hearing

505
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,520
about the amazing courses and and

506
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:12,720
learnings that you'll be able to get our

507
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:15,760
faculty all the the you know academic

508
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:18,240
resources that are also provided to our

509
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,600
students both one-on-one as well as

510
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,400
collectively. There are many

511
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,559
opportunities for you to really sit down

512
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,880
and say have you know these are this is

513
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:28,720
my plan these are the skills or the gaps

514
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,880
where I really think for me to be able

515
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,799
to launch a career in finance is going

516
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,760
to make sense um and to have those

517
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:38,320
conversations you know with Hermy's team

518
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:40,480
um is really an an important part an

519
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,640
aspect of what we offer in addition to

520
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,200
of course our um career services and

521
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,640
those adviserss. So, in terms of the

522
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,559
application, I'm just going to quickly

523
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,799
go over this because, uh, this is all

524
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:53,120
available online. The application is

525
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:55,679
live. Um, first and foremost, let me

526
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:58,480
just say that, um, you can apply to

527
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:00,320
multiple programs at MIT. Uh, there's

528
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,559
absolutely no negative inference if you

529
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,480
choose to do so. Um, the other thing I

530
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:06,480
will mention is we do not have rolling

531
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:09,200
admissions. So, as you can see, the

532
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:11,280
deadline to apply is the 5th of January

533
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:14,240
2026. And that's for anyone who's

534
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:18,080
planning or intends to enroll in July of

535
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:20,640
2026. Um, we as a policy in terms of a

536
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:23,760
standard, you should only be applying if

537
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:25,760
you intend to enroll next year. That's

538
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,000
something that um is really important to

539
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:30,080
think about. If you're not ready, that's

540
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,919
fine. then you may want to wait um until

541
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,320
a time such that you feel more

542
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,880
comfortable and ready to to take on the

543
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:39,280
Master of Finance program. Um it goes by

544
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,960
so quickly. Um and as you can see from

545
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:44,559
everything that you've heard from Ermy

546
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:46,400
and Katie, it is um really chock full of

547
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:48,400
lots of information and skills that

548
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,559
you're going to need to get through. So

549
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,080
in terms of the application components,

550
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,600
and these are not listed in any

551
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,080
particular order other than just

552
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:59,520
alphabetically. So every component of

553
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:02,080
our application is important. Um it's a

554
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:04,720
little bit of a cliche but our our

555
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,640
admissions process is very holistic. We

556
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,200
are looking at everything. And I will

557
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:11,520
also say that upfront if you look at our

558
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,159
class profile which is available online

559
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:16,799
and and perhaps Rachel um will be able

560
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:19,039
to put the link in that um in the chat

561
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:21,200
in the Q&A for you to be able to see it.

562
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:23,440
Um they come from multiple disciplines

563
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,240
and backgrounds. uh to quote one of our

564
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,880
faculty, uh you don't necessarily need

565
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:31,360
to come with a lot of finance coursework

566
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,200
um as an undergrad um or in if you've

567
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,360
already earned a master's degree or

568
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,840
advanced degree. We can teach you

569
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,600
finance. What we're really seeking are

570
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,600
individuals who have the academic

571
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,640
strength, the problem solving and

572
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:46,720
analytical skills, um who have a passion

573
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:49,440
and understanding of what it might be

574
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,360
like to pursue the field of finance. um

575
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,919
this isn't a pre-professional or early

576
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:56,400
career program. Many of our students are

577
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:58,080
coming directly from um university. So

578
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,760
you'll see all that information is

579
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,840
available on our website. These are all

580
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,279
the application components. So obviously

581
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,600
we're going to be looking at academic

582
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:08,400
transcripts, looking at what courses you

583
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:10,080
take and are some of those courses um

584
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,559
more, you know, substantive and

585
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,840
quantitative in nature. uh it you know

586
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:16,559
it could be from many different

587
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:18,559
disciplines engineering physics um other

588
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:20,320
sciences or other coursework that you've

589
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:23,279
done econometrics

590
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:26,240
uh we are you know offering if you'd

591
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:29,279
like to submit the GMAT or GRE they are

592
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:31,039
acceptable uh but they are optional so

593
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:33,200
it's really your decision and your call

594
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:35,520
if you believe that that uh providing

595
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,520
those test scores are really going to um

596
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,200
help to us on the admissions committee

597
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,120
to get a better sense of your academic

598
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,120
strength and then we are looking for

599
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,039
three letters of recommendation. Um,

600
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,559
this is all detailed out in the

601
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:49,039
application itself. We're looking for

602
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:51,279
two academic and one professional,

603
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:53,360
meaning, you know, presumably you've had

604
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:55,760
some internship experience, so a more

605
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:58,720
recent internship. We're also looking

606
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:01,200
for relevant coursework on, you know,

607
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:04,320
the MIN program is a deep dive into

608
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:07,840
quantitative finance. a lot of the

609
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:10,320
essential foundations in work such as

610
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:12,400
you know mathematics and we again we ask

611
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:15,120
about this in the application whether

612
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:17,600
that be calculus statistics probability

613
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:20,320
these are all really ways to help you to

614
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:22,480
be able to thrive in the program um

615
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,960
given all the financial modeling and the

616
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,960
stochastic processes and vector analyses

617
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,240
and all the different um aspects of the

618
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,200
program that you're going to be working

619
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:34,400
on. So, we are looking at some specific

620
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,840
coursework. Uh, you may be uh able to do

621
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,440
some of that online if you haven't been

622
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,440
able to do that as part of your um

623
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,360
undergraduate or graduate studies and

624
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,320
that's perfectly acceptable. And then if

625
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,640
you have any professional

626
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:47,520
certifications, um we're happy to see

627
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,200
those as well. A resume, very specific

628
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:52,080
um instructions on what that should look

629
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:54,799
like and how to um put that in place. Uh

630
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:57,279
as well as some short answer questions.

631
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:59,200
You'll see all of that. Um, some of them

632
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:01,120
are just, you know, a little bit more

633
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,520
about you. And then we have a couple of

634
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:06,240
video questions. Um, I would say, you

635
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:08,240
know, one is a way for you to introduce

636
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,080
yourself to your future classmates and

637
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,200
for them to get to know who you are a

638
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,960
little bit better as well as the

639
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,200
admissions committee. And then there'll

640
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,799
be one um question that's a purely

641
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,720
randomized

642
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:21,840
uh what I would call general interest

643
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:24,880
non-technical question um that will be

644
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,559
um a timed one. Uh but again this is all

645
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,360
part of as I said all of these

646
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:31,760
components uh are really important and

647
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,840
part of helping us to understand who you

648
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:36,799
are why you're applying to the Master of

649
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:38,320
Finance program uh and hopefully to

650
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:42,120
demonstrate that you'll be able to

651
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:42,120
thrive at MIT.

652
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:47,919
Okay. So how are we doing on questions?

653
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:51,760
I'm going to actually stop. This is the

654
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:53,279
general um email um that you can send

655
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,360
certainly send questions. I believe we

656
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:57,919
also have a specific one for MIN which

657
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:01,760
is on our website. Um and maybe Rachel

658
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:03,919
if you can just put that one in the um

659
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:06,159
chat or Q&A because I know there's a

660
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:08,080
specific MIF admissions email that you

661
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:10,159
can send to us. And then again, if you

662
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:12,480
want to scan this QR code to join us at

663
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:14,720
an upcoming event, both virtual or in

664
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,720
person, um please go ahead and do that.

665
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,880
All of this information around

666
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:21,279
admissions is all available on our

667
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:26,000
website and in the application. So I am

668
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:29,840
going to stop sharing my slides and um

669
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:32,000
lean to into our um other folks here

670
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:34,720
Rachel Katie others. Are there any

671
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:38,000
questions in particular that we want to

672
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:41,880
answer live um for that be of interest

673
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,880
in terms of the curriculum?

674
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:46,880
Let's see.

675
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:50,399
Okay.

676
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:52,240
>> Hi Diane. Yes, I'm happy to share from

677
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:54,159
both the questions that came up today as

678
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,559
well as questions that were submitted

679
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:58,559
prior to the session. Uh there were

680
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:02,640
several questions around concentrations

681
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:04,720
if you must do one. Um and if you can

682
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,799
pursue more than one. So I just want to

683
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,360
clarify that concentrations are

684
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:11,760
optional. Yes, more than half of our

685
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,279
students do end up pursuing at least one

686
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,279
concentration

687
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:17,200
um specifically because these are to

688
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:18,960
help you position yourself within the

689
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,760
job market and show how you've tailored

690
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:24,159
your studies um specifically to your

691
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:27,600
desired career path. However, they are

692
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:30,399
not mandatory and yes, you can choose

693
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,919
more than one. Uh I think in recent

694
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:34,320
years, we've had some students do as

695
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:36,320
many as three concentrations. All this

696
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,399
requires is your flexibility and

697
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:41,799
dedication and working closely with your

698
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:41,799
program advisor.

699
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:48,000
Okay, great. Um, someone is asking about

700
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,440
venture. He's interested or she is

701
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,679
interested in venture capital

702
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:54,880
postgraduation. Any suggestions on

703
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:56,080
concentration in the program um for

704
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,640
following that career path?

705
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:01,200
>> Yeah. Um so you know before I answer

706
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:03,600
that question I I I want to just uh you

707
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,760
know piggyback on what uh Katie just

708
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:08,320
mentioned. The concentrations and the

709
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:10,080
design of the program in general the MIN

710
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:14,399
program the design of the program in

711
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:17,440
general is to help you support your

712
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:20,240
pathway uh and as as long as it's

713
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:23,520
related to finance and related spaces.

714
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:26,480
Uh so we are not dis you know we have

715
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:28,880
done a study about our our curriculum

716
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:31,840
looked at other curriculums and what's

717
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:35,200
very exciting and unique is that we have

718
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:38,080
a whole span of coursework and our

719
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:42,080
students going in a whole array of

720
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:45,919
careers um that span from the highly

721
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:48,720
quantitative rigorous mathematical work

722
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:51,360
to the behavioral finance and economics

723
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:54,080
and sort of um you know the consumer

724
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:55,840
aspects of finance as well. So it's it's

725
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,919
uh we have students who go into

726
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:00,640
investment banking and private equity

727
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:03,760
and venture capital. We've got folks who

728
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:06,399
go into traditional um you know

729
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:08,080
financial fields like asset management,

730
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:10,320
investment management, those who go into

731
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:14,559
prop shops, quant trading, quant

732
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:16,960
research. Um we also have people who are

733
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:19,760
looking into fintech opportunities from

734
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:23,279
being in product design to actually

735
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:25,039
fintech in you know ventures um real

736
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:28,240
estate. We have a couple of folks who go

737
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:30,320
into real estate as well. So really it's

738
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:33,520
when you think about why should I come

739
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:35,600
to MIT think of do you have a passion

740
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:39,039
and an interest in finance that you want

741
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:43,120
to explore? Do you want to strengthen

742
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:45,840
your qu skills while also expanding your

743
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:48,640
uh world view? Do you want to strengthen

744
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:52,159
your network? Do you want to be a part

745
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:54,240
of an institute like MIT where you know

746
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:56,799
not just take courses within a business

747
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:59,519
school but within an engineering school

748
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:03,039
and a and a science school. So it's it's

749
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:06,080
that holistic way of thinking is what

750
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:08,320
makes it so exciting and our adviserss

751
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:11,519
like Katie and others will help you sort

752
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:13,760
of cater and design a pathway that makes

753
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:15,679
you successful. So your question, one of

754
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:18,480
the questions was on um you know venture

755
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:22,720
capital. Absolutely. We've had uh I will

756
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:24,559
say that VC um as a field is hired to is

757
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:27,600
is tougher to break into straight out of

758
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:31,519
an Min because they don't hire a lot of

759
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:34,960
people in general. Um but you can start

760
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:38,320
your um journey here. We have fantastic

761
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:40,640
courses uh that are specifically VC

762
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:43,120
focused actually but also in general the

763
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:45,200
fintech concentration uh is a phenomenal

764
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:47,519
concentration to be part of because you

765
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:50,399
also build your cohort of likeminded

766
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:53,840
peers um and then you can be part of the

767
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:56,720
VC club at MIT Sloan and and take other

768
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:59,039
coursework at our Martin Trust Center

769
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,480
which helps you not only develop the

770
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:03,519
understanding of finance but

771
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:05,760
understanding of early stage ventures uh

772
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:08,240
and how to kind of help them scale, how

773
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:10,640
to help them um build their momentum.

774
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,080
And so it's it's really an exciting

775
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,559
field to be in. We do have a couple

776
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,880
people going into VCs every year,

777
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:15,919
>> right?

778
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,760
>> What else Diane?

779
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:19,519
>> So we have another question about in

780
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:22,080
addition to the core modules for the

781
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:24,320
18-month program, how many electives can

782
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:26,720
you take? I know this is always a what

783
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:28,880
what's the the course load that anyone

784
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,519
can really take? Um and from different

785
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,799
concentrations even. So as I mean I'm

786
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:34,640
going to punt this question to Katie but

787
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:37,679
I will just say this everything is

788
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:41,039
dependent on your goal your career goal

789
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:43,600
your academic learning goal and how you

790
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:45,200
want to and how much other stuff is

791
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:49,279
going on in your life. Are you someone

792
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:52,960
who has a job already and therefore you

793
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:55,360
know uh you have uh more time to take

794
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:57,760
even more rigorous coursework. you know

795
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:59,760
it's really a balance of many things and

796
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,760
at what point of time you know sometimes

797
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,919
we have people taking less coursework in

798
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:06,399
their first fall besides the core

799
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:08,320
courses uh and then you see the second

800
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:10,399
fall they're taking a lot of courses in

801
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:12,320
spring but Katie any specific sort of

802
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:13,919
average you see when you're when you're

803
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,919
advising your students

804
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:18,560
>> yeah I would say you know the summer is

805
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:22,399
lock set for you so um that's really the

806
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:24,320
only term that uh we enroll you and you

807
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:27,599
have a set number of courses after that

808
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:30,240
it's totally up to you, your goals, and

809
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:31,919
um your ability. So, I would say on

810
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:34,399
average in the first fall term, we see

811
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:36,480
students take four to five classes uh

812
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:38,800
and then they only increase from there

813
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,320
typically. Uh, of course, for students

814
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:43,599
in the 12-month program, that's much

815
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:46,560
higher. In terms of the degree

816
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:48,320
requirements, so you have restricted

817
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:50,639
electives. We ask you to take at least

818
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,480
four of these. If you are pursuing a

819
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:55,280
concentration, you will likely take more

820
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:57,520
than four, usually around six. Um,

821
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:01,440
however, beyond that, you are able to

822
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:03,200
enroll in any Sloan courses, uh, MIT

823
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:06,400
courses. So, it's very common to see

824
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:08,560
students, as my mentioned, taking higher

825
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:11,520
level economics, finance, computer

826
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:13,359
science courses, um, as well as

827
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:15,520
crossregistering. Many students choose

828
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:18,320
to in future terms, be it spring or

829
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:20,400
second fall, crossregister at Harvard.

830
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,960
um they often do so for leadership

831
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,880
courses, maybe some niche negotiation

832
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,119
courses to supplement their finance

833
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:30,160
studies as they think towards long-term

834
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:32,240
management roles as they progress. Um I

835
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:35,200
think one of the many benefits of the

836
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:36,960
program is this ability to understand

837
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,800
what your recruiting cycle looks like,

838
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,119
supplement that with classes that really

839
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,839
matter in real time. So, what do you

840
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:46,160
need at this point in time in recruiting

841
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:48,640
and what will you need for your future

842
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:51,119
internship or job and tailor your

843
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:53,040
schedule to that?

844
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:54,640
>> Thank you, Kitty. Um um you know, you

845
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,839
mentioned the negotiation class, which I

846
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,880
think is really important for me to

847
00:35:55,839 --> 00:36:00,079
mention. Um we have every year a good

848
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,240
handful of students going into

849
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:03,440
investment banking and for those

850
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,680
students you know they are taking

851
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,640
obviously corporate finance advanced

852
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:11,440
corporate finance they're taking um you

853
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:13,359
know valuation courses but they're also

854
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:16,400
encouraged and many of them take courses

855
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:20,640
in negotiations in law in organizational

856
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:22,800
management um in decision- making. So,

857
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:25,200
you know, these are all very, you know,

858
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:28,640
interesting ways of thinking about

859
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:30,560
expanding your skill set, not just in

860
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,920
from a quantitative perspective, but a

861
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,960
holistic perspective, an

862
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,640
interdicciplinary perspective. Um, and

863
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,800
while I'm on the topic of investment

864
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:41,119
banking, I I you know, you're going to

865
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:43,280
hear me say this many, many times, but

866
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:46,000
if you are interested in pursuing an

867
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:49,040
investment banking internship, you must

868
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:53,119
be looking into those opportunities by,

869
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:55,280
you know, early um in during winter. Uh,

870
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:58,079
so January, February are often the

871
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:00,480
deadlines. And so this is this catches

872
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,320
our students surprise. It's basically

873
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:05,520
even before we've given decisions about

874
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:08,400
EMIN. So just please track that on your

875
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:11,200
own. That is extremely important. We

876
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:14,400
don't control the market. Diet.

877
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:16,160
>> Yeah. Um no great. So we did have I know

878
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,760
I think are we running short on time

879
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,280
here? So I want to make sure there's a

880
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:23,040
lot of questions about the application.

881
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:25,520
Can I just um say to all of you um we

882
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:27,920
have many um info sessions that are

883
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,599
already um posted recordings of them

884
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,359
about that are more specific to the

885
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:33,359
application and admissions process.

886
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:35,680
encourage you to take a look at those.

887
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:37,760
We will have an application tips webinar

888
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:40,079
coming up in another month and a half.

889
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:42,800
Um so definitely stay tuned for more

890
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:44,800
information. The application really is a

891
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:47,200
great resource. Um we have a lot of

892
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,880
details and instructions and it's very

893
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,960
you know for the most part should be

894
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:54,079
pretty clear about what we're looking

895
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:56,000
for um and what's required. So please

896
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:59,680
just read through those. But we are here

897
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,520
to help. Please email that Empress.

898
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,440
If we don't get to some of your

899
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:05,599
application questions today, I want to

900
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:08,320
take the time that we have with me and

901
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:11,200
Katie to really focus on um more of the

902
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:14,800
the core of the curriculum itself. So I

903
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:16,960
think maybe as a closing question uh

904
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:19,920
there is one about what are the common

905
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:22,079
traits you see among the most successful

906
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:24,400
students in the program.

907
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:26,640
Um, thank you for asking that and and

908
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:30,720
I'm sure Diane will say more in future

909
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:34,400
sessions, but but honestly curiosity.

910
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:36,240
Um, you if you are coming to MIT,

911
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:39,839
uh, we're looking for someone who's

912
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:43,040
really curious to expand their

913
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:45,920
worldview, expand the way they think,

914
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:48,079
uh, to somebody who's who's excited to

915
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:52,000
participate in a community and build a

916
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:55,040
network. Um, if your only goal is to get

917
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,880
a job, I wouldn't say this is the right

918
00:38:55,040 --> 00:39:00,079
place for you. You will get a job.

919
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:03,359
That's not the point. But that's a very

920
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:07,359
narrow way of thinking about the MIN

921
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:11,440
experience. The Master of Finance at MIT

922
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:14,560
is is a very holistic experience and you

923
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:17,520
can go as deep as you want academically

924
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:19,920
and build incredible proficiencies in

925
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:24,079
tools, markets, knowledge that you

926
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:26,880
didn't have before, but you're going to

927
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:30,240
make the best use of it if you want to

928
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:32,560
build a network. If you want to uh if

929
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:35,200
you're curious, if you want to hear

930
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:37,200
about talks uh that are happening in

931
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:40,400
different parts of the campus that

932
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:42,880
really expand the way you think um

933
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:45,920
because the what we see is the people

934
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:48,400
who make a difference in the market uh

935
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:51,440
after graduating from our program are

936
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:54,720
the people who are able to be original

937
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:58,160
thinkers, problem solvers with the tools

938
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:59,839
of finance but they go beyond uh the

939
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:03,599
call of duty and that's what we are

940
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:06,400
trying to look for as we look at your um

941
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:08,960
you know as we look at your uh

942
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,720
applications. Um I know that was

943
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:13,760
supposed to be the last question but

944
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:16,240
there I did see a lot of uh questions

945
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:19,119
around in the past around sort of give

946
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:21,520
us some examples of some you know action

947
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:23,920
learning work that we do or applied work

948
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:25,920
we do. So I'll just give one example or

949
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:30,079
two example just to help you understand

950
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:33,040
how expansive your uh you know worldview

951
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:36,320
can become you know uh fin example or

952
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:38,160
the research course um they allow

953
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:40,640
students to work both in private and

954
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:42,240
public markets you know one AI based

955
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:44,880
application that our students are

956
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:48,560
working on is to identify how political

957
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:50,640
risk influences firm valuation you know

958
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:52,400
that's one work they're doing it's a

959
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:54,079
research paper that you're working with

960
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,680
three or four faculty members. There's a

961
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:58,000
team working on that. There's another

962
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:01,040
team that is looking at the inclusion of

963
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:04,160
gold, crypto, um commodities, real

964
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:07,200
estate in um and how that is enhancing

965
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:08,560
asset allocation. Um you know, uh

966
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,240
they're trying to hedge against

967
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:12,480
inflation. They're trying to reduce

968
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:14,319
portfolio volatility. They're looking at

969
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:17,040
long-term growth. So, that's a very

970
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:18,400
different type of uh an application that

971
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:21,520
folks are looking at. There's another

972
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:23,839
team that is um that worked on um

973
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:26,160
long-term you know sustainable housing.

974
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:28,640
So uh and then of course there's a whole

975
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:31,520
bunch of folks who are working on pitch

976
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:35,280
decks, valuation models. So it's really

977
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:36,800
a very exciting vibrant place where you

978
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:39,520
learn

979
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:41,680
with amazing like-minded peers but then

980
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:43,200
you go into a world where you have so

981
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,960
many people from different backgrounds,

982
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:48,720
different parts of the world taking

983
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:51,119
classes with you. uh you you have very

984
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:54,079
foundational courses, very advanced

985
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:57,760
courses, critical thinking courses,

986
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:59,520
teamwork, um a place that is passionate

987
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,760
about problem solving and about making

988
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:04,240
the world a better place. That's what's

989
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:06,800
MIT about. And so you have to be excited

990
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:09,200
about that vision and and come here for

991
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,200
that purpose.
