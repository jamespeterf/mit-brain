1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:04,000
really it's a pleasure to be here to

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:06,040
tell you about the research that's going

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,639
on in my academic laboratory at the

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:10,240
broad Institute and as well because we

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,920
work on so many collaborations you'll

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,920
hear a little bit about what's going on

7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,880
in other labs that we're collaborating

8
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,720
with and you'll see a few examples of

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,960
startups that have launched from this

10
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,039
kind of work so let's get started I'm

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,279
going to talk today I know everyone here

12
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,160
has different background some some uh

13
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:30,080
most I guess biotech um but some AI my

14
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,200
work is computational but as you'll see

15
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,200
everything is is quite grounded in

16
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:37,559
application to the pharmaceutical

17
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,559
industry so um first of all I'm guessing

18
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:42,600
most of you are familiar with at least

19
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:46,079
one of these two laws um moris law which

20
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:48,399
is just this mindblowing uh success of

21
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,079
human technology human Ingenuity has

22
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,000
allowed compute to get cheaper and

23
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,960
cheaper and then the very depressing

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,800
AR's law just sort of the opposite where

25
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,399
discovering new medicines is just really

26
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,480
challenging and um we're all aware of

27
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,040
this even outside the Pharma industry

28
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,439
you're aware of um how uh how many

29
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,799
diseases go uncured and how expensive

30
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:13,799
medications are to develop so uh there's

31
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,240
been significant enthusiasm maybe AI can

32
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:19,400
get us out of this pickle maybe AI can

33
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:23,280
help us to um increase the speed of

34
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:25,520
identifying new drugs and I think when

35
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,040
we say Ai and Drug Discovery it covers

36
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,520
so many different potential um steps in

37
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,320
the pathway we just heard about an

38
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:35,240
excellent one um and so I want to talk

39
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,840
about a very specific uh type of

40
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,840
Technology that's being applied to a lot

41
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,280
of different steps and the most of the

42
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,479
work I'll talk about it's sort of free

43
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:46,520
open source technology um available to

44
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:48,479
anyone to to use and um so can data help

45
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:51,040
us make predictions to accelerate drug

46
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,640
Discovery I understand some don't have

47
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,320
the the same background as others so

48
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,920
just very briefly let's get back to

49
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,079
First principles um the only way we

50
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:01,079
really know if a drug is going to work

51
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:02,759
is if we take compound give it to a

52
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,600
diseased human and end up with a healthy

53
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:06,560
human however we cannot do these

54
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,959
experiments and we've seen today some

55
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:12,480
great examples of assay systems that try

56
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:14,840
to uh mimic a human environment or an

57
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,239
organ system or some kind of a a

58
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:20,000
biological assay system that mimics the

59
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:22,160
the capability here so we try to come up

60
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,959
with these approximations right we try

61
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,519
to come up with some kind of a system in

62
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:28,760
a in a dish whether it involves

63
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:31,080
micropolitics or co-culture systems or

64
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:33,560
um some kind of a system that represents

65
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,760
the disease as best we can get while

66
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,519
still maintaining some amount of high

67
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,319
throughput capability some amount of

68
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,159
ability to test lots of samples so if we

69
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,319
can miniaturize an assay or if we can

70
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:47,560
get the the reagents and the equipment

71
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:50,640
to be cheap enough then we can um in an

72
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:53,360
assay system like this then we can scale

73
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,200
it up to test lots and lots of samples

74
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,400
and so what I'll talk about today most

75
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,840
of the projects involve High throughput

76
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,920
screening where we are creating some

77
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,920
some kind of biological system testing

78
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,680
it in very high throughput each of the

79
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:09,440
samples in the teeny little Wells of

80
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:12,319
these 384 well plates involves um cells

81
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,640
growing with some kind of um addition

82
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:17,360
either drug or a genetic perturbation or

83
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,959
maybe a different patient uh cell line

84
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,799
and so in each well we have a different

85
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:24,920
sample and we do hrut microscopy robotic

86
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:27,440
microscopes that capture images because

87
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,879
the bottom of these plates is clear so

88
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,239
we have a microscope peeking up through

89
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,080
the bottom IM ing the cells and saying

90
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:34,519
how did these cells respond to this drug

91
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:37,760
how did these cells respond to this

92
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:39,239
genetic perturbation and so on so my

93
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,879
work has focused largely on image

94
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:42,200
analysis and we we write this open

95
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,000
source software that's used now

96
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,879
throughout the Pharma and and biotech

97
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,319
Industries for high throughput image

98
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:51,120
analysis and 20 years ago this was a

99
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:55,079
very unsolved problem uh today I'm happy

100
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,280
to say that just about any kind of um uh

101
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:59,799
cell-based system where you can see what

102
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,519
you're looking for it's usually pretty

103
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:03,319
solvable by image analysis software

104
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,280
today whether it's it's cell profiler

105
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:06,959
which has some deep learning

106
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:09,120
capabilities as well or any number of of

107
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,079
other kinds of um algorithms that are

108
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,680
out there it's a pretty well solved

109
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:17,479
problem that images um uh with

110
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:19,759
particular phenotypes can be uh analyzed

111
00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:22,040
in an automated uh quantitative kind of

112
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,440
way so that's been very powerful for all

113
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:27,400
kinds of assay systems um in the in the

114
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:29,000
world and once you've identified the

115
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,919
different components of a cell that

116
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,520
you're interested in then measuring them

117
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:35,560
becomes very trivial so the basis of my

118
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,600
work that I'll describe today um it's a

119
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,800
little bit abstract but it relies on the

120
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,400
fact that we are just measuring all

121
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,280
kinds of information out of every single

122
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,080
cell and every image that we're that

123
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,120
we're analyzing here so measure

124
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,919
everything is kind of the Mantra we can

125
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,360
measure thousands of features of cells

126
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,400
that include some of the obvious things

127
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,400
you would think of like you know how how

128
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:58,280
big is the nucleus how how squiggly EDG

129
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,840
how how squiggly are the edges of the

130
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,800
cytoplasm and so on but they can also be

131
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:05,240
more esoteric things like various

132
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,960
texture measures and um and intensity

133
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:10,000
and correlation

134
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:12,440
relationships um so uh my lab over the

135
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,800
past two decades has been focused on

136
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,840
helping biologists around the world um

137
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,240
and and in the broad Community the MIT

138
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:21,600
Harvard Community to screen all the

139
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,800
things um so each of these examples I

140
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,680
won't go into detail but the long story

141
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,960
short is each of these represents some

142
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,680
kind of a disease some kind of a

143
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:32,560
biological mechanism and can we automat

144
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,919
ially quantify the difference between

145
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:38,120
the cells or worms in in some of these

146
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:40,560
cases that um have a particular disease

147
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:42,560
versus U maybe treated with a drug to

148
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,000
reverse that type of a disease and so

149
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,000
these are all different examples showing

150
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,039
this sort of uh process and this work

151
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,080
has had clinical impact so these are

152
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,319
just two examples of some clinical

153
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:55,600
trials that have been successful based

154
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:57,960
on using image analysis to either

155
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,800
identify drugs in the first case or in

156
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,160
the second case I I wasn't involved in

157
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,919
this experiment directly but they used

158
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,919
our software in order to identify

159
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:08,080
whether a given patient very

160
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:10,840
personalized medicine will this one

161
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,880
patient respond to any of these dozens

162
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:15,520
of drugs that we might give them and is

163
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:18,599
there going to be a good

164
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:21,199
response so uh those projects that I

165
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:23,599
just described were were generally um a

166
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,520
biologist had an assay system in mind

167
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:27,960
they had a phenotype in mind they had an

168
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,160
idea of if I could only measure this

169
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:32,240
thing then I can potentially cure my

170
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,840
disease of Interest what we'll talk

171
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,199
about for the the whole rest of the talk

172
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,759
is this one level more abstract where we

173
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:40,800
use images instead as a data source and

174
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:42,240
we say okay you have cells growing in a

175
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,120
dish you could you could count how many

176
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,440
green cells are there how how big are

177
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,639
they um do they have squiggly edges or

178
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:51,080
not um but what if we don't know what

179
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:53,599
we're looking for what if we don't know

180
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:56,680
what um what is going to best represent

181
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:58,560
a disease and um and perhaps even if we

182
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,599
do know maybe there's more in the images

183
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,440
that we could Leverage do really

184
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:05,680
interesting things with so this is this

185
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,400
concept is called image-based profiling

186
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,720
is very similar to transcriptional

187
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:12,960
profiling or proteomics um and the idea

188
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,199
is you have lots of measurements lots of

189
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,039
samples let's look at the patterns of

190
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,080
those samples to tell us something

191
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,720
important about biology okay it's a

192
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,120
little abstract let's make it concrete

193
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,560
with some individual stories and this is

194
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,599
you know simplified version of the drug

195
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:30,080
Discovery Pipeline and let's see if we

196
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:32,199
can um figure out whether we can use

197
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,080
images to identify signatures of disease

198
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:36,919
when we don't know what those might look

199
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,479
like and then and then find drugs so the

200
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:40,280
first example comes from actually the

201
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,240
University of Utah I wasn't involved in

202
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,919
these original studies but the

203
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,039
researchers there studied cerebral

204
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:49,479
cavernous malformation and uh they

205
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:51,280
thought well this is a relatively easy

206
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:54,520
disorder you knock out this Gene you get

207
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,199
the disease very simple um genetics and

208
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,960
they thought well let's knock down this

209
00:07:56,199 --> 00:08:01,560
Gene CCM in cells and see if we see a

210
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,879
difference as you can very well see um

211
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,120
you don't need to know anything about

212
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,639
biology or image analysis okay there's a

213
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,919
difference here and what's lovely about

214
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:11,479
this kind of an assay is once you see a

215
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,159
difference and once the computer can

216
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:14,800
quantify it then it's pretty

217
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:18,520
straightforward to take cells that are

218
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:20,360
in the diseased State and ask Let's test

219
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:22,720
drugs one by one are there any that can

220
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,039
reverse this um unhealthy State and try

221
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,759
to make it healthy again that's really

222
00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:28,759
the concept that is at play here and

223
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:30,840
although in this case it's completely

224
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:33,159
obvious to our what the difference is

225
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,680
you can easily now imagine I hope well

226
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:36,719
wait a second if we can do this for this

227
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,240
one particular disorder with this one

228
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,760
gene why not do it for all the all the

229
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,360
disorders and all the genes maybe some

230
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,039
of them won't be so visibly obvious but

231
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,600
we can take the same strategy and that's

232
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:48,480
what led to the founding of recursion

233
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,839
Pharma um one of the major Tech bios um

234
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,320
that is now public and this is exactly

235
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:55,080
the strategy they began with and now

236
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,080
have hundreds and hundreds of disorders

237
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,440
that they've attacked in this way in

238
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,519
order to find drugs that that can um

239
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,959
reverse disorders so five clinical

240
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,240
trials uh more than that now um and some

241
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:08,240
of them starting to read out um in the

242
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,120
in the field so very exciting what I

243
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,240
think is a really neat aspect of this

244
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:15,519
academic study that launched this uh

245
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:18,360
trajectory is that the um drugs that

246
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,920
were chosen by the automated analysis of

247
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,640
the images even for a very obvious

248
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,680
phenotype like this they actually

249
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:25,800
outperformed those that were chosen by

250
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,000
experts looking at images and so I I

251
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,279
love that that they bothered to do that

252
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,399
side by-side comparison and the ones

253
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:34,320
chosen by the computer are the ones that

254
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,360
succeeded Downstream and eventually are

255
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,320
now in the in the clinical

256
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,959
trials okay that's one way to identify a

257
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:43,800
disease is to knock out a gene that is

258
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:46,360
known to be causative to for a disorder

259
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:49,079
but not all Gene diseases are that

260
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:51,079
simple many of them involve very complex

261
00:09:49,079 --> 00:09:53,480
genetics and metabolic disease is is

262
00:09:51,079 --> 00:09:55,560
absolutely one in this category Molina

263
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:58,600
clausnitzer is a researcher at the the

264
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:01,120
Bro Institute and she is focused on

265
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:03,079
metabolic disease and had the idea well

266
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,000
she can't just go knock out the one gene

267
00:10:03,079 --> 00:10:06,920
that causes diabetes there's many

268
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,079
potentials and there's all kinds of um

269
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:11,680
interactions at a genetic level but what

270
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:14,399
she could do is take cell lines from

271
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,640
patients that either have a high or low

272
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,399
risk for developing metabolic disease in

273
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,640
their lifetime so this higher low risk

274
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:23,720
is is designated by a polygenic risk

275
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,480
score so sequence your whole genome

276
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,279
figure out are you at high or low risk

277
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,480
of having metabolic disease take a

278
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:31,720
number of patient cell lines with and

279
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:33,320
without the the risk and look to see if

280
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,000
there's a difference again you know

281
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,279
quite obvious here visually and and

282
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,320
there's quantification behind it as well

283
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,680
but our ey of course we see very

284
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,480
dramatic differences in the lipid

285
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,040
droplets these green blobs but

286
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,720
interestingly there's also quite a

287
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:48,279
difference in the actin um cyto

288
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,720
cytoskeleton of the cells that can

289
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:52,880
distinguish these two um diseased versus

290
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,839
non- diseased populations they've gone

291
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,160
on to do all kinds of very interesting

292
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:59,680
work using this basic model system and

293
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:02,480
Molina is um is working to launch a

294
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,160
company focused on using this basic

295
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,040
approach to start doing drug screening

296
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,600
for metabolic disease which is otherwise

297
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:10,560
extremely um difficult here you have

298
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,240
very foundational um genetic

299
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:16,040
underpinnings um that that really tie

300
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,760
the the target Discovery ultimately to

301
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:20,480
um to human genetics which I think is a

302
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:23,279
really neat aspect of what she's

303
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,839
doing all right and now the Third Way um

304
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:27,279
to find a difference between diseased

305
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:29,720
and healthy cells and back in my own lab

306
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:32,560
is uh a collaboration with moty at the

307
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:34,519
University of Toronto so his uh this is

308
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,200
this project I'll describe is the is the

309
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:38,240
work of a single graduate student so

310
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,680
that gives you a sense of the scale she

311
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,040
tested 3,500 variants that are

312
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:44,920
associated with human disorders and for

313
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,240
each one look to see can I find a

314
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:50,200
phenotype that is a drug screenable PHA

315
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:52,839
type so 3500 it's incredible scale but

316
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:55,320
Theo approach is quite straightforward

317
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:57,839
she took for each variant Express the

318
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,240
normal version of that protein in cells

319
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,040
and it's Tagged so you can see where

320
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,240
where that protein is normally located

321
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,560
this is a gene called lz1 you don't need

322
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,440
to know anything about what that protein

323
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,920
does what its normal function is all

324
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,680
we're doing is looking where is it in

325
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:13,600
the cell and if you express that same

326
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,399
protein but with a mutation that causes

327
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,160
a human disorder you can see sometimes

328
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,440
there is a change in the localization

329
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,360
again don't need to know anything about

330
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,519
the disorder but what I want to draw a

331
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,920
parallel here consider that a a human

332
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:28,720
pediatrician is looking at a a child's

333
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:30,480
face I would look at this child and say

334
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,399
oh they pretty typical to me but a

335
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,880
pediatrician is very trained to

336
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,800
understand uh what are the features of a

337
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,079
face that can tell you ah this kid

338
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,399
actually has this disorder in the same

339
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:43,240
way um we don't need to be quite so

340
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:44,839
skilled to see there's a very obvious

341
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:47,120
difference in the localization of this

342
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:48,720
protein and just as the structure of the

343
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,279
face can indicate a disorder the

344
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,440
structure of the cells is also

345
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:55,320
indicating a disorder so now that we've

346
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,240
got this phenotype associated with a

347
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,519
disease we can now do drug screens to

348
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:01,360
reverse the phenotype and and we can

349
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,040
also do genetic perturbations to find

350
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:07,600
potential targets or Pathways so she

351
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:10,000
tested 3500 variants only 250 of them

352
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:13,079
had uh disease phenotypes it's around

353
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,320
16% of the pathogenic um variants you

354
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:17,519
might think 16% is a small percentage

355
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:20,040
but when you're considering um all the

356
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,600
diseases in the world and finding a a a

357
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,880
screenable phenotype this is something

358
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,680
that people often spend um years and

359
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:28,040
decades trying to identify for a single

360
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,160
disorder to so to find 250 in the course

361
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:33,000
of your PhD thesis is is pretty

362
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,000
remarkable um and we have an even uh an

363
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,800
even bigger scale project coming along

364
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,480
where we're testing 80,000 variants so

365
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,160
we'll have thousands of these disease

366
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,880
phenotypes and that creates a new

367
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,560
bottleneck we would love to do a drug

368
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,839
screen for each one of these each one of

369
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:48,240
these disease phenotypes represents a

370
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,199
population of patients who in in the

371
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,079
vast majority of cases these are rare

372
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:55,160
disorders that we tested here have no

373
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:56,519
medicines whatsoever so we would love to

374
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,399
do a drug screen for each of these

375
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:00,880
patient groups but in an academic

376
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,440
environment we can not afford to do 250

377
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,480
uh at once and that leads us to like

378
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,519
let's fix this bottleneck so to fix this

379
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:09,639
bottleneck we're using an approach that

380
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:13,079
was um originally developed by Paul blay

381
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:16,000
at MIT and developed by JT JT Neil at

382
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:19,000
the broad in his lab and the idea is

383
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,360
let's parallelize this by barcoding and

384
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,399
pooling the individual disease variants

385
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,720
so um forgive me it's it's a bit

386
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,560
abstract for those who are not so

387
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:30,199
familiar with these experiments but in

388
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:32,680
each well of this 24 well plate we put a

389
00:14:30,199 --> 00:14:35,360
ton of cells and then we put a mixture

390
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:38,759
of the healthy and the diseased version

391
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,519
of those proteins that are tagged and uh

392
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:42,399
we add a single compound to each

393
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:45,399
different well and we're asking in this

394
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:47,440
well does this compound cure any of

395
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:48,880
these disease phenotypes and the way we

396
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,560
do that is we first image the

397
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:54,440
localization of the protein and then we

398
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:56,839
clear those stains away bleach them away

399
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,759
and then we do this inc2 bar coding so

400
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,560
basically these little dots are flashing

401
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:02,680
a

402
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:05,120
ttgc telling us which cells got which

403
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:07,240
Gene and was it the normal healthy

404
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,040
version or was it the disease Associated

405
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:13,360
version of that Gene and so that allows

406
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:15,560
us to ask whether the localization is

407
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,160
affected by a given drug and then we can

408
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,920
follow it up from there so we're just

409
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,519
getting started on this project it's a a

410
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:23,440
very exciting one and in fact we've

411
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:25,079
launched um a a Consortium called Vista

412
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,880
uh Pharma companies are welcome to join

413
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:29,720
us in this and um the idea is if this

414
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:32,160
works I think this is a technology that

415
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,639
could readily be incorporated um the the

416
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,560
technology is sort of free and open

417
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:37,079
source any Pharma company could adopt it

418
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,959
internally if they would if they would

419
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:41,959
like and our Consortium aims at at in a

420
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:44,040
small scale let's just start with 100

421
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:48,160
diseases and 500 drugs and see if we can

422
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:51,880
make any matches so that's called

423
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:53,120
Vista and the next example of uh so so

424
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:55,399
we just went through three different

425
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,399
examples of how do we find a disease uh

426
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:59,240
phenotype and so that we can do a drug

427
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:01,680
screen there's other things we can do

428
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:03,199
how do we find drugs um if we already

429
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,440
have a phenotype that we're interested

430
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:08,600
in can we find chemical Regulators of

431
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:11,120
that Gene or disease um profile so how

432
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,560
does this work here we take a particular

433
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,600
Gene of interest that we would like to

434
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:18,079
Target and we perturb it in cells and we

435
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,680
we look at the cells with the computer

436
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:23,079
and identify do the have the cells

437
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:26,440
structures changed in any detectable way

438
00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:29,160
if they have we can then search for uh

439
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:30,720
in a database of compounds chemical

440
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,800
compounds that have previously been

441
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,480
tested and just ask have we ever seen

442
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,600
cells that looked like that have we ever

443
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,120
seen cells that had that same kind of

444
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:41,600
phena type that same kind of very

445
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:44,399
specific um change that we see and um if

446
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,240
we do see uh those we can take them and

447
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,639
then go do whatever follow up

448
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:51,000
experiments make sense so we did this in

449
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:53,800
a an an experiment with um first a lot

450
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:57,519
of of course known Gene compound matches

451
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:59,319
and aimed to try to figure out uh the

452
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,160
the kind of success rate overall and

453
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:04,039
we're we're shocked really to find such

454
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:06,240
a high percentage around 32% of the time

455
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:09,039
we could use this strategy to find a

456
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:11,559
compound that is known to to Target a

457
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:13,199
particular Gene um if you consider

458
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:14,439
compare that to the high through bit

459
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,679
screening that a Pharma company

460
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:18,760
typically does typically that involves

461
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:21,400
step one make a customized assay for the

462
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:23,559
gene step step zero figure out what the

463
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:26,360
function of the gene is step one make an

464
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:28,120
assay that that addresses that function

465
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:30,440
that that takes six months and and a

466
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:32,960
considerable amount of effort and then

467
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:36,120
lastly screen a million compounds or

468
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:38,440
100,00 compounds um to try to find drugs

469
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:40,559
that that impact that Gene so to be able

470
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,240
to do a computational query in an

471
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:45,240
afternoon using an existing public

472
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,720
database and get 30 30% of the time get

473
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:49,720
a good hit um is is pretty remarkable

474
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:52,160
and and would save the industry billions

475
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:55,720
if they if they could take this approach

476
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:57,720
we also um the 32% was using known

477
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,840
matches and sometimes it's easy to fool

478
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,200
yourself with um saying oh look we

479
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,360
discovered what was already known like

480
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,039
our our system did a good job so we also

481
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,679
tested it prospectively we said okay

482
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:09,440
here's seven genes that we would like to

483
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:12,320
find new compounds we don't have any

484
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,360
compounds um that that are uh useful so

485
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:17,159
we want to find new compounds and we

486
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:19,280
found a 42% success rate among those one

487
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:22,360
of them was Yap one where um my

488
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:24,200
collaborator Dr eisinger at Penn was

489
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:27,200
very interested to find Regulators of a

490
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:29,120
hippo pathway and identified some that

491
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,679
mimicked Yap one but do not direct L

492
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:34,200
Target it so they direct a they impact a

493
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:36,080
novel Target in the hippo pathway and

494
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,799
yet have this capability of killing

495
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:41,200
saroma cells which caused us to launch a

496
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:43,280
startup company that is now seeking

497
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,360
funding and and Partnerships um called

498
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:48,919
sizon um to pursue those compounds and

499
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:52,400
in general com compounds that hit

500
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:54,840
targets that impact solid tumors coming

501
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,840
from multiple directions um not just

502
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,880
killing cells which is shown here but

503
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:00,520
also impacting The extracellular Matrix

504
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,000
as well as prompting the immune system

505
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:05,880
to help Target the

506
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,600
tumor and then uh lastly can we identify

507
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:10,480
various types of a toxicity this is

508
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:13,159
another approach to use images um in a

509
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,600
in a a datadriven kind of way to

510
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:17,520
accelerate the drug Discovery process um

511
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,880
here we are collaborating not just with

512
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,240
pharmaceutical companies but also

513
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:24,120
agrochemical companies that aim to

514
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:26,039
reduce toxicity in their products and um

515
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:28,280
some of this work was carried out by a

516
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:31,960
postto rdet seal in collaboration with

517
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:33,919
Andreas Bender at Cambridge University

518
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:36,240
and um and you can see a number of

519
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:39,679
examples here the basic gist of of most

520
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:42,280
of these papers is let's um take images

521
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:44,720
of cells um that like I've described

522
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:46,760
already in the talk take images of cells

523
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,919
extract lots of features from those

524
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:51,760
images and say can we use that data to

525
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:54,480
predict whether a compound will be

526
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,760
cardiotoxic or liver toxic or have

527
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,240
certain pharmacokinetic U parameters or

528
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:01,520
MotoX and so on or bio activity in

529
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,960
various different kinds of assays um so

530
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,559
this this basic strategy seems to be

531
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,960
fairly effective and and these are some

532
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:10,159
examples of

533
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:12,039
them and that led us uh that and many

534
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:14,440
other studies in the field led us to

535
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:16,919
think um there's such a push to get rid

536
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,360
of animal models not just because uh we

537
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:20,120
don't love using animals and they're

538
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:23,080
expensive but also because they just

539
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:26,840
aren't super uh predictive of human

540
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:29,919
toxicity uh wonder if we could find uh a

541
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:31,679
way to use cell painting image-based um

542
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,919
approach that I've been describing as

543
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:36,240
well as transcriptomics and proteomics

544
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,360
in a variety of different cell models to

545
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,880
assess safety and we decided to start

546
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:42,520
with hepatotoxicity liver toxicity as

547
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,360
our test case and developed this

548
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:48,120
Consortium which so far has 16 of these

549
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,799
um mostly Pharma companies and uh

550
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:52,400
together our goal is to collect this

551
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:54,520
giant data set I'll I'll skip most of

552
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:57,039
the detail but just to say that the idea

553
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:59,080
was to uh collect compounds that are

554
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:01,960
known to have some kind of in Vivo

555
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:04,480
Associated data both rat and human and

556
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:06,039
then um develop a um test those

557
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:09,600
compounds in a few different model

558
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:11,559
systems ranging from um again human and

559
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,400
rat as well as some some of the fancier

560
00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:16,279
models like liver on a chip and

561
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:19,080
organoids and then uh carry out these

562
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:21,760
various readouts cell painting um images

563
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:24,120
as as as my expertise but also mRNA and

564
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,000
protein and then carry out this data

565
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:28,960
analysis and and share it with the

566
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,120
community to identify are there any outs

567
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:34,200
among these different types of um

568
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:37,240
profiling methodologies that can well

569
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:39,960
predict different types of liver

570
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:41,400
toxicity so that's uh that's it I just

571
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,400
wanted um to point out that you can

572
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:45,440
download a PDF of the slides at the the

573
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,840
URL that's shown here at the bottom and

574
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,080
and feel free to take a picture if you

575
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:51,039
like there's all kinds of other things a

576
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,120
person can do with images and we've

577
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:54,120
developed a lot of different

578
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:57,039
applications some examples are shown

579
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:58,640
here um there's lovely communities of of

580
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,320
people meeting at conferences that are

581
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,320
listed here and some review articles if

582
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:05,600
you want to learn more about this um

583
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:10,159
general research area and with that I'm

584
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:10,159
uh happy to answer any questions thank

585
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:18,760
you thank you that was fantastic um see

586
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:22,080
a question in the

587
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:22,080
back thanks

588
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:28,480
Karina could you use thisen

589
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:34,360
as you develop an understanding of how

590
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,360
difficult expression cell level

591
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,360
corresponds

592
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:05,320
yeah I love I love the idea so the basic

593
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:07,120
idea is um take cells from patients

594
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:09,720
whether that's biopsies because they

595
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,760
needed a biopsy for something or whether

596
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:14,480
that's just take some blood you know a

597
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:16,480
blood blood sample or some other readily

598
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,120
available type of biopsy that's less

599
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,200
invasive um in theory one could

600
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,760
certainly capture images corresponding

601
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,760
to every human at you know whatever

602
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,400
decade intervals or something like this

603
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,279
and then try to correlate what do we see

604
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:32,720
in the images and what do we see in the

605
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:35,640
patient response in the HR over time uh

606
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,799
really cool idea and um to my knowledge

607
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:39,120
I mean it's a logistical challenge is is

608
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:40,600
more than anything else I don't think

609
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,320
it's a scientific challenge because I

610
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,720
think such a thing would be a really

611
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,559
great data set and would really you

612
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:47,679
would really learn a lot from it can I

613
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:49,360
ask a follow-up question order of

614
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,559
magnitude what does it cost to run one

615
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,840
of these oh yeah I'm glad you mentioned

616
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:55,760
that because um it is vanishingly

617
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,520
cheaper to run Imaging essays as

618
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:00,039
compared to mRNA or protein profiling

619
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:02,000
and it's inherently a single cell

620
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:05,400
technology so you get single cell

621
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,520
thousands of cells for each sample um on

622
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,960
the order of like a dollar a well um so

623
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:12,279
it's it's roughly 30 to 100 times

624
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:14,440
cheaper than mr& or protein profiling

625
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:16,559
and yet I didn't show the data in this

626
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:19,200
talk but there's lovely data if you

627
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:20,960
compare I mean if I just asked you if I

628
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,679
snap a picture of cells stained with

629
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,440
five stains and then I capture an mRNA

630
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:27,760
profile of let's say like a thousand

631
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,159
mrnas which one has more information

632
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:32,120
content I I think every sane person

633
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,760
would probably say the MRNA profile

634
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:36,960
should be more specific because it

635
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:38,480
should capture a lot more biology um but

636
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,840
it turns out that they actually are

637
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,679
pretty neck and neck and the and that

638
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:46,399
Imaging is again 30 to 100 times cheaper

639
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:49,080
and single cell um versus bulk so it's

640
00:24:46,399 --> 00:24:51,600
it's really quite a to my mind I mean

641
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:53,360
I'm a fan of Imaging obviously um but to

642
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,520
my mind it was quite a shock when we've

643
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:58,520
seen how how powerful it can be by

644
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,520
comparison

645
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:10,679
great talk um we do

646
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:13,279
single I appreciate it very much we do

647
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:15,279
Dynamic time lapse based so our

648
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,880
limitations on scaling are a little bit

649
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:20,480
different and they driven by like speed

650
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:22,960
of stages on microscopes Etc um for a

651
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:27,159
lot of the applications here you know

652
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:29,360
the cost of um let's say a petri dish or

653
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:32,440
something similar and the cell is small

654
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:34,760
as you say what are the big limitations

655
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:37,480
for these applications for getting to

656
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:40,279
scale in in a productized manner that

657
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:42,399
can be used in any lab I mean the

658
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:44,559
already the cell painting strategy I

659
00:25:42,399 --> 00:25:46,840
which is basically just a subset of all

660
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:48,840
image-based experiments um it's already

661
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:50,880
just extremely widely adopted through

662
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:53,440
throughout the the far Pharma industry

663
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,200
and Academia as well so um the cell

664
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,679
painting essay itself is just add a

665
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,559
bunch of dies to cells fix them take

666
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:01,840
their picture um it's it's really about

667
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:04,120
the simplest possible image-based assay

668
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,559
um you can get um so yeah I would say

669
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:07,720
it's already widespread there's really

670
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:10,640
nothing limiting about it the only times

671
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:13,120
we felt limited is oh well we can do

672
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,440
100,000 samples in a raid format Pharma

673
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,399
does this all the time at the millions

674
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:19,440
of scale it's not it's not overly

675
00:26:16,399 --> 00:26:22,039
burdensome but the pooling the barcoding

676
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,440
pooling is has gotten us over that just

677
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:26,960
one step further to allow drug screening

678
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:30,240
at a a super big scale which which is

679
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,240
which has been a a main limitation

680
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:37,120
this will have to be our last question

681
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,640
um but I'm sure there opportunities

682
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:41,720
following I'm happy to stick around and

683
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:43,480
chat with people thank you br talk so

684
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:46,399
can you comment on the future

685
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:49,720
possibility so we can embed the

686
00:26:46,399 --> 00:26:52,440
biological knowledge into AI analysis

687
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:55,720
image based pipelines to build a world

688
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:58,320
model and use image based analysis for

689
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:00,960
example you have cell painting analysis

690
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:03,159
pipelines so if we can IDE biological

691
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:06,279
Network knowledge into sell painting

692
00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:08,080
image we can decompose that yeah yeah so

693
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:10,279
I I emphasize today because we've been

694
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,120
spending the last decade or so trying to

695
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:14,640
gather evidence and and trying to figure

696
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:18,320
out how powerful is this image based

697
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:21,679
data um I think it's a really great uh

698
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:23,520
um it's been very valuable to see how

699
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:26,240
can we integrate this data with other

700
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:28,200
data types so um we've got done a number

701
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,159
of experiments so far that show that

702
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:33,120
mRNA profiling protein profiling and

703
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:35,640
image-based profiling are um varying in

704
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:37,520
cost but they all produce complimentary

705
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:39,360
types of data some overlapping and some

706
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,440
complimentary and um so they are

707
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,640
absolutely not redundant with each other

708
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,279
um which to me is very exciting because

709
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:47,960
um there's not been a ton of work

710
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:49,080
integrating those three data types um as

711
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,760
well if you're working with drugs you

712
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:52,480
would want to incorporate chemical

713
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:54,200
structure information together with

714
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,080
those other data types if you have so I

715
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:58,600
think there's a lot of possibility for

716
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:00,279
for multimodal data integration across

717
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:02,360
all these different ways they're all

718
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:06,559
just different ways of measuring a cell

719
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:06,559
State thank you
