00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:16,320
hello computational music analysts I'm

2
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:19,640
going to talk a little bit today about

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:23,039
some topics that are not in themselves

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:25,439
essentially computational although

5
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,800
having a computer helps but are really

6
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,239
about the intersection of mathematical

7
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:34,960
and quantitative thinking with music

8
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:36,360
analysis music theory and musicology the

9
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,840
study of music

10
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,200
history and these are some of the things

11
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:44,840
that I've done in my own research that I

12
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:47,640
hope will make you think about some ways

13
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:50,559
that data analysis can go beyond the

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,719
score and tell us something more about

15
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,199
the history of

16
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:59,199
music what I'm not doing computational

17
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:03,239
music analysis my other job is as a

18
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:07,040
medieval music researcher and one of the

19
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:09,360
certainties I was always taught um about

20
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,159
Medieval music is that we've

21
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,880
lost most of it we've lost so much of it

22
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:18,320
and I mean it's it's just incredible how

23
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:22,000
much we have in fact most people always

24
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:24,360
said that um The Sur the music that

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,960
survives is just the tip of the iceberg

26
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:30,880
it was first said by a very important

27
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:34,720
medieval his U musicologist Nino Perot

28
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:39,960
uh but this term was picked up from on

29
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:42,600
by dozens of other people and so um when

30
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,719
we think about what's lost it could be

31
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,320
number of manuscripts that's lost or it

32
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:48,799
could be things that um were lost

33
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:51,040
because they were never written down and

34
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,240
we've forgotten them but if we want to

35
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,479
think about even the things that were

36
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,880
once written down on songs that were

37
00:01:55,479 --> 00:02:00,159
once written down the pieces that were

38
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:03,680
once written down uh how many of them do

39
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:06,719
no longer have any copy of at all um

40
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,759
what is the tip of the iceberg uh is it

41
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,480
90% that's what a lot of people say you

42
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:16,920
know the visible part of the iceberg is

43
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:19,519
is it 99% lost uh 99.9% lost or is one

44
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,840
person said basically everything so I'll

45
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:21,840
call that

46
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:29,599
99.9999% my friend and former teacher

47
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:32,160
Sean Gallagher once asked me hey would

48
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:36,080
there be any way you know you're a math

49
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,400
guy to prove this to show that it's true

50
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,920
and you know I immediately said no you

51
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,239
know there's no way we could do this

52
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,120
then I thought a little bit more and

53
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:47,440
realized there are people who look at um

54
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,480
you know how things get lost and stuff I

55
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:53,640
uh later on I found this great article

56
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:56,640
on um what happens in peer-to-peer song

57
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,440
sharing uh when you just start

58
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,800
disconnecting lots of computers from the

59
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:04,159
network as happened during the Crackdown

60
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,200
on napers and things like that and um

61
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,319
and they showed that as you go from if

62
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,360
you have a 100,000 computers on a

63
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:13,760
network you might have five million

64
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:16,319
songs uh but if the network gets down to

65
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,319
you know maybe 10,000 or 15,000

66
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,519
computers you only lose about half the

67
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,040
song so that was kind of interesting to

68
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:24,480
me that was a little bit

69
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:27,959
counterintuitive that you could really

70
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,560
lose a lot of nodes on a network and not

71
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:32,599
lose a lot of the content there and I

72
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:35,560
kind of thought well you know computers

73
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:37,879
might be something like medieval

74
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,920
manuscripts that we lose a bunch but

75
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:43,560
maybe we still have the songs so I wrote

76
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:45,000
two articles about this topic first um

77
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,080
is what I'm really going to be talking

78
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,319
about now uh it's an article called

79
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,760
tipping the iceberg in a journal called

80
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:54,239
mus discina and another it's a little

81
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,040
bit harder to find uh it's called monks

82
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,640
manuscripts and other peer-to-peer song

83
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:01,799
sharing networks of the Middle Ages it's

84
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:04,840
in a great uh book that the University

85
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:07,280
of Pennsylvania uh helped publish called

86
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:10,680
Kus scriptus Technologies of medieval

87
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:14,120
song like the idea of Technology

88
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:16,479
existing throughout history anyhow so

89
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:19,040
one of the ways that we could do this is

90
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:21,359
just you know look at all the records of

91
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,840
missing pieces and see how many of them

92
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:27,280
we have and that's kind of sarcastic but

93
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:30,840
there are things uh that exist in the

94
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:34,680
world like this um there's a

95
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:37,840
manuscript it's actually only uh I think

96
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:41,840
two or four pages survive now um that

97
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:44,400
was owned by The Duchess of troil so

98
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:48,520
it's often called the tro uh manuscript

99
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:52,400
it's in um it's in the National Library

100
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:55,919
of Paris now and if you look at this

101
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:58,000
manuscript uh what what we only have a

102
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:01,520
couple pages of it but we have the

103
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,520
entire index the table of contents that

104
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,680
tells you uh what the names of the

105
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,600
pieces are and what page they would have

106
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,039
been on in the original manuscript so we

107
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:13,000
can look at well we don't have this

108
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:17,479
manuscript but how many of these pieces

109
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,440
do we have we have we lost so we can see

110
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:22,759
that uh I've marked here these are all

111
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:27,639
the pieces that we're pretty sure we

112
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:29,400
don't have copies of and um here's all

113
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:30,560
the pieces that we're pretty sure we do

114
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,400
have

115
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:36,960
copies there's some pieces that we can't

116
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:40,000
really be sure they're um parts

117
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,759
of Medieval music Traditions like the

118
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,280
mass that have these somewhat generic

119
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:47,880
names like k or something kind of like

120
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:51,199
if we saw oh we lost Symphony well you

121
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:54,600
know who who Symphony things like that

122
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:57,280
um so when we overlay these two together

123
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,919
we see that actually those that survive

124
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,680
really outrank those that don't so so in

125
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:07,000
this particular index we have 114

126
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:11,759
compositions that um of of which 109 are

127
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:14,880
identifiable and 68% of them seem to

128
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:19,120
survive or another thing that I looked

129
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:22,960
at was this collection of um sonnets by

130
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:25,720
a kind of cool but second tier Italian

131
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:28,440
poet named pranii and one of the things

132
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:31,120
that um that makes a lot of people think

133
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:34,199
he's second tier is is he throws in a

134
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,160
lot of his songs just uh lists of things

135
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:38,680
lists of all the food they eat at lists

136
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,240
of all the dances they they danced that

137
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:44,280
day and in this particular case a list

138
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:46,759
of all the songs that were sung Begins

139
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:49,280
the top Bo kind of kind of nice for

140
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:52,280
where we're about to be in the year uh

141
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:58,000
with the violin Viola something they

142
00:06:52,280 --> 00:07:01,520
made all the May songs like Ros Ki my

143
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,520
the rose that never changes it

144
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,240
colors etc etc we can basically figure

145
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:10,680
out which ones of these um things are

146
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,440
titles of songs and then we can see how

147
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:19,479
many of them we know so

148
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:19,479
Ros is a song that survives so is so

149
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:25,080
is but some of them like uh toward the

150
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:32,000
bottom we don't know that song so so we

151
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:34,360
can look over and again we can see how

152
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,840
many of them survive how many of them

153
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:41,160
don't survive and then these other four

154
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:43,360
um where we can argue about um that

155
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,879
there's songs with similar titles are

156
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,199
they just being misquoted or um are they

157
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:50,960
same or is this really a song things

158
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:52,520
like that so uh it's these are the two

159
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,840
proportions that it could be so

160
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:58,199
depending on what we look at there's

161
00:07:54,840 --> 00:08:00,800
somewhere between 16 and 17 compositions

162
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:05,560
and three to to seven of them are lost

163
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:08,800
10 to 12 survive um so that's about 59

164
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:11,919
to 75% of the songs here

165
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,280
survive if we look at all of the sonnets

166
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:18,120
in this collection by protani there's 59

167
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:20,639
identifiable compositions and 40 of them

168
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:24,080
surviv so that's

169
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:28,120
71% so here's two pieces of evidence um

170
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:30,599
both from textual sources to try to see

171
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:34,560
um how how much survives or how much

172
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:37,399
doesn't but can can we do

173
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:39,760
better one of the things I thought of

174
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:41,640
was that there are people who spend a

175
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,680
lot of time trying to count things that

176
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:46,440
are difficult to count because you can't

177
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:49,200
sort of capture them all uh they are the

178
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:52,440
animal population

179
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:55,720
biologists they are people who go out

180
00:08:52,440 --> 00:09:01,000
and um they can't capture every deer in

181
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:03,040
a forest so what do they do they um they

182
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,160
might go out here's one way that they do

183
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:09,880
it they may go out at a certain point

184
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:12,040
and go and um capture you know all the

185
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:14,120
deer they can capture in a couple days

186
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:17,480
um you know maybe it's let's say it's 10

187
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:19,600
10 deer and they go and they tag the

188
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,839
deer in some way or something somehow

189
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,079
somehow they you know so they can

190
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:25,480
recognize the same deer again then maybe

191
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:28,160
you know they let a month go by or

192
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:30,040
something not too long but more enough

193
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,560
time that animals can move around and

194
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,399
stuff and then they go out and they

195
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:37,040
capture deer for a day again and let's

196
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:39,519
say you know they capture 10 deer again

197
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,640
uh the point is the second time they do

198
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,320
a capture this called capture recapture

199
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:47,560
methods the second time they do it they

200
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:50,000
look to see how many of the deer that we

201
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:52,120
captured the second time did we also

202
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,959
capture the first time if you think

203
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:56,320
about it if you go into a forest and you

204
00:09:53,959 --> 00:10:00,160
know you you walked around pretty

205
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:03,680
randomly or something and you all of the

206
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:05,519
deer or nine out of the 10 deer that you

207
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:10,279
captur the first time you see the same

208
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:14,279
ones the second time you might think wow

209
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:14,279
we've seen almost all the deer in the

210
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:21,000
forest on the other hand let's say you

211
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:23,399
captured 10 deer and none of them that

212
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,959
you captured the second time had the tax

213
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:29,760
you'd be like wow okay I know I've seen

214
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:32,720
20 deer here but law of averages suggest

215
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:35,720
there's a lot more than 20 deer and in

216
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:39,040
fact there's um there's formulas that

217
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:40,839
can you can uh that people do with this

218
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,959
type of thing

219
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:47,000
um so I tried to figure out you know

220
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:51,560
what would be the equivalent in in music

221
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:54,519
and so um I started to think you know uh

222
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:58,399
let's go and look at some equations we

223
00:10:54,519 --> 00:11:00,560
might make uh if we had the number of

224
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,480
pieces if we knew the number of pieces

225
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:05,000
that originally existed and we

226
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,839
multiplied by the probability that any

227
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
given piece would be

228
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:11,200
missing we would know the total number

229
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,120
of missing

230
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:17,320
pieces that's

231
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:19,480
fantastic that is a very hard uh

232
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:22,360
equation it's very hard to argue against

233
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,920
but it's completely useless right we

234
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,959
don't know the number of pieces

235
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,519
originally we don't know the probability

236
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:30,320
that any given piece would be missing

237
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:32,880
and therefore we don't know how many

238
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:36,399
missing pieces are so one equation three

239
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:38,200
unknowns we don't know any of

240
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:41,000
them

241
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:44,600
but we can think through some of the

242
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,560
things here um I'm going to go through a

243
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:50,680
quicker version of this but I have

244
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:52,040
elsewhere well I have in my article um a

245
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:55,399
little bit deeper version that talks

246
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:58,639
about all the UN um the assumptions that

247
00:11:55,399 --> 00:12:00,200
could be in play but let's start with um

248
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:03,279
how can we figure F out the probability

249
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:07,040
that we're missing a given piece well

250
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:10,000
here's one model and it's it's kind of a

251
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:12,920
um it's kind of a bad assumption maybe

252
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,399
to start with but here's one model uh

253
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:19,440
what if there's just medieval scribes

254
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,639
had baskets of pieces you just all the

255
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,079
pieces they knew them all their head

256
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,199
there something like that and they kind

257
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:27,480
of randomly chose ones that they were

258
00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:29,320
going to write down well then the

259
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:32,000
probability that a given piece would be

260
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:35,440
in a particular manuscript is

261
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,480
approximately um the proportion of all

262
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,440
of the pieces in the manuscript there's

263
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,760
if R sub I is the number of pieces in

264
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,519
the manuscript and N is the total of

265
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,360
pieces originally copied then we would

266
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,519
know the probability that a piece would

267
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,800
be in a given manuscript or song book

268
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:53,320
it's not exactly that number because you

269
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:56,519
don't do duplication but but it's pretty

270
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:58,600
close um uh it's actually the people

271
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:59,920
have argued against me that you know

272
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,639
like well you have to correct for that

273
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:05,279
error but you only have to correct for

274
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:07,519
the probability of duplication if um if

275
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:11,000
the number piece in that manuscript is

276
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:12,720
very is close uh some major uh

277
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,519
percentage of the total number pieces

278
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,680
originally copied so um that's already

279
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,079
kind of getting anyhow so this is the

280
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,079
probability that given piece would be in

281
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:23,639
the given manuscript from here we can

282
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:25,959
work out what's the probability the

283
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:29,120
piece is not in a given manuscript and

284
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:31,560
we just subtract that from one great so

285
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,320
so that's that's pretty good now let's

286
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,920
say you have two independent manuscripts

287
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,519
they're being copied in different places

288
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,880
you know different people whatever

289
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,880
something like that what would be the

290
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:44,600
probability that the piece would not be

291
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:46,240
in any of these two manuscripts and so

292
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,519
you just multiply the probability that

293
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,320
it wouldn't be in one

294
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,160
manuscript and not in the other and so R

295
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,240
sub one and R sub2 they're going to

296
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,680
depend on how many pieces are in the

297
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,440
manuscript but this would be the

298
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:01,759
probability that some piece existing or

299
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,839
not would be in would not be in any of

300
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:05,680
two

301
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:07,360
manuscripts so there's about 85

302
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,079
surviving medieval manuscripts in the

303
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,720
period I'm most interested in um so of

304
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:15,959
Italy from 1370 to

305
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,880
1420 just after the black death and um

306
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:20,320
during the time of the great papal

307
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,759
Schism so there's about 85 of these

308
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,800
manuscripts so what's the probability

309
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:26,279
that any given piece would not be in any

310
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:28,759
of the 85 surviving

311
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:31,040
manuscripts and it looks something like

312
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:31,040
this

313
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:37,199
um

314
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:40,480
so this is something you know that's

315
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:43,920
it's a it's a big long um number but you

316
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:47,040
can see that right at the very end this

317
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:49,399
whatever this works out to is the equal

318
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,480
to the probability that a piece would be

319
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:55,040
missing because if a piece is not in any

320
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:58,240
of the surviving manuscripts then it's

321
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:00,160
missing to us today so this is kind of

322
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,519
great we know all these are numbers

323
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:05,360
because they're simply the number of

324
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:07,800
pieces in a manuscript today uh not in

325
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,120
originally say so we can take this and

326
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,279
we can go back to our original equation

327
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:16,480
with three

328
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:19,800
unknowns and um substitute it into for

329
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:22,759
that P of M place so we can see that now

330
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:26,279
we have one equation and two unknowns um

331
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:27,959
it's still a pretty honky equation but

332
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:29,839
uh well that's good one equation two

333
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:31,560
unknowns still two many unknowns right

334
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,759
we need two equations at least if we're

335
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:37,399
going to do two unknowns but we can look

336
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:41,079
at this last answer this m what are the

337
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:43,120
total number of missing pieces well the

338
00:15:41,079 --> 00:15:45,519
total number of missing pieces is just

339
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:48,800
the number of pieces that originally

340
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:50,639
existed which we don't know minus the

341
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,000
number of pieces that survive which we

342
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,959
do know if we have a pretty good catalog

343
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,920
of everything that survives today then

344
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:59,920
we can figure that out so now we go back

345
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,959
and we see that we have actually just

346
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:06,120
one equation and one unknown uh it's a

347
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:07,680
pretty big equation um in fact a lot of

348
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:10,839
the literature that I was reading from

349
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:13,880
the 60s and 70s 80s was about okay you

350
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:17,040
can't possibly solve an equation you of

351
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:19,040
this dimensionality uh exactly so here's

352
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,000
all the sophisticated math that we can

353
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:24,040
do to

354
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,560
um to try to um you to try to

355
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:29,759
approximate it but in fact nowadays it's

356
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:32,720
it's pretty simple what we can do is we

357
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:34,880
can try different numbers for n the

358
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,079
number of original pieces starting from

359
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,959
you know one more than the numbers

360
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:42,800
fiving pieces or something try all these

361
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:45,759
numbers into here until the left side

362
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:48,800
and the right side approximately Balan

363
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:51,160
and we can do that with computers so uh

364
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:54,880
when I did this I mean it's uh this is

365
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:57,800
article I think like 13 14 years old uh

366
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:01,519
it's before um before python was big so

367
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:03,240
I used Pearl and I just did find U find

368
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,319
and find the hypothetical total number

369
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:09,520
of manuscripts given all the things that

370
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:13,360
we know and so on so on and um we're

371
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:15,959
able for each of um four

372
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:18,480
different uh genas these are different

373
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:21,880
types of music we're able to figure out

374
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:24,720
what percentage of the pieces are

375
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:26,760
probably missing these are you know I'm

376
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:30,160
uh there's error bars on this is rough

377
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:32,840
guesses um but we can see that the

378
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,120
percentage of missing pieces maybe in

379
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:37,200
only

380
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:39,880
one in only one of the genres is it

381
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,720
predicted to be more than the number of

382
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:44,440
total number pieces than you know than

383
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,960
the number of surviving pieces in fact

384
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:49,480
for some of these genres we predict that

385
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,600
hey we have almost everything

386
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:55,919
there

387
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:57,880
um so one of the things we could look at

388
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,720
instead of saying uh how many pieces

389
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:05,080
were once copied but no longer exist we

390
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:09,240
can take that total number and say wow

391
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:09,240
maybe we have all but 25% of

392
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:15,400
them now there were a lot of assumptions

393
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:17,480
that went into that um that scribes are

394
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,039
correcting things randomly and so on and

395
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,559
so forth and that you know that there's

396
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:23,000
not pieces that are more popular than

397
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:25,400
each other and so on and so in the

398
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,240
article that I wrote there's um ways

399
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,120
that you can compensate for this and

400
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,679
ways that we can test for for instance

401
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:34,120
we can hold out um 10% of the

402
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:37,799
manuscripts at random and then say not

403
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:40,799
just how many pieces would um would we

404
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:43,799
expect to um would you know would we

405
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:46,159
expect we lost but if we gained 10 more

406
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:48,840
manuscripts how many more pieces would

407
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:52,080
we expect to have that we didn't know

408
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:54,919
already and then we can look at okay now

409
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,720
put those 10 men get back and voila uh I

410
00:18:54,919 --> 00:18:58,120
think I can't remember off the top of my

411
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,640
head right now I you know one of those

412
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:02,360
things I published so I don't have to

413
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:04,720
remember but uh I think that the

414
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:07,799
percentage of pieces that were lost I

415
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:10,559
think I think it was you know within 10%

416
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:13,360
of something or so so these models were

417
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:15,280
pretty pretty good so we can use this

418
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:18,320
mathematical thinking and just a little

419
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:20,280
bit of programming to answer questions

420
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,240
that were thought to be completely

421
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:26,240
unanswerable in

422
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,240
history thanks
