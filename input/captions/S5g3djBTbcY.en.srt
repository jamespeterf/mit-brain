1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:06,759
good morning everyone and welcome to the

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:09,800
first day of our MPG

3
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:11,719
2425 season um my name is Nicole

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:15,440
rockweiler I'm a postto in Steve MCC

5
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:18,160
Carrol's lab um myself and Michelle we

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,800
co-organize the mpg primer and we're so

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,760
glad that you guys are tuning in today

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:26,720
remotely or in person um just wanted to

9
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:30,320
give a few slides for housekeeping um

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:32,119
information so as you have already can

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,160
tell we're in a different location this

12
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:36,200
year and this is just to make it easier

13
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,320
so we can transition to the seminar

14
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:42,200
meeting uh so we'll be here in this room

15
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,879
every week unless there's a a room

16
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,840
reservation issue but you can always

17
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:48,879
check our calendar um and then also just

18
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,360
to be cognizant that there's another

19
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:53,480
seminar right after this we're going to

20
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:55,160
end at 9:20 feel free to stay here if

21
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,760
you want but if you want to move over to

22
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,640
get your next breakfast and get a good

23
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:02,879
seat for the prime for the seminar um

24
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:05,720
just uh feel free to do

25
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:08,320
that um and also just want to tell you

26
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:10,080
today and forever we really encourage

27
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,280
you guys to ask your questions this

28
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,360
primer is for you if something is

29
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,560
unclear you want to know more please ask

30
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:21,600
your questions either at the mics or put

31
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:25,200
it in in the Q&A on Zoom um and then

32
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,799
lastly we put these meetings online

33
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,960
afterwards on YouTube so they're open

34
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:31,560
meetings um and then again this year

35
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:34,479
we're going to start something new we're

36
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:37,040
going to try to put these uh PDFs of the

37
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,360
slides on the broad website that's

38
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,560
publicly available so if you want to

39
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:43,159
share with colleagues um it's another

40
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,719
resource for

41
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:49,360
you um one more bookkeeping thing about

42
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:51,840
today uh today we have our primer our

43
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,640
seminar at 9:30 and then the next event

44
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,680
today is a happy hour with food and

45
00:01:53,640 --> 00:02:00,000
drinks uh it will be at 4: to 5:30 in

46
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:02,280
the Terrace just across the the side um

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,920
um and if I didn't mention both food and

48
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,920
alcoholic and non-alcoholic

49
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:11,080
Beverages and then uh another update

50
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:14,319
we're trying a lot of new things this

51
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:18,360
year we are officially on Twitter as

52
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:21,319
broad MPG so if you want to learn about

53
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,640
our primers when the videos go up read

54
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:26,200
about papers from our community as well

55
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,519
as job postings um please consider

00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:31,879
following us and also tag us with your

57
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:34,319
research so that we can follow you um

58
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:36,879
and share your

59
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,319
work um and you might notice one less

60
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:41,480
person in the room right now uh Lauren

61
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:43,680
who was our program manager she actually

62
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:46,440
stepped down from the position so we are

63
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,720
actively looking for a new person uh to

64
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:53,239
be the operation SP specialist for MPG

65
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:56,920
and TGG uh the job is officially posted

66
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:59,640
um there's this IO link here um if you

67
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:03,560
have any um questions about the position

68
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:07,120
or know someone please let um myself

69
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:09,080

00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,720
in

74
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,319
general I'm G to go o I'm going to skip

75
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,080
the description I'm going to post it on

76
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:27,000
slack later today but please if you know

77
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:30,120
anyone we would love to um have them on

78
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,280
board uh so just to give you AE of

79
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,640
what's coming up in the beginning of

80
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,760
this primary season we're going to

81
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,680
really focus on basics of population

82
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,799
genetics so next week we're going to

83
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,439
have an intro to pop gen and the

84
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:44,439
following week we're going to do um more

85
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:47,640
pop gen topics such as population

86
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:51,000
structure stratification and AD

87
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:53,400
mixture and uh lastly I'm pretty sure

88
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,439
this is the last slide um today we have

89
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,680
a lovely um introduction to our for data

90
00:03:56,439 --> 00:04:01,840
analysis by nil and Michelle's going to

91
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:04,599
introduce her great thanks good morning

92
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,879
um it is my pleasure to introduce nil

93
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:09,519
aigon nil received her PhD in

94
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:13,519
bioinformatics in computational biology

95
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:15,400
at UNC Chapel Hill in 2023 during this

96
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,000
training under the mentorship of Dr

97
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,000
Jason Stein she investigated genetically

98
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,759
altered cell type specific Gene

99
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,360
regulation during human neural

100
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:28,360
differentiation she began her postdoc

101
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:31,240
research in the bokum lab in May

102
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:33,280
2023 and in her postdoc she's developing

103
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,400
algorithms to explore the genetic and

104
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,320
other molecular co-occurrences driving

105
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,840
cancer progression and Drug resistance

106
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,720
um but today she's going to be talking

107
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,840
to us about data science with our um an

108
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,520
introduction so with that I hand it over

109
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:49,080
to

110
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,759
Neil thank you so much yeah today I

111
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,759
would like to share with you some

112
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:57,600
introduction uh for how to use R and

113
00:04:53,759 --> 00:05:00,199
data science um in general so I'm really

114
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:04,120
happy to be here today yeah today we

115
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:06,600
will go over uh certain some basics in

116
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:09,199
art and how to use them in specific

117
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:12,479
genomic analysis and this is our outline

118
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:15,199
uh we will learned basic data structures

119
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:18,479
data how to manipulate data INR how to

120
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:20,720
uh define specific functions um how to

121
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:23,520
use control structures how to perform

122
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:28,240
regation analysis and how to visualize

123
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:30,800
your data um and some uh still there

124
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,600
specific specialized our packages you

125
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,479
can also use for genomic analysis in

126
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:38,639
addition to what we go over today

127
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,639
so to be able to give you an

128
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,479
introduction all of these topics I would

129
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,039
like to start with an interesting

130
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,880
genomic question uh so that we can

131
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:50,360
introduce certain data set and how we

132
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:54,680
can answer specific questions by using R

133
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:59,880
so this question includes um some qtl

134
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:01,560
work in from my pphd study um so in that

135
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:04,199
as you all familiar with genome white

136
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:07,599
Association studies discover many in

137
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:10,400
genetic variant that are associated with

138
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:13,240
variety of complex human traits one

139
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,280
interesting fact is that those variants

140
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:19,960
are mainly found in noncoding part of

141
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:23,680
the genome um and that makes uh hard to

142
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:26,520
explain uh their function so one

143
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:29,039
potential mechanism is that a genetic

144
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:33,000
variant can be located from water of a

145
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:36,520
gene that may interfere binding of uh

146
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,360
transcription regulators and that will

147
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:41,240
uh change the C accessibility in that

148
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:43,840
area and accordingly based on the um

149
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:46,919
having different variant excuse me

150
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:49,919
different Al of this variant we can see

151
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:52,240
changes in expression as an outcome so

152
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:56,440
by performing expression quantity to tra

153
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:59,319
Locus ensured uh equal analysis we can

154
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:03,080
try to understand if the individuals

155
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:06,800
that that have AA genotype has a higher

156
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:09,840
gene expression than individuals with CC

157
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,960
genotype and in this case we perform a

158
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,160
statistical test and understand if this

159
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:17,520
relationship is significant so let's say

160
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:21,879
we are interest in performing expression

161
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:26,120
quanti local analysis and these are the

162
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:29,919
oops let me go how can I go

163
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:34,520
further oh okay here we go

164
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:37,160
so let's say we drive uh some data sets

165
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:40,759
from this to perform this analysis such

166
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:42,720
that we perform um RNA sequencing by

167
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:45,479
collecting hundreds of individuals and

168
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,800
drive cell lines from them because we're

169
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:51,199
interest in cell have specificity and we

170
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:53,080
profile we perform jic Prof transcrip

171
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,960
profiling across the cell Lines by

172
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:58,960
performing R sequencing analysis and

173
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:01,240
here is the data set we can see for Gen

174
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,240
expression in this case each Dr

175
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:06,639
indicates different genes and their

176
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,479
corresponding expression value across

177
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:11,800
those cell lines coming from different

178
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:14,639
individuals and you can see that those

179
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,840
values corresponds to normalized gen

180
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,919
expression

181
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:22,720
value and we can also look genotypes of

182
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:24,960
the cell lines dve from the individuals

183
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,800
in this case you can see the variety of

184
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:30,440
genetic variants listed on the roow and

185
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:33,360
their corresponding genotyp information

186
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:36,320
across cell lines for instance one

187
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:40,320
indicates that in my case I call effect

188
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:43,800
Al as a minor Al um and if an individual

189
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:46,320
has only one minor Al We call we can

190
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:48,680
call as a one if it doesn't have any we

191
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:52,680
can call this a zero if it has two of

192
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:54,399
the minor Al we can call two so just a

193
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:58,560
numeric interpretation of how a

194
00:08:54,399 --> 00:09:00,760
genotyping data set u can be done for a

195
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,279
qtl in any typ type of um variant

196
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:06,040
Association analysis in addition to that

197
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:08,399
we may have a metadata which includes

198
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:11,640
information from the cell lines which

199
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:14,560
can be further useful for us for example

200
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:17,360
let's say we sorted cells based on a

201
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,240
certain marker by using tax machine and

202
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,399
unfortunately there are two different

203
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:23,279
tax machines very available that's why

204
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:26,680
it ca some batch effect that's what we

205
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:28,720
can call them tax Miss A and B and uh

206
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:31,560
those individuals they provide as sell

207
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:34,640
lines for us can come from may have

208
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:41,200
different genders male female and you

209
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:41,200
can also store their ages um as well

210
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:51,320
so oops Yeah to be able to um import

211
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,279
this data set and work on them in R we

212
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,440
first need to understand uh data

213
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,560
structure potential data structures in R

214
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:01,880
let's look at them a little quick

215
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:04,160
vectors are the base six um El Basics

216
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:07,120
units have to represent data structure

217
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:11,040
in R it basically includes a list of

218
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:14,279
elements and by using C parenthesis you

219
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:18,480
can define a new Vector in this case I

220
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:23,040
Define a vector name a u which includes

221
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:25,600
eight numeric individ components and

222
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:29,440
this is how you assign a variable in R

223
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:31,959
by using equal Dash operators and and

224
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:35,160
this is how the it looks like and you

225
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:38,000
can also check what type of data is by

226
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:40,639
using class function in R again as you

227
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,240
see that it go on numeric values in

228
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:46,560
addition numeric values we can store a

229
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:48,839
character U or other words stct string

230
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,880
components in a vector in this case

231
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:54,600
these are different Gene names as you

232
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:58,720
can see and there's a character

233
00:10:54,600 --> 00:11:00,639
vector and majes is a 2d form of the

234
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,600
vectors in this Cas you can store a

235
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:06,120
multiple information from multiple

236
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:08,680
vectors um as an example here you have

237
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:11,399
two different vectors A and B that

238
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:14,200
includes numeric values of with three

239
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:15,920
different components by using C cbind

240
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:19,120
function in other words column bind

241
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:23,240
function you can bind this vector by

242
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:25,440
column that result in this 2D U

243
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:28,560
information and we can check the

244
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,360
dimensions of this matrix by using dim

245
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,519
function again

246
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:35,839
uh and alternatively you can define a

247
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:38,680
fun matrix by using Matrix function in

248
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:41,800
this case you provide a vector as a

249
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:44,279
first first parameter of this function

250
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:47,600
and you can actually uh there a type

251
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:51,160
here is three um and you can say that

252
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:53,480
how many rowes you expect in your Matrix

253
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:56,839
and if they were order if there are

254
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,839
order by row or

255
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:04,320
column um so to be able to access

256
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:07,440
elements or slice or subset a matrices

257
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:12,639
there are certain ways so for this we

258
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:14,880
can use square brackets B for our um um

259
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:17,560
object in this case our Matrix object

260
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:20,040
called as M so let's say we want to

261
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:22,959
interested in to access Elements which

262
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:26,199
located second row and First Column of

263
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:29,680
this Matrix for this we can ident we can

264
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:32,120
Define first element before comma

265
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:35,079
uh as the row information and the second

266
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:37,760
one as the column information

267
00:12:35,079 --> 00:12:40,839
alternatively um we

268
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:43,240
can get for example slic The Matrix so

269
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:45,480
that we can get only the First Column

270
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:49,600
and then all the information from the

271
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:52,079
rest of rowes we can uh basically uh

272
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:55,680
leave empty the first item and second

273
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:59,480
place can be the number of the um column

274
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,480
you're interested in

275
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:06,720
data frames uh are a little bit more

276
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,320
complicated version of the matrices um

277
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:12,279
difference between mat and the data

278
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:16,199
frame is that you can store a variety of

279
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:18,360
um uh different the different uh not the

280
00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:19,639
same data set but different structures

281
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,360
uh different classes excuse me for

282
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:23,800
example you can store both numeric and

283
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,320
character information in the same data

284
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:28,560
frame such as for example let's back to

285
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,199
the our previous example we have cell

286
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:35,040
lines uh indicated by your identifiers

287
00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:37,160
here and uh the text machine which is

288
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:40,680
use to sort them and gender information

289
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:42,920
and age information by using the data.

290
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:46,040
frame function you can define a data

291
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:50,839
frame as you can see you can place each

292
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:53,839
of those U vectors and they result in a

293
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:56,800
mix of information coming from numeric

294
00:13:53,839 --> 00:14:00,240
values and character

295
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:02,600
values again you can SL device or softs

296
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:06,160
set data frames by using a similar

297
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:08,839
strategy we use for matrices uh by using

298
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:12,759
a square brackets and writing the name

299
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:14,600
of the um um columns for your interest

300
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:17,880
for example let's say I want to get the

301
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:20,320
values from First Column to Second

302
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:24,160
column by keeping all information from

303
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:26,240
the all rows I can put one column and

304
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,480
two and this will result and this will

305
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,800
give me the information from the first

306
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:34,680
uh uh First Column second column and

307
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:37,120
also we can select information from the

308
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:39,839
um first and excuse me second and third

309
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:43,480
rows across all the columns so this now

310
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:46,800
we will place our interest uh range to

311
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:48,839
the first place and then um leave the

312
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:53,079
empty in the second

313
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:56,560
item and alternatively how we can call

314
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:59,040
certain columns from data frame can be

315
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:02,680
can be performed by using a dollar sign

316
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:05,240
for example each uh column has a name in

317
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:08,120
our data frame and by using a dollar

318
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:11,560
sign we can pull information from fax

319
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:13,959
machine and that will result in as you

320
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:15,800
see in a vector it's a character vector

321
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:18,399
and Str Str is another function you can

322
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:20,440
learn what type of data set you have

323
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,759
within your vector or in general in your

324
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,759
data

325
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:29,519
frame and uh lists are will the final

326
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,600
data structure I will introduce you here

327
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:37,079
today um this is a even more complicated

328
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:41,079
version of the data frame which includes

329
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:45,399
uh a vector a character and even a

330
00:15:41,079 --> 00:15:48,759
matrix written a same um same object so

331
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:52,279
in this case I included a numeric Vector

332
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:55,720
called numbers and a strength of work as

333
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:58,759
genetics and a matrix uh which has two

334
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:01,120
columns and three rows in the same list

335
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:04,759
and eventually you can see that all of

336
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:07,199
them can store in the same uh

337
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:09,759
object uh to be able to extract the

338
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:12,720
elements of the list you in this case

339
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:15,319
you need to use double square brackets

340
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:18,920
for example if I want to reach the

341
00:16:15,319 --> 00:16:22,680
Matrix within this list I can use a

342
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:26,240
double square U uh brackets and also

343
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:28,639
writing the um index of

344
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,440
this where this Matrix is stored in the

345
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,839
list

346
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:35,600
which is three and as you can see again

347
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:38,600
I can look for this by Str Str I can

348
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,720
learn what type of a data I have here

349
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:43,319
that indicates that I have a matrix

350
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,120
which include numeric values and also

351
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:48,279
similar to data frame you can use a

352
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,880
dollar sign to extract an element as

353
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:54,240
long as you have a name for it within

354
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:56,319
your list uh and again you will um

355
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,079
extract your um Matrix information

356
00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:00,839
within that list by using dollar sign

357
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,839
Matrix

358
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,679
comment

359
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:10,120
so after learning the data structures

360
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:13,559
let's look at how to manipulate data in

361
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:18,240
R and we will go over that by asking

362
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:20,120
some very simple um questions and before

363
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,319
going that I would like to introduce you

364
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:26,280
tidy Words which is an collection of

365
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:29,760
different art packages that is designed

366
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:32,559
for data science usage and can be used

367
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:34,559
for data manipulation as you know this I

368
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:37,400
said something different here which is

369
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:40,160
package so let me first introduce what

370
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:44,160
is package what does it mean in

371
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:46,679
R so um in addition to certain function

372
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:50,320
which you can find in B bying base R

373
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:52,880
without need for any other um help I

374
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:56,760
would say you can perform many tasks but

375
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:59,400
however there are also um packages in R

376
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:01,640
they can be add on all of the

377
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:05,080
uh base our functions and that allows

378
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:07,799
you to perform additional tasks so you

379
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:11,640
need to install this R packages as you

380
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:14,120
need and there are three major uh

381
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:16,799
resources you can install this packages

382
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:19,919
one of them is curan and by using

383
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:22,320
install. packages function you can

384
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:25,919
install um your package of interest in

385
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:29,120
this case for example tiders um can be

386
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:32,880
uh installed in that way uh bioconductor

387
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:36,200
is another place uh which includes our

388
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,480
packages that is that are specified for

389
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:42,280
biological

390
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:47,039
functions um and by using biom manager

391
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:49,960
you can install this packages as well um

392
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:54,120
so biom manager another our package

393
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:56,520
which allows you to install um packages

394
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:59,600
store in the bioconductor so that's why

395
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:02,440
you first need to get the bio manager

396
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:05,799
bio manager from curan and then you need

397
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:09,000
to install packages from bioconductor by

398
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:13,679
using the help of Bio manager and GitHub

399
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:17,320
is another place um you can also

400
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:19,559
um um you can also get the data for that

401
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:22,559
you can use Dev tools which is another

402
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:25,280
our package uh because uh you know this

403
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:27,520
a very Dynamic field and every day

404
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:30,159
people generate their their own art

405
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:32,120
packages and they don't prer going to um

406
00:19:30,159 --> 00:19:33,919
you know apply by conductor for each

407
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:36,480
time that's why they just place them in

408
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,080
GitHub because it's free open the public

409
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,200
so basically you can if you are

410
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,280
interested in to use their own packages

411
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:45,640
you can uh download them from GitHub

412
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:49,400
based on the um addresses they provide

413
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:52,440
you so one important thing here

414
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:55,960
installing a package is only a one-time

415
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:58,240
task once you install a package in your

416
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:01,120
R you'll no longer need to do that

417
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:04,600
however you need to do each art session

418
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:07,600
is you need to load them for this you

419
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:10,320
can use a library function and every

420
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,760
time once you want to use a pack some

421
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:15,159
some functions from a package you need

422
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:17,440
to install excuse me you need to load in

423
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:21,360
your environment by using this Library

424
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:24,799
function so let's go back to um data man

425
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:27,960
manipulation part again so in this case

426
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:30,880
um we going to answer U such a question

427
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:35,400
like cell lines in our data set were

428
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:38,880
sorted by FX machine a so for this first

429
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:42,200
we need to import the data set of

430
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:46,520
interest in our R environment for that

431
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:49,320
we can use RIT CSV function because I

432
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:53,080
have a CSV function it can be an Excel

433
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:56,320
function you can use a different um

434
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:59,159
um excuse me Excel document you can use

435
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:01,760
a different function for that specified

436
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:04,640
uh or you may have a text uh file in

437
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:07,919
this case you can R table or you can use

438
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:11,440
a f function which is coming from data

439
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:13,240
table package which is very um helpful

440
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,679
once you have a big data set it's

441
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:21,360
required High memory um as an

442
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:25,400
alternative so to be able to um read

443
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:28,919
this data set first we need to Define

444
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:31,320
where is the data set this is um how I

445
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:33,120
store my data set a meta called the

446
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:39,200
metad data and then you write the name

447
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:41,600
of file and once you uh read this file

448
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:44,960
you need to assign another variable so

449
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:48,240
that you can work with uh as a object in

450
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:51,039
your our environment so we can look at

451
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:54,360
what is inside in this metadata object

452
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:57,840
by using head function uh that will give

453
00:21:54,360 --> 00:22:00,400
you the first six row um so you don't

454
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,520
need to um look at the whole full data

455
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,520
set for example again you can see the

456
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:09,159
cell line information and they

457
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:09,159
corresponding fact machine gender and

458
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:16,880
age so now if you go back to our

459
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:18,720
question that is uh we want to learn uh

460
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:22,080
which sell lines were sorted by fax

461
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:26,279
machine R fax machine a excuse me what

462
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:30,080
we can do is we can use um this uh

463
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:33,760
specified functions from uh tiders uh

464
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:35,960
more specifically de lier so now I would

465
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,600
like to introduce you this operator

466
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:43,320
which looks AIT complicated is call as a

467
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:45,480
pipe so that allows you to use an output

468
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:48,640
from your previous step as an input for

469
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:53,360
your next in this case I will use a

470
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:57,880
filter function so that I can get only

471
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:59,279
row which has a a in their fax machine

472
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:04,679
information

473
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:05,960
so that's why I uh uh Define it in here

474
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:10,720
and then that

475
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:13,720
resulted uh in subset this uh metadata

476
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:17,120
so that only the only information is

477
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:21,760
kept where cell lines were sorted based

478
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:23,919
on tax machine a as the Second

479
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,840
Step what I would like to learn is I

480
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,000
want to learn which cell lines actually

481
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,919
have this information that's why I only

482
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,880
need that column that include the

483
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:36,159
selling information to be able to

484
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:39,320
perform this task I need an additional

485
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:41,960
command again I add my pipe here and I

486
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:44,919
will perform that by using the select

487
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:46,960
function So within the select function

488
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:49,480
I'm writing the name of the column I'm

489
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:54,480
interested to extract and that will

490
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:57,440
result um in sell lines that were sorted

491
00:23:54,480 --> 00:24:01,600
based on text machine

492
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:04,360
a so let's ask another question that is

493
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:08,240
um I'm going to learn what is the age

494
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:11,080
average of females versus mail donors

495
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:15,279
from which cell lines were generated for

496
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:18,880
that again my data set metadata is here

497
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:21,240
I want to group by group them based on

498
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:24,039
their gender so that I can get a gender

499
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:28,480
specific information by using Group by

500
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:30,559
function and then from the separated uh

501
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:34,960
stratified data based on gender I want

502
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:37,640
to calculate um average of the um

503
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,840
age to be able to perform that I can use

504
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:44,279
a summarized function and with the

505
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:46,000
summarized function I will write um um

506
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:48,360
my function interest in this case that

507
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,120
is gaing the mean calculate the mean for

508
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:55,440
the column of interest that is H and

509
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:59,480
that will resulted uh average uh age for

510
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,480
females and males

511
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:07,000
um what else I can do for example I may

512
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:09,480
also be interested in adding additional

513
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,600
information for this metadata let's say

514
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:15,760
ancestor information uh and we have a

515
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:19,159
list of ancestors for each of this

516
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:24,279
donors that we got the sell lines from

517
00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:28,080
um which is a an object called ancestry

518
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:30,480
character vector and um to be able to

519
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:33,440
add this information to my data set I

520
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:37,919
can use mutate function again after the

521
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:42,440
pipe and I can um put in a name for this

522
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:47,320
variable within my um um for my for my

523
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:49,919
data frame uh by using uh by using the

524
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:52,799
variable name on the left side of the

525
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:56,159
equal sign and then I will put my Vector

526
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:58,640
name here so that result in new column

527
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:01,159
called us ancestry which includes the

528
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:04,640
information from each of the cell

529
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:06,720
lines so since I created a new data set

530
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:10,520
probably I want to store it or exported

531
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:14,039
from R to be able to uh do this I can

532
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:18,279
use right CSV function if I want to save

533
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:22,880
this in a CSC format or I can save as a

534
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:22,880
text format by using the right table

535
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:30,840
function so these are the uh basics for

536
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:34,159
how to you can manipulate the data based

537
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:36,279
on your specific question of interest um

538
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:40,120
however we may need to do additional

539
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:42,399
tasks in this case we may need to use um

540
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:46,000
we may need to Define some functions by

541
00:26:42,399 --> 00:26:49,960
ourselves and we need to perform this

542
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,320
complicated uh settings like going

543
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:54,559
through all the data set and that's why

544
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:58,520
we need to learn some control

545
00:26:54,559 --> 00:27:01,200
structures so first look at this uh

546
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:04,000
another question that is they are

547
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:08,720
specifically interested in if the

548
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:12,799
expression of egfr gen um is greater

549
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:14,840
than five at Le 5% of the cell lines so

550
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:18,799
to be able to perform this task first we

551
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:22,799
need to read the Gen expression data and

552
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:26,000
you can see the first fourth rows and

553
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:30,000
fourth Columns of this expression data

554
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:34,200
here as you can see so so first I need

555
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:38,279
to obtain expression values

556
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:40,840
from egfr egfr G there are alternative

557
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:43,440
ways to do that first what since I know

558
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:45,600
that this is a first row I can quickly

559
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,880
call the information from first row

560
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:50,880
across all the columns from this object

561
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:52,799
expression um data object or

562
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:57,240
alternatively if I don't know there is

563
00:27:52,799 --> 00:28:00,919
the egfr in store um I can learn it by

564
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:03,840
asking um by using the V uh

565
00:28:00,919 --> 00:28:09,880
function so and

566
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:12,519
then I try to understand uh actually

567
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:15,360
which of the cell lines have gen

568
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:17,720
expression value bigger than five again

569
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:21,399
by using the V function that will give

570
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:25,279
me the location of the cell Lines within

571
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:28,880
this um first row that has a value

572
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:30,880
greater than five and to be able to

573
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:34,799
learn how many of cell

574
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:37,320
lines uh has this information I can use

575
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:39,720
length function and that will gives me

576
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:43,000
the number of the cell lines that has

577
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:45,120
egfr expression greater than five and I

578
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:49,960
can calculate the percentage in the end

579
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:54,000
and eventually it is 96 res in that 96%

580
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:56,399
of cell lines um having a Hy expression

581
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,679
value so this is important for us

582
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:02,320
because mainly we want to learn

583
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:05,640
um coverage so so that we can have

584
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:07,399
enough expression values to perform CU

585
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:11,679
analysis or any type of differential

586
00:29:07,399 --> 00:29:14,679
expression analysis so on so that is why

587
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:18,120
we probably need to do that across

588
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:21,080
transcript on across all other genes and

589
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:24,679
how we can do that so we cannot make

590
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:27,039
this one by one right for each row um

591
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:28,640
and every time when you write all of

592
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:31,320
this um

593
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:34,840
commands it looks U it's not efficient

594
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:37,519
first of all and also it looks U very um

595
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:39,880
not not regulated not arrange very well

596
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:43,000
so what you can do is actually you can

597
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:46,120
define a function which can perform all

598
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:49,279
of the steps within and you can just

599
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:51,080
provide um specific information in that

600
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:53,240
function and then it will eventually

601
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:55,640
give you the answer of the question

602
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:59,480
you're interested in for example in this

603
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:03,440
case we can define a function by using a

604
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:06,760
uh function name is function and X will

605
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:09,919
be your input of your interest and again

606
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:12,120
I will replace all of the commands I

607
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:16,159
show you from the previous slide within

608
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:21,279
this uh our function and then it will

609
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:24,880
return the percentage of the cell lines

610
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:26,360
um that has a certain expression value

611
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,840
greater than certain expression value in

612
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:31,320
our case this is five so I call this

613
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:37,320
function as get

614
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:41,440
coverage and um to be able to um perform

615
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:45,399
this task across all of the genes I can

616
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:49,200
use a for Loop strategy um and for this

617
00:30:45,399 --> 00:30:52,720
I Define a for Loop that will go over

618
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:57,360
each of the row of this gene expression

619
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:59,559
Matrix and after I extracted information

620
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:03,840
from each through for example in this

621
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:06,360
case I Define it here and I will provide

622
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:09,000
it as an input for my function get

623
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:10,880
coverage I Define previous so what is

624
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,240
important here is for this is something

625
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:17,039
new for us I put a minus one here so

626
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:20,799
that I can export the First Column which

627
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:22,840
include information from the Gen um name

628
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:28,720
so that I can get only the numeric

629
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:31,799
values and J indicates the row that will

630
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:34,039
first one by one through this for Loop

631
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:36,120
for example it will first get the

632
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:41,480
information from the first row and then

633
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:44,480
second and third so on and I Define a g

634
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:47,000
g name as well so that I can store this

635
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:49,320
information and to be able to store this

636
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,000
information in the end at the beginning

637
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:56,080
I Define an empty data frame called as

638
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:58,360
coverage values and every time I extract

639
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:01,480
the information for

640
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:05,760
uh coverage and also Gene name I store

641
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:10,519
them in a little data frame and I added

642
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:12,799
this information to the previous one uh

643
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:15,279
previous information the previous Ro by

644
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:18,039
using the rbind row bind function

645
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:23,159
basically I bind this information from

646
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:25,720
this little data frames um by by row and

647
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:28,200
eventually that result in a object

648
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:31,799
called as coverage values that will the

649
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:33,399
information from each gene um and your

650
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:36,440
corresponding

651
00:32:33,399 --> 00:32:40,159
coverage so after that after I Define

652
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:43,240
the data frame by using uh again some

653
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:45,799
data manipulation tools I can filter

654
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:48,760
them based on their coverage will be

655
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:50,919
greater than five and I can select only

656
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:54,840
the gene column so that I can learn

657
00:32:50,919 --> 00:32:54,840
actually which genes has High

658
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:02,200
coverage so there's actually more

659
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:05,960
efficient way doing that um instead of

660
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:09,760
using the for Loops um and apply family

661
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:14,600
functions can be can perform this task

662
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:18,200
for this we can use apply function and

663
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:22,720
we uh provide our data set here as a

664
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:24,760
first item and second item um will be

665
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,960
direction of the calculations we're

666
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:30,720
interested in in our case we're

667
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:33,600
interested in um uh compute the coverage

668
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:38,200
per row right in the direction of this

669
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:41,200
arrow and we provided this input for the

670
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:43,960
get carage function each time so

671
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:47,120
basically instead of writing a for Loop

672
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:50,480
uh by providing an apply function you

673
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:54,039
can let your algorithm pass through all

674
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:57,519
of the rows and uh in your data frame uh

675
00:33:54,039 --> 00:33:58,440
by using a one called line so in this

676
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:02,360
case

677
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:04,639
each um rowes will go to get coverage

678
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:06,960
function and that's will result in the

679
00:34:04,639 --> 00:34:08,919
same um

680
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,119
um coverage

681
00:34:08,919 --> 00:34:16,040
information um there are other functions

682
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:18,359
called L apply and S apply so uh there

683
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:20,839
are differences based on what type of

684
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:23,720
input you can provide and what type of

685
00:34:20,839 --> 00:34:25,399
output you can get in apply function you

686
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:27,800
can

687
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:33,159
um apply function can be applied for for

688
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:36,000
either matrices or data frames um so uh

689
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:38,720
one more one more information here is um

690
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,200
for examp if you want to parse your data

691
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:45,679
frame or Matrix through columns you can

692
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:48,720
replace by two um and L apply uh can be

693
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:52,639
used for uh inputs that are list and

694
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:56,359
output again list s apply also can be

695
00:34:52,639 --> 00:35:00,240
used for either list vectors um matrices

696
00:34:56,359 --> 00:35:02,560
and it will result of um uh this data

697
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:05,800
structure as an output as well so it

698
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:08,240
depends on what type of a um task you

699
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:11,079
want to perform you can uh look for

700
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:15,680
other apply family functions and they

701
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:15,680
are very efficiently uh passed for your

702
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:23,400
grou um now let's go through regression

703
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:26,599
analysis that is the actually the

704
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:31,000
initial question we are interested in so

705
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:34,960
that was we want to look learn how um

706
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:37,760
what is the um variation uh in the gene

707
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:42,599
expression data is how much of them is

708
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:45,359
explained by certain um variants so in

709
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:48,280
this case we can um perform regression

710
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:50,560
analysis understand their relationship

711
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:54,359
between the genotype and the gene

712
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:57,640
expression in this case we

713
00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:58,720
Define um gen expression as a depend

714
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:01,880
dependent

715
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:03,760
variable basically by using a genotype

716
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:09,240
information that's our independent

717
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:11,839
variable we can predict um values for uh

718
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:16,560
Y which is Gen expression value in our

719
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:20,160
case and to perform this task we try to

720
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:23,440
fit the data points in a line and as you

721
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:24,720
see here you call the regression line um

722
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:28,079
the data

723
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:32,240
points do not perfectly fit the line so

724
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:35,000
that will introduce an error term um and

725
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:39,480
this line basically

726
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:43,440
selected based on a criteria that

727
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:45,480
minimizes um the square sum of each of

728
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,960
this error term coming from data set

729
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:52,280
that indicates their distance from the

730
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:56,319
fited line so after this U line that

731
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:58,440
minimizes the square sum is selected uh

732
00:36:56,319 --> 00:37:01,440
we see two different

733
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:04,200
uh variables one of them

734
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:06,599
is it's for better coefficients it

735
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:09,160
included two information one for beta

736
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:12,839
zero that is intercept basically that is

737
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:16,280
the point uh the y y value that

738
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:18,480
correspond to x value which equals zero

739
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:21,400
and beta one which is actually more

740
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:24,359
important for our cases that is the

741
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:27,680
slope of that line that indicates how

742
00:37:24,359 --> 00:37:29,359
strong a relationship between your genot

743
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:33,560
type and your gen

744
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:37,680
expression so and regression analysis uh

745
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:40,040
tests the significance of how this uh

746
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:42,240
beta value beta one value is different

747
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:45,520
from

748
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:49,040
zero and we can perform the linear

749
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:50,560
regression analysis by using R um let's

750
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,720
say I'm interested in see the

751
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:57,960
relationship between EF gen expression

752
00:37:52,720 --> 00:38:02,520
values versus this RS um 14 and and with

753
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:05,599
76 uh genetic variance first I read my

754
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:08,359
uh data sets and then I extracted the

755
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:10,760
corresponding values for EGF egfr gen

756
00:38:08,359 --> 00:38:14,800
expression and genotype value for the

757
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:17,280
snip and I form a data frame which

758
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:19,440
include information from What gene

759
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:22,079
expression and genotype and also

760
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:24,599
additionally I added gender and age

761
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:26,400
information so that resulted in in a

762
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:28,800
data frame where you can see the

763
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:31,640
expression values for egfr and their

764
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:36,040
corresponding genotype value for uh this

765
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:39,079
specific snip and uh gender and the age

766
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:42,960
of each of the cell

767
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:47,400
lines so by using LM function I can

768
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:49,640
perform this task and uh basically my y

769
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:53,200
now will be in the left side of the

770
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:57,920
tilta my X will be the on the right top

771
00:38:53,200 --> 00:39:00,400
of the um uh tilt and I Define uh those

772
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:03,480
variables by using their column names

773
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:05,560
and I tell them which data I want to use

774
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:08,359
within this data

775
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:11,160
parameter and U by using a summary

776
00:39:08,359 --> 00:39:16,319
function I can get an information of

777
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:22,800
Statistics so U for the beta one we can

778
00:39:16,319 --> 00:39:26,200
see the uh estimation values as uh 27 in

779
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:28,520
this uh second row of the First Column

780
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:31,079
and then you can see the corresponding P

781
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:34,640
value let's say I want to

782
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:37,359
add gender information uh to this model

783
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:40,200
meaning that I want to control for the

784
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:42,040
impact of gender on gene expression and

785
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:44,119
then I want to see the relationship

786
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:49,119
between an expression of genotype for

787
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:52,160
this simply I can add gender after um

788
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:53,920
plus sign and as you see here again I

789
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:56,000
will look for the corresponding

790
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:58,160
statistics for the

791
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,280
genotype and

792
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:03,560
P value and beta coefficient of slightly

793
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:06,040
change now after you add this so there

794
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:09,560
are some cases your data can be

795
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:12,160
significant after you add for um this

796
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:15,960
additional information we call them

797
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:18,000
co-founders um basically the um ideal

798
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:21,079
way is checking their impact on G

799
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,640
expression first and then decide uh if

800
00:40:21,079 --> 00:40:28,599
you want to edit your linear model so

801
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:28,599
that you can perform a robust Q analysis

802
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:39,079
sure uh yeah this is a b and then what

803
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:42,000
is the number above that the nine what

804
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:45,079
is the oh this one yeah what is that

805
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:48,240
this is intercept this is the beta zero

806
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:49,680
this is how okay yeah basically

807
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:53,160
generally we are always interested in a

808
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:55,680
beta coent key value uh so that we can

809
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:58,920
report them to show the significance of

810
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,920
our relationship

811
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:09,160
um yeah and then let's visualize uh our

812
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:12,200
data set finally by using GG plot so um

813
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:16,880
I also want to show how we can look for

814
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:19,000
the line relationship excuse me um and

815
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,920
gplot is a very helpful function for

816
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,880
data

817
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:26,640
visualization um for this you use ggplot

818
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:29,359
function and you write the name of your

819
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:31,880
data and then you can uh select the

820
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:35,280
columns which you would like to uh Plot

821
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:37,760
show within this a e s corresponding

822
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:41,200
athetics function so what I want to do

823
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:44,480
is I want to plot information genotype

824
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:48,119
versus expression values that's why I

825
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:51,640
put this column names and I use jum

826
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:55,880
Jitter function here uh so that I can

827
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:59,839
get a scatter plot which U uh sort of um

828
00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:02,800
since I have a group of values from 0 1

829
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:05,280
two for x-axis but I want to separate

830
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:08,119
this data points I use uh kind of a

831
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:11,079
rotation by using a g function instead

832
00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:14,040
you can use a g point that will allows

833
00:42:11,079 --> 00:42:17,680
you when you have a wide range of X Val

834
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:20,760
versus y AIS that's um kind of having

835
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:24,160
equal number of elements as well uh I

836
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:28,280
Define a color of this data points here

837
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:31,440
um and then I Define size B

838
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:37,760
um excuse me size of the points and then

839
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:41,720
I name the uh labels exic y labels here

840
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:43,559
so if I want to add um gen stratify them

841
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:46,359
based on the gender information what I

842
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:50,119
can do is I can add a color parameter

843
00:42:46,359 --> 00:42:53,200
within this a e Statics function it will

844
00:42:50,119 --> 00:42:57,960
color those data points based on gender

845
00:42:53,200 --> 00:43:01,319
or finally I can uh add a box plot on

846
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:03,880
top of it by using the jum box plot

847
00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:06,440
function in addition that there are

848
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:08,880
variety of other function that allows

849
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:11,720
you different visualizations like for

850
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:14,520
examp bar plot you can use J Bar for

851
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:17,000
density plots you can use J density or

852
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:19,839
histograms because jum

853
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:23,800
histogram let's go to the final part of

854
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:26,000
our talk today so as we mentioned at the

855
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:28,720
beginning uh by conductor is are one of

856
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:31,319
the uh place you can uh get lots of our

857
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:33,960
packages to be using

858
00:43:31,319 --> 00:43:37,640
um to answer different biological

859
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:39,760
questions um it's a huge uh storage area

860
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:44,319
that includes above

861
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:46,960
2,000 uh different um our packages uh I

862
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:50,760
just like to highlight you uh one of the

863
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:53,280
a few popular ones first one is dc2

864
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:55,839
first that can be used to test

865
00:43:53,280 --> 00:44:00,880
differential gen expression analysis you

866
00:43:55,839 --> 00:44:03,839
can um use the dc2 uh package name dc2

867
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:06,480
for that uh it will perform a differen

868
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:09,240
expression by using negative binormal

869
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:13,440
distribution um and you can see this is

870
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:15,119
a famous volcano flight uh not Volcan

871
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:19,280
but mean expression versus log to full

872
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:21,920
change plot um after you perform uh this

873
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:25,640
um analysis it's an algorithm generated

874
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:27,880
by um Dr Mike and their

875
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:30,720
colleagues um another package which is

876
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:35,160
very I found very helpful is a g

877
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:38,160
profiler too um instead of using uh this

878
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:40,880
webbased tools you can perform Gene

879
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:43,240
enrichment analysis genology analysis by

880
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:45,000
using this Tool uh basically after

881
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:48,880
performing your differential expression

882
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:51,280
analysis you can um extract the genes

883
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:54,000
which show up regulation and which show

884
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:56,760
down regulation and then by using list

885
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,319
of genes as an input for a function

886
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:02,359
called as ghost within this package you

887
00:44:59,319 --> 00:45:05,000
can find uh which Pathways they were

888
00:45:02,359 --> 00:45:08,160
significantly enriched and it can even

889
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:11,280
perform uh some visualization for you um

890
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:13,359
summarize uh what type of uh enrichment

891
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:17,880
um results you

892
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:20,800
have finally uh this is from uh um my

893
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:22,800
own study uh with my colleagues uh we

894
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:25,480
performance crial analysis and to be

895
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:27,559
able to look at the results um we use

896
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:29,359
some visualization tools

897
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:31,760
uh this looks a very complicated graph

898
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:34,839
here if I can summarize for example in

899
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:37,839
this case we are interested in um how

900
00:45:34,839 --> 00:45:41,800
and eqtl for coming from certain cell

901
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:44,079
types for the CPW Gene um is associated

902
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:47,119
with u education attainment and Global

903
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:48,960
surface area gas so for example to be

904
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:51,160
able to make this beautiful and

905
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:54,920
complicated graph a variet or our

906
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:58,079
packages exist uh which includes Jus

907
00:45:54,920 --> 00:46:01,880
biomart um and also genomic ranges that

908
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:04,119
will allow you to Define your um genomic

909
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:05,480
Locus with an object and you can play

910
00:46:04,119 --> 00:46:08,240
with

911
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:10,720
them so yeah thank you so much all of

912
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:12,760
you for having me today and I will be

913
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:16,160
happy if you have additional uh

914
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:17,440
questions and if you don't have anything

915
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:19,839
right now you can also reach me

916
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:21,480
afterwards uh this is my email I'm in

917
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:23,640
the cancer program uh living in the

918
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:25,559
fourth floor um yeah I will be very

919
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:28,920
happy to talk about about my research

920
00:46:25,559 --> 00:46:28,920
and our in general

921
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:37,440
okay thanks NE that was great I know for

922
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:40,240
me I'm used to looking at art tutorials

923
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:42,359
with the built-in um data frames like

924
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:45,400
cars so it was really nice to see it in

925
00:46:42,359 --> 00:46:47,559
a genomic context um do we have any

926
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:50,400
questions in the

927
00:46:47,559 --> 00:46:51,599
room yeah yeah I can bring you the

928
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,800
microphone or you could come up and

929
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:57,119
stand by one do you have any experience

930
00:46:54,800 --> 00:47:00,359
working with data that doesn't fit in

931
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:02,559
memory and how you would handle that

932
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:04,839
yeah that's a great point and for those

933
00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:06,960
cases uh instead of using my generally I

934
00:47:04,839 --> 00:47:09,520
don't use my local machine at all for

935
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:12,079
any analysis uh we can have a system

936
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:14,640
inro called Uber that allows you to

937
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:16,760
access High memory uh computer with the

938
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:19,720
high memory uh basically you can get an

939
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:21,640
interactive job um you can Define how

940
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:23,880
much memory you want and you can handle

941
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:28,280
data set with uh those additional

942
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:28,280
computers not your in local machine

943
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:41,480
yeah the eqtl the last

944
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:44,000
plot the last plot for showing the locus

945
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:48,400
and how do you know about this snip is

946
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:51,000
uh the the location in your plot oh yeah

947
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,960
uh I'm having the information from um

948
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:55,280
have genotype data store that's a

949
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:57,359
software plink that give me the VAR the

950
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:59,720
variant is uh you can you can also look

951
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:01,160
at them in r as well because we know the

952
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:04,440
there is the jum location of each of

953
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:07,079
variant um and but you can actually put

954
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:09,640
this information within a g range object

955
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:12,040
in each time for each variance uh and

956
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:14,200
basically you create a numeric values of

957
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:18,160
the location of each variant and the

958
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:22,160
genome are these um all Snips correlated

959
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:25,359
with each other and the inod to the the

960
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:27,920
one gen oh yeah that's a great point so

961
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:29,800
in this case I tested Association of all

962
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:35,119
the variant within the stomic locus with

963
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:35,119
cvw Gene only one gene thank you yeah

964
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:41,079
sure I'm wondering if you have

965
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:43,960
suggestions for um people new to R in

966
00:48:41,079 --> 00:48:45,559
these analyses and using chat GPT or

967
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:49,680
copilot to try to help them with their

968
00:48:45,559 --> 00:48:52,680
coding or like words of the wise yeah um

969
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:54,599
definitely they are helpful uh but as

970
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:57,119
long as you don't know what function

971
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:59,640
does it can some dangerous and time

972
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:01,799
consuming um for a starting point I

973
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:04,599
would definitely suggest going uh some

974
00:49:01,799 --> 00:49:08,119
uh art tutorials online first and once

975
00:49:04,599 --> 00:49:09,960
you're familiar with um you can also uh

976
00:49:08,119 --> 00:49:12,760
look for chat but I think you should be

977
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:15,319
able to judge what chat un does because

978
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:17,839
sometimes uh it gives you a mix of

979
00:49:15,319 --> 00:49:20,440
functions um all the general it can be a

980
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:22,160
very helpful starting point as well uh

981
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:24,839
but yeah as long as you have a good art

982
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:27,720
tutorial sort of a script save somewhere

983
00:49:24,839 --> 00:49:31,200
you can copy paste it from each time um

984
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:36,240
change it based on your um question so I

985
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:36,240
trust tutorial more than chat

986
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:41,240
actually all right well if there's no

987
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:42,620
other questions let's thank our speaker

988
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:45,750
again
