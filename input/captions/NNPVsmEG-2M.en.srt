1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,279
Good morning everyone. Thank you so much

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,879
for joining us. My name is Alexis

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,760
Marcus. I'm part of the admissions team

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:11,519
here at MIT Sloan and I am joined by a

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,080
number of my colleagues today on the

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,920
back end of this Zoom webinar who are

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,480
here to answer your questions about the

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,720
MBA application um which we're so

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,240
excited is now open for this next

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,840
admission cycle. So for entry in fall of

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,039
2026

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,119
um we're really excited that the

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,400
application is live. You can you can

14
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,760
start your application, you can submit

15
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,559
your application, but we'll go through

16
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,239
all of those um details today and then

17
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,960
answer any questions that you might have

18
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,559
about the application itself. Let's get

19
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,120
started. So, the first thing I want to

20
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,320
talk about is the mission of MIT Sloan.

21
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,920
And the reason why I think this is

22
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,079
important is because it really is

23
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,640
ingrained into everything that we do at

24
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:54,000
MIT Sloan and really is at the heart of

25
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,920
our application. We at MIT Sloan um are

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,239
trying to develop principled innovative

27
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,800
leader to improve the world and generate

28
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,559
ideas that advance management practice.

29
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,239
And within our application, we're

30
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,159
looking for different components that

31
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,159
will indicate that you will become one

32
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:11,760
of these leaders in the future. And

33
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:14,479
we'll talk about that in just a minute.

34
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,560
So there are a number of programs at MIT

35
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,560
Sloan. And as I mentioned today, we're

36
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,759
really focusing in on the 2-year

37
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,840
full-time MBA. So, our MBA program, as I

38
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,080
mentioned, it's two years. You have the

39
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,240
summer off in between the two years.

40
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,920
You'll have um you'll start at the end

41
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,280
of August for an orientation, and then

42
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,759
classes begin at the beginning of

43
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,200
September. They run through May. Again,

44
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,400
you have that summer off, and then you

45
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,880
repeat for your second year. Um it is a

46
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,880
full-time program. It's all on campus in

47
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,360
Cambridge. There's no hybrid option.

48
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,680
There's no online option. So, it all is

49
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,280
in person on campus. And then, as you

50
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,960
can see here, we have that portfolio of

51
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,280
programs. So there's a number of other

52
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,759
programs at MIT Sloan and as part of

53
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,079
your MBA experience, you will be taking

54
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,159
elective classes with folks from all of

55
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,399
these other programs. So it's really an

56
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,560
exciting opportunity. Those that are

57
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,880
interested in the MBA program do have

58
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,920
the opportunity to do some dual degree

59
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,680
programs. Um so there are three dual or

60
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,319
joint degree programs. The first is our

61
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,720
LJGO leaders in global operations. As

62
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,720
you can see, that's a full 24month

63
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,520
program. So that actually starts in June

64
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:24,800
and goes for a full 24 months. Um you

65
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:27,200
get both an MBA at Sloan as well as an

66
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,680
SM in one of the nine engineering

67
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,760
disciplines at the engineering school um

68
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,680
within MIT. That does have a separate

69
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,120
deadline which we'll talk about but um

70
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,080
there are some additional application

71
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,879
components for that program. We also

72
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,560
have a dual degree program with DUP,

73
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:45,200
which is the Department of Urban Studies

74
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,040
and Planning, as well as a dual degree

75
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,560
with the Harvard Kennedy School for an

76
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:54,400
MPP or an MPA. Both of those programs,

77
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:57,120
you do need to apply concurrently to DUP

78
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,280
or HKS and you must submit your

79
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,720
application for Sloan in round two,

80
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,239
which isn't going to be in January.

81
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,959
We'll talk about the deadlines coming up

82
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,319
soon. So, just a little FYI there.

83
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,920
Something to think about if you're

84
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,120
planning out your year and when you're

85
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,400
going to be applying and if you're

86
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,040
interested in those dual degree

87
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,120
programs.

88
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,159
So, here's a quick snapshot of the MBA

89
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,080
class of 2026. So, these are the rising

90
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,560
second years, not the folks that are

91
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,800
coming into the class this year. Our

92
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,000
class profile for the class of 2027,

93
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,319
which are the folks that will be joining

94
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,480
us in just a few short weeks, um will be

95
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,480
available probably in late September on

96
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,560
the website. Um, but many of the things

97
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,000
will stay relatively the same. So, you

98
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,840
know, when you're looking at this, just

99
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,239
kind of giving you a snapshot of, hey,

100
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,239
do I fall into what Sloan is looking

101
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,080
for. Um, I think the most important

102
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,239
thing to remember is that we are not

103
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,879
looking for a specific type of student

104
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,879
or someone from a specific background.

105
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:53,440
We certainly have people coming to the

106
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:55,040
MBA program from, you know, specific

107
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,280
undergraduate majors, specific

108
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,840
industries. Um, however, there is a

109
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,680
place for everyone here at MIT. You can

110
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,239
see we have people from the social

111
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,879
sciences, from the humanities studies,

112
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,879
um we have people from law uh industry

113
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:11,360
coming into the MBA program. So, there

114
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,720
really is a spot for everyone. And then

115
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,640
you can also see just some of the

116
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,919
academics, what we're looking for

117
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:20,639
typically um for an average or median um

118
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:23,280
GPA from your undergraduate institution

119
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:26,160
as well as any median scores for your

120
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,000
GMAT or GRE. Um, one thing to keep in

121
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,400
mind, I know that this is representing

122
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,720
the 10th edition GMAT. We hopefully will

123
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,639
be reporting out for this coming uh for

124
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,400
the incoming class this year on that

125
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,040
GMAT focus. So, you can understand

126
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,360
really where our median look or median

127
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,639
or average looks for the GMAT focus. So,

128
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,960
that information should be coming in

129
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,560
September.

130
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:50,160
So, a couple reasons that you might want

131
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,560
to pursue an M um an MBA at MIT Sloan.

132
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,960
It's really a unique opportunity because

133
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,840
we sit at that intersection of business

134
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,360
and technology. We are MIT's business

135
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,280
school and for that reason you have

136
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,160
access to everything at the greater

137
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,759
institute. Within the program itself,

138
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,919
you'll be developing your leadership

139
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,160
skills. Whether you're looking to

140
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,680
advance your career in whatever industry

141
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,840
you're staying in or if you're looking

142
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,479
to pivot, you absolutely have the

143
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,240
opportunity to develop those skills to

144
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,400
learn something new while you're at

145
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,840
Sloan. um and you'll build, you know, a

146
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:26,479
lifelong lifelong uh network within your

147
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,720
community. Here at MIT Sloan, we have a

148
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,880
ton of academic offerings really

149
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,199
focusing in on hands-on learning through

150
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,919
our action learning labs, our study

151
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,000
tours and tracks. Um and then we also

152
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,240
have that one semester core which is

153
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,520
your first semester at MIT Sloan and

154
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,000
then after that you have full

155
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,840
flexibility to take whatever classes you

156
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,759
want including taking up to three

157
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,479
electives across the greater institute

158
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,160
or at Harvard.

159
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:55,600
So want to quickly talk about the

160
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,120
application timeline um for this cycle

161
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,600
because that's really what we're here to

162
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,400
talk about today. So the deadline for

163
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:05,120
round one is going to be September 29th

164
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,039
this year. Um, and then on the 30th, we

165
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,199
will get started on reading right away.

166
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:11,520
So on the 29th, you will want to get

167
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:14,000
everything submitted no later than 300

168
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,400
p.m. Eastern time. So 3 p.m. in

169
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Cambridge. On the 29th, we will start

170
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,479
kind of going through those applications

171
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,600
shortly thereafter and then reading all

172
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:25,440
of those applications on the 30th. We'll

173
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,800
read for a few weeks as you'll see here,

174
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,960
and then you'll get a um interview um an

175
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,240
interview invite or a final decision.

176
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,400
Um, so you could potentially get

177
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,840
weightlisted without an interview. You

178
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,880
could potentially get invited for an

179
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:42,319
interview or you could be um rejected by

180
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:44,720
the 27th of October. And then if you are

181
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:47,440
invited to interview, you will be um

182
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,280
invited to schedule a Zoom interview

183
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,520
during the month of November through the

184
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:54,160
first week of December. And then a final

185
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,880
decision will be rendered u by December

186
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,280
11th um of this calendar year. So, you

187
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,720
will have the opportunity um you know,

188
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,000
you you can see kind of here what the

189
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,280
schedule will look like between

190
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,680
September when you submit the

191
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,520
application all the way to December. A

192
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,360
couple things to note. We do not look at

193
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,120
applications on a rolling basis. So, we

194
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,280
do not look at them when you submit. So,

195
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,039
if you submit it on September 2nd, no

196
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,680
one is reviewing that application until

197
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,880
September 30th. Um but we will start

198
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,639
looking at those applications on

199
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,080
September 30th, including all of the

200
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:26,319
components. So, you want to make sure

201
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:28,400
everything is submitted on time.

202
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,560
So, in terms of the evaluation process,

203
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,720
here's a quick snapshot of how many

204
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,639
applications we receive year-over-year,

205
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,400
how many are reviewed by the admissions

206
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,319
committee, and then ultimately how many

207
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,440
are admitted. So, you can see we roughly

208
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:43,599
get about 5,000 MBAon applications every

209
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,440
year. Every single application that

210
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:47,520
comes in the door is reviewed by a

211
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,000
member of the admissions committee. um

212
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,039
we read every single file that comes in

213
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,400
and then from that um pool of of

214
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:58,800
applicants we invite about 25% every

215
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,360
single round to interview and then

216
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:06,319
ultimately we admit about 16% of the

217
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:08,080
overall pool to um to join our class.

218
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,000
So what are we evaluating during the

219
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,800
admissions process? So there's kind of

220
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,039
two buckets that MIT Sloan um MBA

221
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:18,240
program is really falling into here. Um,

222
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:20,319
in true, you know, MIT fashion, we do

223
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,840
plot it on an XY axis, which I'll show

224
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,240
you in just a minute. But we're looking

225
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:27,120
for kind of two categories. One is this

226
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,039
demonstrated success, and the other are

227
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,680
certain personal attributes, including

228
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:34,080
your leadership skills or leadership um,

229
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,240
abilities. So, we're really curious on

230
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,399
the demonstrated success side on your

231
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,399
academics. You know, how have you done

232
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,159
in your undergraduate, if you do have a

233
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,159
a graduate degree, how have you done in

234
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,920
your graduate degree studies? So, we'll

235
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,000
be looking at your transcripts for that.

236
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,760
We'll also be looking at your um

237
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,360
standardized testing scores. And then

238
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,920
also in demonstrated success, we're

239
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,160
looking at your um impact within your

240
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:59,600
professional career. So, as a reminder,

241
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,760
our MBA program folks have on average

242
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,320
five years of full-time work experience

243
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:07,040
before joining the MBA program. So, they

244
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,440
do have that span of about two to seven

245
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,760
years is pretty common um where we see

246
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,920
those MBA uh students joining the

247
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,640
program. And so we want to understand

248
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,399
throughout your application how are you

249
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,240
having impact within your professional

250
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,240
career and how have you had that growth.

251
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,519
Similarly on the other axis we're

252
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,040
looking again at those personal

253
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,440
attributes. How well do you work in

254
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,760
teams? How are you solving problems? How

255
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,360
do you communicate with other people on

256
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,279
your teams? How do you communicate up

257
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,680
and how do you communicate down? How do

258
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,959
you adapt to change? So all of those are

259
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,120
the kinds of things that we're looking

260
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:41,360
for specific examples throughout the

261
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,440
entire application to understand a

262
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,480
little bit more.

263
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:49,279
So here's a just a sample of that XYaxis

264
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,279
and how we kind of score um applicants

265
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,600
and then ultimately who moves forward

266
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,680
within the process. So you can see, you

267
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,000
know, the dots here represent where you

268
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,839
scored, where applicants scored within

269
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,600
their written application. And then in

270
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,920
the upper right quadrant, those are the

271
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:07,200
folks that ultimately move forward, the

272
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:10,399
25% that move forward and get invited to

273
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,399
interview with MIT Sloan.

274
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,800
This is similarly repeated after the

275
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,560
interview. You will be, you know, um

276
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,399
scored again on the same competencies

277
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,399
because there'll be more additional data

278
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,000
and information. and then those folks in

279
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,200
the upper right quadrant will be moved

280
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,279
forward for admission.

281
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,279
So, let's get into the checklist and how

282
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,880
are you going to be showcasing all of

283
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,399
these things that I just mentioned,

284
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,760
right? So, first and foremost,

285
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,079
deadlines. We already talked about it.

286
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,560
Round one is September 29th and then we

287
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:40,800
have two other rounds, January 13th and

288
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,079
April 6th. As I mentioned at the

289
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,920
beginning, if you're interested in that

290
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:46,160
dual degree with the engine with an

291
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,480
engineering um department, that's the

292
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:51,440
LJGO application, and you do need to

293
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,600
specifically do that LJGO application um

294
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,920
and apply by November 5th. Anyone that

295
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,320
applies to LJGO is automatically

296
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,240
considered for MBA. So, if you are not

297
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,560
successful in getting into the LJGO

298
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,399
program or not successful and um getting

299
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,000
in getting into the engineering side,

300
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,880
Sloan is still looking at you and will

301
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,320
still consider you just for the MBA.

302
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:14,399
So, talking specifically about the MBAon

303
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,000
application, here are all of the

304
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,399
components and we're going to go through

305
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,480
each and every one of them um together

306
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,680
and answer answer any questions that you

307
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,760
might have and hopefully I'll give you

308
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,600
some tips along the way. So, each of

309
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,519
these components are things that you're

310
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,640
going to need to submit in order to have

311
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:33,120
a complete application to MIT Sloan MBA

312
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:35,200
program. Um, and we'll go through those

313
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,800
right now. One thing that I want to talk

314
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,399
about is which deadline should you

315
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,240
apply? And that's always a question that

316
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,399
we get is is one deadline better than

317
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,079
the other. The best deadline is the

318
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,560
deadline that you are ready for? Because

319
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:49,680
many of you are here today. You are a

320
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:52,160
couple months away in in anticipation of

321
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,839
going um of submitting this application.

322
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,160
So hopefully you'll be getting it in in

323
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,760
round one. It's really just a simple

324
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,079
math problem, right? When you think

325
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,480
about it, we obviously are admitting

326
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:04,720
people in round one. Those seats get

327
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,200
taken when they commit to the program.

328
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,880
So seats get taken up in round one. So

329
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,200
that there the most seats are available

330
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,959
if you apply in round one. However, that

331
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,279
being said, we do get a number of

332
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:17,200
applications in round two and that is

333
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:19,440
also a really large large round for us.

334
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,360
So the balance for you as an applicant

335
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,279
is to find when your application is

336
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,079
ready. So you don't want to rush things.

337
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:28,320
You don't want to um submit an

338
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:30,880
unfinished application. If you need that

339
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,480
extra time, you can take it. Um, but you

340
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,480
know, if you're planning in advance, I

341
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,320
would shoot for the earliest round. That

342
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,399
also gives you more opportunities to get

343
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,320
in front of the admissions committee.

344
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,959
So, the reason I say that is because we

345
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,800
talked about um if you are weightlisted

346
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:47,279
without an interview, you will be then

347
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,200
reconsidered in the following subsequent

348
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:51,600
round for an interview. So, you'll be

349
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,079
looked at more frequently than someone

350
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,680
that says say applies in round two or

351
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,519
round three. They only have that one

352
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,279
chance. So, round three, I would

353
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,959
definitely not be planning for it. is

354
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:03,040
quite small and there are not that many

355
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,959
seats available at that point. But

356
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:08,160
certainly focusing in on round one or

357
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:10,800
round two is a smart plan. All right, so

358
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:13,040
let's jump into each of the different

359
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,480
components. So first the first component

360
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,760
that we want to talk about is the cover

361
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:20,000
letter. So MIT Sloan's application as

362
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,720
general rule is relatively lean and we

363
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,800
make it that way on purpose. We really

364
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,120
want you to be thoughtful about how

365
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,040
you're kind of portraying your impact

366
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,120
and your successes in both your academic

367
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,480
and professional careers. And for that

368
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,079
reason, we don't really have those

369
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,399
traditional essays that you might see in

370
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,800
other business school applications. So,

371
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,560
the cover letter is a 300word cover

372
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,720
letter. It doesn't include the address

373
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,560
or salutation. Um, and it's your

374
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,920
opportunity to really sell yourself and

375
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:50,160
also sell you sell us on why MIT Sloan

376
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,839
is the right place for you. One of the

377
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,000
unique things about the cover letter is

378
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:58,000
that we're asking you to seek a place in

379
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,680
the MIT um MBA class and also highlight

380
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,839
what those successes have been in your

381
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,160
professional career. Um one of the

382
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:06,720
things that we're not asking are why do

383
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:09,279
you want to go to business school and

384
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,279
what are your goals? Certainly you are

385
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:13,279
welcome to submit that as part of your

386
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:15,440
application, but we're not asking it and

387
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,760
we're actually do that on purpose. We

388
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,079
encourage you to explore different

389
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,160
opportunities. um pivot within your

390
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:24,720
career or see what is interesting to you

391
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,480
when you get here um and you know we're

392
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,519
not holding you to a certain industry or

393
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,279
a certain uh function postmbba and so

394
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,560
for that reason you know you might not

395
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,079
want to talk about what your goals are

396
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,000
because you're not sure yet and that is

397
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,440
completely okay so within the cover

398
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,160
letter you really want to be

399
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,720
highlighting some of the examples from

400
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,160
your work that um highlight some of the

401
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,160
attributes that we were talking about

402
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,920
before how you're working in teams what

403
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,839
have you done that has been really

404
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,000
successful full within your professional

405
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,920
career. Um, and again, you don't need to

406
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,920
focus on those future goals. We're

407
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,000
really looking um at your past

408
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:01,360
performance as an indicator of your

409
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,600
future success.

410
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,920
So, the second part of the application

411
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:09,120
is the resume. So, the resumeé is

412
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:11,199
limited to a onepage resumeé. Um, and we

413
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,519
look for a really standard kind of

414
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:15,440
format. So, you don't need to go crazy

415
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:18,079
with making it, you know, a different

416
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,839
format. you know, just the standard CV

417
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,680
resume that you're you you've used

418
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:24,720
you're you're used to seeing, excuse me,

419
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:27,120
um is perfectly fine. Some normal Times

420
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,360
New Roman font, size 10 is what we these

421
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,680
are just suggestions for the formatting.

422
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,560
Um certainly not required, but something

423
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,160
very simple and easy to read. We don't

424
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,320
want to be taking too much time trying

425
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,240
to just figure out where the information

426
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:43,040
is. you know, really kind of

427
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,040
understanding um you know, the the

428
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,720
format and being able to quickly have a

429
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,440
snapshot of what you're what you have

430
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,279
done to date. Um we really want to see

431
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,959
sections on your education, your work

432
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,720
experience, and then any additional

433
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,399
information. You can certainly showcase

434
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,320
your volunteer experience or

435
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:01,279
extracurriculars, any certificates that

436
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:03,040
you have, um leadership positions, or um

437
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,480
any interests. I always love a little

438
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,920
line at the bottom that tells you some

439
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,320
of the interests that you might not find

440
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,320
elsewhere in the application about uh

441
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,320
the applicant. The most important thing

442
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,800
to take away from the resume is that all

443
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,720
of the bullets within your professional

444
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,199
um educ or excuse me within your work

445
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,839
experience section of your resume should

446
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,519
be impact related bullets. So

447
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,920
quantifiable

448
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:28,160
um successes within your career. So, you

449
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,560
really want to focus in on um what have

450
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,639
you done really well and what where have

451
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,000
you had those kind of highlights within

452
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,759
those the different roles that you've

453
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,160
held. We don't need your daily

454
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:40,000
activities. Um we really want to see,

455
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,240
you know, those specific highlights. And

456
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,079
then within your resume or within your

457
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,600
cover letter or within your video, which

458
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:47,759
we'll talk about in a minute, you might

459
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,199
be highlighting those more some of those

460
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,199
examples a little bit more and

461
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,880
elaborating a little bit more on those

462
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,560
examples. But you do want to make sure

463
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:58,160
that you're talking specifically about

464
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,920
the impact that EP had.

465
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,399
So, next component is the video

466
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,079
statement. Definitely a favorite for the

467
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,000
admissions committee. This is an

468
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,640
opportunity for you to record a

469
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,520
60-second video. We ask that you do it

470
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,360
in one take. Um, so no editing. There

471
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:16,480
should not be any subtitles. There

472
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:18,079
should not be any background noises. Um,

473
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,880
really being aware of your surroundings

474
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,799
is very important. um no music, anything

475
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,559
like that. So, it really is just you in

476
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,319
front of a camera. Um and you're

477
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:29,280
answering the question of introducing

478
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:31,760
yourself to your future classmates. Um

479
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,679
so, we really do want you to do exactly

480
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,080
that. Even though only the admissions

481
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:38,000
committee will see the video, we want to

482
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,760
hear how you would give your introduce

483
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,919
yourself when you walked into a Sloan

484
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,760
classroom in a year. Um you want to use

485
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,600
your best judgment here, right? So,

486
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,360
while only the admissions committee is

487
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,280
seeing it and you're quote unquote

488
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,360
introducing yourself to classmates, you

489
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,799
want to be professional and um as well.

490
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,120
So, you want to kind of keep that in

491
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:57,360
mind. Keep it simple. Don't do anything

492
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,360
that you feel uncomfortable doing. Some

493
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,280
people shoot these videos outside or

494
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,440
while they're doing one of their um you

495
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,039
know, favorite pastimes or hobbies. You

496
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,720
absolutely can do that, but don't feel

497
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:09,280
pressured to do that. We also have

498
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,880
really fantastic videos where people are

499
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,280
just sitting in front of a camera like I

500
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,600
am right now and answering the question

501
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,760
um and introducing themselves. The video

502
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,480
really should be an opportunity for you

503
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,799
to share a little bit about who you are,

504
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,559
why you're at MIT Sloan, right? Because

505
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:27,440
you're introducing yourself to those

506
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:29,200
future classmates. Um and you know what

507
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,200
brings you there, right? So it's kind of

508
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,440
like your elevator fit, excuse me, your

509
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,760
elevator pitch to your future friends is

510
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,760
a good way to kind of think about it. um

511
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,520
you want to tell a little bit more about

512
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,440
what else is not in your application

513
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:44,000
already. So this isn't a time to kind of

514
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,200
go through your resume um or talk about

515
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,720
things that are you know not

516
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,320
particularly good in your application or

517
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,160
things that areas of concern. We there's

518
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,000
plenty of um space for that within the

519
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,919
written application but the video

520
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,440
statement is a really great time for you

521
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:59,280
to show us your communication skills.

522
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,320
Speaking of communication skills, we

523
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:04,480
have a second video question now. Uh

524
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:07,120
this was introduced in the MBA

525
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:10,080
application last year. It is required

526
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:12,080
for all applicants to submit. This video

527
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,160
question two appears when in the

528
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,000
application on the left hand side you

529
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,160
will see that it will appear after

530
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,640
you've finished about 80% of the

531
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,320
application. Um and what happens is

532
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,000
you'll have some you know testing to

533
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,400
make sure all of your camera and your

534
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,400
microphones are working. Um but after

535
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,080
you do that you'll have a a randomly

536
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,400
generated question will appear on the

537
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,160
screen. um you'll have 10 seconds to

538
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,919
think about an answer and then the

539
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,559
camera will automatically turn on. So

540
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:40,559
unlike video, the video statement where

541
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,880
you're recording it and uploading it.

542
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:45,120
This is part of the application and once

543
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,600
you hit start, that's it. There's no

544
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,760
re-recording it. Um you can't go back

545
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,200
and redo it afterwards. So, you know,

546
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,960
this is really something that you want

547
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,120
to make sure that you're sitting at your

548
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,679
computer and you're ready to go. So, the

549
00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:01,039
questions are very open-ended. They

550
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:02,960
don't require any prior preparation. Um,

551
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:04,160
an example of a question might be, tell

552
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,360
us about a time that you were

553
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:10,080
disappointed by a teammate or tell us

554
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:12,080
about a time that you disagreed with

555
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:15,360
someone. Um, and we're really just

556
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:17,039
looking for for you to communicate the

557
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,480
answer. It doesn't have to be the

558
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,840
perfect answer. So, I don't want you to

559
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,919
go to bed that night and think, "Oh my

560
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,600
goodness, I had a better example that I

561
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,160
should have shared in video question

562
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:28,400
two." That is not our intent here. The

563
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:31,280
intent is really for us to understand

564
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,840
how you communicate those um those

565
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,760
thoughts on kind of you know a a quick a

566
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,679
quick turnaround.

567
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,640
So we're assessing those competencies

568
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,640
that we talked about in the

569
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:44,960
communication skill. There's no right or

570
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:47,120
wrong answer to video question two

571
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,120
recommendation letter. You're required

572
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,919
to submit only one letter of

573
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,600
recommendation for the MBA application.

574
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:55,120
So you need to think very carefully

575
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,200
about who you want to ask for that

576
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,039
letter of recommendation. On the right

577
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,880
hand side here in the blue box, light

578
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:03,039
blue box, you'll see the questions that

579
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:06,000
we specifically ask the recommener to

580
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:08,720
respond to within their letter. Um so

581
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,480
think about who can answer these most

582
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:14,880
effectively and most favorably for you.

583
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,799
Um and ask that person. Make sure you're

584
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,679
asking them early. the letter of

585
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:22,240
recommendation is due in as part of your

586
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,760
application by the deadline date. And so

587
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,280
for that reason, you want to make sure

588
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,559
that they're getting it submitted and

589
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,480
that if they have any issues with

590
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,559
getting it uploaded to our system, we

591
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,400
can help them out with that. Um, in

592
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:34,320
order to get your recommenders

593
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,240
information, get their letter, you have

594
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,240
to go into the application, you input

595
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,159
their information into the application,

596
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,480
and we will send them a unique link

597
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,400
where they can upload their letter

598
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,080
directly. So, you should not be writing

599
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,760
their letter for them. you should not be

600
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,159
involved in the upload of that letter

601
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,799
whatsoever. Um, all of that will happen

602
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,640
directly through the application.

603
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,760
And if you have additional people that

604
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,600
want to write you letters of

605
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:00,000
recommendation, you do have the

606
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,840
opportunity to include them uh their

607
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,400
name and contact information as two of

608
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:06,640
your professional references. Those

609
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,640
professional references you are people

610
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,520
that we may contact during the

611
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,520
admissions process um to ask additional

612
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:16,480
questions similar to what's written

613
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:18,799
here. um but we will not be asking them

614
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:21,120
for a formal letter. So again, it's just

615
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:23,039
one letter of recommendation. Um and we

616
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,400
do ask that you kind of abide by that

617
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:26,159
because that is what we ask all

618
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,600
applicants for. So in fairness, one

619
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,760
letter of recommendation is considered

620
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,520
for everyone.

621
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,880
And here's the information about the

622
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:36,799
additional references. Um we may contact

623
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,960
them, we may not. So if we do contact

624
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,320
them, we will find a mutually convenient

625
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,400
time. We'll send them an email and see

626
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:45,600
if there's a time that we can schedule

627
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,600
um a call with them.

628
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:50,640
All right, the organizational chart. The

629
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,400
organizational chart is really a a

630
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,200
visual snapshot for the admissions

631
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,919
committee of where you fall within your

632
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:00,480
current organization. So, we want a

633
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,799
one-page visual. So, this is intended

634
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,880
for you to create. It is not intended

635
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:07,520
for you to go on the HR website and

636
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,440
print out, you know, the team um org

637
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,280
chart. We're really looking for you to

638
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:14,400
create a visual for us. We want to

639
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,919
understand within your unit, within your

640
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,679
department, within your organization,

641
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,679
depending on how big it is, you know,

642
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:22,799
where do you fall, who are you reporting

643
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:24,799
to, who are your peers, who reports into

644
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,080
you, if anyone, do you have a dotted

645
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,919
line to anyone? Does anyone have a

646
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,760
dotted line to you? These are all great

647
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,760
examples of things that you might want

648
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,159
to showcase within the within the org

649
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:36,080
chart. The idea is that, you know, we're

650
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:38,480
seeing who you're working with on a

651
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,720
daily basis. We do have some really

652
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,960
great examples that are available on our

653
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,480
website in the FAQ section. I believe

654
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,240
they're also linked within the

655
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,720
application so you can see what those

656
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:51,440
look like. Um, we would like that you

657
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,360
circle yourself in red so we can easily

658
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,760
identify where you are on the

659
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:58,000
organizational chart. Um, you can also

660
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,600
if you have any of your recommener your

661
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,280
recommener or any of your references

662
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,600
fall within the org chart, you can

663
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:05,360
identify them in a certain way. We've

664
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,200
seen some really creative org charts

665
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,919
that have been very helpful to give us

666
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,679
that visual and really understand how uh

667
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:14,880
the reporting structure within your job

668
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:17,440
works. It is not intended to count up

669
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,279
direct reports by any means. You are not

670
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,960
required to be a manager. You are not

671
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:23,039
required to have any direct reports to

672
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,600
apply to the MBA program. So it is

673
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:27,520
definitely not that. Um it is really

674
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,480
just an understanding of where you are

675
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:32,159
visually. With regards to folks that are

676
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,000
in the consulting field, we often get

677
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,679
this question. Um, if you're in

678
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,919
consulting, you can give us a

679
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:40,000
organizational chart of a more recent

680
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,600
project that you've worked on. Um, and

681
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,520
you can showcase people from the client

682
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,279
or people from your firm, whatever makes

683
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,240
sense um, based on that. And then

684
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:50,559
similarly with anyone um, that might be

685
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,960
a a military veteran, if you've held a

686
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:54,799
civilian job, you are welcome to submit

687
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,559
that as well um, as for your

688
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:59,520
organizational chart. completely depends

689
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:01,679
on you know what your preference is. Um

690
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:03,360
other thing to note we al often get the

691
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,279
question of what about confidential

692
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:07,760
information do I need to put people's

693
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:09,840
names titles etc on the org chart? No

694
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,279
you can absolutely redact confidential

695
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,200
information. You don't need to include

696
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:15,279
people's names maybe just include

697
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,360
people's titles. It really is up to you

698
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:19,520
on you know your comfort level as well

699
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,279
as your company's comfort level on what

700
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:24,760
information you'd be sharing there on

701
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:24,760
the ORC chart.

702
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:30,159
All right, test scores. So, the GMAT,

703
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,000
either the focus edition, which is the

704
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:33,520
current GMAT that you can take now, or

705
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,200
the 10th edition that you could have

706
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,679
taken a couple years back, but the

707
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:40,720
scores are still valid, or a GRE score

708
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:44,159
is required for all applicants applying

709
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:46,159
to the MBA program. Um, we accept all

710
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,600
formats of all of the exams. So, you

711
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,640
could have taken it online, you could

712
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,960
have taken it in person. Um, whichever

713
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,880
test you take, what whichever format you

714
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,360
take is completely fine with us and we

715
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,799
have no preference. Um, I know we're

716
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,880
going to get questions about this, so I

717
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:04,000
will just address it now. We will not be

718
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:06,000
having a test waiver for this year. Uh,

719
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,919
we did have that during COVID and we've

720
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,400
h held on to it for a few years, but we

721
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:12,799
are seeing more and more people having

722
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:15,679
access to that test and having access to

723
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:18,400
getting um, a GMAT or a GRE, especially

724
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:20,480
online over the last few cycles. And for

725
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:23,440
that reason, every applicant will be

726
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:27,600
required to submit a test score as part

727
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:28,880
of their application this year.

728
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,480
So the next thing that we will be

729
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,320
considering when we think about that

730
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,559
demonstrated success that I was talking

731
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:37,039
about are your academic records and your

732
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:39,120
relevant coursework. So we need you to

733
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:42,159
submit all of your transcripts from your

734
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:44,159
prior institution. So, for undergrad, if

735
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:46,720
you studied abroad or if you had

736
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:49,360
transfer credits, you need transcripts

737
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,919
from all of those sources to be uploaded

738
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,840
to your application. Um, so we will ask

739
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:55,840
for them if they are missing. So, just

740
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,440
keep that in mind. Um, sometimes it can

741
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,880
be hard or take a little bit of time to

742
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,880
get some of those applications, so you

743
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,679
just want to start doing the leg work uh

744
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:05,440
now if needed. If you're currently in a

745
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:08,240
graduate program or you're currently

746
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:10,960
pursuing some other degree, upload your

747
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:13,039
most recent transcript. Transcripts do

748
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,279
not need to be official at this point.

749
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:18,000
You can upload unofficial transcripts to

750
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:19,840
the application. Just make sure that we

751
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,080
can read them. So, when you upload them

752
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:24,720
to the to your application, open that

753
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:26,480
PDF and make sure it's legible. If you

754
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,240
can't read it, I can assure you we

755
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,960
cannot read it. So, it's really really

756
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,799
important um that you check that. And

757
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,960
then you also have the opportunity to

758
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:37,200
tell us about any coursework that you've

759
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:40,320
taken, any professional certificates. So

760
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:43,760
if you've taken um any Corsera courses

761
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:45,120
or if you've taken MBA math um or any

762
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,640
Python classes, I'm just giving some

763
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:50,480
examples of things that I've recently

764
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:52,559
seen or you know if you um you did your

765
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,399
CPA, you could put all of that

766
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:56,720
information in there. We're really

767
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:58,960
curious and understanding you know what

768
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:03,399
you what is interesting to you and also

769
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,399
what you have pursued post undergrad.

770
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,760
So we have a short answer question um in

771
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,760
the application and it's called the

772
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:14,240
world that shaped you and within this

773
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:16,399
question we are asking you how is the

774
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:19,840
world that you come from shaped who you

775
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:21,760
are today. So curiously, we want to know

776
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,480
um you know, did your culture, your

777
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:26,880
family, your community, what about you

778
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:29,120
shaped the aspects of your identity? And

779
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,799
tell us a little bit more. We really

780
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,799
love this short answer question because

781
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:35,279
it's an opportunity to get to know you

782
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:36,720
as an applicant more than other parts of

783
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:38,960
your application that are really focused

784
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,559
on your academics and professionals,

785
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:43,279
professional successes. And this is

786
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:45,919
about you specifically. So it is limited

787
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:48,240
just to words. We do not want any links

788
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:50,240
or videos part as part of this. It's I

789
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,559
believe it's 250 words that you will be

790
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,080
typing in um and responding to this

791
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:56,000
question but it's a really great

792
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,760
opportunity for you to share something

793
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,240
that we cannot find elsewhere in the

794
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:02,240
application.

795
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,919
So those are all the components and now

796
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,799
I just I'm going to briefly talk about

797
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:08,480
the interview. So as I indicated at the

798
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:10,240
beginning if you are invited for an

799
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,399
interview you will get an email to

800
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,559
schedule that zoom interview. It will be

801
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:16,720
a 30 minute Zoom interview with a member

802
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:18,960
of the admissions committee. Before the

803
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:21,360
interview, you will get um prompted to

804
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,520
respond to two additional short answer

805
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:25,919
questions which we'll share at that time

806
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:28,399
and you must have those submitted um at

807
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:30,640
least 24 hours before the uh scheduled

808
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:32,880
interview. During the interview, we'll

809
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,960
be asking you a series of questions and

810
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,559
we're looking for really specific

811
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,799
examples on how you've handled

812
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:40,159
situations in your professional career.

813
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:42,000
So, as you're putting together your

814
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:43,760
application, you could kind of think

815
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,440
about what have my successes been, where

816
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:48,240
are things that I want to highlight to

817
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:50,320
show them. How am I a problem solver?

818
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,320
How do I work with others? Like, what

819
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,919
are those um attributes that you really

820
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,760
want to make sure that you're showcasing

821
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:58,000
throughout the application? And, you

822
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,760
know, putting together those a list of

823
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,039
examples that you could put that you

824
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,760
could use both within your written

825
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:05,279
application as well as your interview

826
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,360
because you don't want to be duplicative

827
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:09,200
in both of those things. So, kind of

828
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,440
being mindful about putting together

829
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,440
both um your written application and

830
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,600
then potentially your future um

831
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,679
interview will be really helpful so that

832
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:20,880
you have additional material to share

833
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:22,960
during the interview.

834
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:26,240
So, a couple additional tips before we

835
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:28,159
open it up to questions. Um applying

836
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,320
early, I talked about earlier, you know,

837
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:32,000
applying when you're ready, um is really

838
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,240
important, but if you're if you're

839
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,919
ready, submit your application. If it's

840
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,919
if it's good to go, you've checked it.

841
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:40,640
you feel really confident, it's okay to

842
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:43,200
hit submit. Um, making sure that you

843
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:45,360
follow the directions. This team that's

844
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,679
all on in the background today have read

845
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,600
this application. We've developed it. We

846
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:52,080
have really been thoughtful about how

847
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,120
the uh instructions are written and why

848
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,039
they are written the way they're

849
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:58,320
written. So, make sure you read them

850
00:30:55,039 --> 00:31:00,080
carefully and follow them. Um, within

851
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:02,720
the application, we really want you to

852
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:04,480
be yourself. We are not looking for

853
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,080
something specific within the

854
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,720
application to, you know, there's no

855
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:10,880
secret sauce, right? So, we're looking

856
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,120
for reasons to admit you. And so, we're

857
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,200
looking for you to advocate for

858
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,039
yourself, help us gather the data that

859
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,360
we need. And because our application is

860
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:22,080
lean, my best piece of advice is don't

861
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,520
think about it as one each individual

862
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,520
component. You really want to think

863
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:28,000
about it as a whole. So once you've put

864
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:30,000
together all of the materials, look at

865
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,520
it and say, "Hey, is there any, you

866
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,679
know, holes here?" Like, am I not

867
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:35,520
explaining something or am I not

868
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:37,600
showcasing one of those competencies

869
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:39,200
that I was hoping to showcase? Um, and

870
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,559
then you can kind of go back and rework

871
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,240
it. Maybe it makes sense to include it

872
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:44,240
in your resume. Maybe it makes sense to

873
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,760
include it in your cover letter. Um, you

874
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,000
really need to think about all of those

875
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:50,799
components together and how they're

876
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,399
showcasing you as an applicant. Um, but

877
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:54,799
we're really excited to consider you for

878
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:57,039
admission and um, you know, hopefully

879
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:59,200
putting together a really thoughtful and

880
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:02,159
meaningful application will showcase all

881
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:04,880
of that to the admissions committee.

882
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:07,120
So, at this time, I'm happy to take any

883
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,799
questions that have come in. I think

884
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,640
Katherine from our team is going to pop

885
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:14,159
on and I know they've been answering

886
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:15,919
questions in the background. So, any big

887
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:16,720
areas that people have lots of questions

888
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:18,640
about?

889
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,640
>> Yeah. Um, we've had a few questions

890
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,480
around folks who have maybe recently

891
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,000
transitioned in their role or gone to a

892
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,840
new company. What are your

893
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,159
recommendations for, you know, choosing

894
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,919
their recommener, submitting an org

895
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:32,080
chart, things like that?

896
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:33,600
>> Yeah, great questions. So, when we're

897
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,440
thinking about recommenders, we are

898
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,919
always looking for professional letters

899
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,960
of recommendation. Um, that being said,

900
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:41,039
whether you've just changed

901
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,320
organizations or whether you just aren't

902
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:44,240
telling your employer that you're going

903
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,919
to apply to business school are all

904
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,559
valid reasons that you might not want to

905
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:50,320
ask your current boss um for a letter of

906
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:52,159
recommendation and that is completely

907
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,760
fine. We we see that all the time and we

908
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:56,000
completely understand it. So, I would

909
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:58,240
say asking someone um from your prior

910
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,399
job that could speak to your skill set

911
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,399
is completely acceptable and we will

912
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:04,480
understand that. With regards to your

913
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:06,000
org chart, you should be submitting the

914
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,159
visual or excuse me that yeah, the

915
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,200
visual representation of the org that

916
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:13,840
you are currently in at the time of your

917
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:16,399
um application. So, if you started a new

918
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:19,279
job on September 1, uh, and you're

919
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:21,120
applying on September 28th for the 29th

920
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:23,200
deadline, I want to see your new

921
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,960
organization because by the time we get

922
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,399
to the interview, you will have been

923
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,159
there for a number of months and we'll

924
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:29,519
we want that visual of where you've been

925
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:31,360
so that we can understand a little bit

926
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:33,760
more about, you know, what that new role

927
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:35,360
has looked like. So, hopefully, did I

928
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,519
get the all of the questions, Katherine?

929
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,799
I

930
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,840
>> think so. Thank you.

931
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:39,440
>> Okay.

932
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:41,360
>> Um, another question for the relevant

933
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,679
courses section. And if someone has a a

934
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,519
wide variety of STEM courses and that

935
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:47,440
fit, should they list them all or how

936
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:49,600
would they choose?

937
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:52,320
>> Yeah, so you should limit it. I believe

938
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:55,679
there's you can only upload three, maybe

939
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:57,440
four um per subject matter. Um but

940
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:00,320
really, you know, focus in on the ones

941
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,919
that are like like 100% of that class

942
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:05,279
was focused on that subject matter. If

943
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:07,440
you touched upon um you know, economics

944
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:09,520
for 5% of the class, it's okay to not

945
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,280
list that. Um, we are going to be

946
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,879
looking at your transcripts as well. So,

947
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,879
it's not one or the other, right? So,

948
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:16,480
the the relevant coursework is really

949
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:18,079
just kind of a quick snapshot for us,

950
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,760
but then we will be getting and digging

951
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:21,679
into every class that you take within

952
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,480
your transcripts.

953
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:25,760
>> Thank you. Um, another question, um,

954
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,119
what are the common mistakes that you

955
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,960
see applicants make? And I know you went

956
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:31,919
over this a little bit, but in the cover

957
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:34,960
letter and then also in their videos.

958
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:36,720
>> Yeah. Um, common mistakes are being

959
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,639
duplicative. Certainly, I feel like

960
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:40,720
people aren't using the real estate on

961
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:43,200
the application to their best of their

962
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:45,440
abilities. So, certainly, you know,

963
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:47,359
repeating your resume or repeating the

964
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,359
example that you already had in your

965
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:51,440
cover letter within that video

966
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:54,079
statement, you have 60 seconds to tell

967
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:57,200
us more to give us more information

968
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:59,280
about who you are as an individual. Um,

969
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,880
and that's really kind of a downfall

970
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,440
when people don't don't take advantage

971
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:05,440
of that. With regards to the resume, I

972
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,040
will say the formatting issue that I

973
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,839
kind of highlighted earlier is the

974
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:12,320
biggest one for me. Um, not being able

975
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:13,760
to find information I think can be a

976
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:17,280
struggle for the admissions committee

977
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:19,280
when we're kind of there's a lot of um,

978
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,599
visual clutter if you will. So like

979
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,359
colors and pictures and we can't find

980
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:25,440
the information quickly that we're

981
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:27,119
looking for. So really trying to avoid

982
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:30,079
that and focusing on just like a

983
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:32,079
standard format.

984
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:33,359
>> Great. Thank you. And then a number of

985
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:35,280
questions around is there any

986
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:37,520
disadvantage in applying in later rounds

987
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,839
or do you have a suggestion?

988
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:41,839
>> Um so there's no disadvantage to

989
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:43,920
applying in later rounds aside from what

990
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:45,920
I was saying with just simple math,

991
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:48,400
right? CL like there have seats have

992
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:50,560
been committed um by round two and round

993
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,640
three. That being said, round two and

994
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:54,960
round one are pretty equal in terms of

995
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:57,599
the size of of applicants as well as

996
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:00,640
admins. Round three is significantly

997
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:03,760
smaller. Um so I certainly encourage you

998
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:06,400
to apply in rounds one or round two. Um

999
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:08,480
and certainly for international admits I

1000
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,480
would say you know definitely not round

1001
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:13,040
three because by then we if you do need

1002
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,160
to get a visa appointment to come um to

1003
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,839
the United States you want to be

1004
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:18,160
starting that as soon as possible once

1005
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:20,320
you've committed to the program. Um we

1006
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:22,079
also have admit days for round one and

1007
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:24,240
round two. So, it's a really great

1008
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,920
opportunity to come and visit us and

1009
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:28,880
learn a little bit more about the

1010
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:30,880
program and and who we are at Sloan. Um,

1011
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:33,359
the other thing that I can just add is,

1012
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,960
you know, uh the weight listing process.

1013
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:37,520
So, if you are weight listed either

1014
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:39,920
without an interview or after an

1015
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:42,000
interview, you will continue to be

1016
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,960
assessed in this in subsequent rounds.

1017
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,200
So, the earlier round that you apply in,

1018
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:49,839
the more you're going to be looked at um

1019
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:52,720
by the admissions committee.

1020
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:53,920
>> Great. Thank you. Um, another question

1021
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,079
and then we get this a lot from

1022
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,359
consultants. Um, who should they use and

1023
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:59,040
how should they approach the

1024
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:00,560
organizational chart?

1025
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:03,119
>> Okay. I think I just talked about this

1026
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:04,960
but I can I'll talk about it again. Um,

1027
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,560
if you are a consultant you can talk

1028
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,320
about a recent project that you did

1029
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,920
within your organizational chart. So you

1030
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:12,480
don't want to do like you know if you

1031
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:14,560
work at McKenzie you don't need to do an

1032
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,480
organizational chart of McKenzie. Do a

1033
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:18,640
recent project that you worked on. So

1034
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,480
who did you work with at the client? who

1035
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:22,960
you know was your counterpart were did

1036
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:25,040
you have other um analysts or associates

1037
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,560
that were working with you from

1038
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,000
Mackenzie I'm just using Mackenzie as an

1039
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:30,240
example you can be at any consulting

1040
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,320
firm but um really just kind of

1041
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,839
showcasing that within your

1042
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:37,599
organizational chart is completely

1043
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:39,359
sufficient in what we commonly see

1044
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:42,400
>> and quick easy question are folks

1045
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:44,160
allowed to self-report their test scores

1046
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,520
>> yes that is a great question and thank

1047
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,440
you for bringing it up yes you can

1048
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:50,000
self-report your test scores so if you

1049
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,920
took the test the day before uh the

1050
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,000
deadline, you can absolutely just put

1051
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,520
those right in there. Um, keep in mind,

1052
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,760
we are not going to be asking for those

1053
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:59,359
official scores to be reported to us

1054
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,040
until you're admitted and then we would

1055
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:03,680
do the verification process down the

1056
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:05,200
line. So, you can self-report um and

1057
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:07,119
we're happy to take it that way. They

1058
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,359
would just of of course need to match uh

1059
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:11,839
down the line. One other thing I want to

1060
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:13,599
note is you are not to supercore any

1061
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:15,440
tests. So, you can submit as many test

1062
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:17,119
scores as you want, but you cannot pick

1063
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,800
and choose like you can't cherrypick

1064
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:21,119
like a high quant score from here and a

1065
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:24,240
high verbal score from here. But you can

1066
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:26,640
give us your all of those scores um in

1067
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,720
in a list and we will we will see what

1068
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:31,040
those highest scores were for your quant

1069
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:33,280
section or your verbal section.

1070
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,480
>> Perfect. Thanks. Um another question and

1071
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,240
you may have touched on this a little

1072
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,400
bit. I know you did. Um but could you

1073
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:40,880
expand more on the short answer question

1074
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:43,200
on the the world that shaped you?

1075
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,800
>> Sure. So, this was a um optional

1076
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,040
question a few years ago and then we

1077
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,599
made it required as of last year for all

1078
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:51,440
of our applications for MIT Sloan. Um

1079
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:53,839
and we've found that it's a really just

1080
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:55,839
great way to learn more about applicants

1081
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:58,880
above and beyond their academics and

1082
00:38:55,839 --> 00:39:00,800
their professional successes. Um you

1083
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:03,440
know, which is what the rest of the

1084
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,880
application is focused on. So, um it's a

1085
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,680
little bit more to get to know who you

1086
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:09,200
are um as an individual and share a

1087
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:11,680
little bit more about what makes you,

1088
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:14,880
you know, um who you are and why you're

1089
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:16,160
kind of pursuing um an MBA. I mean,

1090
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,760
everyone shares something different. It

1091
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:20,320
really depends on, you know, what your

1092
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,160
your situation is or who you are. Again,

1093
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,280
the world that shaped you. So, if it's

1094
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,720
unique to everyone, we're not looking

1095
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:28,560
for anything specific. We're just hoping

1096
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:30,400
to get to know you a little bit better.

1097
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:32,640
>> Thanks. And I know we've answered a lot

1098
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,960
of questions, so just

1099
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:37,119
looking through the list. Um I guess I

1100
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:39,040
I've seen it a couple of times. I I know

1101
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:40,160
um could you touch on if we have a

1102
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,240
number of years that we're looking for

1103
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:43,520
for years of work experience or if you

1104
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,520
have a little bit lower, you know, how

1105
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:47,119
that impacts you as an applicant?

1106
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:49,520
>> Yeah, that's a good question. So on

1107
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:51,440
average, we have of our MBA program has

1108
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,839
five years of full-time work experience

1109
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,599
coming in. It ranges from about two to

1110
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:57,920
three years all the way up to like seven

1111
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:59,520
or eight years. Um but again, those are

1112
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,280
averages. So, there are people that fall

1113
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,720
without outside of those averages.

1114
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,320
Sometimes there are people with nine or

1115
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,880
10 years of experience coming into the

1116
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:08,720
2-year MBA program. Sometimes there are

1117
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:11,280
people at that 2-year mark coming into

1118
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:14,320
the MBA program. Um, we are not really

1119
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:17,200
seeing anyone below the 2-year mark. So,

1120
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:19,440
that's just not as common. Um, we are

1121
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:21,280
looking for people that have had, you

1122
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,560
know, enough significant work experience

1123
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,560
to be able to contribute in the

1124
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,720
classroom. And we have seen time over

1125
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:28,720
time with anyone with lower years of

1126
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:31,839
work experience that you know they don't

1127
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:33,839
get as much of uh as much out of the MBA

1128
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:35,760
experience than those with the with the

1129
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:38,640
experience the professional experience

1130
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:40,480
before joining.

1131
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:42,000
>> Thank you. Um and I know you probably

1132
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,520
touched on this as well but a couple of

1133
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,040
questions around the professional

1134
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:47,359
experience section of the application

1135
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:49,359
and the CV. What are you looking for if

1136
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:51,599
anything differently in those?

1137
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:54,079
>> Yeah, so they actually should be mirrors

1138
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:56,160
of one another. one another. So, within

1139
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:57,839
the employment widget, which is the the

1140
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,839
kind of the popup window that comes up

1141
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:03,040
in the application, you want to be

1142
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:04,880
putting in um your main job there first.

1143
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:07,359
And there's a but a button that you can

1144
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:09,920
click that says primary or you know main

1145
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:12,720
employer. So, if you are on an

1146
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:14,319
internship, externship, secondment, you

1147
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,839
want to be putting who your main

1148
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:18,079
employer is, who you're going to be

1149
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:20,560
going back to. And then as the second

1150
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:22,880
thing you can put your secundment or for

1151
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:24,000
your second one your prior roles and

1152
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,400
things like that. I think you can list

1153
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
up to three employers there. We want to

1154
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,079
see that match the dates and the

1155
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,040
timelines from your resume. Certainly

1156
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:34,640
you might have more on your resume. Um

1157
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:36,960
but certainly you know you want to be

1158
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,800
filling out that widget in that area of

1159
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,520
your application to give us a little bit

1160
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,760
more detail that might not be in the the

1161
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:46,079
resume. It also is your opportunity to

1162
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:47,680
explain the company or explain your

1163
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:49,200
function within the company, your role

1164
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:51,200
within the company that you don't

1165
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:53,760
necessarily do on the onepage resume

1166
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:56,160
where you're focusing in more on impact.

1167
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:58,480
So on the, you know, employment section,

1168
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:01,040
we're really able to see what does this

1169
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:03,520
company do, what do you do, how many

1170
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:05,680
people like work within the company, uh

1171
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:08,000
just more information like that, whereas

1172
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:10,800
the real estate on your onepage resume

1173
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,160
is really focused in on your successes.

1174
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,680
>> Thank you. I think we have time for

1175
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:16,160
maybe one more question and I've seen

1176
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,520
this come up a bit. So, um, and when

1177
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,880
we're reviewing applications, do we

1178
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,160
distinguish at all between someone who's

1179
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:22,319
an international applicant versus

1180
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:24,560
someone who's a domestic applicant?

1181
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:26,560
>> Absolutely not. Um, everyone is

1182
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:28,800
considered exactly the same. So, that's

1183
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:30,800
the same with regards to your prembba

1184
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:33,040
industry, with regards to your

1185
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:35,440
undergraduate studies, with regards to

1186
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:37,359
your citizenship, all of that. Everyone

1187
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:40,000
is considered exactly the same. And we

1188
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:42,160
are so excited to build um a really

1189
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:45,599
diverse and thought you know in thought

1190
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:49,200
and experience and perspective um class

1191
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:49,200
for the MBA cohort. I
