1
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:15,480
okay so uh we're going to continue our

2
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,640
discussion today of redistribution and

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,960
fairness remember we talked about how

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,000
most of this class was just about

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,439
efficiency and we had that that simple

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,720
measure of welfare which just adding

7
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,320
consumer and produce a surplus we talked

8
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,759
last time about why that might not be

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,679
the right measure and while how we can

10
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:33,320
actually do interpersonal comparisons in

11
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,680
economics how it can move beyond the

12
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:38,239
simple addition of consumer producer

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,360
Surplus to richer interpersonal

14
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,320
comparisons using a social welfare

15
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:45,039
function and then we talked about the

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,640
inherent Equity efficiency tradeoff we

17
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,360
went through a model that Illustrated

18
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,640
the inefficiencies that come from the

19
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,800
Leaky bucket and we started and you

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,680
finish in section an example how you can

21
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,399
put that all together how you can take

22
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,519
the concept of leaky bucket together

23
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:01,519
with the concept of social welfare and

24
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:03,600
use it to decide if a given

25
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:05,880
redistribution raises social welfare or

26
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,799
lowers it in other words is the benefit

27
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:11,680
of redistributing the P worth shrinking

28
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,119
the P that's what it comes down to okay

29
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,080
we know how to maximize the size of the

30
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,040
pi we learned that you know we're done

31
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,880
with that we're done with perfect

32
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,119
competition we know how to maximize the

33
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,200
size of the pi the question is is it

34
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:24,400
worth shrinking the pi to redistribute

35
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,759
the resources now what I want to talk

36
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,680
about today is how we do it in practice

37
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,920
what do we do in practice to actually

38
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,360
redistribute money in the US and like I

39
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:36,240
said we have two

40
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,119
forms two two potential leaks in the

41
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:43,200
bucket two two steps toing to

42
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:45,399
redistributing money one is to tax the

43
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,000
people who have the resources and the

44
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:50,479
other is to transfer money to those who

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,640
don't so I want to talk today about both

46
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:55,439
sides of that equation once again doing

47
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,840
what I do in about 12 lectures in 1441

48
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,880
in one lecture here at a very broad

49
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,159
level to understand how Taxation and

50
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,719
transfers work in our country and how in

51
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,680
practice we

52
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:08,800
implement the idea of of of

53
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:11,319
redistributing uh social wealth let's

54
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:16,000
start with figure 231 the figures today

55
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:18,840
all be from my textbook figure 231 shows

56
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,480
how we raise money in America this is a

57
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:24,239
simple pie chart so about 37% of the

58
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,720
money we raise in America is from

59
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:29,280
individual income taxes that's the taxes

60
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,480
you fire file every April 15th you

61
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,040
probably haven't much yet but you will

62
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,080
when you're grownups the next biggest is

63
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,480
social security

64
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,319
contributions these are what we call

65
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,879
payroll taxes these differ from income

66
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:44,959
taxes in that you don't pay it on your

67
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,120
income at the end of the year you pay it

68
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,599
on your earnings as the year goes on if

69
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,280
you've ever earned money you'll see

70
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:53,120
there's a line on your stub called f or

71
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,800
another another one called Medicare

72
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,560
these are our federal payroll

73
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,599
contributions and that is the second

74
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,720
biggest source of Revenue the third

75
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:03,280
biggest source of Revenue is consumption

76
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:06,000
taxes mostly state sales

77
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,440
taxes but also excise taxes on things

78
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,879
like alcohol and cigarettes that's

79
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:14,120
specific taxes on alcohol cigarettes and

80
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:16,400
gas the fourth biggest is the property

81
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,280
tax which is basically tax you pay on

82
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,720
the value of your

83
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:23,239
house uh and the fifth biggest besides

84
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,480
the other actually sixth biggest after

85
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:28,959
other is a corporate income tax we only

86
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:31,280
raise one in every $20 in America from

87
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,000
tax Incorporation

88
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,519
think about that look at this graph we

89
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,840
raise 37% for income taxes 25% Social

90
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:41,560
Security contributions 177% for

91
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:45,319
consumption taxes all taxes that fall on

92
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,879
the average Joe and 5% from the taxes we

93
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:48,799
raise on

94
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,239
corporations how should we feel about

95
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,439
that should that make us irate that

96
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:55,040
we're favoring corporations or not it

97
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:58,040
turns out the answer is not

98
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:01,000
obvious because to understand the answer

99
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:03,879
we need to when we talk about

100
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,400
taxation we need to think

101
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:09,319
about the fairness of the whole tax

102
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,560
system or what we call an economics the

103
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:14,879
incidence of

104
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:18,040
taxes who actually Bears the tax and it

105
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:20,720
turns out this chart is very

106
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,520
misleading because it turns out the

107
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,240
party that sends the money to the

108
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,680
government is not necessarily the party

109
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,919
that actually Bears the burden of the

110
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,000
tax which is sort of weird right I've

111
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:30,759
just you say well how can that be

112
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,960
they're sending the money to the

113
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:36,320
government and the answer is it ignores

114
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:39,919
the fact that the market reacts to

115
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:42,280
Taxation and that incidence is about who

116
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,720
ultimately Bears the burden after the

117
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,759
market has

118
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,440
responded so we're going to Define

119
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:51,039
economic incidence of a

120
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:54,039
tax as the difference in an individual's

121
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:56,320
resources before and after a tax is

122
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:58,199
imposed the economic incidence is not

123
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,919
the amount they send to the government

124
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:04,160
it's the difference in their resources

125
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:06,520
from before to after the tax is imposed

126
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,560
and we'll see that can end up being very

127
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:13,000
different the amount than the check they

128
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,000
actually write to understand

129
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:19,199
why let's look

130
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:22,120
at figure

131
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,759
232 figure 232 is an example of a market

132
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:27,160
the market for gas gas is a market we

133
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:28,759
have a specific excise tax on gas a

134
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,520
certain amount per gallon there's a

135
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:32,240
federal excise tax and States layer

136
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,840
excise tax on top of

137
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,720
that so let's start by thinking about

138
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,880
the market for gas Standard supply and

139
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,560
demand model you've got the quantity of

140
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,520
gas on the x- axis the price of gas on

141
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,960
the y- axis and this in this highly

142
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,520
out-of-date graph that clearly needs to

143
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:49,280
be updated I've got us selling 100

144
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:52,680
billion gallons of gas at a150 a gallon

145
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,680
my fantasies of past life okay so

146
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,639
imagine we're initially in that

147
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,080
equilibrium and remember that is the

148
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,800
equilibrium remember definition of

149
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,080
equilibrium that makes both producers

150
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:04,720
and consumers happy producers are

151
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:07,319
willing to sell 100 billion gallons at

152
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:10,240
$150 a gallon consumers are willing to

153
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:12,360
buy 100 billion gallons of a150 a gallon

154
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:18,000
the Market's in

155
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:21,280
equilibrium now imagine that we Levy um

156
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,520
a tax of 50 cents per gallon let's say

157
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,919
we Levy it on the producers of gas let's

158
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:28,440
say we go to the gas companies and say

159
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,360
look for every you rich gas companies

160
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:32,319
oil gas oil companies are making record

161
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,319
profits so we go to them and say you

162
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,560
know what you rich oil and gas companies

163
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,240
for every gallon of gas you sell we're

164
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,599
going to make you send a check for 50

165
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,560
cents to the government because you're

166
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:44,240
making too much money and we want to you

167
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:46,400
know tax you and but not consumers we

168
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,199
want to tax the greedy corporations so

169
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,599
we say 50 cents per gallon you have to

170
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,360
write a check 50 cents per gallon you

171
00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:55,319
sell what does that do to our graph well

172
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,879
think of it from The Producers

173
00:06:55,319 --> 00:07:00,639
perspective what you've done is simply

174
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:02,960
rais their marginal cost

175
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,800
whatever their marginal cost was before

176
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,280
it's now 50 cents per gallon higher

177
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,720
because for every gallon they produce

178
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:12,039
they have to spend 50 cents more paying

179
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:15,000
the government so that acts as a shift

180
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:18,879
inward in their supply

181
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,400
curve in other words the point is before

182
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:25,280
they were happy to

183
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:28,879
provide a 100 billion gallons at

184
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,479
a150 but now if you want to supply 150

185
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:33,400
100 billion gall balance you need to pay

186
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:35,919
them $2 why well because in this

187
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:38,240
perfectly competitive market they were

188
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,319
zero profit before at $150 if they're

189
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,560
sending 50 cents a gall on the

190
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:43,280
government they have to make $2 to be

191
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,800
zero profit now so this is that's what

192
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,919
they'd have to get so we get a shift and

193
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,720
supply and therefore through the

194
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:50,919
adjustment equilibrium we get a new

195
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,560
outcome which is we get a new

196
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:55,560
equilibrium at Point D which is since

197
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:57,680
Supply shifted

198
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:00,400
inward we get a new equilibrium with

199
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:04,440
only 90 billion gallons of gas being

200
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,440
sold at a price of A180 why do we get

201
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,680
there well it's a stand Market

202
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,000
adjustment we've been through already

203
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,440
okay and it could be dollar 80 could be

204
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,599
dollar you know I'm not saying this is

205
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:14,280
the definite answer but it's just an

206
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,680
example of how Market would adjust okay

207
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,800
questions about

208
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:22,720
that just an example how Market would

209
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:26,240
adjust now let's ask what is the burden

210
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:29,560
on producers what is the producer

211
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,479
burdened from this tax well let's just

212
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:34,680
do some simple

213
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:34,680
math the

214
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:42,800
producer

215
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:45,120
um the producer uh used to the producer

216
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,480
used to get a

217
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:51,160
$150

218
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,160
okay so they used to get a

219
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:57,000
$150 now they have to send 50 cents to

220
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:57,000
the

221
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:08,000
government but they now get A180 per

222
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:10,800
gallon so on net their burden is 20

223
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,880
cents that is they are bearing a burden

224
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:16,959
of 20 cents and you could see that if

225
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:22,240
you look at the graph the

226
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:24,760
producer used to get a $150 now they get

227
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,000
A180 so they get 30 cents more a gallon

228
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,720
but they have to send 50 cents to the

229
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,079
government so on net they're out

230
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:35,480
20 on net they're out 20 cents what's

231
00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:36,920
the consumer burden well the consumer

232
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:43,000
used to

233
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:46,480
pay uh the consumer used to now now pays

234
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:50,600
A180 it used to pay consumer used to pay

235
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,600
$150 so their burden is 30

236
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,200
cents you can see that once again in the

237
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:57,760
graph consumers used to pay 150 now they

238
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,600
pay 180 they're not paying 30 cents more

239
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,959
so look at what happened who lost cost

240
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,640
more from this tax consumers or

241
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:05,959
producers

242
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:08,519
consumers we were trying to tax the

243
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:12,399
greedy oil companies but what did we end

244
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:15,320
up doing we ended up making consumers 30

245
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:17,200
cents worse per gallon and producers

246
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:20,519
only 20 cents worse per

247
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:23,120
gallon that is the incidence was not the

248
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:26,519
same as the amount of the check sent in

249
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:30,079
even though the producers sent in a

250
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:31,399
check for 50 cents a gallon

251
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,760
that was offset by the fact they're

252
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:35,279
getting 30 cents more a gallon so a net

253
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,639
they only were out 20 cents a gallon

254
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,519
even though consumers weren't touched in

255
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:39,360
theory the government said I'm not

256
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,519
hurting you consumers in practice

257
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,839
consumers were hurt because consumers

258
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,800
had to pay 30 cents more a gallon and

259
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,880
this is why a graph life figure 231

260
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:51,040
could be

261
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:53,440
misleading because think about

262
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,320
corporations when you tax

263
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,680
corporations some what's going to happen

264
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,880
is the rich Corporation owners will take

265
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:01,240
it but some of it is they'll pass it on

266
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:03,880
to higher prices to Consumers

267
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,160
so it's not like tax in corporations is

268
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,639
purely getting at the rich guys it's

269
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,200
also getting consumers it's not as easy

270
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:10,079
as that graph makes it

271
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,959
look

272
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:14,680
okay

273
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:16,480
now here's something to note let's note

274
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:19,360
the following interesting phenomenon

275
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,360
look at figure 9

276
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:25,360
233

277
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:27,360
imagine that we had instead of taxing

278
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,440
producers we tax consumers the way the

279
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,519
gas tax usually works right the way the

280
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,480
well let's say the no let's say the way

281
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:33,680
the gas tax worked is literally it's

282
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,200
sort of weird but the government said to

283
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,040
you for every gallon you buy I'm going

284
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,560
to make you send me 50 cents it'd be a

285
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,079
weird tax to think about let's imagine

286
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,600
way the tax worked okay is the

287
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,880
government said I'm going to track your

288
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,519
gas purchases and for every gallon you

289
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:48,240
buy I'm going to make you 70 50 cents

290
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:50,519
well now the supply curve doesn't change

291
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,360
marginal cost hasn't change but demand

292
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:56,399
changes consumers used to be willing to

293
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,560
buy 100 billion gallons of $150 but now

294
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,440
their marginal list to pay Falls if they

295
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,480
were indiffer

296
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,720
between paying a150 for the 100

297
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,040
billionth gallon now they have to send

298
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,120
50 cents to the government they're

299
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:10,040
paying a dollar for the billionth gallon

300
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:12,240
they're not willing to pay $150 anymore

301
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:14,000
they're only will paying a dollar why

302
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,600
because that last marginal consumer was

303
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,040
indifferent his marginal willingness to

304
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,279
pay for the 100 billionth gallon was a

305
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,680
$150 that's his total willingness to pay

306
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:22,959
said 50 cents to the government he's

307
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,480
only willing to pay a dollar to the gas

308
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:28,519
company to get that gallon so that's a

309
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:30,440
shift downward in the demand curve the

310
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:34,760
demand curve Shi sh down we get to New

311
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,760
equilibrium with a price of

312
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:39,480
a130 by the way this shift this is just

313
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,800
this is natural this is because the

314
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,920
curves are the

315
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:46,399
same what is the new producer burden did

316
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,040
someone tell me what's the new producer

317
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,079
burden what's the incidence of this even

318
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,800
though producer aren't sending a check

319
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:54,800
to the government what is the incidence

320
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:57,120
of this tax on producers in this

321
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:01,120
case how much worse off our producers

322
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,120
yeah 20 cents why

323
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,120
exactly same person what about consumers

324
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:11,120
how much worse offer

325
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,120
they

326
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,720
because they save 20 cents a gallon but

327
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:21,480
they send a 50 Cent check to the

328
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,639
government right could producers

329
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,639
consumers get a lower price but then

330
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:27,160
they have to send that check to the

331
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,720
government so they wor off 30 cents

332
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,240
producers who weren't involved in this

333
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,320
so was just tax on those greedy

334
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,760
consumers they're getting 20 cents less

335
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:38,600
a gallon too econom economic incidence

336
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:40,519
is not so two points here first it

337
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,760
hammers home the point that economic

338
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:44,040
difference is different than who sends

339
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:47,519
the check but second of all it hammers

340
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:50,399
home the point that it for a given tax

341
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,600
in a given Market it does not matter who

342
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,959
pays the tax this is a profound

343
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:58,600
insight for a given supply and demand

344
00:13:54,959 --> 00:14:00,320
curve and a given total tax it doesn't

345
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:04,399
matter who sends the check

346
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:06,399
in the incident is the same that's very

347
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,199
profound that says it is totally

348
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,959
irrelevant that says politicians are

349
00:14:08,199 --> 00:14:12,519
free to label a tax any way they want

350
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,440
but for a given market and a given size

351
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:16,959
tax consumers and producers end up in

352
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,839
the same position or what we say in

353
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,720
public finances the side of the Market's

354
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:22,560
irrelevant it doesn't matter who

355
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,959
actually sends the check to the

356
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,639
government okay what matters is how big

357
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:30,320
the taxes and what eles are of supply

358
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:32,839
and demand that's incredibly powerful

359
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:35,320
okay my guess is most of you without

360
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:36,839
spending a long time pondering it if I'd

361
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,880
said walking this class doesn't matter

362
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:40,399
if consumers pay the gas tax or oil

363
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,600
companies pay the gas tax you would have

364
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:45,680
said it does matter but it

365
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,160
doesn't it doesn't matter as long as the

366
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,639
tax is the same and the Market's the

367
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:53,480
same questions about that and I've just

368
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,480
blown your mind

369
00:14:55,759 --> 00:15:02,199
yeah you're getting ahead of me hold on

370
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,199
other questions about this

371
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,639
yeah excellent excellent question both

372
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:15,720
great questions that lead to the next

373
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:18,000
point the next point is who Bears the

374
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,680
taxes who actually Bears them well that

375
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,920
it turns out is going to be determined

376
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:25,279
by the elasticities of these curves

377
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:28,120
let's look at figure

378
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:30,120
234 in the first case we have a case of

379
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:32,160
inelastic demand for gas this is

380
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,279
probably right in the very very short

381
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,600
run probably dayto day if the price of

382
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:38,040
gas goes up a lot people don't adjust

383
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,639
their consumption the next day okay so

384
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,360
gas is probably pretty inelastically

385
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:42,959
demanded in the short run well in that

386
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,959
case what happens let's say we tax

387
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:47,759
producers the first example the supply

388
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:51,279
curve shifts

389
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:54,600
up but what happens to price it goes up

390
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:55,639
by the amount of the tax why because

391
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,240
consumers are going to buy the same

392
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:58,279
amount of gas no matter what so you can

393
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,880
just charge them whatever the hell you

394
00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:01,720
want

395
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,720
so who Bears the burden of this tax how

396
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,959
much is on producers and how much is on

397
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:08,959
consumers when demand is

398
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:08,959
inelastic

399
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:15,759
yeah exactly it's all on consumers flip

400
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,600
that around that's good good answer flip

401
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,040
that

402
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,720
around okay now imagine we're in the

403
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,440
very long run where people can you know

404
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,800
shift to bicycles and walk and demand

405
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,079
for gas is super elastic in fact let's

406
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,279
imagine it's perfectly elastic not true

407
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:30,199
but let's imagine it now what happens

408
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:33,720
well we tax the

409
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:35,959
producers but they can't raise the price

410
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:38,560
because demand's perfectly

411
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:39,800
elastic so now who Bears the burden of

412
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,560
the

413
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,519
taxes the

414
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,639
producer the consumer doesn't bear

415
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,839
because if the producer tries to pass

416
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,040
one sent on them they'll just stop

417
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,839
buying

418
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:52,560
gas so the producer has to Bear it all

419
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:54,639
so what determines who Bears the taxes

420
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,319
is

421
00:16:54,639 --> 00:17:01,480
elasticities and basically the bottom

422
00:16:57,319 --> 00:17:05,319
line is those who

423
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:07,799
are the most elastic will be the best at

424
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:09,240
avoiding taxes this is not the right

425
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:12,400
intuition but here's how I think about

426
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,799
it I think of like negotiating power

427
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,079
think about there's this tax and

428
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:16,919
consumers are produc and negotiating

429
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:18,360
who's going to Bear it well if consumers

430
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:19,799
are perfectly elastic they're like you

431
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:22,520
know [ __ ] you I'm not going to Bear it

432
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:23,959
you try to give me any I'm gone but iFly

433
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,160
inelastic produc is like I'm sticking

434
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:26,959
you with it and I know you're going to

435
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:30,840
take it because you have no choice your

436
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,840
demand's perfectly in elastic yeah

437
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,360
excellent question we're going to come

438
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,880
back to that the way we think of

439
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,520
incidents is the reason we think about

440
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,840
is the change in price the reason we use

441
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,640
price and we don't pay attention to the

442
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,440
x-axis at all is another way ask your

443
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,880
question is we're thinking about an

444
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:52,000
incremental infinitesimally small change

445
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:54,720
so X wouldn't change okay I mean X would

446
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,760
change basically X does change let me go

447
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,440
back let me say this differently we're

448
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:02,840
focusing on incidents because

449
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,320
basically the fairness aspect Yeah

450
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:07,880
scratch my first answer here's a better

451
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:11,200
answer in both equilibriums before and

452
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:13,880
after the tax everyone is perfectly

453
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,400
happy with where they are so it's not

454
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:19,440
about efficiency you're an efficient

455
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,640
outcome before or after okay it's about

456
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,960
fairness and fairness about who's paying

457
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:26,440
more before after so not a great answer

458
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,720
but that's the way to think about it

459
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,760
okay but it leads to the next section

460
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,240
I'm going to teach okay other questions

461
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:35,360
about

462
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:36,400
that okay so elasticity determines who

463
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:40,360
Bears the

464
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:42,640
burden okay so here's a great example of

465
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:44,240
that let me ask a hard question see if

466
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,720
you guys get that get

467
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:49,080
this cities Levy taxes on hotels on

468
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,039
hotel rooms when you go to a hotel room

469
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,080
in a big city there's a city tax on that

470
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:56,000
hotel

471
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:59,480
room that tax and hotels rooms is born

472
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,840
as you could now know be partially by

473
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,840
the hotels and partially by the

474
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:07,000
consumers of hotel

475
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:09,640
rooms after Airbnb came

476
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:13,159
along how did that shift the burden of

477
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:15,440
that tax so there's taxes on hotels whoa

478
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:17,360
okay how did it shift the burden of the

479
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:21,080
tax

480
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:24,120
because exactly what airbn D did was

481
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:26,400
make consumer demand for hotels more

482
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:28,840
elastic when consumer demands for hotels

483
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,880
more elastic producers couldn't pass the

484
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:33,760
tax onto them as much so producers had

485
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,159
to Bear more of it that's an example how

486
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,679
this matters in the real world and

487
00:19:35,159 --> 00:19:40,080
there's evidence of

488
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:41,360
that okay so this isn't just saying you

489
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,799
know a different question I could ask is

490
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,520
well what happens when Airbnb comes in

491
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:45,840
hotel price will have to fall that's a

492
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,320
different

493
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,919
question okay this question is what

494
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,120
happens the effect of attacks on hotels

495
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,919
and the answer is it's borne more by

496
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,480
hotels and less by consumers because

497
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:57,039
consumers look more like the second

498
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,120
panel of figure 234 and less like the

499
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:02,559
first panel

500
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:05,320
so basically the more elastic consumers

501
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:06,600
become the more they can avoid taxes the

502
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,760
less elastic the more they'll be stuck

503
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:11,480
with

504
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,640
them okay now that's fairness but let me

505
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,159
come to this great question over here

506
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,679
which is okay that's just about prices

507
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:19,919
what about profits what about

508
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:24,120
quantities well that comes to the SEC

509
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:24,120
back to our original concept which is

510
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:31,000
efficiency which is now let's talk talk

511
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,159
about the efficient aspect of taxes I

512
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,080
misspoke I said you wasn't that they're

513
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,000
efficient in both outcomes they're an

514
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,799
equilibrium in both outcomes let's come

515
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:41,159
to the efficiency of

516
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:43,440
Taxation now let's look at a tax now

517
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:46,760
let's go back to figure to our original

518
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:49,039
t figure 235 goes back to our original

519
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:52,240
tax on

520
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:54,640
producers of 50 cents a gallon same

521
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:57,919
thing initially equilibrium at P1

522
00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:01,200
q1 now you get new equilibrium at P1 at

523
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:03,960
P2 Q2 to A180 90 billion

524
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:07,360
gallons what about efficiency well

525
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:10,039
efficiency is what has happened to the

526
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,520
social surplus fairness about division

527
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:13,960
of so social surplus and that's why I

528
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,840
just focused on prices efficiency is

529
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:17,440
about the size of the social surplus and

530
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:20,039
now we focus on

531
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,120
quantities well what's happened to the

532
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:23,760
size of the social surplus well it used

533
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:27,320
to

534
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:29,600
be if you look at it consumers used to

535
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:33,480
have the consumer surplus

536
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:36,400
of the area above the 150 Price Line and

537
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:37,840
below the blue demand line producers

538
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,640
used have producer Surplus the area

539
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,919
below the $150 Price Line and above the

540
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:44,919
blue supply line now the quantity is

541
00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:47,600
shrunk we've

542
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:49,880
reduced consumer

543
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,480
surplus and as a result and we've

544
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,679
reduced we've reduced consumer surplus

545
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:56,480
and producer Surplus Now consumer

546
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:59,039
surplus is just the amount

547
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:02,880
above the $180 line

548
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:05,480
line and below the demand curve producer

549
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:08,799
Surplus is just the amount

550
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:10,720
above below the dollar 80 line and above

551
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:12,559
the red supply curve both consumer

552
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:15,080
producer Surplus have shrunk and we've

553
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:17,919
created a dead weight

554
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:19,919
loss so there's an efficiency cost to

555
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,919
taxation this is the source of the leak

556
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,720
in the

557
00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:25,480
bucket I talked about it last time more

558
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,760
casually I talked about why or I talked

559
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,000
a couple Le about why we care about

560
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,880
moral hazard why we care that there's

561
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,799
people are for example not working or

562
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,080
here it's why do we care about the Lost

563
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:37,320
gallons of gas we care about the Lost

564
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:40,080
gallons of gas because that's a cost to

565
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:44,000
society there are 10 billion gallons of

566
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:46,320
gas that were being sold before in in

567
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,720
trades that make both parties happen

568
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,240
those trades have

569
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:54,080
disappeared we have created an

570
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:56,720
inefficiency by tax in the gas

571
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:59,279
market that is the dead weight loss of

572
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:02,799
Taxation and that's the leak in the

573
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:03,960
bucket the leak in the bucket from

574
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:07,440
taxing

575
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:09,360
things is equal to the dead weight loss

576
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,799
of Taxation that's the that's the first

577
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:14,640
leak that's the tax

578
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:18,039
leak the tax

579
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,760
leak is the dead weight loss of Taxation

580
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:22,320
the inefficiency we've

581
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:25,200
created by taxing

582
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,960
Goods now here's the mind-blowing part

583
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:31,840
look at figure

584
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:34,679
236 now I ask now I take a gas market

585
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,240
with more and less I don't do perfectly

586
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:38,120
imperfectly elastic and elastic I do

587
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,480
sort of more or more realistically more

588
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:43,960
or less elastic look what happens to the

589
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,240
dead weight loss when demand for gas is

590
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:48,720
very

591
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:51,960
inelastic the dead weight loss is much

592
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,960
smaller than when the demand for gas is

593
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:56,039
very

594
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:59,039
elastic indeed if the demand for gas

595
00:23:56,039 --> 00:24:01,760
were perfectly inelastic there'd be Zero

596
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:04,919
inefficiency from tax

597
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:08,440
why why would taxes not be inefficient

598
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:10,440
at all if deo's in elastic

599
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,520
yeah because there's no changeing

600
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,520
consumers are going to buy there's no

601
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,279
trades that aren't being made you're

602
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:18,120
screwing consumers that's the fairness

603
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:20,799
part but there's no efficiency loss

604
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:24,600
there's no trade that's not being

605
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:27,399
made as a result the more elastic demand

606
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:29,360
gets the bigger the efficiency cost gets

607
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:31,880
because more and more trades are being

608
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:36,559
blocked from

609
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:38,200
happening okay so basically we get this

610
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:41,320
interesting

611
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:47,320
contrast which is that as elasticities

612
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:51,279
go up as as elasticities of demand go up

613
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:54,960
on the one hand consumers Escape

614
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:57,080
taxation right on the other hand their

615
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,640
escaping the taxation is what creates

616
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:02,559
inefficiency in dead weight loss

617
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:05,880
once again sort of an equity efficiency

618
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:08,240
tradeoff right the most the fairest

619
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,679
taxes the taxes which if we if we

620
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,960
consider ourselves as consumers we care

621
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:14,799
about ourselves as consumers the fairest

622
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:16,240
taxes are the taxes on Goods which are

623
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:18,600
most elastically demanded because we

624
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,399
don't have to bear them but they're also

625
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:22,279
the most distortionary taxes the tax

626
00:25:20,399 --> 00:25:24,440
that create the biggest leak in the

627
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:27,240
bucket another way of thinking about

628
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:29,399
this Equity efficiency tradeoff the more

629
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:31,840
elastic is

630
00:25:29,399 --> 00:25:34,320
demand the more consumers avoid taxes

631
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:36,880
but the more inefficiencies you'll cost

632
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:39,880
okay questions about

633
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,880
that

634
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:54,919
yeah well um let me ask the question

635
00:25:51,960 --> 00:26:00,360
differently look at figure

636
00:25:54,919 --> 00:26:02,039
23 uh 4 A first panel here's another way

637
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,960
to ask your question why aren't they

638
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:06,399
charging

639
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:08,440
Infinity in it's in elastic

640
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:10,200
demand why aren't they charging Infinity

641
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,760
it's another version of your question

642
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,440
the answer is that there's always

643
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,399
external pressure on producers why don't

644
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,200
monopolis charge Infinity because

645
00:26:15,399 --> 00:26:18,760
ultimately there's external pressure now

646
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,799
in this

647
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:22,960
case the reason they're not charging

648
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:24,320
Infinity is because at some point people

649
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,480
will start to drop

650
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,360
out okay so your answer is why don't

651
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,080
they just shift it more well sure but

652
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:32,000
then why aren't they charging more

653
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,600
today they could always charge the

654
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,279
answer is there's other Market forces

655
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,080
constraining them why isn't Apple

656
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:39,039
charging us more for the iPhone well

657
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:41,559
because the Android exists people prefer

658
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:42,919
the iPhone but Apple's clearly decided

659
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:44,080
that if it was two grand in iPhone

660
00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:46,679
people would just switch too much to

661
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:49,360
Androids they're already making a good

662
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:50,360
ungodly profit why not more because

663
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,799
they've reached some point where they've

664
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:55,399
decided it's the alone Point okay so

665
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:57,240
basically the key point is Market power

666
00:26:55,399 --> 00:26:59,640
doesn't necessarily mean you could do

667
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:02,960
what you want but this does raise the

668
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:05,480
interesting issue which is beyond this

669
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,720
class but if you take 1420 industrial

670
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:10,559
organization which is a lot of people

671
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:13,440
claim that during this inflationary

672
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:16,279
period part of what has driven inflation

673
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:18,159
is firms increasing their profit margins

674
00:27:16,279 --> 00:27:19,320
now you might say well look why would

675
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,399
firms if firms could have increased

676
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,440
their profit margin before they would

677
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:24,120
have why are they doing it now and the

678
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:26,360
answer is sort of in this question which

679
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:29,320
is a little bit hidden now prices are

680
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:31,360
going up anyway so they can blame the

681
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:32,159
war or the president whoever they want

682
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,559
to

683
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,720
blame okay so it's a good time to raise

684
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:38,320
their profit margin because prices are

685
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:40,360
up if five years ago when inflation was

686
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,720
Zero if they rais their prop Mar

687
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,960
everyone would notice is hey why is Coke

688
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,960
more expensive but now Coke's getting

689
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:47,159
way more expensive if you make it even a

690
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,120
dollar more expensive you'll think well

691
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:50,559
that's just

692
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:52,320
inflation so actually it becomes it sort

693
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:55,399
of an answer your questions in the real

694
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:57,200
world opportunities like taxation or

695
00:27:55,399 --> 00:27:59,559
inflation are often opportunities

696
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:02,039
companies use to sort of raat of profit

697
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:03,960
margins but not in our more simple

698
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:06,559
models

699
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:08,080
okay other

700
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:10,919
questions

701
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:12,559
okay that's the tax side of it now let's

702
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:15,880
talk about the transfer side of it so

703
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:19,320
that's the first leak the first leak is

704
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:19,320
the dead weight loss caused by

705
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:25,399
taxation the second leak second leak in

706
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:30,120
the bucket is the inefficiencies the

707
00:28:25,399 --> 00:28:30,120
dead weight loss caused by transfers

708
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:36,919
okay so now let's go to figure

709
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:43,840
237 237 is the figure we had last time

710
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:46,399
that showed the leaks in the bucket the

711
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,799
tar part of the remember the red the

712
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:49,320
black line is your old budget constraint

713
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:50,799
before the government came in remember

714
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:53,440
the program we're transferring money to

715
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:54,399
people who were poor pay for by tax on

716
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:59,559
those who are

717
00:28:54,399 --> 00:29:02,159
richer the tax led to the W shifted red

718
00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:04,120
budget line to the left of the diagram

719
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:07,399
and we Now understand why that caused

720
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:08,960
inefficiency people work less less is

721
00:29:07,399 --> 00:29:12,039
produced in society that's a dead weight

722
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,440
loss what about the part if we transfer

723
00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:16,480
well here we see the in efficiency right

724
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:19,000
away which is all those people who at

725
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:22,360
least were working some now don't work

726
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,559
at all basically if we set up a welfare

727
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:27,440
program like this there is if you are

728
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:29,440
anyone who wanted to work less than 250

729
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,240
hours

730
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,880
then literally there's 100% tax rate on

731
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:34,039
your work why work you're going to get

732
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,640
the same amount of money whether you

733
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:37,159
work or not because every dollar you're

734
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,039
Inn there going to take a dollar away

735
00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:43,000
remember the transfer formula was the

736
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:45,480
transfer we gave you was the max of zero

737
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,440
or your income minus

738
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,960
5,000 what that means every dollar of

739
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,080
income you earn we take a dollar away of

740
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,080
the

741
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:55,240
transfer no no no I'm sorry 5,000 minus

742
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:58,360
your income I that backwards 5,000 minus

743
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:58,360
your income

744
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:02,480
right so it's like a 100% tax on income

745
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:06,960
every dollar you earn we take a dollar

746
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:08,159
away so why work that is the transfer

747
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,039
side of the Leaky

748
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:14,880
bucket that people quit

749
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:17,799
working so now the question is what can

750
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,559
we do about it and governments recognize

751
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:22,519
this problem so here you're a

752
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:24,640
government and you want to redistribute

753
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:26,120
from the rich to the poor and let's even

754
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,600
solve the tax Problem by finding

755
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:30,919
inelastic sources of in elastic markets

756
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,840
to tax so you've even you've reduced so

757
00:30:30,919 --> 00:30:35,519
for example a very inelastic Market to

758
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:37,640
tax is property people's houses are

759
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:39,760
there so let's say you're taxing

760
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:41,519
property that's pretty inelastic you

761
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,760
don't create a dead weight loss tax side

762
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:44,000
but now you want to say I'm creating all

763
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,640
this dead weight loss on the transfer

764
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,200
side because I'm causing all these loan

765
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:51,720
people just quit work because why

766
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:53,799
work how can I deal with that well

767
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:55,120
there's two ways governments deal with

768
00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:58,039
that problem in

769
00:30:55,120 --> 00:31:01,919
reality the first way they deal with it

770
00:30:58,039 --> 00:31:01,919
is through what we call categorical

771
00:31:02,639 --> 00:31:07,039
welfare categorical welfare we give cash

772
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:10,440
not to

773
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:13,399
everyone but to people who meet certain

774
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:16,240
criteria so for example we have in the

775
00:31:13,399 --> 00:31:19,840
US the tanif program temporary Aid to

776
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:23,240
needy families that is money for poor

777
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:26,000
single moms so it's not just being poor

778
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:29,320
but you have to also be a single mom we

779
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,760
have our biggest cash trans program to

780
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:33,799
the US to the poor people it's called

781
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:36,960
SSI subal security income that's for

782
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:38,799
poor disabled people you have to be poor

783
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,200
and

784
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:43,559
disabled why do we do categoric

785
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:46,880
transfers because we're trying to take

786
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:46,880
advantage of

787
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:53,159
targeting we're trying to take advantage

788
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:55,039
of

789
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:57,120
targeting obviously we want to give

790
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:58,240
money to low-income people those people

791
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,000
who need it we talked about how any

792
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,159
sensible social welfare function would

793
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,159
deliver distribution to low-income

794
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:06,679
people the problem is in giving to them

795
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:08,960
we make this huge leak in the

796
00:32:06,679 --> 00:32:10,000
bucket what if how we could give it to

797
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,799
them without creating a leak in the

798
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,480
bucket think about a simple

799
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:16,760
example imagine that there's two reasons

800
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:20,440
people are low

801
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:24,320
income they're unskilled and they're

802
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:26,240
lazy okay now we would like to protect

803
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,200
the unskilled from behind the AV behind

804
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,519
your born you don't know if you're going

805
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,639
be skilled or unskilled SK so we'd like

806
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,600
to all have a system that protects the

807
00:32:30,639 --> 00:32:34,399
unskilled we're not sure we want to

808
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:37,559
protect the lazy they should probably

809
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:40,559
work okay let's say we're all born with

810
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:43,279
a irremovable tattoo on our head IR

811
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:44,679
removable and inadible you can't add it

812
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:46,720
that says

813
00:32:44,679 --> 00:32:48,919
unskilled or

814
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,840
skilled well then we simply say I'm

815
00:32:48,919 --> 00:32:52,240
going to look at your tattoo if your

816
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:54,480
tattoo says unskilled I'm going to give

817
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,000
you money say skilled I'm not going to I

818
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,000
don't care what your income is because I

819
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,080
know you can make a good living if

820
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,080
you're not doing so it just means you're

821
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:05,880
lazy then we'd have no dead weight

822
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:07,639
loss because why because you couldn't

823
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:09,720
change dead weight loss is created by

824
00:33:07,639 --> 00:33:12,320
what people changing their behavior to

825
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:13,279
avoid taxation well if it's based on a

826
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,679
tattoo it's on your head when you're

827
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:16,159
born you can't change your behavior

828
00:33:14,679 --> 00:33:18,639
unless parents can like do in vitro

829
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:20,440
tattoo tattooing or something okay you

830
00:33:18,639 --> 00:33:21,960
can't change your behavior so there's no

831
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:24,639
dead weight loss it's in elastic the

832
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:26,559
supply of unskilled tattoos is in

833
00:33:24,639 --> 00:33:28,760
elastic there's no dead weight loss so

834
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:31,880
if we could simply know

835
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:33,080
who was truly in need and who wasn't

836
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:35,799
really need they were just quitting

837
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:38,799
their job we could redistribute without

838
00:33:35,799 --> 00:33:41,399
dead weight loss problem is we don't

839
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:42,480
probably a good thing that we don't okay

840
00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:43,960
we don't have to get to debate between

841
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:49,320
my daughter and myself on tattoos that's

842
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:51,120
for another day okay but what we do know

843
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:54,360
is things which are

844
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:57,480
correlated with your underlying skill

845
00:33:54,360 --> 00:34:01,120
regardless of your work effort okay so

846
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:03,440
let let take something like

847
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,880
blindness especially you know genetic

848
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,120
blindness you're born

849
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:09,320
blind well that's pretty much like being

850
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:11,480
born with unskilled stamped on your head

851
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:13,119
now to be fair many blind people succeed

852
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:15,200
enormously blind students at MIT will go

853
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:18,000
on to incredibly fruitful careers but

854
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:19,760
it's true that if you're blind you're

855
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
most likely very needy of

856
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,560
help then we'd say we give to blind

857
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,879
people by making it

858
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:29,839
categorical we're able to try to Target

859
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:32,839
the benefits without creating deadweight

860
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:35,280
loss okay that's why have disability

861
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:36,839
single moms well basically as long as

862
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,359
single moms didn't sort of choose to be

863
00:34:36,839 --> 00:34:40,440
single moms they just got stuck with a

864
00:34:38,359 --> 00:34:42,839
kid because their you know their partner

865
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:44,040
left them or something like that then

866
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:45,119
it's going to be really hard to work we

867
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,119
know they're needy someone's got to keep

868
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:48,079
an eye on the kid they can't work

869
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:50,320
without child care so that's another

870
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:53,079
indicator of needing

871
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:58,440
help now that one is

872
00:34:53,079 --> 00:34:59,680
but that's a little tricky because is it

873
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:02,040
something people can change with their

874
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,599
behavior well of course people can

875
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:06,359
choose to become single

876
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:08,440
moms so it's not like genetic blindness

877
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:10,480
which isn't Changed by your behavior

878
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:12,520
single motherhood is potentially Changed

879
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,720
by your behavior so now we start to get

880
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:17,680
in a murky

881
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:20,119
realm of is it a good idea to Target

882
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:22,160
benefits to single moms or in fact as

883
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:24,440
many conservatives claimed back in the

884
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:26,240
1980s when this sort of became a major

885
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:28,480
topic of discussion are we actually

886
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:31,640
making Society worse by creating single

887
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,359
moms are we actually making things worse

888
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:35,880
by targeting benefit single moms

889
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:38,640
actually creating single motherhood in

890
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:42,040
America okay and indeed there was a very

891
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:45,880
famous book that was written in

892
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:48,640
1984 okay that looked at a simple graph

893
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:51,119
of the generosity of welfare and single

894
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:53,839
motherhood so this is

895
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:57,119
time and this is like

896
00:35:53,839 --> 00:36:00,480
1960 and this is like 1980 which is when

897
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:02,760
their data end ended and if this was the

898
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,880
generosity of welfare benefits welfare

899
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:07,160
was getting more

900
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:09,040
generous and this is single motherhood

901
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:12,440
single motherhood was was going

902
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:13,640
up so it was like look by making W for

903
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,960
generous we're encouraging single

904
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:17,400
mothers we're not rewarding those who

905
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:21,079
need it we're encouraging them the

906
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,079
problem is this is what's happened

907
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:27,160
since okay it turns out through Decades

908
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:28,359
of careful study single motherhood has

909
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:30,760
almost nothing to do with welfare

910
00:36:28,359 --> 00:36:32,319
benefits basically people don't decide

911
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:34,359
to become single mothers based on cash

912
00:36:32,319 --> 00:36:38,440
concerns it's based on other concerns in

913
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:40,760
their life so it turns out the

914
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:43,319
inefficiency of targeting money to

915
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:46,119
single moms is low because what drives

916
00:36:43,319 --> 00:36:49,119
that inefficiency what drives it is the

917
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:50,760
elasticity of single motherhood with

918
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:53,359
respect to

919
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:55,839
welfare that's the key parameter that's

920
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:58,760
the key elasticity that drives the dead

921
00:36:55,839 --> 00:37:00,240
weight loss the more elastic single

922
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,599
motherhood is with respect to welfare

923
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,800
The More inefficiency We Get By

924
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:07,640
targeting single motherhood but it turns

925
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:08,800
out this is approximately zero so it

926
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,800
turns out this is a pretty good way to

927
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,760
Target

928
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:14,160
people here's what's

929
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,480
ironic you might say well look it's

930
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,800
uncontroversial Single Moms is

931
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,359
controversial targeting disabled is

932
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,319
uncontroversial turns out you'd have

933
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:21,880
that

934
00:37:19,319 --> 00:37:25,599
backwards turns out the

935
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:29,359
elasticity of claiming SSI with respect

936
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:31,720
to welfare benefits is greater than

937
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:33,560
zero because as I mentioned type of

938
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:35,119
workers comp it is hard to monitor

939
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:37,040
whether people are truly

940
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:39,520
disabled and it turns out the more

941
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:42,599
generous you make disability benefits

942
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:45,520
the more people claim SSI the more the

943
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:49,720
more people claim uh that there's

944
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:50,720
disabled so now so here's here's the way

945
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,640
to think about it let's go back to our

946
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,480
Equity efficiency tradeoff with single

947
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:56,839
mothers there's no equity efficiency

948
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,079
trade-off they are a poor group and by

949
00:37:56,839 --> 00:38:01,520
giving the money you don't create dead

950
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:04,119
weight loss with disabled people there

951
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:05,960
is an equity efficiency trade-off which

952
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:08,079
is there are poor people but you create

953
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:09,079
deadweight loss by giving them money so

954
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:12,040
for this one you don't even need a

955
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:13,319
social welfare function you're done for

956
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:15,640
this one you need a social welfare

957
00:38:13,319 --> 00:38:17,040
function decide if it's worth it to

958
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:19,119
decide if the dead weight loss you're

959
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,200
creating how it compares to the benefits

960
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:25,040
you're getting from giving money to poor

961
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:29,160
needy people okay questions about

962
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:31,240
that so that's one way we deal with this

963
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:33,599
inefficiency this Deb we loss the other

964
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:37,720
way is by changing the way we pay

965
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:37,720
benefits and making them in

966
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:46,880
kind okay the the problem with cash

967
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:49,520
transfer systems is Everyone likes cash

968
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:52,000
so it creates a maximum incentive to

969
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:53,520
distort your behavior to qualify well

970
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,040
what if instead of cash I gave you a

971
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:57,440
shitty public apartment with leaking

972
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:59,720
roof and it's just sort of bad

973
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:02,400
neighborhood and stuff like that well

974
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:04,319
then maybe people wouldn't who didn't

975
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,079
really need it wouldn't change their

976
00:39:04,319 --> 00:39:08,359
behavior to get it maybe only people

977
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:09,319
would take that but people who really

978
00:39:08,359 --> 00:39:13,000
need

979
00:39:09,319 --> 00:39:15,359
it so maybe we don't need to have you T

980
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:18,359
tattooed on your forehead maybe we can

981
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:20,720
get you to reveal whether you truly need

982
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:22,040
help or Not by giving you something

983
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,680
that's not so

984
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:27,599
great it's sort of a perverse

985
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:29,720
logic but the logic is the way we get

986
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,920
people to reveal whether they're truly

987
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:33,280
needy by giving them something only

988
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:34,680
truly needy people would want which is a

989
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:38,040
crappy

990
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:40,839
apartment okay and this is a major

991
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:44,040
reason why we deliver most of the

992
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:47,960
benefits to the poor on an in kind

993
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:50,680
basis most the there about a 10 to one

994
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:52,760
ratio in the US of the benefits we give

995
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:54,800
to the poor through things like Medical

996
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:58,280
Care and housing and food to what we

997
00:39:54,800 --> 00:40:01,079
give them in cash about a 10 to1 ratio

998
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:03,760
okay we give much more in Goods now part

999
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:04,920
of the reason is the theory I just gave

1000
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,000
you part of the reason is because we're

1001
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:08,960
paternalistic as Society you remember

1002
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,839
way back in like the third lecture I

1003
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,079
talked about food stamps and how to be

1004
00:40:10,839 --> 00:40:13,760
more efficient to give people cash but

1005
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:16,200
we don't think they'll spend it on

1006
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,760
cocaine okay that's the main reason we

1007
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,880
do Inc benefits realistically is because

1008
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,440
we don't trust people to spend their

1009
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:23,680
money but there's an economic Logic for

1010
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:25,040
it which is that it's a way to get

1011
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,920
people to reveal their types when you

1012
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:29,319
can't really know who should be targeted

1013
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,319
and who shouldn't

1014
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:34,440
okay once again the tradeoff we'd love

1015
00:40:32,359 --> 00:40:36,280
to give everyone nice Apartments but in

1016
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,480
doing so we create a huge dead weight

1017
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:40,079
loss of people quitting their jobs to

1018
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:43,480
get the nice Apartments so it's a

1019
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:45,520
trade-off now once again this is the

1020
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,720
Dismal science and all I do is talk

1021
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,040
about tradeoffs all day so let me

1022
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,599
actually end the lecture on a positive

1023
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:53,800
note which is there's actually one

1024
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:55,920
program that's not a tradeoff there's

1025
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:59,359
actually one program we've discovered

1026
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:02,400
which actually redistributes money and

1027
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:05,079
increases efficiency and that's what we

1028
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:08,640
call

1029
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:11,839
conditional cash

1030
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:14,640
transfers which is money we give to

1031
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:16,119
people conditional on them doing

1032
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:18,640
efficient

1033
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:23,119
activities the classic example in the US

1034
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:26,880
is called the Earned Income Tax

1035
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:33,079
Credit the earn income tax credit is a

1036
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:36,240
way W subsidy program it's a wage

1037
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:37,520
subsidy what does that mean it's the

1038
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,920
opposite of a

1039
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:42,760
tax the earning of tax credit is such

1040
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:44,560
that for every for the whenever you earn

1041
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:47,040
money the government said taking some

1042
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:49,760
away will match it as long as you're

1043
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:52,359
poor so if we look at figure

1044
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:55,839
238 this shows how the income tax credit

1045
00:41:52,359 --> 00:41:58,359
works on the x-axis is earned

1046
00:41:55,839 --> 00:42:01,520
income on the Y axis is the amount of

1047
00:41:58,359 --> 00:42:02,880
the eitc you get what you see is if you

1048
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:05,599
earn no money you get nothing from the

1049
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:08,280
government of this program but as you

1050
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:11,359
earn money until you make

1051
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:14,359
14,800 for every dollar you earn the

1052
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:17,680
government gives you another 40 cents so

1053
00:42:14,359 --> 00:42:18,839
the first $115,000 you earn you get

1054
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:21,440
another 40 cents from the government

1055
00:42:18,839 --> 00:42:24,880
it's a negative tax at that point it

1056
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:28,400
caps out the biggest checking it is 5920

1057
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:30,359
and then they start to take it away

1058
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,400
why because they want they don't want

1059
00:42:30,359 --> 00:42:32,760
this money to go to everyone they want

1060
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:34,760
to go to low income so by the time your

1061
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:37,160
income is 47,000 you're

1062
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:38,680
done so the idea is targeted to

1063
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:40,920
low-income

1064
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:42,119
groups so you give these loow people

1065
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:44,240
money but then as their income goes up

1066
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:47,000
you take it back

1067
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:49,200
away

1068
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:52,040
now the important point to know about

1069
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:53,440
this program is it's not all obvious

1070
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:57,520
what this program will

1071
00:42:53,440 --> 00:43:00,480
do okay think about someone

1072
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:01,559
who if you think about someone who's

1073
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,040
below

1074
00:43:01,559 --> 00:43:07,319
14800 the effect of the program is

1075
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:10,160
obvious take someone's earning

1076
00:43:07,319 --> 00:43:12,839
zero what is the income effect on them

1077
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:15,040
of this program well it's zero they were

1078
00:43:12,839 --> 00:43:17,119
earning zero What's the substitution

1079
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:20,160
effect it's massively positive their

1080
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:22,559
wage has gone from X to x x

1081
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:24,800
1.4 so for someone earning zero the

1082
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:29,200
effect is unambiguously

1083
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:33,440
positive okay but now now let's imagine

1084
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:33,440
someone earning um $1

1085
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:40,400
19,35 and they're thinking about should

1086
00:43:36,359 --> 00:43:42,559
I earn $100 more so they're at

1087
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,240
19350 they're getting their check from

1088
00:43:42,559 --> 00:43:47,520
the

1089
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:47,520
government of

1090
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:53,520
5920 and now they're saying should I

1091
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:57,319
earn $100 more what happens they $100

1092
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:59,200
more well they get the $100 check but

1093
00:43:57,319 --> 00:44:04,520
they lose

1094
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:07,440
$21 of their 5920 their 5920 goes down

1095
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:11,359
by

1096
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,359
$21 so they end up only at

1097
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:16,960
$58.99 why because we're taking it back

1098
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:19,000
away as they earn money so effectively

1099
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:24,040
we are taxing

1100
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:26,720
them so now we've created a new tax

1101
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:29,359
we're trying to help poor people but in

1102
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:31,000
doing so afraid of a new tax why because

1103
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:32,359
we want to keep it to poor people then

1104
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,720
we do that take it away as people's

1105
00:44:32,359 --> 00:44:37,240
income goes

1106
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:38,440
up so effect this program is ambiguous

1107
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,599
on the one hand you take the guys who

1108
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:41,720
weren't working at all and give them big

1109
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:43,800
money to go to work but in order to

1110
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:45,960
phase that out you tax the people

1111
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:48,280
already working and make them less

1112
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:49,960
likely to work assuming substitution

1113
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:52,079
effects dominant income

1114
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:56,559
effects okay people understand that

1115
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:56,559
questions about that yeah

1116
00:45:03,079 --> 00:45:06,720
oh well we have separate taxes for the

1117
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:08,480
Richer people this is just a don't think

1118
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:10,240
of this as a tax think of as a targeting

1119
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,839
mechanism we're trying to Target to

1120
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:13,040
low-income people the way we target

1121
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:14,839
low-income people is by taking away

1122
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:17,040
their income goes up we don't think we

1123
00:45:14,839 --> 00:45:19,240
don't think anyone over 47440 deserves

1124
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,319
this lowincome transfer so we're taking

1125
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,760
away by the time you get there you don't

1126
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:24,079
get anymore we have separate taxs on

1127
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:28,839
Rich guys this is just this program per

1128
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:31,359
se good question other questions

1129
00:45:28,839 --> 00:45:34,280
yeah what's

1130
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:37,000
that oh because for every $100 you earn

1131
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:38,800
you lose 21 cents you lose 21 cents per

1132
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:43,400
dollar on that

1133
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:43,400
slope okay other questions

1134
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:48,839
yeah you could flatten it okay what

1135
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:51,040
would happen then well one good thing

1136
00:45:48,839 --> 00:45:53,640
and one bad thing the good thing is

1137
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:55,359
there'd be a lower tax rate the bad

1138
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:57,319
thing is if we don't think people will

1139
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:58,319
need above 47440 need this money we're

1140
00:45:57,319 --> 00:45:59,920
giving money away to people who don't

1141
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:02,760
need it because it' go out to like

1142
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:04,040
60,000 now so the trade-off is you could

1143
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,559
also get rid of the slope you could keep

1144
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:07,160
it there but then Bill Gates gets the

1145
00:46:05,559 --> 00:46:09,599
check

1146
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:10,920
5920 okay the point is if you want this

1147
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:12,119
to Lo comp people you have to phase it

1148
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:14,200
out now we can argue what the right

1149
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:15,920
phase out is you can always argue about

1150
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:17,319
these numbers and one awes thing about

1151
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,960
working in government is literally

1152
00:46:17,319 --> 00:46:20,200
people in government get to just come up

1153
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,960
with these numbers I mean how cool is

1154
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:23,720
that you get to come up with how much M

1155
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:25,000
people are going to get in their lives

1156
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:26,440
okay so there's lots of fights of what

1157
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,760
these numbers should be but the bottom

1158
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:30,960
line is just structure you need if you

1159
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:34,200
want a program that's targeted you need

1160
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:35,680
this structure so here's the tradeoff we

1161
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:37,720
encourage people at the bottom of the

1162
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:39,520
income distribution to go to work but we

1163
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:41,520
discourage people in that middle part of

1164
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:44,079
the income distribution from

1165
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:45,559
working well guess what we can go to the

1166
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:47,839
evidence and evaluate that and guess

1167
00:46:45,559 --> 00:46:50,599
what we learn the first thing we learn

1168
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:53,200
is the first effect is huge the earn

1169
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:54,720
income tax credit has a huge effect in

1170
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:58,559
encouraging people to

1171
00:46:54,720 --> 00:47:00,640
work okay um best estimates are that

1172
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:03,680
basically if you take especially single

1173
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:05,640
moms there's something like a 15%

1174
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:08,000
increase in the odds they work I mean

1175
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:11,680
huge the odds that they

1176
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:15,720
work and there is no evidence that it

1177
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:18,119
causes people on that other part to work

1178
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:19,520
less so there's good evidence takes the

1179
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:21,040
zero people and brings them in the labor

1180
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:22,920
market there's no evidence that takes

1181
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:24,960
the 19,000 people and cause them to work

1182
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:25,839
less why is that well there's two

1183
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,640
possible

1184
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:31,240
reasons one is remember for the zero

1185
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:33,440
people the effect is unambiguous zero

1186
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:35,599
income effect positive substitution

1187
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:37,240
effect for these people the effect is

1188
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:39,559
ambiguous we talked about that with

1189
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:40,800
labor supply income substitution effects

1190
00:47:39,559 --> 00:47:44,240
here you have a substitution effect

1191
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:45,839
saying you work less okay but the income

1192
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:48,920
effect might go the other way actually

1193
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:51,200
no let me go back that's wrong because

1194
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:52,599
remember they do have more income they

1195
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,200
deal more income the income saying work

1196
00:47:52,599 --> 00:47:58,599
less substitution effects working less

1197
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:58,599
so that can't explain it they're richer

1198
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:03,440
no I had it right let me go back I had

1199
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:05,440
it right on the margin for that

1200
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:08,160
next100 there's substitution effect

1201
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:10,520
they're getting $21 poorer which should

1202
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:13,559
make them take less Leisure and work

1203
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:15,680
more but they're only taking home 79

1204
00:48:13,559 --> 00:48:16,880
cents on the dollar which has subs

1205
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:18,200
effect makes them work less so it's

1206
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:20,200
ambiguous so on the one hand you have an

1207
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:23,359
unambiguous effect taking people from

1208
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:25,920
zero to working an ambiguous effect

1209
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:27,079
here that could be why we don't see a

1210
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,079
difference but here's why we don't see

1211
00:48:27,079 --> 00:48:31,359
difference really people don't

1212
00:48:29,079 --> 00:48:34,000
understand it's super complic if I say

1213
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:36,119
to you hey guess what used to get X

1214
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,960
going to work I get X plus a big check

1215
00:48:36,119 --> 00:48:39,599
I'll go to work if you say well on the

1216
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:41,000
margin if you work one more hour your

1217
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:42,480
income goes down by 21 cents I mean

1218
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,200
you're MIT students and you didn't quite

1219
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:46,640
understand

1220
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:48,760
it okay so the answer is I think my

1221
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:52,200
theory it's not good evence this is that

1222
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:54,240
basically this effect this effect is so

1223
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:57,119
subtle and complicated that people don't

1224
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:58,720
pay attention whereas the you get a big

1225
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:00,960
new check if you go to work effect

1226
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:02,440
people pay attention to I'm not saying

1227
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:04,599
that's been proven that's my

1228
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:07,319
theory the bottom line is it doesn't

1229
00:49:04,599 --> 00:49:09,559
matter what the theory is this is a

1230
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:10,960
win-win this is a program which is

1231
00:49:09,559 --> 00:49:13,160
redistributing people money to the

1232
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:15,000
needest people in society it's about a

1233
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:17,119
something like oh God I forget something

1234
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,359
like an 80 billion dollar a year program

1235
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:20,839
it's $80 billion dollar going to the

1236
00:49:18,359 --> 00:49:23,720
poorest member of society and it's

1237
00:49:20,839 --> 00:49:25,799
increasing work it's increasing work

1238
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:28,400
it's increasing efficiency so that's a

1239
00:49:25,799 --> 00:49:31,680
win-win program

1240
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:34,000
okay this is not just in America Mexico

1241
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:35,880
a great example a wonderful example the

1242
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,400
president of Mexico had a good buddy who

1243
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:39,680
was a sociologist who knew a lot of

1244
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:42,200
economics who convinced him to set up a

1245
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:43,359
program where they give money to mothers

1246
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:46,160
only if their kids got their

1247
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:47,559
immunizations you know sorry sorry RFK

1248
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:50,480
got their immunizations and were

1249
00:49:47,559 --> 00:49:53,720
enrolled in school and guess what it had

1250
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:56,119
a huge effect on improving kids outcomes

1251
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:57,440
even their incomes later in life sadly

1252
00:49:56,119 --> 00:49:59,880
the current president in Mexico got rid

1253
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:01,359
of it but this was an incredibly

1254
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:02,839
successful program these conditional

1255
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:04,720
cash TR programs have success been

1256
00:50:02,839 --> 00:50:06,240
successful all over the world and that's

1257
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:08,000
a way we can solve the Leaky bucket it's

1258
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:09,920
a positive story for our government

1259
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:13,880
policy can do better anyway I'll stop

1260
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:13,880
there I'll see you all on Wednesday
