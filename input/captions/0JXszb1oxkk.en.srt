00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:01,733
(logo whooshing)

2
00:00:01,733 --> 00:00:02,566
I am Andreea Bobu.

3
00:00:05,466 --> 00:00:08,490
I lead the Collaborative
Learning Autonomy Research Lab

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,410
at MIT or CLEAR Lab

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,450
and we work on autonomous agents

6
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,630
that can do tasks for,
with, and around people.

7
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,440
This work really applies to any domain

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,470
where you have a human
and a robot interacting

9
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,990
and collaborating and trying
to do a task together.

10
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,530
Maybe the human wants the
robot to do a task for them.

11
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,860
So this pertains to personal
robotics, so a robot at home,

12
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,930
assistive robotics, so maybe robots

13
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,490
helping with elderly care or
with people with disabilities.

14
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:42,180
LLM agents, which we all
use all the time nowadays,

15
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,980
or self-driving cars.

16
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,170
In our lab, one of our research interests

17
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,540
is about making personalized robots

18
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:52,830
and how to efficiently give
human feedback to the robots.

19
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:53,830
Using only a single
modality of human feedback,

20
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,160
we have to use a lot of data.

21
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,140
To reduce that burden,

22
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,040
one of our research

23
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,743
is about using multimodal human feedback.

24
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,820
We are trying to improve the
efficiency of robot learning

25
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:09,990
by doing that.

26
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:10,823
An autonomous agent is really any system

27
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,700
that can perceive the world,

28
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,270
then make decisions
autonomously about the world

29
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,550
and then act upon those decisions.

30
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:23,190
How can computing make
people's lives easier?

31
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:26,730
How can computing amplify
people's abilities?

32
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:31,410
How can it help humans do
tasks that they don't wanna do

33
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:33,720
or that they can't do easily?

34
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,810
When I was very small, I really
wanted to be a scientist.

35
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,400
I didn't know what that meant.

36
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,040
My only exposure was "Dexter's Laboratory"

37
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,020
but that's what I wanted to do.

38
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,180
I guess it just made natural sense

39
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,470
that I gravitated towards not
just robotics and autonomy,

40
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,570
but specifically human robot interaction,

41
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,150
where we're thinking about
how do we get robots to help

42
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,880
and assist and do tasks for people

43
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,500
and make their lives easier.

44
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,090
I almost didn't apply to MIT

45
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,490
because I thought I wouldn't get in

46
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,340
and actually I decided December 31st,

47
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,710
so the day before the deadline
or the day of the deadline

48
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,020
to apply, I think it
was the holiday spirit.

49
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,870
I was thinking, "Okay, like
why not just give it a shot?"

50
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,860
And then I got in.

51
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,360
I progressively majored in 6-3.

52
00:02:18,168 --> 00:02:21,090
I knew right off the bat that
I wanna do computer science,

53
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,850
but then I decided what
kind of computer science

54
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:27,720
a little later on, I started
taking more courses in AI,

55
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,270
machine learning, and
then I started doing a UOP

56
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:33,810
with Professor Polina
Golland, who's also in CSAIL

57
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,250
doing medical imaging research.

58
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,580
And I really loved it and
decided I wanna keep learning

59
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,413
and I wanna be in grad
school and do more research.

60
00:02:39,413 --> 00:02:40,246
Working with Andreea is great,

61
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,780
we have really good communication

62
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,090
and she's really
supportive to the students.

63
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,310
And for me, I think I have the freedom

64
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:53,190
to choose the topic that I wanna work on.

65
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,480
It was just really nice.

66
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,970
Coming back to MIT as a PI

67
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:01,680
started being a walk down
memory lane initially.

68
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,260
All of these people who
used to be my professors

69
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,720
and my mentors and I
used to look up to them,

70
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,810
are now some of them
my colleagues at CSAIL.

71
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:11,340
So it's really rewarding

72
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,150
and exciting to be in
this full circle moment.

73
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,880
My favorite thing about
MIT is really the people.

74
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,970
It's this intellectual
curiosity, the drive,

75
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:23,460
the quirkiness, the
camaraderie that everyone

76
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:26,490
around experiences in
the pursuit of science.

77
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:29,610
And that's really what
is at the core of MIT

78
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:32,610
and I think it's why MIT
is, at the end of the day,

79
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:34,383
the best place to do research.
