00:00:03,729 --> 00:00:08,320
LHF: Hi everyone, and welcome back to Today I 
Learned: Climate, the climate change podcast  

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,600
from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
I'm Laur Hesse Fisher, and I can't believe that  

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:18,640
this is going to be the last time that I ever 
utter those words. Yes, I am leaving the show.  

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,480
Very sad to do that. It has been a wonderful, 
remarkable experience being here and creating  

5
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,640
the show with my wonderful team. And at the same 
time, I'm really excited to share what is coming  

6
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,440
up next for TILclimate, because it certainly is 
not going away. So in this episode, what we're  

7
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,000
going to do is we're going to talk a little bit 
about the secret sauce of how we make the show  

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,880
and what makes it special. We're going to talk a 
little bit about some new things that are going  

9
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:52,560
to change with the upcoming season. But first, it 
is my distinct pleasure and honor to introduce to  

10
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:58,240
you Madison Goldberg. Madison is going to be the 
new host of Today I Learned: Climate. Madison,  

11
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,147
welcome to the show.

12
00:00:59,147 --> 00:01:02,216
MG: Thank you. It's such an 
honor to be here. I'm really excited.

13
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:08,000
LHF: So, we're going to get a huge opportunity to get to 
know you and your background. You are no stranger  

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
to science communication. You have a degree 
in earth and planetary sciences from our dear  

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,840
friends down the road, as well as in journalism. 
And you have worked on the Scientific American  

16
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:25,200
podcast and on Living on Earth, on that show. And 
also you've done deep reporting on environmental  

17
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,920
issues in Pennsylvania. So you have so much 
to bring to this conversation. Let's start  

18
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,009
off. I want to ask you, what sparked your fire 
for science communication? 

19
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:35,743
MG: Yeah. You know,  

20
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:41,680
I had what I think is not an uncommon path into 
science communication, where I started in science.  

21
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,680
You know, I studied, in undergrad I studied 
earth and planetary sciences, as you mentioned,  

22
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,400
and I adored it. I worked with amazing people. 
I did, you know, earth science research, and it  

23
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:55,920
was awesome. But I realized that I think, like, 
the parts of it when I was just really fired up  

24
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:02,240
and in my element were were not necessarily, you 
know, in the lab per se, but when I was, you know,  

25
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,440
at a big earth science conference, in the giant 
poster halls where everyone has their posters out,  

26
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:12,160
and going around and learning from people, 
learning about their research. I also have, like,  

27
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,360
this very vivid memory of, before one of those 
conferences, I had made my big poster and it was  

28
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:24,240
spread out on the table and my grandparents were 
visiting. And I distinctly remember the joy that  

29
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:30,320
came from explaining to them what I was doing and, 
like, them at least pretending to be interested.  

30
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:34,480
And that was fantastic. And you know, from there 
it was just, I was really lucky to have folks  

31
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,360
who encouraged me to keep exploring it, both in 
science and in writing and journalism. 

32
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,631
LHF: So, I love that. And you chose audio as a way to 
express and kind of do your science communication. 

33
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:47,100
What do you love about the medium of audio? 

34
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,936
MG: Yeah. You know, at the risk
of sounding obvious, you

35
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:56,800
hear people in their voices, and I think that's 
really special. You know, on TILclimate, you hear  

36
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,440
from scientists in their own voices. I think you 
can really hear when someone gets animated, and  

37
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:07,440
especially like, now that we have so many people 
who are deploying climate solutions in the field  

38
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,800
and their communities, getting to talk to them 
I think is really, really special, and I think  

39
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,254
it makes it tangible, hopefully, for listeners 
in a special way. 

40
00:03:14,254 --> 00:03:15,489
LHF: That is absolutely why we  

41
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:20,720
prioritized having a—this is a podcast, because 
we wanted people to feel a closer connection to  

42
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,200
the science. I mean you, read about it, you see 
reports, you see statistics and graphs. It feels  

43
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:31,680
very distant and kind of abstract, and so this is 
a way to hear the stories and the interests and  

44
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,000
the words specifically from scientists and kind 
of, I don't know, personify them a little bit more  

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,160
than you get to do in a more traditional way that 
science is communicated and climate change science  

46
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,276
is communicated these days. 

47
00:03:41,276 --> 00:03:45,512
MG: Yeah, absolutely. 
I think that personality aspect is crucial, and  

48
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,760
I'd love to hear a bit about how how you've gone 
about that, how you thought about how to cultivate  

49
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,050
that personality of the show. 

50
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:54,620
LHF: So, thank you. 
So we built the show for people who were curious  

51
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:00,880
about climate change already. Maybe they were new 
to climate change because of a job, or maybe they  

52
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,320
were confused by lots of different things that 
they hear about on the news, and they just wanted  

53
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:09,680
someone to provide a kind of signal through 
the noise of what was going on, like, simple,  

54
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:16,800
clear explanations. I feel like as the host, I get 
to be curious on behalf of the audience, right? We  

55
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,440
have the scientists that are there. I get the 
honor to be able to ask them all my questions,  

56
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,280
and then I have to figure out how to distill 
that down to the most basic key things that  

57
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,246
our audience needs to know. Like, let me give you 
one example. 

58
00:04:27,246 --> 00:04:28,613
MG: Yeah, please.
LHF: So, one of our  

59
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:34,560
first episodes was with Professor Kerry Emanuel, 
and we were working on a show on hurricanes.  

60
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:42,080
And what I learned is that the way that hurricanes 
form in an ocean is actually really complicated.  

61
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,200
And then we were wrestling with this, like, how do 
we deal with this? What do we—and then we realized  

62
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:52,400
the thing that we need to communicate here, it's 
not all the mechanics of how a hurricane starts,  

63
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:58,320
but the fact is that a warmer air means a 
warmer ocean, a warmer ocean has more energy,  

64
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,280
that basically creates more energy inside of 
a hurricane. And the hurricane, like, absorbs  

65
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,520
more of that energy, and that's why it's more 
intense. We don't need to get more complicated  

66
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:13,120
than that. So what we always try to do with all of 
our shows is take the topic and kind of distill it  

67
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,119
down to something that feels memorable and simple 
and crisp for people to remember. 

68
00:05:18,119 --> 00:05:19,253
MG: Yeah. Yeah.

69
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,640
That actually reminds me—you know, you mentioned 
that I was fortunate to do a fellowship in  

70
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:29,040
Pennsylvania reporting on environmental issues. 
One of my very first assignments was something  

71
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:34,480
that this reminded me of. And, you know, we made 
these very short radio spots sometimes that,  

72
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:39,403
you know, you just have to be snappy. They have to be
within the window of time that you have. And so I was

73
00:05:39,403 --> 00:05:42,705
supposed to make an explainer about climate models.
LHF: Oh boy. 

74
00:05:42,705 --> 00:05:46,108
MG: Yes, and under a minute.
LHF: Oh gosh.

75
00:05:46,108 --> 00:05:50,640
MG: So it was—honestly, I'm 
so glad that it was my first assignment, because  

76
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:55,840
it was an incredible challenge. My editor and my 
other colleagues there helped me so much. I think  

77
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,080
it was this amazing exercise in forcing yourself 
to think about, there's a million different  

78
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,760
directions that I could go here. Climate models 
are obviously an immensely complicated area. But  

79
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:09,760
there are certain things that I think serve 
people who are hearing it as they're driving,  

80
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:14,960
and other things that probably aren't that useful 
to them in that moment, that they can figure out  

81
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,299
if they want to go and learn more. 

82
00:06:16,299 --> 00:06:18,767
LHF: So what I loved about what you said
is that you provided that

83
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,400
explainer as a springboard, right? So it's like, 
okay, let's give people exactly what they need  

84
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,480
to know to understand why it's relevant for me, 
or why I could care about this, or should care  

85
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:32,240
about this. Maybe they're satisfied with that. But 
maybe actually it's a step towards a deeper dive,  

86
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,800
with a basic level of understanding. And I think 
that's a really valuable and important role of  

87
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,749
science communication.

88
00:06:37,749 --> 00:06:43,587
MG: Yeah, totally. And on this idea of,
like, making things memorable,  

89
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,960
I think, you know, you kind of mentioned like, 
okay, so how can we get to people and how can we  

90
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,440
sort of find these ways of putting it that help 
it stick? Like, I know that's something that you  

91
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,360
guys have thought a lot about, and you've thought 
about, you know, different metaphors you can use or

92
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,160
things like that. Like how do you think about that?
LHF: Yeah. So, one of my favorite metaphors  

93
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,440
that was introduced on the show was our direct 
air capture episode. So, this is the idea of,  

94
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,000
okay, there's all this carbon dioxide in the air. 
Can't we just suck it out, right? And like put it  

95
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,480
somewhere, do something with it. So Professor 
Niall MacDowell was our guest speaker, and he  

96
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:23,760
introduced this metaphor of, like, imagine like 
the molecules of oxygen and nitrogen and CO2 and  

97
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:28,480
all the other stuff that's in the air, the gases 
that are in the air, are marbles. And everything  

98
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:37,280
that isn't CO2 is blue, and CO2 is red. And we're 
talking about, CO2 is about 420 parts per million,  

99
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:43,600
right? So we're talking about—so there are, if 
there are a million blue marbles in the sky,  

100
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:50,160
then 400 of them, about, are red. And if you're 
trying to pull, like, sort through all of those  

101
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,880
marbles and just pull out the red ones, well, 
that's actually really hard to do. And it ends  

102
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:59,520
up that it's really energy intensive to do 
as well. And so just that visual of, like,  

103
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:05,760
oh my gosh, okay, I can kind of get a sense of why 
this is, why direct air capture is so expensive,  

104
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:10,320
so energy intensive, so hard. I think that 
visual really helps, and I've used that in  

105
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,391
explaining direct air capture to other people as 
well, and it's been pretty effective.  

106
00:08:13,391 --> 00:08:19,280
MG: Yeah, it's effective for me. I mean, that's awesome. 
Putting a picture in people's heads, and these  

107
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:25,840
sorts of metaphors, I think are really important 
in the same way that, you know, audio demands  

108
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:31,600
a lot of strategies of science communication 
that—maybe different ones are needed elsewhere.  

109
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,840
So part of what this stems from is that a lot 
of people, when they're listening to a podcast,  

110
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,760
they're doing something else. Like that's what I'm 
doing. Like I'm, you know, driving or doing the  

111
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,813
dishes or doing laundry.
LHF: Folding laundry.

112
00:08:40,813 --> 00:08:46,451
MG: Yep. That's the classic. And so because of that,  

113
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:52,320
and because, you know, I think it's just a 
different thing to expect someone to rewind,  

114
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,280
excuse me, as opposed to like, scrolling back up 
and rereading something. It goes by fast. And it  

115
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:01,600
can be easy to have, and very understandable to 
have, like, half your brain on it and half of  

116
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,800
your brain on something else. So I think these 
structures, and I mean something like, "this is  

117
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,040
what we're going to talk about today," or, "wait, 
let's make sure we caught that," and repeating it,  

118
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,480
or at the end being like, "this is where we 
went on our journey." I think those things are  

119
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,040
really important, and I think that's something 
that on the show you've done a great job of,  

120
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,513
and it's been great.

121
00:09:22,513 --> 00:09:25,915
LHF: Well, I can't take credit
for that. That is Dave Lishansky,

122
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:32,320
our brilliant audio producer. He is a genius. 
I know you've had a chance to work with him,  

123
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,960
and everybody who's listening to this episode has 
had the privilege of being able to listen to his  

124
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:43,520
talent. He's just, he has a natural sense of how 
people listen and, like, when people need mental  

125
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:50,400
breaks, and how to—I mean, he always has said, and 
I'm looking at him because we have a video of him  

126
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:57,920
right over there over Zoom. And you've always 
said, Dave, that podcasting is a visual medium,  

127
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:04,080
and it is, because we have these imaginations, 
and as we're hearing, we're imagining what we're  

128
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,160
thinking and what we're hearing in our minds. And 
of course it forms for different people, and we  

129
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,480
have to carry people along like what you said. 
So another part of bringing listeners along on  

130
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:20,640
the story is a lot about trust, because one of the 
benefits, of course, is we're from MIT, so we have  

131
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,760
an incredible cadre of researchers and people that 
we can pull from for the show that brings a sense  

132
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:33,840
of credibility. But then also, we don't expect our 
listeners to take what we say for granted. We come  

133
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:38,960
with a lot of curiosity. We also try to come with 
a lot of skepticism. And what I mean by that is,  

134
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:43,600
a scientist is naturally skeptical. I mean, you 
know, you're a scientist, right? And journalists  

135
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:49,600
are also naturally skeptical. And so they're 
trying to not take things at face value. So in  

136
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,800
addition to explaining, kind of, what folks know 
about, what scientists know about climate change,  

137
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:01,600
we also try to communicate how they know what they 
know. So one of my favorite episodes was "TIL about  

138
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,600
planting trees." And the whole concept is like, 
well, can't we just plant a whole lot of trees,  

139
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,320
and like, if not, why not? And all of that. And 
so we took at it like, okay, let's actually get  

140
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,560
genuinely curious about that. And as part 
of that episode, we looked at—oh my gosh,  

141
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:20,800
we had to, talk about science communication. 
First, we had to start with like, okay, well,  

142
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:26,240
we have to explain how trees take up carbon 
and then emit carbon, right? Like I'm looking  

143
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:32,560
at Aaron Krol, our executive producer and writer 
for the show. Where we just spent a long time. I  

144
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,440
remember you and I spent a long time figuring that 
out, and redoing the calculations, and oh my gosh,  

145
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,640
it was a whole thing. Anyway, so we had to explain 
that part, and then explain how it works, like,  

146
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,480
inside of a tree. And then we realized, well, 
we're not really talking about trees. We're  

147
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,440
talking about forests, right? Because like, that's 
the scale that we're talking about here. And so  

148
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:59,680
when you want to measure the carbon dioxide uptake 
and release in a forest, there are like, these  

149
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:05,760
radio towers that can like, use sensors and like, 
you know, measure the air flow, and there all  

150
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,800
these calculations. So we're explaining how that 
works. But as we're explaining how that works,  

151
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:16,240
we're also demonstrating, like, okay, we know 
these things, but we don't know them perfectly. So  

152
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:22,160
it's like, we hope that, by explaining how things 
happen, it also elucidates some of the challenges  

153
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,825
that exist in trying to deal with climate change. 

154
00:12:25,825 --> 00:12:28,393
MG: Totally. And so we're talking a lot about sort  

155
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:33,600
of, these ideas of how to communicate the science, 
and the nitty-gritty of that stuff. But obviously,  

156
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:39,920
you know, I know a big focus for you in creating 
this show is also a focus on the solutions. And  

157
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:47,120
I think, and I have a lot of empathy for this 
feeling—I think it's very easy to feel doomed,  

158
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:53,040
and to feel scared, and to feel overwhelmed by 
the prospect of of climate change, and, you know,  

159
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,440
is it too late to do anything? What do we even 
do? Like, I think that's a totally understandable  

160
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,080
feeling. And something that I've really 
appreciated about the tone that you've created on  

161
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:07,120
the show is, I tend to leave the episodes feeling 
more motivated, you know, more like a sense of  

162
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,880
efficacy, a sense of possibility. And I'd love to 
hear, sort of, you know, you've been working on  

163
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,131
this show for many years, how you sort of molded 
that, how you thought about that.

164
00:13:16,131 --> 00:13:23,120
LHF: Man, I'm so thankful and grateful that you get that 
impression from listening to the show. It's  

165
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:29,600
definitely something that we prioritize. I don't 
feel doomed about climate change. And I've thought  

166
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:36,960
a lot about why that is. And I think a lot of it 
is because I do this work, and I am connected with  

167
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:44,800
so very many people, smart, committed, authentic, 
hardworking people, like thousands and thousands  

168
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,040
and thousands, and if you look at the global 
climate community, millions, who are working  

169
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:55,840
strategically on this issue. So I don't feel 
alone. And of course I'm concerned. I'm very  

170
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:02,080
concerned. We need to take action. But I think 
that feeling of, you said motivation, agency, and  

171
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:07,040
being a part of something, shifts the way that you 
interact with a problem, and that's part of what  

172
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:12,160
we want to bring to this show. Because the fact 
is, we have a lot of agency. There is a toolkit,  

173
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,320
a toolbelt of solutions that need to be employed, 
and there's a lot of work that needs to be done,  

174
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:21,280
and there's a lot of work that can be done. And 
so in every episode, we really try to focus on,  

175
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:26,560
okay, where is the sense of agency? What are 
the things that are holding back progress,  

176
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:31,120
but then can actually be done to move things 
forward? And I'm just thankful that we've been  

177
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,692
able to figure out a way to do that.

178
00:14:32,692 --> 00:14:36,862
MG: Yeah. So on this sense
of agency and efficacy that you've

179
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:42,400
tried to cultivate, you know, how do you go about 
that? What does that look like in the show? What  

180
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,534
has it looked like thus far?

181
00:14:43,534 --> 00:14:46,369
LHF: Yes. The reason why I sighed
is because it's something that we 

182
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:52,000
thought a lot about, and we've really wrestled 
with this topic, because we know this is not a  

183
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,120
"what I can do about climate change" show. And 
at the same time, a lot of people are wondering,  

184
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,480
what do I do about climate change? And we tackled 
this in an episode. So the point that we try to  

185
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:10,880
emphasize in the show is that climate change is a 
systems problem, and one individual is inside of  

186
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:17,200
a system. And so we need a systems change solution 
to this problem. Okay, that sounds very technical.  

187
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,480
It's very MIT, you know, what does that even 
mean? It just means that these things are big  

188
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:27,520
and complicated. So in that episode, we encouraged 
people, instead of asking "what can I do," to ask,  

189
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:33,600
"what can I influence?" What communities are they 
a part of that they can shift something there?  

190
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,840
Are there faith groups that have buildings and 
infrastructure where they can shape things? Are  

191
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:42,960
there nonprofit organizations that they're a part 
of that maybe could do advocacy work? You know,  

192
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:47,040
what are they—are they inside of a corporate 
infrastructure or a legal infrastructure where  

193
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,600
they could shift systems? Like, that's the kind 
of work that really needs to happen in order to  

194
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,960
deal with the systemic issue. So in all of our 
episodes, we try to frame it through that lens.  

195
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,640
Like, let me give you an example. We worked 
on an episode recently, you were involved in  

196
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:06,080
this episode, called "The Great Indoors," where 
we talked about buildings. And so we could have  

197
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:10,320
just focused on, okay, what are the steps that 
everybody needs to do to kind of retrofit their  

198
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,720
homes and have better energy efficiency and save 
money and blah blah blah. We did talk about that,  

199
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,680
but we didn't just talk about that, right? We also 
talked about the larger issue of like, okay, you  

200
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:27,440
can retrofit your own home, but how does a city, a 
state, a country, retrofit an old building stock,  

201
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,000
like existing building stock? And then what do we 
need to do—oops—what do we need to do on setting  

202
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,680
new building codes and new kinds of standards so 
that new buildings that get built abide by, like,  

203
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,400
certain kind of energy efficiency, da da da. So 
you can't—we can't just stop at the individual  

204
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:46,960
level. We really want people to be thinking of the 
larger picture. And part of it is, we know that  

205
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:51,120
there are all different people of all different 
walks of life who are listening to this show. We  

206
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:58,800
know that we have city planners and former mayors 
and policy staffers and people who have, you know,  

207
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:03,600
set procedural guidelines in their corporate 
infrastructure. Like, we know that people are  

208
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:09,680
listening to the show, and everybody has something 
that they can influence. So we really try to frame  

209
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:15,020
it so people can find themselves as best as we can 
inside of that context.

210
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,155
MG: Yeah. Yeah, I'm really 

211
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,320
glad you brought that up, because a concept that 
has greatly resonated with me, as I've learned  

212
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:26,080
more about climate communication, is one that—you 
know, there's a scientist and climate communicator  

213
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:31,600
who I really, really admire, Dr. Ayanna Elizabeth 
Johnson, and she talks about this concept of a  

214
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:37,280
climate action Venn diagram. So thinking about, 
you know, what am I good at? What are the things  

215
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:42,320
that need to be done? And what brings me joy? 
She talks about finding the intersection of  

216
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:49,440
those things. And I think that gets to this idea 
of, what are things that I can do, based on the  

217
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,240
networks, the communities, that I'm a part of. 
And as she mentions, it's important that it brings  

218
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,600
you joy, because that's something that you can 
keep doing, you know, and hopefully will derive  

219
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:05,280
satisfaction and fulfillment and purpose from. 
That really stuck with me. And so when I heard  

220
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:12,320
that episode that you mentioned, "TIL what I can 
do," which focused on this sort of framework,  

221
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:17,280
I really appreciated that, and I think going 
forward in the show, I hope that that's something  

222
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,871
that we can maintain.

223
00:18:18,871 --> 00:18:23,808
LHF: Well, speaking of which,
so I mean, what we talked about today are,  

224
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,720
you know, like the principles and the elements 
of the show that has made it the show that it is  

225
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,800
today. And when you came on board, you know, I'm 
really excited for you to keep championing that.  

226
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:37,600
And you have such an interesting background 
and like, such an interesting skill set,  

227
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:42,400
and I've heard rumblings that there are 
going to be some new elements to the show  

228
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,526
to take it to the next level. Can you give us 
any sneak peeks about this?

229
00:18:46,526 --> 00:18:52,560
MG: Yeah. Well, I think something that I have experience
with, and that is one of my favorite parts of doing  

230
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:56,400
this kind of work, is going out into the field 
and talking to people. You know, field reporting,  

231
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:02,800
specifically field audio reporting. Speaking of 
things that bring one joy, this brings me a good  

232
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:07,520
deal of joy, and it's something that I'm really 
excited to hopefully incorporate a bit more of  

233
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:13,040
in the show, in addition to sort of the sit-down 
interviews that listeners are used to. You know,  

234
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:19,600
climate solutions are being deployed now. And 
I think the chance to hear from people who are  

235
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,800
both working on those solutions, and working on 
the research, you know, that underpins them and  

236
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:30,240
whatnot, I think can be—hopefully can make things 
tangible for listeners. And so that's one thing,  

237
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:36,960
is this sort of on the ground look. And actually, 
you know, I had a chance recently to go out with  

238
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:42,240
some researchers from MIT who are doing some field 
work down on Cape Cod in a marsh there. You know,  

239
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:48,640
you spoke about how trees and other vegetation 
stores carbon, and so they are doing research in  

240
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:56,080
that realm. And I'm really excited to weave that 
into the show going forward. And then I think just  

241
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,240
this sense of momentum, this sense of possibility 
that you've talked about, that's something that I  

242
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:06,880
really will strive to maintain. I think that's 
super important. And something that you hear  

243
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,920
sometimes, and that has been very motivating to 
me—I know it made an appearance, this concept,  

244
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:17,840
in an episode—is that every fraction of a degree 
of warming that we can prevent matters. You know,  

245
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:25,840
we have these sorts of numerical thresholds that, 
you know, global agreements are aiming to avoid,  

246
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:32,160
but passing one doesn't mean, you know, throw in 
the towel and be done. And so that sense both of  

247
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:39,040
the urgency of doing something, and the fact that 
we can, and there are, like you said, a toolbelt  

248
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:44,560
of things. And people can leverage their networks, 
people can leverage their skills. There are so  

249
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:50,240
many, there are so many tools at our disposal, and 
that emphasis is one that I hope and that I will  

250
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,792
strive to continue on.

251
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:54,928
LHF: And there's also this incredible
opportunity for us to build something  

252
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:02,080
better than what we have now. On the show, of 
course. But also in the world, right? I mean, this  

253
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:08,640
is, a lot of conversation about climate change is 
escaping the worst impacts. And there's also the  

254
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,920
opportunity of, well, what can we build for the 
future that's better than what we have today? And  

255
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:19,680
that's the most important thing to look forward to.
MG: Yeah. So, speaking of the future, of  

256
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:26,800
the world and also of your life, can you tell us a 
little bit about what's next for you? What are you  

257
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,356
working on, and what can people look
forward to from you? 

258
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:33,658
LHF: Oh, thanks for asking that. So for

259
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:40,080
the last several years, I had just been fascinated 
by what's actually holding us back, right, and  

260
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,320
actually accelerating action on climate change. 
And it just became clear to me over and over again  

261
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:50,080
that the polarization, the political polarization 
of the issue of climate change, is I'd say one  

262
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:55,120
of the top, if not the top things in the United 
States. So the fact that one side of the political  

263
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,040
spectrum sees the issue differently than the other 
side of the political spectrum. And so I've been  

264
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:05,680
doing a deep investigation into that over the past 
couple years. One of the reasons I left MIT is to  

265
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:11,040
really pursue this completely and more fully. How 
can we build better bridges, better understanding,  

266
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:17,520
in order for climate change not to be a polarized 
issue anymore, and for us to decarbonize no matter  

267
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:25,280
what president is in office or who has power in 
Congress. So I could nerd out for another hours,  

268
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,600
hours and hours and hours and days and days, 
on all of that. If folks are interested in  

269
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:34,960
connecting with me on that topic, you can find me 
on LinkedIn. Who knows, maybe I'll do another show  

270
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:41,040
focused particularly on depolarization of climate. 
But that is where my heart is at right now,  

271
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:48,640
and I'm really excited to pursue it. And then 
speaking of, you know, my heart, I'm going to get  

272
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:57,280
corny here. So it's been such a, just a privilege 
and an honor that MIT entrusted me and our team  

273
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:03,520
with representing MIT research and philosophy 
through the show for a public audience. So that's  

274
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:11,280
been a true joy to be able to explore how to do. 
The podcast is one effort inside of a program,  

275
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:17,760
and we have a fabulous team. Aaron, you've been 
my partner in crime in making this so successful.  

276
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:24,560
Obviously Dave too on the show. And if folks 
don't know, check out climate.mit.edu for all  

277
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:31,360
the different resources that we have. It's been 
just a true joy to be able to produce something  

278
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:37,360
like this and for this show. And I just want to 
say to all of our listeners, you know, thank you  

279
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:43,840
so much for being here for the last seven seasons. 
It's been such a privilege to be able to have you  

280
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:48,880
in my head as we've been writing these episodes 
and producing them, and of course hearing from you  

281
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:54,480
over phone calls and emails and LinkedIn posts and 
everything else. I'm really looking forward to you  

282
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,038
continuing with us and the show.

283
00:23:56,038 --> 00:24:00,875
MG: All right. And to all of our
listeners—and to the folks watching  

284
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:06,720
this as well, since it is in video form, too—thank 
you so much for being here. We're really,  

285
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:16,560
really excited that you're here, and please stay 
tuned for the next season. I'm really excited.
