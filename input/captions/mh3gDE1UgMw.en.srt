2
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,879
here I have a circuit with a battery

3
00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:08,760
light bulb and GAP if I fill this Gap

4
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:11,639
with a metal the light comes on if I

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:14,040
fill this Gap with glass the light stays

6
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:16,520
off but what happens when I fill this

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,080
Gap with a silicon

8
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:21,039
wafer the light stays off so you might

9
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,760
think the silicon's an insulator but

10
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,760
what if I heat it

11
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:32,960
up it lights up

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,600
the Silicon is insulating at room

13
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,079
temperature but conducts electricity

14
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:40,000
when it's very hot it's a semiconductor

15
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,280
whose conductivity changes based on the

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,640
environment semiconductors have enabled

17
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,600
Electronics to become smaller faster and

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,640
more reliable you can cheaply add

19
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,360
transistors to almost any device you can

20
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,079
think of from spaceships to servers to

21
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,399
maybe even your toaster for more MIT

22
00:00:54,079 --> 00:01:00,079
moments from MIT open learning like
