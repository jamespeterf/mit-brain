00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:06,170
SILI DENG: I've been always
interested in science.

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:09,050
I got very much into
combustion because I

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,770
think it's an intellectually
challenging problem.

5
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:14,600

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,780
You can imagine in combustion
you have chemistry.

7
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,830
And you have fluid mechanics.

8
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,593
Each subject is very
rich in science.

9
00:00:22,593 --> 00:00:25,100

10
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,640
This also has very strong
engineering implications

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,270
and applications.

12
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:33,600
It's a hard problem.

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,250
It's an important problem.

14
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,930
That's why I wanted to
be working in this area.

15
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:43,550
So still now, 80% of the
global energy production

16
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:46,670
is from the combustion
of fossil fuels.

17
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:50,000
So how do we do the transition
from the heavy dependence

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,250
on fossil fuels to renewable
energy with storage?

19
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,650
So my group is really
targeting these three areas,

20
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,260
building up the
fundamental knowledge

21
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,980
on combustion processes.

22
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,050
Second is to develop alternative
fuels and metal combustion

23
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:08,190
to replace fossil fuels.

24
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:12,520
And the third is to have this
flame-based synthesis that

25
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,476
can bring down the cost of
generating battery materials.

26
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:20,380

27
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,530
I was first introduced
to flame synthesis

28
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:26,300
in my junior year in college.

29
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,810
At that time, I realized
you can actually

30
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:30,530
burn things to make things.

31
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,870
That was really fascinating.

32
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:38,200
So I wanted to study why and how
does particles form in flame?

33
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:43,150
Flame synthesis, this technology
actually can be dated back 3,000

34
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,380
years ago in ancient China.

35
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:50,270
This is a primary way of
making the black ink materials.

36
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:55,540
So what people did was burn
down vegetables or woods such

37
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,960
that afterwards they can
collect the solidified smoke

38
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,090
on the wall.

39
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:03,850
For our battery
applications, we can

40
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:08,680
try to fit in the same formula,
but of course with new tweaks.

41
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:13,490
We developed a technology called
flame-assisted spray pyrolysis.

42
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:15,320
So in short, it's called FASP.

43
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:19,870
We aim at FASP synthesis of
lithium-ion battery cathode

44
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,190
materials.

45
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:24,310
The cathode material for
lithium-ion batteries

46
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:29,500
contribute to 30% to 50%
of the cost of the battery.

47
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,320
The primary target
for us is to come up

48
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,020
with scalable
manufacturing methods

49
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:39,046
to reduce the cost of
producing battery materials.

50
00:02:39,046 --> 00:02:49,480

51
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,140
We are also very interested in
developing alternative fuels,

52
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,180
such as metals.

53
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:58,993
Aluminum, for example, have
been used for solid rockets.

54
00:02:58,993 --> 00:03:04,180

55
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,870
Nowadays, we are interested
in utilizing aluminum

56
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:11,350
as a fuel for
similar applications.

57
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:15,490
Because aluminum is
really abundant in Earth.

58
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:16,900
And it's cheap.

59
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,350
And it's available
to all the countries.

60
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:24,640
What we are trying to do is to
understand different regimes

61
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,500
that aluminum combusts and be
able to tailor its ignition

62
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,280
and propagation properties.

63
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,610
When I was a small kid,
when I watch TV shows,

64
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:39,750
I always got very
interested in detectives.

65
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,750
And I wanted to be one of them.

66
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:47,280
I feel that by doing research,
we are like detectives.

67
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,220
We are unfolding many
interesting science

68
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,270
and be able to leverage that.

69
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:55,960
We can also see a greater
impact in our daily lives,

70
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,360
in our society.

71
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,560
And that's what keeps me
going in scientific field.
