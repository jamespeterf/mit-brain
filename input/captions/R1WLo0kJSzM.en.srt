1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,679
If you take a slinky and stretch it out

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:06,319
like this, it represents the space

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:09,280
between Earth and the North Star. Quite

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:11,679
a ways to travel. But if we can somehow

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,840
find a way to expand the space behind us

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,200
and contract the space in front of us,

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,720
then we've made it most of the way to

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,960
the North Star without having moved

9
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,279
hardly at all. Now, this sounds like

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,880
science fiction, but NASA is actually

11
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,039
funding some really, really early

12
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,359
research related to the Alcubier warp

13
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,279
drive, which would allow us to appear to

14
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,679
be breaking the universe's speed limit

15
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,680
by bending space itself around us. The

16
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,360
space in this bubble hasn't been warped,

17
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,880
so you still experience time the same

18
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,640
way you normally would. That's different

19
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,399
from if your ship itself was traveling

20
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,879
close to the speed of light, where time

21
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,440
would pass more slowly. So all NASA's

22
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:47,440
doing now is trying to create teeny tiny

23
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,480
warp fields in order to see if this sort

24
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,160
of thing is even possible. And if it is,

25
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,879
we're still probably a millennium away

26
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,199
from actually using it. For more MIT
