1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,040
Hey, so I had written up a bunch of

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,800
closing comments and you'll be happy to

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,120
know that I'm not going to subject you

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,360
to all of them. I just want to make a

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,080
couple of points in uh closing up the

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:21,279
ceremony here. Uh well, the one thing I

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,519
do need to do is thank everybody. I I

8
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,439
want to thank uh well, the man behind

9
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,320
the curtain who you don't hear from but

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:32,800
makes everything work. um our wonderful

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:37,200
people from MIT audio video which do

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:38,640
what they do as as good as anyone and

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,920
it's testament to everything going

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,960
smoothly today. Also all the people uh

15
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,200
that haven't spoken up here today that

16
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,600
actually did all the work to make things

17
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,360
happen to do the registration everything

18
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,920
like that. So there was a lot that that

19
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:58,320
went into this. back and then especially

20
00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:00,640
I want to thank you the audience. I I

21
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,000
honestly think this is one of the best

22
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,479
audiences I've seen at at an MIT uh

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,400
event of this type. The uh engagement

24
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,960
was great. The questions were wonderful

25
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,880
and I think the speakers in some cases

26
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,680
enjoyed you as much as you enjoyed them.

27
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:19,840
So um I guess I can't ask you to clap

28
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:23,280
for yourselves but you should. Uh so uh

29
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,799
thanks. And now, um, I want to keep this

30
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,040
quick because if there's one thing I

31
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,200
learned in my years at MIT is you don't

32
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,880
want to get in between a room full of

33
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,479
hungry engineers and their pizza and

34
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:37,759
beer at the end of a long day. Uh, so

35
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:40,799
what I want to do is just end with a a

36
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:43,840
quick story and that's why I'm not going

37
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,640
to go in things I had prepared. But as I

38
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:50,159
sat through the different uh talks here

39
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,600
today, it reminded me of and this is

40
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,000
something that's happened to me several

41
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,680
times with working with ILP members and

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,759
my colleagues can say that it's happened

43
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,840
with them where when somebody comes to

44
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,119
visit MIT

45
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,960
particularly in this group was from

46
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,320
Europe. So when they came to Boston,

47
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,000
they set up a whole bunch of meetings

48
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,800
with a whole different comp bunch of

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,879
companies, not only MIT and then they

50
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,920
came on the last day to MIT and we did

51
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:16,160
rapidfire meetings with MIT faculty and

52
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,160
their comment was that wow this was

53
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,560
refreshing. We spent days with

54
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,920
consultants and and our vendors and

55
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,080
there's nothing wrong with them. I mean

56
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:27,360
they have a a living to make but we came

57
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,760
to MIT and we got this unfiltered

58
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,319
perspective from some of the people who

59
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,120
are the best at at what they do and it

60
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,800
was just really nice to hear that. So uh

61
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,040
I didn't hear a lot of like strong

62
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,480
pitches from MIT speakers that were here

63
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,319
today. So I'll make a little one for

64
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:47,280
them. Um they all want to work with our

65
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:49,040
industry partners and uh as I said this

66
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,400
morning our motto is mens at Manis or

67
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:56,319
mind in hand. Um, you all are the hand

68
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,920
and MIT wouldn't be MIT without the work

69
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,480
that we do with our entrepreneurs and

70
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,400
with our industry partners. So, if you

71
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,120
saw things that were interesting here

72
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,200
today, um, for all the ILP members,

73
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,760
which is most of you, please contact

74
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,360
your program director and have them make

75
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,200
the connections for you so you can

76
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,200
continue those conversations. And they

77
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,640
could be just talks, they could be

78
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,720
exchange of data, they could be

79
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,720
sponsored research.

80
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,319
the field is wide open for that. But the

81
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,200
all of the MIT speakers that we're

82
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,879
talking to here today, I know that they

83
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,040
would love to hear from you and to

84
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:31,680
continue that conversation. So, please

85
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:35,599
do that. Uh so, with that, we'll

86
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,680
conclude MIT Data Center Day. Thank you

87
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,680
all for being here. Thank you all for

88
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,599
the folks online. I'm sorry you won't

89
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,440
join us for the pizza and beer, but

90
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:46,959
we'll we'll raise a we'll raise a toast

91
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,959
to you on that. Uh thank you. Hope to

92
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,959
see you all again soon. On to the

93
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,959
networking.
