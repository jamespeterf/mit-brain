00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,550
I'm Cara Miller and I'm Rob Stoner and

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:14,769
this is what if it

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:14,769
[Music]

4
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:21,320
works from the MIT energy initiative

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,240
this is what if it works a podcast

6
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,400
looking at the energy solutions for

7
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,840
climate change I'm Cara Miller you might

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,840
know me from the public radio program

9
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,519
Innovation Hub which I hosted and now

10
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,119
write the big idea column for the Boston

11
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:33,680
Globe and I'm Robert Stoner the

12
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:37,559
president of the Kendall Square project

13
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,559
and former director of the MIT energy

14
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,680
initiative and today we're talking with

15
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:45,360
Ernest munes former Secretary of Energy

16
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:47,239
under President Obama about what role

17
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,920
government has played in the energy

18
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:52,920
transition what role it can play and

19
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,120
what role it will play I think the first

20
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:59,719
thing to say without being polanish

21
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:02,680
about this is that Trump 1.0 had far

22
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:05,799
less impact on what was actually

23
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:08,640
happening in decarbonization for example

24
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:10,840
than many think and yeah you can't

25
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,119
really talk about decarbonization at

26
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:16,520
least not in the US if you don't look

27
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:20,400
ahead at our looming election and how a

28
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:23,520
second Trump term might unfold sure the

29
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:27,079
uh the Paris agreement was tossed out

30
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:29,640
now tossed back in by President Biden

31
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:32,159
but the Paris agreement in and of itself

32
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,920
does not present solutions to the carbon

33
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,240
challenge to the clean energy transition

34
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,880
mon is now the Cecil and Ida green

35
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:41,360
ameritus professor of physics and

36
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,360
Engineering Systems at MIT he's the

37
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,920
founding director of the MIT energy

38
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,799
initiative and the CEO of the Energy

39
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,520
Futures and nuclear threat initiatives I

40
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:54,240
asked him if Trump were to return to the

41
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,640
White House having explicitly said that

42
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,680
climate change is quote unquote

43
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,360
non-existent with the private sector

44
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,479
step in what would happen and what would

45
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,880
become of President Biden's Marquee

46
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:09,000
energy legislation the inflation

47
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:11,039
reduction act the IRA legislation that

48
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,720
vice president Harris where she to

49
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:17,640
become president in 2025 would

50
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:20,560
presumably build on Mon says it's not

51
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:24,280
all about the president whoever that is

52
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,800
frankly it's complicated the reality is

53
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:30,560
Congress has supported the clean

54
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:33,680
energy Technology Innovation agenda

55
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,519
pretty consistently in a bipartisan way

56
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,400
in a bipartisan way um especially in

57
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:43,840
areas like nuclear energy carbon capture

58
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:45,879
and sequestration Etc frankly uh you put

59
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,319
your finger on one of the important

60
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:52,200
Dynamics namely the private sector in

61
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:56,519
many ways kept carrying the clean energy

62
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:58,720
transition forward during Trump uh 1.0

63
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:02,360
and obviously uh with the support of the

64
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:05,080
current Administration Biden 1.0 but the

65
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:08,000
reality is private sector takes a lot of

66
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:10,360
risk uh with a lot of capital they don't

67
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,360
have a four-year time Horizon in the

68
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:15,159
energy business uh for sure it's a much

69
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:19,920
longer one and I believe that for many

70
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:23,319
years now the private sector has almost

71
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:25,640
entirely acknowledged that we are having

72
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:28,959
and we will continue to have a low

73
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:31,599
carbon transition the pace and the scale

74
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:34,480
are not fully understood but I think

75
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:37,159
there's a an understandable reluctance

76
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:40,159
to put a lot of money on the table for

77
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:43,480
uh carbonization when those could easily

78
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:46,120
become uh stranded assets however if

79
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:48,519
former president Trump wins the election

80
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:53,280
I think we have to distinguish between

81
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:58,079
two different Pathways one is that Trump

82
00:03:53,280 --> 00:04:01,720
wins and the Republican Party takes both

83
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:05,920
chambers of Congress versus Trump wins

84
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:08,480
and the Democrats retain one chamber of

85
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,640
Congress or both but at least one

86
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,439
because the legislative options are then

87
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,799
quite

88
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:18,479
different however if president Trump

89
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,759
wins and controls if you like both

90
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,320
chambers of

91
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:25,840
Congress then a very important approach

92
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:28,240
to anything with budgetary implications

93
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,960
can come into play It's called

94
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,639
technically reconciliation

95
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:37,080
basically what it amounts to is any

96
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:39,400
budget related uh activity can then pass

97
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:41,639
with a simple majority in the Senate

98
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:45,520
versus the usual 60

99
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:47,960
votes the dots often aren't connected

100
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:52,800
that the last three

101
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:55,720
presidencies Obama Trump 1.0 and Biden

102
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,160
1.0 have all had their signature

103
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:00,520
legislative achievements accomplished

104
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,600
through reconciliation

105
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:06,800
Obamacare Trump tax cuts and

106
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,120
Ira so the difference between

107
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,240
controlling both Chambers and only one

108
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:16,160
chamber can be quite uh

109
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,639
significant if the one chamber scenario

110
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,120
plays out

111
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:23,880
however a trump presidency while being

112
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,720
very limited in its legislative

113
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,199
flexibility will still retain enormous

114
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,080
administrative

115
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:34,240
flexibility so for for example the

116
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,880
IRA I would find it very hard to believe

117
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,880
that the IRA would be

118
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:44,160
repealed in that scenario or that it

119
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:45,440
would be even modified in any very very

120
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,759
substantial

121
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:52,919
way however the president it's not

122
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:56,600
immediate it takes time to go through Ru

123
00:05:52,919 --> 00:06:00,080
making but the ru making done in this

124
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:03,919
case by the treasury Department is very

125
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:06,440
very significant in terms of how the tax

126
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:09,160
credits in this case the IRA let's say

127
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:12,120
can be utilized there clearly will be

128
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:14,680
push back in that scenario from some

129
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:17,639
Republican Governors and and States

130
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:20,639
including members of Congress because

131
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:23,280
they have already grown to like various

132
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,280
aspects of this legislation like they

133
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,560
have wind farms and they're they have

134
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,160
wind farms they have they have hydrogen

135
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:33,599
hubs they have all kinds of things uh

136
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,960
existing or coming but nevertheless I

137
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:38,960
think in that scenario one would see

138
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:41,880
some significant administrative actions

139
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,400
taken by a trump presidency that would

140
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:46,840
certainly slow down although not

141
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,080
entirely derail in my view the low

142
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,080
carbon

143
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,560
transition you know I have a question

144
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,520
kind of for both of you since you've

145
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,240
both thought a lot about companies and

146
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,520
how they intersect with governments you

147
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,120
said something very interesting about

148
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:03,639
this idea

149
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:05,319
of that Trump 1.0 didn't send back the

150
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:07,039
clean energy agenda as much as you might

151
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:09,800
think a lot of Private Industry stepped

152
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:13,280
in are they doing that because a

153
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:16,039
consumers demand it B they've made like

154
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,520
ESG commitments to shareholders like why

155
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:19,720
are they doing that why are they

156
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,919
stepping in I think it's my sense is

157
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:24,840
that there's a social global social

158
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:27,479
movement toward decarbonizing the

159
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:29,520
economy in recognition of the importance

160
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:31,280
of addressing the climate change problem

161
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,639
so it's happening and and I don't think

162
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,400
the US is in a position to go it alone

163
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:38,319
and in the opposite direction nor is it

164
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,479
in our self-interest to do that okay so

165
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:43,520
they might be culturally ostracized for

166
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:45,120
not making the transition even if the

167
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,840
administration says well we don't care

168
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,280
about this think be culturally

169
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,680
ostracized I think they'll be investing

170
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,000
in stuff that's not going to have any

171
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,720
value in in the relatively near future

172
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,879
and that's a problem well OB would just

173
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:59,080
add that of course many of the large

174
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,159
corporations well all of the very large

175
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:05,440
corporation ations for sure are Global

176
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:07,080
in nature so they are satisfying Market

177
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,720
requirements in many many different

178
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:12,759
places and of course the large markets

179
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,319
are by definition in the developed

180
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:17,919
countries I'm not saying that they are

181
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:20,319
ignoring in any sense the developing and

182
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,800
emerging economies but the really big

183
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:25,280
markets the really big economies United

184
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,000
States Europe Japan of course you have

185
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:30,879
to add China in there which is I would

186
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,320
say mixed in terms of developed an

187
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:37,680
emerging emerging economy uh but China

188
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:40,519
itself of course has moved its Market in

189
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,800
many sectors pretty strongly towards the

190
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:44,480
energy transition not in all uh coal

191
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,440
plants remain obviously a very very

192
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,040
important part of their electricity

193
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,920
generation but for example right now in

194
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,760
the news uh it's all about electric

195
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:56,480
vehicles and what's going to happen as

196
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,839
they strive for the export Market we

197
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,040
know that they are already leader in

198
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:03,560
deployment uh and an export of of

199
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:06,320
renewable Technologies they've made

200
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:08,720
major commitments in this area and when

201
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,560
all is said and done I would go back to

202
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,480
what I said earlier even if the pace and

203
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:18,279
scale of the clean energy transition is

204
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:20,279
not understood not easily predictable I

205
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:22,880
mean we know what we would like but we

206
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:26,600
don't know what we're going to get when

207
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:29,959
the reality is We are following the

208
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:32,040
historical path of decarbonization of of

209
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:34,600
the Energy System you know we can go

210
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:36,120
into why that that's happening but but I

211
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:39,000
think it's a fact I think the private

212
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,600
sector understands and that's why fossil

213
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
fuel companies for example the oil and

214
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:45,440
gas companies it would be incorrect to

215
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,079
not think that they are genuinely

216
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:51,040
hedging their bets on the future in

217
00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:53,200
terms of looking at Connected areas to

218
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,839
what they do like carbon capture and

219
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,880
sequestration and and hydrogen but you

220
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,600
also see some of the especially the

221
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:02,920
international oil andas gas companies

222
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,880
some of them going heavily into the

223
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:08,000
power sector for example with Renewables

224
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:11,040
so anyway I I just think it's a real

225
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:16,519
secular Trend just with uncertain pace

226
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:21,880
and scale I personally think that the

227
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:24,920
public interest in and pressure towards

228
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:27,560
decarbonization Will tip the political

229
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:30,800
system including in the United States

230
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:33,399
mainly through the impacts of extreme

231
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,360
weather the reality is and I'm not going

232
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:37,600
to get into the science of it but I

233
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,880
think the reality is that polling shows

234
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,240
that the public is more and more

235
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:44,959
certainly associating extreme weather

236
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,680
with global warming and climate change

237
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:50,959
uh they are seeing in many parts of the

238
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:54,320
country uh impact of things like

239
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:57,040
skyrocketing insurance rates we've had

240
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,839
some significant electricity outages in

241
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,880
various parts of the country from

242
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:03,399
extreme weather it's only going to

243
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:06,880
increase uh uh it's been predicted for a

244
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:10,720
long time it's happening and frankly I

245
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:13,399
don't want to sound uh kinly here but

246
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:16,680
the reality is the extreme weather and

247
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:21,200
the consequences of extreme weather are

248
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:23,880
more and more bringing a focus on the

249
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,480
impacts to the current generation as

250
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:28,040
opposed to Future

251
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:31,440
Generations we all knew the arguments

252
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:34,560
about preser serving the environment etc

253
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:37,120
for our grandchildren and uh we love our

254
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,160
grandchildren and our children but when

255
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,079
it's being felt in the pocketbook right

256
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:44,399
now I think that the attitudes are

257
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,680
shifting dramatically and eventually

258
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,200
that is what tips the political system

259
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,120
and my sense is that globally

260
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:53,360
governments around the world have taken

261
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:55,720
on board at some level as if their

262
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,440
societies that there's a problem here

263
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,519
and they have to address it and they've

264
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,320
begun to move that way and it's amazing

265
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:05,200
the degree there is inertia now in this

266
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:08,600
transition I mean large segments of the

267
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:11,200
Chinese economy for example now are

268
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,199
focused on becoming the renewable energy

269
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,199
manufacturer to the world I mean they

270
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:16,600
they did it with solar panels they've

271
00:12:15,199 --> 00:12:18,680
done it with lithium ion batteries

272
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,920
they're trying to do it with EVS but

273
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:22,720
even even another area is steel you know

274
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:24,560
they're a huge steel producer and

275
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,320
they're very aware of carbon border

276
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,240
adjustment taxes beginning to come into

277
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,839
effect in Europe talk of tariffs in this

278
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,760
country and the use of tariffs as a

279
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:36,720
weapon very aware that their economy is

280
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,920
vulnerable to being too carbon intensive

281
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,480
in the not very far future and and in a

282
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:44,000
curious way they are the ones who are

283
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,880
driving the transition by enabling us

284
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,720
and moving very quickly themselves

285
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,920
there's always in the climate business

286
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:53,000
the uh the tragedy of the commons if you

287
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:55,600
like but the reality is that a place

288
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,639
like China for example the leadership

289
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,240
recognizes that the impacts of global

290
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,199
warming and climate change are going to

291
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,800
be felt very very directly in China and

292
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:08,040
there are other parts of the world the

293
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:11,480
Middle East is is an example where the

294
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:13,560
predictions of of heat and drought Etc

295
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:16,399
are really very very substantial and of

296
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:19,199
course fires the United States we've had

297
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:23,000
that but look at Canada look at many

298
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:25,440
places the exact manifestation of the

299
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,199
issues can be quite geographically

300
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,720
different but they tend to be pretty

301
00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:32,720
uniform in terms of some

302
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:34,839
uh at least being very very socially

303
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,320
disruptive if I could go back Cara to

304
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:41,560
your original question just add one more

305
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:43,880
element of a stabilizing influence in

306
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:45,639
terms of how we go forward irrespective

307
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:50,079
of the coming

308
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:52,720
election the Ukraine war in particular

309
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,759
clearly put energy security onto the

310
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,120
front

311
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:58,320
burner and personally it's frankly it's

312
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,880
something that I've been saying for a

313
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,759
long long time

314
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:05,440
that the climate discussion the energy

315
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:08,360
security discussion and the social

316
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:12,160
Equity discussion should be viewed as

317
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:15,880
one discussion and not three separate

318
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:20,120
ones in the energy security

319
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:22,720
world after Russia's initial invasion of

320
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:24,839
Ukraine which I remind everyone was in

321
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:28,720
2014 not in

322
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:31,759
2022 the G7 in the EU I was energy

323
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:35,759
Secret at the time very explicitly came

324
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:39,160
together to kind of refresh uh how one

325
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:40,880
looked at energy security a refreshment

326
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:43,040
that really had not been done since the

327
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:48,440
oil embargos of the

328
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:51,720
1970s and one of the aspects of that

329
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:54,920
relook if you like was to explicitly

330
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:58,199
connect decarbonized energy sources with

331
00:14:54,920 --> 00:15:01,600
energy security turning it around energy

332
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:03,480
insecurity is all about carbon and so I

333
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:08,399
think those conversations coming

334
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:10,880
together is also part of the reason why

335
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:13,959
we we clearly will have change depending

336
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:16,320
upon the election outcome but perhaps

337
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:17,959
not as Extreme as many think and

338
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,079
interestingly in in the new world of

339
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:22,759
renewable energy you can become energy

340
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:25,320
insecure by failing to have access to

341
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:27,720
critical materials by failing to have a

342
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,880
robust manufacturing sector by failing

343
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,759
to have access to cheap Capital it's an

344
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:33,600
opportunity for China to become very

345
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:36,600
energy secure where they haven't been in

346
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,240
the past except for coal but it's an

347
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,639
opportunity for the the United States if

348
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,759
it falls behind to become energy

349
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:44,360
insecure in in a way we really don't

350
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:46,319
want to and and so this is I think it's

351
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,319
a transition in the motivations and

352
00:15:46,319 --> 00:15:50,920
thinking that that governments had to

353
00:15:48,319 --> 00:15:53,000
undergo the third element just put put

354
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:56,600
on the table now again uh the the social

355
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,160
Equity part and here at MIT at the MIT

356
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,000
energy initiative and the Center for

357
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,480
Energy environment policy research we've

358
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,399
been doing now for six years the

359
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,040
so-called Roosevelt project the

360
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:09,000
Roosevelt project is all based on the

361
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,240
premise which I think is

362
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,839
incontrovertible and uh regrettably

363
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:17,399
becoming more and more clear that if we

364
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:19,560
do not address the legitimate concerns

365
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:22,079
of workers and communities about the

366
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:26,160
clean energy transition uh and have

367
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:28,519
affordable energy have a future for

368
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:31,839
these workers and communities we will

369
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:33,959
have intense headwinds in the clean

370
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,399
energy transition like political

371
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:38,759
opposition that's been seen the yellow

372
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:41,279
jackets in Europe for example was all

373
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:43,279
about the cost of energy we've seen it

374
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:45,199
here in the United States uh we're

375
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:47,480
seeing it in some of the major

376
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:49,759
especially again in Europe their recent

377
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:52,880
elections well let's face it have not

378
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:55,399
been pretty and the issues of what is

379
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,600
bubbling to the top of the priority list

380
00:16:55,399 --> 00:17:00,720
was part and parcel of their drift to

381
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:03,440
the right so we have to balance clean

382
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,880
energy transition pace and scale with

383
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,360
energy security with affordability

384
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:10,760
reliability social Equity if we are

385
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:12,919
going to succeed in my view at any of

386
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:14,880
them and we need to succeed at all of

387
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:18,280
them you know I think the Europeans have

388
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:21,160
once again reinforced Kermit the Frog's

389
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:22,760
claim that it isn't easy being green and

390
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:25,280
the greens suffered a real setback in

391
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:27,439
this election and it's because I think

392
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:30,120
they're perceived to be driving the cost

393
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:32,720
of energy higher maybe not rightly but

394
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:34,160
with policies that insist on renewable

395
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,400
energy and investment in renewable

396
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,120
energy I'm not an expert on European

397
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,200
politics but I I think that the politics

398
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:43,360
are shifting around this as well

399
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,559
becoming more pragmatic in many ways so

400
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,480
I think this brings up an interesting

401
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:50,960
question which is if in Trump 1.0

402
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,600
climate policies did not get set back as

403
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,720
much as one might think that the private

404
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:57,600
sector no I didn't I didn't say climate

405
00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:00,000
policies didn't get S back I climate

406
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:03,360
decarbonization Okay uh did not somehow

407
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,280
halt okay um because maybe the private

408
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,640
sector understands that if you're a car

409
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,360
company where you still have to compete

410
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,120
with companies around the world you you

411
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:12,840
know it doesn't necessarily ma

412
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:15,080
presidents change but there's a sort of

413
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:19,480
competitive trajectory you have to

414
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:21,400
understand then what is the right role

415
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,640
for government like what things should

416
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:26,480
governments be doing and what things do

417
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:28,159
governments not need to do because other

418
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,480
parts of society will take care of those

419
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:32,159
things

420
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,480
well first of all let me emphasize the

421
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:37,120
Innovation

422
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:40,480
agenda involving technology and business

423
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:43,200
models and policy those are all part of

424
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:46,880
an innovation agenda now the business

425
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,720
model uh Innovation is by definition

426
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,280
primarily obviously in the private

427
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,880
sector Technology Innovation side

428
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:56,760
there's no doubt that there remains a

429
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:59,240
critical role for the government at the

430
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:01,720
early stages if you like of the of the

431
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:03,520
Innovation uh road map certainly

432
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:06,559
supporting a lot of the crosscutting

433
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,880
basic science uh that that is needed

434
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:11,960
supporting uh some of the certainly the

435
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:15,720
early stage technology developments uh

436
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:18,200
building on that science in general but

437
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,360
I would posit and this becomes more and

438
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,880
more

439
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:26,559
controversial that the place where we

440
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:29,039
are at in terms of addressing climate

441
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:33,600
change in the technology ology

442
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:34,880
Innovation space I think needs to go to

443
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,960
the advanced

444
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:40,679
demonstration and early deployment

445
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:42,799
stages what is again called industrial

446
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:45,320
industrial strategy well so you're

447
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:49,600
seeing it today uh the infrastructure

448
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:52,840
law with regard to the uh energy sector

449
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:56,720
is supporting things like for example

450
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:59,840
hydrogen hubs there's going to be seven

451
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:02,120
or up to seven uh hydrogen hubs in

452
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,440
different parts of the country that is

453
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:07,400
trying to say that look we the

454
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:09,640
government we want to Kickstart both

455
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:12,480
hydrogen Supply and hydrogen

456
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:15,799
demand uh formation whether that will

457
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:18,960
happen uh remains to be seen but that's

458
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:22,280
a bet if you like the infrastructure law

459
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,159
similarly uh put forward carbon capture

460
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:26,159
and

461
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:29,919
sequestration hubs same idea to make

462
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:32,559
hubs specific locations to advance that

463
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:36,080
the government has been very very active

464
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:39,120
in uh trying to promote nuclear power

465
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:42,400
deployment in the United States we just

466
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:45,840
had uh recently the celebration of the

467
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:47,960
two new nuclear power plants uh coming

468
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:50,280
that came online in Georgia it was more

469
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:53,480
of a sigh of relief than a celebration

470
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:55,799
was um no it was a genuine celebration

471
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:58,159
uh the budget and the schedule were not

472
00:20:55,799 --> 00:21:01,480
for the faint of heart but I will say

473
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:05,840
that uh um I was there these are called

474
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:09,480
the Vogal three and four units but I was

475
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:12,520
uh very happy to have a an extensive

476
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:14,120
tour of the new plants and I have to

477
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:18,240
tell you there's there was a visual

478
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:20,600
there that really impressed one namely

479
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,840
there was a screen showing the

480
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:26,679
instantaneous power output of the four

481
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:29,600
Vogal reactors every one of them

482
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:34,880
basically pegged at one point .2

483
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:36,559
gaw 4.8 GW of clean electrons coming out

484
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,400
it's pretty impressive it's similar to

485
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:41,080
the total amount of offshore wind energy

486
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:44,840
we might ever get well we'll we'll see

487
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:47,200
but um and it emphasized that it's

488
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:51,200
serving a very important function having

489
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:53,679
those almost 5 GW of firm power not

490
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:57,600
variable power but firm power like all

491
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:59,679
the time all the dispatchable ETC and in

492
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:02,679
fact so the reason I really mentioned

493
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:05,279
vogle vogle 3 and four were the two new

494
00:22:02,679 --> 00:22:07,559
units the governor of Georgia Governor

495
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:10,600
Kemp Republican going back to the

496
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:13,000
earlier conversation he said publicly

497
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:16,159
surprised a lot of people when he said I

498
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,960
want to see Vogal 5 that means six as

499
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:20,880
well but the point is there's the the in

500
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:24,760
this case for example the department of

501
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:27,520
energy uh provided loan support to build

502
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:30,000
those reactors the department of energy

503
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:32,600
has Prov provided funding for two

504
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,679
so-called Generation 4 that has advanced

505
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:38,440
non-l lightwater reactors for the future

506
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:41,159
so the government is playing certainly

507
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:45,039
an important role there where the

508
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:47,320
motivations include the economy energy

509
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:50,840
security and the like but the fact is

510
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:53,200
it's clean firm power that we are going

511
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:57,200
to need a lot more of in the United

512
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:59,039
States in my view as we necessarily also

513
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,640
build up wind and soil

514
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:05,080
with some storage attached to it because

515
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:06,760
the reality is wind and solar very very

516
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:09,159
attractive the costs have come down

517
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:11,400
dramatically the cost of batteries have

518
00:23:09,159 --> 00:23:13,919
come down dramatically for storage it

519
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:17,200
doesn't change the fact that they are

520
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:21,000
weather dependent sources and even in a

521
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:23,840
place like Texas where we have the most

522
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:27,559
Wind by far in the United States the

523
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:31,279
reality is in Texas in a typical year

524
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:33,919
there are probably 90 days 9 Z days in

525
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:36,919
that year with essentially no wind in

526
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:39,039
Texas and the Order of a week and a half

527
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:42,840
in a row of no

528
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:46,000
wind you got to have firm power to

529
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:48,000
complement the variable power and we're

530
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,600
going to have to find new ways of

531
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,400
organizing our electricity system to

532
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:56,120
Value much more The Firm power

533
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:59,320
contributions to Value the backup

534
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:04,520
contributions you can't run a system

535
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:06,760
if half or 70% of the electricity Source

536
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:09,159
may go away for over a week you're going

537
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:11,279
to have to have backup somebody has to

538
00:24:09,159 --> 00:24:15,720
pay for it so we have a lot of work to

539
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:18,360
do to make this system work together but

540
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:20,919
frankly if we don't get there it won't

541
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:22,320
be because the technology isn't ready we

542
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:25,200
have a lot of Technology now we're going

543
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:27,960
to have a lot more technology in 10 15

544
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:30,279
20 years but we need the whole system to

545
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:34,200
function together including with

546
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:38,320
business model policy and Regulatory

547
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:42,080
Innovation right now we have a lot of

548
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:44,919
silos I would argue that for example

549
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:48,080
there are not very many people in

550
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:51,120
government who really understand how

551
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:53,559
large investment decisions are made by

552
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:57,200
the various players who do have very

553
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:59,880
Deep Pockets uh but are very committed

554
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,200
to uh using those Deep Pockets to get

555
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:03,000
them

556
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,760
deeper are we talking about private

557
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,720
sector companies here I'm talking about

558
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:09,600
corporations talking about Banks talking

559
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:12,640
about Pension funds uh there are many

560
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:15,760
many pockets of of deep Capital which

561
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:18,039
have also especially in the financial

562
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:20,559
sector as opposed to the corporate world

563
00:25:18,039 --> 00:25:25,159
they have many many options as to how to

564
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:28,600
deploy those funds for maximizing return

565
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:31,159
which is the probably the highest level

566
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:33,679
priority for them they do want to

567
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:36,799
diversify and they are also hedging

568
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:39,640
their Futures etc etc but fundamentally

569
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:44,279
you have to make the Investments

570
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:47,679
investable and often policy makers don't

571
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:50,159
realize when a policy is not constructed

572
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:52,640
well to encourage the deployment of that

573
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:54,240
Capital but turning it around I would

574
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,720
say there aren't there aren't that many

575
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:59,640
players on Wall Street for example who

576
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:02,799
really understand how policy is made so

577
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:04,159
we need a lot of convening also of these

578
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:06,360
different sectors and of course the

579
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:08,440
Strategic investors like the corporates

580
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:11,640
for example they really need to come

581
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:14,480
together in ways that uh support the

582
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:16,520
investability of clean energy projects

583
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,159
they're the ones that have the trillions

584
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,960
maybe the tens of trillions in this

585
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,919
country that need to get deployed to get

586
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:23,200
these things out there yeah and and it's

587
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,520
they've got to have a profit motive for

588
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:28,960
doing it I think it our colleague David

589
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:31,919
Victor I think is UCSD

590
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:35,240
said the other day in a conversation

591
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:37,159
that you know clean energy Finance isn't

592
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,240
going to be clean energy Finance until

593
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:40,679
it's just

594
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,200
finance and I think that's right I mean

595
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:45,080
we've got to get these costs down there

596
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:47,240
but but that doesn't mean that policy

597
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:49,799
consistency by the federal government

598
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:51,799
and and strong signals isn't needed both

599
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:53,600
are and I and I and I do think we're at

600
00:26:51,799 --> 00:26:55,240
some risk with the Trump Administration

601
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:58,000
although I don't think we're at risk of

602
00:26:55,240 --> 00:27:00,080
of the the IRA or the B being canceled

603
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,919
or unfunded or they maybe slowed down a

604
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:05,080
bit I think we're more at risk of

605
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,760
inconsistency in policy that that might

606
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:08,840
cause some of that private sector money

607
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:10,600
to hang back a little bit because it's

608
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:13,480
not sure where we're going well on the

609
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:15,600
on the positive side I think one of the

610
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:19,159
very positive developments let's say in

611
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:22,600
the ira was precisely by changing the

612
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:25,440
time Horizon for the credits to 10 years

613
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:27,640
rather than the historically you know

614
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:30,559
one or twoe kinds of Horizons which

615
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:33,720
really impeded progress that's an

616
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:36,520
example of the policy world not having

617
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:38,320
really understood how to put their

618
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:41,760
incentives in place in ways that would

619
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:44,919
really incentivize but the reality is

620
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:47,000
today including in Biden Administration

621
00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:49,799
has put some pretty forward-leaning

622
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:53,080
programs out there but the reality is

623
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:55,640
our approach uh in the United States I

624
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:59,519
would call carrots and

625
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:02,600
twigs uh the uh A variation on a theme

626
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:04,880
okay correct um and um and eventually

627
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,799
there won't be enough carrots that is if

628
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,720
we

629
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:12,159
succeed in this incentivization approach

630
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:15,799
eventually we don't have enough money in

631
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:19,039
the public sector to uh just keep

632
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:21,600
pouring money into clean energy programs

633
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:23,760
that are in fact scaling that's where we

634
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:26,320
have to make that transition to the

635
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:28,720
private sector and it's very unlikely

636
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:32,320
for that to happen in my view until we

637
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,919
get to a real carrots and sticks I mean

638
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:36,360
by Sticks what do I mean I mean for

639
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:39,240
example a carbon emissions price would

640
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:42,240
be would be an example uh and that that

641
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:45,799
resets the whole playing field it resets

642
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:47,880
how an investor makes decisions because

643
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:51,320
uh once we go to a carbon price it's

644
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:53,399
kind of assumed that um that will be in

645
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:55,559
place for a long long time and may be

646
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:58,200
growing over time and that that

647
00:28:55,559 --> 00:29:01,720
influences which projects are going to

648
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:05,320
be profitable so I think that carrots

649
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:07,679
and twigs is the right policy now

650
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:10,679
frankly it's the only practical policy

651
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:13,559
uh right now but eventually and I just

652
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:15,799
can't say when I do think that the

653
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:18,440
extreme weather is going to tip the

654
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:20,960
political equation towards a real

655
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:24,640
negotiation in terms of uh how we are

656
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:28,320
going to condition the energy

657
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:31,519
Marketplace for a transition and I do

658
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:34,080
want to emphasize the word transition

659
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:36,559
because unfortunately too many of our

660
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:39,559
colleagues involved in the climate

661
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:41,600
discussion indulge themselves into

662
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:44,159
telling us how wonderful it's going to

663
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:46,720
be in

664
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:50,080
2050 but don't want to talk about the

665
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:53,200
hard work of 25 years of

666
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:56,840
transition that's what it's

667
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:59,799
about cuz if we don't have that

668
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:01,399
Viewpoint again to NE dots earlier will

669
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:05,240
never be able to address the social

670
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:08,440
Equity challenges without a real focus

671
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:11,399
on transition getting from here to there

672
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:13,640
what's the road map and so the point is

673
00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:15,519
we have a lot of these pieces on the go

674
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:18,840
board but we have to start connecting

675
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:22,200
them and having a a long-term plan uh

676
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:22,200
how how that game of Go

677
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:26,559
[Music]

678
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,120
finishes so rnie you talked about

679
00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:32,480
conditioning the marketplace which I

680
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,640
assume is

681
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,760
euphemistic way of talking about carbon

682
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:39,440
taxes at some level you mentioned carbon

683
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:42,919
taxes I said

684
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:44,799
pricing carbon how it goes in government

685
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:46,679
I I remember interviewing a couple

686
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,960
economists years ago I mean it had to be

687
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:51,480
10 years ago one of them being John

688
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:53,320
grber here at MIT of various stripes or

689
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:55,159
Republicans people had served in George

690
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,840
Bush's Administration they all agreed

691
00:30:55,159 --> 00:30:58,840
there should be a carbon tax which I

692
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:01,760
just remember being the most shocking

693
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:03,559
conversation because at least economists

694
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,799
were in that at that time were kind of

695
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:08,880
on the same page but yes and that's late

696
00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:11,919
in the game I mean Waxman Marky 2008

697
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:14,120
2009 2010 was we were so close and and

698
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:15,600
Obama made a choice it was it was he

699
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:17,919
going to spend his political capital on

700
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:20,360
that or Obamacare I think he probably

701
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:22,120
made the right choice that time but it

702
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:24,720
does beg the question are we ever going

703
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:27,440
to get to a carbon tax in the United

704
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,159
States or anywhere or is that just a

705
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,600
latent threat that the government can

706
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:33,120
sort of hang over the head of the

707
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:36,080
economy that drives the economy toward

708
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:39,039
doing the right thing for other reasons

709
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:41,760
I I personally believe that we

710
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:45,919
will that Tipping Point I mentioned I

711
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:48,679
think will end up with a an emissions

712
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:52,159
tax price whatever you want to call it I

713
00:31:48,679 --> 00:31:55,200
think that something like this

714
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:59,639
eventually is going to happen where the

715
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:01,039
big tension will be in how the revenue

716
00:31:59,639 --> 00:32:04,519
is

717
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:08,399
used I cannot name the name but let's

718
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:09,639
just say I not that long ago spoke with

719
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:13,519
a

720
00:32:09,639 --> 00:32:17,039
prominent former Republican government

721
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:21,679
figure uh well respected in the Finance

722
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:25,080
Tax Arena and I was quite surprised when

723
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:28,559
this person said unequivocally he

724
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:31,120
supported the carbon tax

725
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:34,279
and we talked more and then we found

726
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:39,720
where there was a bit of a breakdown uh

727
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:42,880
in our views namely his view was all the

728
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:44,919
funds should go to deficit

729
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,639
reduction well that of course is

730
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:49,559
completely

731
00:32:46,639 --> 00:32:52,279
regressive in the end that may be the

732
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:55,720
negotiation how much of this funding is

733
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:58,840
returned uh to the population in a

734
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:01,559
progressive way right how much goes to

735
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:03,960
budget balancing if I had to guess I

736
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:07,039
would guess that we may end up with that

737
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:11,519
that as the final negotiation do you

738
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:14,960
think that the US has a tendency to be

739
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:17,840
preachy in terms of you know of course

740
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:20,880
we want big economies like China and

741
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:24,200
India to try to use cleaner energy to

742
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:27,279
transition but in in a case like China

743
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:29,120
um a lot of our stuff potentially like

744
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:31,399
the stuff that we buy in the store from

745
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:33,880
Toys to bikes to blenders and whatever

746
00:33:31,399 --> 00:33:36,760
is is potentially being contributing to

747
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:38,880
their emissions so do we not look at

748
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:42,200
ourself enough when we say to other

749
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:45,360
countries hey use cleaner energy buy a

750
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:49,360
fewer bikes or or

751
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:51,559
yeah obviously offshoring is an issue

752
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,480
but of course now what we're doing

753
00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:55,960
particularly with the Biden

754
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:58,600
Administration legislative activity

755
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:01,480
where there's a lot of onshoring uh uh

756
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:04,200
going on to switch the subject slightly

757
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:09,720
not not intentionally but it it raises a

758
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:12,480
different issue as we are onshoring and

759
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:16,599
building data centers Galore especially

760
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:20,040
with AI and electrifying transportation

761
00:34:16,599 --> 00:34:23,560
and electrifying space Heating and maybe

762
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:26,520
making green hydrogen electrolysis of of

763
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:28,280
water and maybe supporting a

764
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:31,720
cryptocurrency uh

765
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:35,800
uh uh world who knows we have today we

766
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:37,200
are seeing enormous growth in our own

767
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,520
electricity

768
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:42,679
requirements this you triggered it by

769
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:46,119
mentioning China in that context and

770
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:50,000
frankly I think the utilities are just

771
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:53,240
saying the truth that in the near term

772
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,800
the only way that this load can be

773
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:59,400
satisfied is by building more natural

774
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:02,720
gas plants so we have our own little

775
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:05,440
carbon load electricity load train wreck

776
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:09,400
in a certain sense but I think that uh

777
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:12,320
once again if we had some real planning

778
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:14,200
we could offset that because we

779
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:17,000
understand you know pretty well the

780
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:19,280
forcing of global warming from

781
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,800
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and

782
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:25,079
uh what we need to do is uh uh not just

783
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:27,200
catch up in terms of the emissions level

784
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:28,240
but catch up in terms of the integrated

785
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,400
Force

786
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:32,880
of the atmosphere and the warming but

787
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:35,160
those discussions just are not happening

788
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,920
I think they are I don't know they they

789
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:39,400
would require some sophistication they

790
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:41,200
would require some some serious uh

791
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:43,800
analysis and modeling and everything

792
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,680
else and decision- making about priority

793
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:48,280
decision making about priorities I mean

794
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:51,880
AI is you know consuming a lot of energy

795
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:54,839
for things like Google Assistant uh you

796
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:56,560
know and and basically a lot of trivial

797
00:35:54,839 --> 00:35:57,920
nonsense that that we could easily

798
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:01,200
dispense with but you're not going to

799
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:02,680
selectively tax it and I keep coming

800
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,119
back to a carbon tax as being the right

801
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:07,079
answer for a lot no I I agree with that

802
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:11,079
Rob but also I would say look the

803
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:13,480
reality is today the near-term load

804
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:18,119
growth in many parts of the United

805
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:20,520
States is driven 80 90% by data centers

806
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:23,359
that fraction will decrease as more of

807
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:26,560
the onshoring uh manufacturing plants

808
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:28,400
come online and more EVs and and and and

809
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:31,880
the like but but today it's really

810
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:33,400
driven there but I would argue that in a

811
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:37,599
digitized

812
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:41,440
world that frankly meeting the

813
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:44,560
load for data centers and AI large

814
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:47,839
language model training and the like is

815
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:51,160
frankly a national imperative for all

816
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:54,680
kinds of reasons including security so I

817
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:56,560
think that rather than arguing about it

818
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:58,599
we should just be talking about okay how

819
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,200
are we going to do this uh in a low

820
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:02,160
carbon world and there is a lot of

821
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:05,119
technological innovation going on to

822
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:06,520
make it possible I mean probably even

823
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:07,960
things related to this hydrogen

824
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,760
initiative we were talking about earlier

825
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:12,680
yeah and and by the way even in the AI

826
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:15,200
sector I think the amount of power for

827
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:18,319
example being required for these you

828
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:20,680
know gpus driving AI that can come down

829
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:23,319
by an order of magnitude now whether it

830
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:26,079
will just create 10 more cycles per

831
00:37:23,319 --> 00:37:28,160
cycle we'll see but certainly Energy

832
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:30,440
Efficiency the surface has not been

833
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:32,839
scratched in that world yeah Energy

834
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:35,960
Efficiency in computer algorithms in

835
00:37:32,839 --> 00:37:37,680
computer hardware in cooling hardware

836
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:39,240
and Concepts I mean I I just see this

837
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,520
across the board and and it is

838
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:42,599
interesting Ian but it's really got to

839
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:46,240
bear fruit correct we've covered a lot

840
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:48,560
of ground so if let's say President

841
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:50,599
Biden called you later this afternoon

842
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:53,400
which who knows could happen he never

843
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:57,240
calls me Cara okay but it might happen

844
00:37:53,400 --> 00:38:00,160
later today um and and he said you know

845
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:01,640
what what's the one suggestion from both

846
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:04,400
of you what's the one suggestion you

847
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:06,400
would have that maybe like I'm not doing

848
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:09,119
Blank Slate just tell me what you think

849
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:11,480
it is but maybe something you think I

850
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:13,760
could do so like though you might

851
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:15,720
support a carbon tax you might also

852
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,520
think that's completely not feasible in

853
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:21,680
the current setup so but what's

854
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:23,319
something he could do that is not

855
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:25,240
currently being done and would be like

856
00:38:23,319 --> 00:38:27,240
your top thing Ernie you want to say

857
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:29,640
what well first of all I would support

858
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:33,079
the carbon pricing and agree that he

859
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:36,079
can't do it right now uh the uh we're

860
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:38,240
just not ready frankly ready for that

861
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:41,880
for all the reasons we discussed earlier

862
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:42,720
but in terms of what may be doable I

863
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:46,400
would

864
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:49,400
actually say that he and his

865
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:53,319
administration should build on things

866
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:55,880
they have been starting to do in terms

867
00:38:53,319 --> 00:38:58,160
of getting the whole electricity

868
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:00,760
infrastructure built out out and

869
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:04,160
straightened out this is the grit uh or

870
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:08,520
the grd uhhuh the fact is

871
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:11,160
electricity has been the lead horse and

872
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:13,400
decarbonization it is the lead horse and

873
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:14,520
decarbonization it will be the lead

874
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:17,720
horse in

875
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:22,119
decarbonization the needs are growing

876
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:24,560
dramatically we've just shifted from a

877
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:27,599
significant period where National

878
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:30,480
electricity growth was about a half% per

879
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:33,240
year to a place now where I think it's

880
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:35,960
roughly 1 and a half% per year and maybe

881
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:38,599
growing and certainly in some hotpots is

882
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:42,000
growing much faster than that having a

883
00:39:38,599 --> 00:39:45,040
grid that functions and not just

884
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,839
regionally but inter regionally would

885
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:49,839
unlock a lot of other possibilities and

886
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:53,359
there's a lot of innovation that can be

887
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:55,359
used so if I take for example getting

888
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:57,480
very practical since you suggested

889
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:59,480
something that had to be practical uh

890
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:05,119
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission

891
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:08,960
FK issued an order that was probably its

892
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:12,079
biggest step on transmission in over a

893
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:15,319
decade and it had some very useful

894
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:18,000
elements in it like 20-year planning for

895
00:40:15,319 --> 00:40:20,640
regional grid buildout like very

896
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:24,560
importantly not discussed enough I think

897
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:26,680
is the encouragement of uh Technologies

898
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:29,800
to increase the capacity of the existing

899
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:35,000
grid new conductors and dynamic line

900
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:38,960
rating and new switching um Technologies

901
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:41,640
and modeling Etc however it also fall

902
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:43,920
short it did not consider interregional

903
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:46,720
planning it did not really consider the

904
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:50,240
permitting issues this is hard but I

905
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:53,079
think doable for example in Congress

906
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:55,800
there has been legislation it's still

907
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:58,720
kind of knocking around uh in terms of

908
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:02,200
trying to improve the permitting process

909
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:04,280
it needs a push so I would say really

910
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:07,359
addressing the

911
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:10,760
technology and Regulatory structures

912
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:11,920
needed to really build out the grid and

913
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:15,599
to

914
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:19,319
allow all the generation

915
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:23,160
Technologies to work to connect to real

916
00:41:19,319 --> 00:41:26,000
loads Etc to connect faster I think

917
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:27,640
that's doable in the next four years it

918
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,040
it's an interesting priority because I

919
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:32,880
think it seems so like pedestrian or

920
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,480
unsexy you know but but in some ways

921
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:37,520
you're like well but we can't do the

922
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:39,599
cool awesome things if we have you know

923
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:41,280
the infrastructure of like what what

924
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:44,839
good is a new car if the roads are all

925
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:46,880
messed up we need a real a real push on

926
00:41:44,839 --> 00:41:50,319
infrastructure uh and I agree I was

927
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:53,040
intentionally being non-sexy in that but

928
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:56,079
I would get I I will degenerate even

929
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:57,800
further and say that it's not only wires

930
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:00,400
but it's also on pipe

931
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:04,680
there's a I think terrific project in

932
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:07,359
the midwest to gather up CO2 emitted

933
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:09,680
from many many ethanol plants and bury

934
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:11,440
it sequester it except they can't get

935
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:14,640
permits to build the

936
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:16,319
pipelines so anyway so we have a a big

937
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:19,440
infrastructure challenge again I put the

938
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:21,920
electricity right up there as number one

939
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,960
uh and doable potentially uh but I

940
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,760
wouldn't ignore other parts of the

941
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:27,200
energy infrastructure as well maybe we

942
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,760
could make those Transmissions lines

943
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:33,079
sexier by making some of them super

944
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:35,359
conducting and Buried buried and buried

945
00:42:33,079 --> 00:42:37,480
right do do you have a thought if um

946
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:39,280
President Biden called you later today

947
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:41,880
absolutely you had just one thing you

948
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:44,920
could contribute yes so I mean what I've

949
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:47,280
noticed is where we're successful and I

950
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:49,680
think of the IRA here we're operating

951
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:52,200
through the tax code and just just

952
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:55,480
changing the tax code not passing new

953
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:58,200
laws necessarily but allowing people to

954
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:59,559
deduct stuff uh or or providing rebates

955
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:01,520
in some ways or

956
00:42:59,559 --> 00:43:05,359
subsidies so we got to do something

957
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:07,200
there at the same time we have very high

958
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:10,960
interest rates and it's making it hard

959
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:12,119
for people to buy houses and I can't

960
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,800
help thinking that somehow we could

961
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:17,000
combine these things you know allowing

962
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:20,559
them for maybe maybe using Federal money

963
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:22,760
to enable people to buy down points on

964
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:25,160
new home purchases to reduce their

965
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:27,119
interest rates if they sign up for some

966
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:29,920
sort of Energy Efficiency program

967
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:32,280
program and reduce their their

968
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,559
consumption of electricity natural gas

969
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:37,359
whatever it is Maybe by getting their

970
00:43:33,559 --> 00:43:39,839
homes reinsulated on purchase or even as

971
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:42,720
as as a retrofit uh for people who are

972
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:44,440
refinancing their homes so I so I I

973
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,880
think that that's you know something

974
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:47,119
that needs obviously to be thought

975
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:50,599
through a lot more than I'm thinking it

976
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:52,000
through right now but I think we we need

977
00:43:50,599 --> 00:43:54,520
to look for solutions that are

978
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,800
politically attractive and feasible and

979
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:59,240
where there are obvious problems that

980
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:01,839
can be solved at the same time as

981
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:04,480
solving the renewable energy problem I

982
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:07,520
mean there are programs uh particularly

983
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:09,640
for the less well-off yeah parts of the

984
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:11,000
population they tend not to subscribe to

985
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:14,200
those programs they need to be

986
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:17,319
strengthened and uh and also we I said

987
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:19,680
earlier about policy changes that can

988
00:44:17,319 --> 00:44:22,040
help large private sector Financial

989
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:24,400
flows to projects there are also policy

990
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:26,520
changes needed for the other end of the

991
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,680
economic spectrum if you like in terms

992
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:31,359
of making

993
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:33,800
usable to them I will note that in the

994
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:37,160
current Administration the legislation

995
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:39,559
passed by Congress has a lot of elements

996
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:42,119
for addressing some of the social Equity

997
00:44:39,559 --> 00:44:45,280
issues requiring things like Community

998
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:48,079
benefits plans or at least incentivizing

999
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:50,240
labor project agreements Etc the problem

1000
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:52,480
is especially on the community benefits

1001
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:55,359
plans uh is

1002
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:58,000
that it's a new thing and there's still

1003
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:59,800
a lot of figuring out uh how to do this

1004
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:04,079
that's another thing which by the way a

1005
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:07,240
president could also uh get some more um

1006
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:10,319
energy behind really moving these

1007
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:12,680
requirements for planning early with

1008
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:15,400
communities in terms of what benefits

1009
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:17,559
they will they will see from projects

1010
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:19,800
get that really really really moving I

1011
00:45:17,559 --> 00:45:22,040
mean it's there but um I think there's

1012
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:24,319
still a little kind of fumbling around

1013
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:26,280
as people try to figure out how to make

1014
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:27,559
the system work yeah well the the ones

1015
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:29,200
who figure out how to make this system

1016
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:30,760
work are the rich communities of course

1017
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:33,280
where there's more capacity to govern

1018
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:34,520
more experience more lawyers per capita

1019
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:37,400
they get in there and they scoop up

1020
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:40,119
these programs and and the social Equity

1021
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:41,839
problems are exacerbated so I think that

1022
00:45:40,119 --> 00:45:43,319
there's probably a role to play perhaps

1023
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:44,839
on on the government's part in

1024
00:45:43,319 --> 00:45:46,920
strengthening these communities in a

1025
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:48,440
very deliberate way to enable them to

1026
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:50,720
participate and and again we're seeing

1027
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:53,559
that I think already beginning to happen

1028
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:55,880
yeah finally I just wonder what your

1029
00:45:53,559 --> 00:45:59,319
level of optimism is I mean we've

1030
00:45:55,880 --> 00:46:02,119
there's a lot of uh hurdles to overcome

1031
00:45:59,319 --> 00:46:04,400
as we talked about ve what seems like a

1032
00:46:02,119 --> 00:46:05,880
very close election coming up could

1033
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:09,319
easily go either

1034
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:10,920
way what how do you think about not just

1035
00:46:09,319 --> 00:46:13,240
like the next six months but I mean the

1036
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:15,280
next 10 or 20 years well first of all

1037
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:18,640
you're speaking with two physicists who

1038
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:20,640
are by Nature optimistic that that I can

1039
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:24,559
say that about all physicists absolutely

1040
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:26,960
oh okay yes all the ones I

1041
00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:29,640
know I do think we're going to get there

1042
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:31,599
there as as usual we tend to get there a

1043
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:34,839
little bit too slow and that's probably

1044
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:36,920
going to be the case but uh here as well

1045
00:46:34,839 --> 00:46:40,359
but the reality is when all is said and

1046
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:42,680
done my optimism rests on the fact that

1047
00:46:40,359 --> 00:46:46,119
we will

1048
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:50,960
have all the technology we need

1049
00:46:46,119 --> 00:46:56,040
available I think at reasonable cost in

1050
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:58,400
the context of what we will be paying by

1051
00:46:56,040 --> 00:47:00,040
not addressing the the problem there are

1052
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:02,280
so many examples that I think are going

1053
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:04,280
to push us over the top like the crazy

1054
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:06,280
Insurance costs that are coming in

1055
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:08,480
various parts of the country the real

1056
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:10,920
pain and suffering that people are

1057
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:13,000
experiencing from from extreme weather

1058
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:15,920
literally having to move in many in many

1059
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:18,880
cases and of course globally we see all

1060
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:21,319
these dislocations of populations war is

1061
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:23,079
part of that but so is climate change a

1062
00:47:21,319 --> 00:47:26,040
big part of that and and frankly those

1063
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:28,440
often get intertwined as well so it may

1064
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:30,440
be for for fortunate reasons uh but I

1065
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:31,760
think we we are going to have the kind

1066
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:33,599
of Tipping Point that I mentioned

1067
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:35,480
earlier we're going to have to get the

1068
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:37,359
carbon markets right we're going to have

1069
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:40,160
to get policy better aligned with

1070
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:43,200
finance and the technology will be there

1071
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:45,359
to um hopefully save the day the

1072
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:47,240
technology is coming there's no question

1073
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:49,079
about it the cost reductions are coming

1074
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:52,640
and I think public opinion is coming and

1075
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:54,319
it's Winston Churchill famously said the

1076
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:57,319
Americans can be counted on to do the

1077
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:59,440
right thing after exhausting every other

1078
00:47:57,319 --> 00:48:02,070
possibility we're on our we're on our
