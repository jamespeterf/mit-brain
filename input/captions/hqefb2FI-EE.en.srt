00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:07,200
Good morning everybody. Welcome to the

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:09,840
MPG primer. Today it is my pleasure to

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,800
introduce Pamela. Pamela is a genomic

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,200
specialist for Clinen at the Broad

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,720
Institute and an expert in variant and

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:22,480
gene curation. She co-chairs the Clinen

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:25,840
ClinVar curation working group advancing

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,680
accurate var variant classification. Her

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,920
background includes germline and somatic

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,399
curation for an Australian childhood

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,480
cancer program and a biotech startup

12
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,960
where she also developed genomic

13
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,120
training workshops. Pamela serves on the

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,200
board of directors for the federation of

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,760
American societies for experimental

16
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,000
biology, the education committee of the

17
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,719
cancer genomics consortium and the

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,440
professional relations committee of AM.

19
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:54,480
She earned her PhD studying microRNAs in

20
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,640
head and neck cancer. and today she's

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,960
going to give us a primer on clinical

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,840
genomic resources. So, thank you very

23
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,840
much Pam for speaking today.

24
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,519
>> Thank you. Um I want to start off first

25
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,960
by saying it's my pleasure to be here

26
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:11,520
today. Um I could talk about Clen

27
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,880
Clenver genomic resources all day. I

28
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,400
won't do that though. I will stick to

29
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:19,840
the 45 minutes. Um but before I get into

30
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:23,200
the deep dive on genomic resources, I

31
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:25,360
wanted to start off first with a story.

32
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,600
Um, so this is a story about a disease

33
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,759
that's been a defining challenge in

34
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,479
medicine for over the past century,

35
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,960
which is cickle cell. And this is a

36
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:38,240
life-threatening genetic disorder that's

37
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,799
associated with anemia, infection, and

38
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,200
episodes of pain. If you look at the

39
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,439
figure on the right, it shows how red

40
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,920
blood cells are in the sickled cell

41
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:50,640
shape, hence the name, that can cause

42
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,200
them to get stuck in blood vessels,

43
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,880
blocking blood flow and leading to

44
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,640
really serious downstream health

45
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,680
consequences.

46
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:03,040
Now, this is caused by a single base

47
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,719
pair change in the hemoblobin gene, and

48
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,840
an individual with cickle cell disease

49
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:10,000
has both copies of that gene mutated.

50
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,400
And this is the most common uh variation

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,480
of cickle cell disease.

52
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,560
So it is known that it affects millions

53
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,959
of people throughout the world and is

54
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,120
particularly common among those whose

55
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:25,920
ancestors came from parts of the world

56
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:28,720
where malaria was or is still common.

57
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,040
And so cle cells are really classic

58
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,800
example of a monogetic disorder where

59
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,560
you have a change in a single gene that

60
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,319
leads to really profound clinical

61
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,000
consequences.

62
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:43,599
Now, in 2023, the narrative did change

63
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,440
and some of you might notice um so what

64
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:49,599
I've got here is a press release from

65
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:52,560
the FDA where they had approved two

66
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:54,959
milestone treatments. So, this was Kazvi

67
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,200
and Lisgenia, which were the first

68
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,640
cellbased gene therapies for the

69
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:03,840
treatment of cickle cell disease. Um,

70
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:07,200
also really cool is that cuz Jeevy was

71
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,599
actually the first ever FDA approved

72
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,519
therapy that was developed with crisper

73
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,640
technology. And it's my understanding

74
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,360
it's actually the work of one of the

75
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,040
broadies that also contributed to this.

76
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,920
So that's just a really great example of

77
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,239
seeing that bench to bedside happen in

78
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,080
action.

79
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,159
Now I do have a bit of a personal

80
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,000
connection with this disease. I actually

81
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,720
recently found out through carrier

82
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,840
genetic testing that I have cickle cell

83
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:37,040
trait which means that I carry one

84
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,280
abnormal copy of the betaglobin gene and

85
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,000
the gen genetics behind that is that I

86
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,159
have what we call a missense variant. So

87
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,480
in the gene on the DNA level at a

88
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:49,120
specific position instead of an adinine

89
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,040
I have a thymine. So going from A to T

90
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,000
and on a protein level that's going from

91
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,519
glutamic acid to veiling.

92
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,920
Uh what does that mean in terms of

93
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,560
symptoms? Honestly, I have never really

94
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,400
felt any symptoms throughout my life. Um

95
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,319
I wish I had known about it a few years

96
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,879
ago when I was in Bali worrying about

97
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,319
mosquitoes and malaria. Um and not

98
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:11,920
knowing that all along I kind of had the

99
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:13,840
superpower essentially. Um there are

100
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:17,280
some serious implications if you are

101
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,759
planning to have a a family. Um, so if

102
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,840
my partner is also a carrier, and I've

103
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:25,680
just got a little diagram down there,

104
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:28,639
then our child has a one in4 chance of

105
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,639
developing cickle cell disease.

106
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,400
I'm going to be honest, we weren't too

107
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:36,560
worried just because my husband does

108
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:39,199
look like this. Um, but it's not zero,

109
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:42,800
so we still got him tested. Um, and what

110
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:46,800
I want to now show is our first genomic

111
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,560
resource, which is Nomad. Um so this is

112
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,759
a huge resource of the general

113
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:54,479
population um with exo sequencing and

114
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:57,280
genome sequencing data and you can

115
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:59,520
essentially look at a variant and see is

116
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,400
this a rare variant or is it common in

117
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:05,120
the general population and you can even

118
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:08,240
look at it further by ancestral groups.

119
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,880
So I've highlighted two. I'm in the

120
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,479
African African-Amean bucket where the

121
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,360
frequency for the variant that I have is

122
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:18,400
about 5%. actually turns out because I

123
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:22,560
have generations of Nigerian heritage um

124
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:25,039
it's more like 25% for me. Um but my

125
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,800
partner who's of the European non-finish

126
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,720
background you can see it's quite low.

127
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,759
It's like 0.004%.

128
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,320
So um it's always worth to check and do

129
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,560
your genetic testing if you can. Um but

130
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,160
it really starts to be this is my segue

131
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,680
into the rest of the talk showing

132
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,560
genomic resources, why they're

133
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,560
important, how we use them.

134
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,360
Um, so there's heaps out there, lots of

135
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,880
resources. Um, I'm just going to speak

136
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,639
about some of them in a broad level and

137
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,919
just show some examples as well. Um, so

138
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,680
grouping them into three different

139
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,199
buckets. We've got like the gene level

140
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,280
associations where we're trying to

141
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,360
figure out, you know, is this gene

142
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,520
actually linked to this disease? And you

143
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,520
can see some examples along there. And

144
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,360
then there's the variant level side

145
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,800
where you want to know are there

146
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,720
interpretations that have been made

147
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,120
about this variant? Is there any kind of

148
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,800
functional data that can be used or a

149
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,080
little frequencies in databases like

150
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,919
Nomad? Um these can be publicly

151
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,919
available so anyone can access that

152
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,120
information or it can be commercial

153
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:28,479
where you got to pay a little bit of

154
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:31,360
money to access that database. Um or in

155
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:33,919
some cases a lot of money. Um and then

156
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:37,680
there's the case level side where you

157
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:39,840
have deidentified patient information um

158
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,240
and you're looking into that data

159
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,560
identifying varants and the phenotypes

160
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:48,440
the observable traits and trying to make

161
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,440
associations there.

162
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,280
So it is a clinen clinva other genomic

163
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,120
resources talk which means there's going

164
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:58,560
to be a heavy um talk on clinen um so

165
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,080
this is short for the clinical genome

166
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:04,639
resource and it's really the purpose

167
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,280
behind it was to and is to create an

168
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,360
authoritative central resource that

169
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,280
defines the clinical relevance of genes

170
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,199
and varants for use in precision

171
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:18,240
medicine and research. Um, this started

172
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:20,479
back in September 2013.

173
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,440
Um, and it is primarily funded by the

174
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:25,520
NIH, which in 20125 in the states.

175
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:29,120
That's a fun time as I'm sure you're all

176
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:32,319
aware. Um it's covered by three core

177
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:35,440
grants throughout the US um with PIs at

178
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:37,520
multiple sites including at the broad um

179
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,120
one sematic cancer grant, one

180
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,240
pharmaccogenomics

181
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:46,080
and um just over 20 disease focused

182
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:50,720
grants as well. And all of this is

183
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:53,360
fueled into this mission on the left um

184
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,520
which is a infograph depicting what we

185
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,759
do. So we have our stakeholders at the

186
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:01,120
top where we're able to aggregate

187
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:04,319
deidentify genomic and health data um

188
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:07,919
and use that to answer Clinen's four

189
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:10,720
critical questions. One, gene disease

190
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:13,120
validity. Does variation in this gene

191
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,759
lead to disease? Two, variant

192
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:19,120
pathogenicity. Is this variant disease

193
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:22,240
causing? Three, dosage sensitivity. Does

194
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:25,440
copy gain or loss of this gene or

195
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:28,319
genomic region lead to disease? And

196
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:31,199
four, clinical actionability. If this

197
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,760
gene was significantly altered, could it

198
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,159
confer a high risk of serious disease

199
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,479
that could have been mitigated if that

200
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,640
disease risk was known? And so we do

201
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,120
this in the form of our expert panels is

202
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:45,279
what we call them. Um, which consists of

203
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,839
scientists and clinicians around the

204
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:50,720
world who are experts in the field. and

205
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:53,360
we come together on a frequent basis um

206
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,440
focusing on a series of diseases and

207
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,120
answering these questions using

208
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,279
established frameworks that have been

209
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,399
created and then this information is

210
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:04,720
disseminated to the public. Um and it

211
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:07,279
fuels back into these questions and we

212
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,120
have this feedback system and the end

213
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:13,440
goal here is really just to improve

214
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:16,240
patient care through genomic medicine.

215
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:19,279
Additionally, Clinen also has um the

216
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:22,080
honor of being a global core biodata

217
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:24,720
resource, meaning that it is considered

218
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:27,760
of such fundamental importance to the

219
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,839
biological and life sciences community

220
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:35,560
um for the preservation of biological

221
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:35,560
data. So, it's a cool honor to have.

222
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,279
So this paper came out last year from

223
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,760
the Clinton consortium and really just

224
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:46,320
shows the progress of the past decade in

225
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:49,279
essence. Um and the figure on the right

226
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:52,320
really shows the explosive growth of

227
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:56,080
Clinen's expert panels over time. You

228
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,519
can see in pink the gene curation expert

229
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,760
panels and in blue are the gene

230
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,600
curations and then in orange are the

231
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,920
variant curation expert panels and in

232
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,959
green are the variant curations. And

233
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,560
we're now at what we call phase three

234
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:11,200
which is all about scaling and

235
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,279
sustainability. So we have so much data.

236
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,519
How do we continue to maintain this in a

237
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,360
feasible manner? And also how do we

238
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,040
scale our efforts? There's still so much

239
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:23,720
to do and how do we do that in a

240
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,720
resource sensitive and mindful way.

241
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:30,399
Um here I've got a slide showing Clinen

242
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,959
leadership who are responsible for

243
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:37,519
oversight and the direction of Clinen as

244
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:39,760
a whole um and they're all around the US

245
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:42,800
and then additionally

246
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:46,320
um we also have 100 plus staff members

247
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:48,240
such as myself um who are involved in

248
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,560
additional leadership roles,

249
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,000
coordination. Clen is a beast. It's a

250
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,680
fantastic beast, but there's lots of

251
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,959
moving parts, so coordination is

252
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:59,440
necessary. Um, biocuration,

253
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:02,240
software development, and many other

254
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,640
roles. We also have over 50 working

255
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:08,079
groups that manage standards,

256
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:11,880
operations, and software, and also over

257
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,880
140 expert panels.

258
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:16,240
Wanted to highlight the Clinen team at

259
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,519
the Broad site, which is where we're at

260
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,279
today. Um, so this is co-led by the PIs.

261
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,079
You can see here professors Heidi Ree

262
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:27,200
and Marina Dfina at the top. Um and then

263
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:29,680
this is a diligent hardworking team that

264
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:33,320
um really make sure that we keep clinen

265
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,320
running from our side.

266
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,800
Okay. So let's start to talk about

267
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,200
Clinen's expert panels. So in order to

268
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,959
do that um we have what we call our

269
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,040
clinical domain working groups. So

270
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:48,160
there's 15 of them. You can see them on

271
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:51,680
the left there. um focus on specific

272
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:57,720
disease areas essentially and then that

273
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:57,720
leads to 58 gene curation experiencation

274
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,560
expert panels and another thing that I

275
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:06,079
really want to highlight is that yes we

276
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:09,920
have about 100 or so staff but the bulk

277
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:13,200
of Clenen is actually our 2,800 plus

278
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:15,519
volunteers all around the world from 74

279
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,519
countries that actively contribute to

280
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,680
our extra panels in our working group.

281
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,839
So, Clenon wouldn't exist without them.

282
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,839
Um, so we're always very thankful for

283
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,839
that.

284
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,639
So, today I'm going to be focused on

285
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,160
gene and variant um curation. I'm not

286
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:36,000
going to talk about those clinical or

287
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:38,560
sematic um but before we can define a

288
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:43,639
variant's role in disease, we first must

289
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,639
assess the gene level evidence.

290
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,720
Um and so I want to show another

291
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:51,279
resource which is Omen. Um this is a

292
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,040
absolutely comprehensive resource for

293
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:56,240
finding claims that have been made

294
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:59,600
between a given gene and disease. Um

295
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:02,720
looking at recent stats from Omen, they

296
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,800
have over 7,000 phenotypes or observable

297
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,519
traits for which there is some sort of

298
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:10,320
molecular basis known. Um which equates

299
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:12,160
to about 5,000 or so genes that are

300
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,320
associated with a phenotype causing

301
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,800
mutation. So that's a lot of data,

302
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,959
especially for very um uh other

303
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:22,800
comparative resources that do the same

304
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:24,880
thing. Um in order for a gene to enter

305
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,480
this database, it does need a minimum

306
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,320
level of evidence. So it's not just

307
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,320
anything and everything. It's really

308
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,560
genes that it seems like there there

309
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:37,040
could be something there.

310
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:39,120
Um and OM includes variants for a given

311
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,120
gene and disease that are kind of like

312
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,360
exemplar variants for that. So it's not

313
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,279
a complete catalog either of every

314
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,000
variant that has been reported in

315
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:49,839
association with that disease.

316
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,200
Now there's lots of ways to use Omen.

317
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,639
I'm just going to show a really simple

318
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:57,199
way um where you can put in a gene and

319
00:13:54,639 --> 00:14:00,800
I've put in here MSX1 and you can have a

320
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:03,279
look and see okay um what diseases have

321
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,720
been asserted for this gene and then you

322
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,160
can click into them and look into it

323
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,480
further and see okay what are the

324
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:11,839
phenotypes associated with this disease

325
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,600
that have been reported. um if you got

326
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,920
patient data you're looking at, does it

327
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,680
match your patient? Um if you're trying

328
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:20,000
to figure out more about the disease and

329
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,600
figure out if it's part of a spectrum,

330
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,959
um you know, you can do comparisons

331
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,720
there. There's lots of different things

332
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:27,959
and it's a really great starting point

333
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,959
for that.

334
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,199
Okay, so now I'm going to start to talk

335
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,959
about um gene disease validity, which

336
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:37,760
I'm using interchangeably with gene

337
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:40,720
curation um from the Clenen side of

338
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:43,199
things.

339
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,880
So on the top left there is the

340
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:48,240
publication that came out a few years

341
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:51,120
ago describing the evidencebased

342
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:54,480
semi-quantitative framework that Clinen

343
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,079
uses for gene curation. Um and

344
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,160
essentially this is subdivided into

345
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:00,160
genetic evidence and experimental

346
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,839
evidence. So when we're thinking about

347
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,800
genetic evidence we're thinking about

348
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:08,000
things like case reports, case series,

349
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:10,480
case control data, family pedigrees. um

350
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,199
and we have a point system that we use

351
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,040
as a scoring metric. And then similarly

352
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,639
with experimental evidence, we're

353
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,600
looking at things like biochemical

354
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:23,120
evidence, expression data, um animal

355
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:25,279
studies, all of that to support the gene

356
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,760
disease relationship as well. And so the

357
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:29,360
points are added up and then based on

358
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:32,240
the amount of points you get, the more

359
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,680
points you have um the more evidence

360
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,079
supporting that gene disease

361
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,480
relationship. So at the top we have

362
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:40,399
definitive if I can get my mouse to go

363
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,240
there. Um, as the most amount of

364
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:45,680
evidence and then at the bottom we have

365
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:48,720
refuted as the least amount. Basically

366
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:51,040
saying that at this point there is no

367
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:54,920
substantial evidence at all supporting

368
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,920
that gene disease relationship.

369
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:01,600
Okay. So there are implications

370
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:04,240
downstream on what the final class is

371
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:07,839
for a given gene disease relationship.

372
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:10,639
Um on the right uh technical standards

373
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:12,880
that came out a few years ago from the

374
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:15,120
American College of Medical Genetics and

375
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:18,800
Genomics ACMG

376
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:22,320
um basically giving guidance around how

377
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:27,199
to diagnose a sequencing panel and um

378
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:30,240
report variance um from that. Now um in

379
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:33,199
essence if you are in the kind of

380
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,959
discovery stage research settings you're

381
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:38,000
going to identify genes and diseases

382
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:39,920
that meet that entire spectrum of uh

383
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,639
classification.

384
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:45,360
However, as soon as patients are

385
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:47,920
involved, you need to have a pretty good

386
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,000
amount of confidence that that gene is

387
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,759
actually associated with that disease.

388
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,320
And so when you want to design a

389
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:56,959
diagnostic panel, the recommendation is

390
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:59,120
to have moderate or above as the

391
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:01,920
evidence um strength for that gene

392
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:04,480
disease relationship. And then the next

393
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,000
tier above that is predictive testing

394
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,079
where you have an asymptomatic

395
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,439
individual who wants to understand their

396
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:14,959
risk of developing disease. And so for

397
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:17,360
that we use the highest tier of um

398
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:20,360
evidence for gene disease validity

399
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,360
classification.

400
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:26,959
So this is just showing the data from

401
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:29,200
Clinen's 58 gene curation exop panels.

402
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,280
That's just a subset of them there. Um

403
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,720
colorcoded by the final classification

404
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:38,000
that they received. Um when I last

405
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:40,960
checked it was 3,331

406
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,480
total gene disease curations. Um three

407
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,400
is my lucky number. So I was kind of

408
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,640
hoping it'll be 3 three3 by the time

409
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,760
this talk came around, but no such luck.

410
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,600
That's okay. Um and then this is just

411
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,760
showing at the top the distribution of

412
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,640
the classifications and you can see the

413
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:59,840
vast majority are definitive. However,

414
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:02,559
there is a subset of the insufficient

415
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,720
evidence about 23%

416
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:07,039
which don't have enough claim. And

417
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,960
that's kind of concerning because a lot

418
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:11,280
of the times when we're looking at these

419
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:14,480
genes in our expert panels, it's because

420
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:16,320
they're on diagnostic panels. So we

421
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,000
shouldn't be seeing them. you know, they

422
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,440
should be having more evidence. So, it's

423
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,200
it's a little bit concerning. It just

424
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,160
highlights why it's important to do gene

425
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:26,240
curation first.

426
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,000
All right, this is our golden example of

427
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,880
like why you need to do gene curation

428
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,480
first. Um, so this was a paper that came

429
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,960
out a few years ago from the Bata

430
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:38,799
syndrome expert panel. They were looking

431
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:41,440
at 21 genes that are commonly found on

432
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,960
diagnostic panels for Briata syndrome.

433
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,320
So they applied the gene curation

434
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:49,600
framework and lo and behold to their

435
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:52,480
shock and horror only one gene just one

436
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:55,200
gene had definitive evidence for bata

437
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,280
syndrome. The remaining 20 genes were

438
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,000
actually disputed meaning that the

439
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,600
evidence was conflicting at best and yet

440
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,640
these were appearing on diagnostic

441
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,960
panels. Right? That's a worry. Um, and

442
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,440
so it just really highlights why we

443
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,520
really encourage gene curation to be

444
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:15,240
done before designing a diagnostic panel

445
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,240
and using it on patients.

446
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,600
So these are just a few screenshots

447
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,520
showing the clin knowledge base. It's

448
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,600
honestly quite huge. There's no way I

449
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,919
could show everything in time. Um, but

450
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,760
there's lots of different uses. If you

451
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,760
haven't used or been on this website

452
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,160
before, it's a treasure trove of

453
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,600
information. I recommend you use it. I'm

454
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,480
not just saying that as someone who's

455
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,960
paid to work for Clinen. I said that for

456
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,280
years prior even, you know, receiving a

457
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,960
single paycheck um from the place. Um

458
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,919
but it is genuinely a fantastic

459
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,440
resource. Um you can put in your gene of

460
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,840
interest and you can see if there's any

461
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:54,240
kind of curations in the gene space, the

462
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:56,240
variant space, the CNV space, um sematic

463
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,400
clinical actionability, all of that and

464
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:02,000
um see what evidence that has been

465
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:04,000
expertly curated towards it. Um, so

466
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,160
everything we do, we're all about being

467
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,559
thorough and transparent. And so when

468
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:10,799
you click in into any gene, disease, or

469
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:13,280
variant, you'll find out the evidence

470
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:16,679
that we use to score it, how we scored

471
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,679
it, and why.

472
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:22,799
So just here is just an example of the

473
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:26,000
my gene and you can see from the gene

474
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:27,919
disease validity perspective that the it

475
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,880
has been curated against four different

476
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,320
diseases. um the final classifications

477
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,559
are different especially for that last

478
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,880
one there. Um and you can click in

479
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:40,480
further and find out why

480
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:42,080
um if any kind of CNV uh review has been

481
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,000
done that will appear under dosage

482
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,919
sensitivity and then similarly

483
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,320
actionability will have a report if

484
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,600
that's available.

485
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,080
I'll talk about our variant curation

486
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,440
exop panels later but if one exists and

487
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,760
they've started they've created

488
00:20:53,440 --> 00:21:00,080
specifications and curated variants

489
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:00,080
you'll find that evidence there as well.

490
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,240
Um, so I want to talk about the curation

491
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:08,320
ecosystem now. So I've talked about

492
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:11,760
clinen quite a bit and the consortium

493
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:14,960
and what we do, but we also work quite

494
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:17,840
closely with two other resources. The

495
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:20,320
first one I'm going to go into is gencc

496
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,880
or the gene curation coalition.

497
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:25,360
um which is a database for sharing gene

498
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:28,360
level knowledge and this is supported by

499
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,360
clinen.

500
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,600
So gencc is actually co-led by two of

501
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:37,200
broads pis that I introduced earlier.

502
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:40,799
So, Marina Dust Stefano and Heidi Ree.

503
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:43,120
Um, and so their vision before Gen CCC

504
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:46,159
became a reality was based on the fact

505
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,919
that for a while you had lots of groups

506
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:50,400
out there who were also doing gene

507
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:52,480
curations all in isolation and not

508
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,880
sharing their data. And as we know at

509
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,640
science, collaboration is key, right,

510
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,760
for scientific progress and and

511
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,679
discoveries. And so they envisioned

512
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:05,280
essentially what could be a one-stop

513
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:07,919
shop for gene curations and convinced

514
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:10,960
quite a good number of submitters which

515
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:13,919
you can see up there um to come together

516
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:16,000
and share it in this database. So this

517
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,600
is a combination of public and private

518
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,320
resources

519
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,240
and part of creating genC and getting

520
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,880
them on board was also developing

521
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,799
consistent terminology for gene disease

522
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,400
validity assessments. And if you think

523
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,440
about it, right, if we're calling

524
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,760
something with the most amount of

525
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,760
evidence definitive, another group needs

526
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,600
to have the same name or we need to come

527
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,360
to an agreement as to what that name

528
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,720
would be, right? We need to be speaking

529
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,679
the same language. We don't want to be

530
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:44,799
comparing apples to oranges.

531
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:47,120
Um, and so this has led to the public

532
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:48,799
sharing of not just published curations,

533
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:51,200
but also unpublished curations from

534
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:54,000
these groups. um and they now meet

535
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:58,520
frequently to collaborate and resolve

536
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,520
discrepancies um on gene curation.

537
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:06,000
Um so in terms of overall stats from

538
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:09,600
dencc they have over 24,000 submissions

539
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:13,120
in their classifications on over 5,000

540
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:15,280
genes. So very similar to Omen and 16

541
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,840
submitters that actively contribute

542
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,039
their gene curations. Um and on the

543
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,200
bottom you can again just see the

544
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:23,840
distribution of those classifications

545
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:26,320
where similarly to clinen about 17% of

546
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:30,039
those have insuff insufficient evidence

547
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,039
supporting the claim.

548
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,400
Um so one thing that you can do with

549
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,240
gencc there's lots of things actually

550
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,799
but you can put in like your gene of

551
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,880
interest or disease or you can even look

552
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:44,400
by submitter and basically you can see

553
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:47,039
what information is out there. Um in

554
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,480
this example here we have GJB3

555
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:51,200
and you can see that it's associated

556
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,960
with eight diseases from seven different

557
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,720
groups. And so you can just like have a

558
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,960
look and see okay what are the

559
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,880
submitters diseases and what

560
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,720
classifications did they come through

561
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:04,039
and what's concordant or discordant

562
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,039
between them.

563
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,480
So I want to move on now to variant

564
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:09,679
pathogenicity. Can I can I ask a

565
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,240
question before you move to the next

566
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:14,559
part online? Um, someone was thanking

567
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,720
you for bringing up OM and they just

568
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:18,960
wondered why there's no OM numbers or if

569
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,480
it's possible to add OM numbers to

570
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,440
Clinen

571
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:25,679
as in in our Clinen curations also have

572
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,960
Omen numbers embedded within them.

573
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,919
>> That's what it sounds like.

574
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,440
>> So, you can actually see um in one of

575
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:34,400
the sections where if you click down,

576
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,880
it'll say what disease entries were used

577
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:41,520
and so Omen links would be in there if

578
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,520
if um if used.

579
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:50,360
All right. So, where was I? Baron

580
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:50,360
curation. I need to go back one slide.

581
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,360
There we go.

582
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,440
Um, okay. So, when we're thinking about

583
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:02,720
variant classification,

584
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:06,720
um, there's a few considerations, right?

585
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:09,600
Um, so you want to have a set of common

586
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:12,880
standards for variant classification.

587
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:16,799
Um, if you think about it, you want a

588
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:20,000
group in Japan or a group in Australia

589
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:23,120
or in Germany to see the same variant

590
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,279
from a patient and review the evidence

591
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,440
and come to the same conclusion about

592
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:30,240
the variants pathogenicity,

593
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,360
right? Um, in order for that to happen,

594
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:35,520
they need to be using the same

595
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:38,159
framework. Additionally, you want them

596
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:40,960
to have access to the same pool of

597
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:43,520
evidence. Similarly, if you have one

598
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:46,080
group that has access to internal

599
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:48,400
patient data, another group that has

600
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:50,400
access to some functional assays that

601
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:53,440
Jay just have, another group who has

602
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,720
access to neither, you know, it's a for

603
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,240
sure they're going to come to different

604
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,039
conclusions on the variance

605
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,480
pathogenicity. And so what we really

606
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:03,120
want to encourage is a breakdown of

607
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:05,200
those silos and a sharing of evidence so

608
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,840
that we can try to come to a harmonized

609
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,679
classification on a given variant. And

610
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,520
so part of that is having a shared

611
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:14,799
evidence base which I will talk about in

612
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:18,320
a bit. Um we also want the public

613
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:21,520
sharing of variant classifications right

614
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:23,520
um if there different groups have

615
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,799
different views and there's discordance

616
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:27,039
we want to know why so we can see what

617
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:28,880
those discrepancies are. And then

618
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:32,320
finally, we want to have expert

619
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:35,120
consensus on these classifications. Um,

620
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:37,279
one to help resolve discrepancies, but

621
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:40,559
also for those groups who don't have the

622
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:42,720
bandwidth or the resources to go and do

623
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:44,720
those deep dives into the evidence to

624
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,520
support them and which is what our

625
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,919
clinen variant creation extra panels do.

626
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:52,480
Um, so I'll get into all of that, but

627
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,960
you can see on the right, um, just a

628
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,559
subset. There are so many resources out

629
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,600
there and they just keep growing day by

630
00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:01,919
day. But um these are some very commonly

631
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:04,919
used ones for variant classification

632
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,919
purposes.

633
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:14,400
Okay. So common framework. Um so we have

634
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:16,799
the ACMG AMP standards and the paper

635
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:19,679
down there is just showing the paper

636
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:23,520
that came out in 2015. to about a decade

637
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:27,039
ago um which really is a cornerstone of

638
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:30,080
variant curation um and describes this

639
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:33,360
common framework um it acknowledges the

640
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:35,279
complexity of curation right cur um

641
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,360
classifying variance isn't black and

642
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:39,360
white I mean sometimes it is but a lot

643
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:42,240
of the time it's not right it can really

644
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:45,600
fall on a gradient and so they developed

645
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:47,200
this five tier classification system

646
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,760
where you had pathogenic likely

647
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:52,240
pathogenic Um so these are variants that

648
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:55,360
are considered um reportable and you can

649
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,799
return them back to the patient. Um

650
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:00,559
there's a variance of uncertain

651
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:02,480
significance or the vos's and um anyone

652
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:06,080
in this space would know they are the

653
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:09,039
bane absolute bane of our existence um

654
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:11,279
and how labs can treat reporting them um

655
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:12,720
can be quite different depending on

656
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:14,799
circumstances of the patient that

657
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,039
they're dealing with. Um but there is

658
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:20,480
guidance coming out to help with this.

659
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:22,720
Fingers crossed. Um and then we have

660
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,960
likely benign and benign um which is

661
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:29,080
considered not reportable because the

662
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,080
variants are not disease causing.

663
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:34,960
So this is the table of evidence that we

664
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,360
use for variant classification. It

665
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:39,360
summarizes things like you know is a

666
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:42,000
variant common or not in a general

667
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:44,159
population like I showed with Nomad. um

668
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,360
what do the computational predictures

669
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:49,760
predictors think um of this variant um

670
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:51,840
are their functional assays out there?

671
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:54,240
What about the family data? What is that

672
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:56,399
showing? So using all those pieces of

673
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:59,039
evidence to then combine them and come

674
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:02,159
to a final classification which is shown

675
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:04,240
on the right. Um now those combining

676
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:06,960
rules have over time proven a little bit

677
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:10,000
tricky to remember. So we have started

678
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:14,159
to shift towards a point system which is

679
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:16,320
quite intuitive. Um and we're expecting

680
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:17,919
next year, we've been expecting this for

681
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,720
a while, but we've been told it's for

682
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:23,520
sure next year we are having a long

683
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,840
overdue update to the 2015 standards and

684
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:28,159
everyone's waiting with baited breath.

685
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:30,480
Um, and this should really just resolve

686
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:32,720
some of the issues we've had um with the

687
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:37,640
current standards such as subjectivity

688
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,640
of um interpreting some of the evidence.

689
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:44,559
So with Clinton's variant curation

690
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:46,880
expert panels or VSAPS, their goal is

691
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:49,120
essentially to take those 2015 standards

692
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,960
which are generic in nature and that's

693
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:53,520
intentional so you can plug in a given

694
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:56,000
disease or gene but they take it and

695
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:58,000
they're focusing on a disease area and a

696
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,080
set of genes and they capture that

697
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,919
information and account for the

698
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,600
biological nuances right that are

699
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:06,880
associated with diseases. So that's what

700
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:08,480
they do. um can take a long time, right?

701
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,720
It can take a couple of years at least

702
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:13,120
to put that together and then those

703
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:16,960
specifications once approved are made

704
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:19,279
available um by Clinen for public use.

705
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:22,000
So genetic testing labs, research labs

706
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:23,840
can just go on get that information and

707
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,080
use what they need like okay what is the

708
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:28,080
threshold of population frequency to

709
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,279
consider this rare or frequent like they

710
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:33,679
don't need to do the research we've done

711
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:37,919
that for them. Um what we also do is

712
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:41,520
that vets then publish curations um on a

713
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:43,360
database called clinbar um to classify

714
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,440
difficult variants and resolve

715
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,760
discrepancies. So it's on climber but

716
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:50,799
it's also um can be found u within

717
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:53,360
clingen one of our portals also takes us

718
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:55,919
to that. Um

719
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:58,799
the work of clinen beps is a FDA

720
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:02,080
recognized process um because of how

721
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:05,120
thorough our curations are um and how

722
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:09,440
transparent we have to be um in terms of

723
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:12,799
what evidence we use and why. Um so at

724
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:16,559
this stage we have 38 fully approved

725
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:18,080
vsaps associated with 89 gene disease

726
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:21,120
specifications

727
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:23,120
where 82 vips in total in various stages

728
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:26,080
of development.

729
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:27,520
Um so this equates to almost 12,000

730
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:30,559
variant curations that have been

731
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:32,880
published. Um and this is just showing

732
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:37,320
down here the different um

733
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,320
classifications that they've met.

734
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,799
So going back to curation ecosystem I

735
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,200
now want to talk about clinvar. So this

736
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:47,600
is a database for sharing variant level

737
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,840
knowledge and is supported by the

738
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:52,399
national center for biotechnology

739
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:54,240
information.

740
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:58,159
So clin has been around for as long as

741
00:31:54,240 --> 00:32:00,159
clinen and at this point has over 6

742
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:01,840
million submissions and that number

743
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:03,919
keeps drastically changing. And I feel

744
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:06,080
like every time I talk about Clinbar,

745
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:10,320
it's, you know, 3 million, 4 million, 5,

746
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:13,840
now it's 6 million. Um, and on 4 million

747
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:16,000
variants and over three, 3,000

748
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:19,200
submitters from 92 countries. So, the

749
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:22,720
amount of data in here is unbelievable.

750
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:25,039
Um, by far the vast majority of

751
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:28,880
submitters are clinical labs, as you can

752
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:31,440
see. Um and then a smaller subset are

753
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:35,200
researchers, clinen expert panels,

754
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:37,600
patient registries and clinics. Um so

755
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:40,080
over time has really proven to be a

756
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:42,000
critical resource for the global

757
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:45,000
clinical and research genomic

758
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
communities.

759
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:49,519
Um very quickly just for anyone who's

760
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,840
not familiar with ClinVar and what that

761
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:54,240
looks like. So this is just showing a

762
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,919
variant record for a missense variant in

763
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:59,200
the MIBPC3

764
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:02,240
gene. Um and I'm going to try to click

765
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:06,000
and see how I go here. Each row is a

766
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:08,640
different submitter, right? Um so on the

767
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,519
left you have information like uh what

768
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:14,240
classification they gave the variant. Um

769
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:15,679
if they used a framework, what we call

770
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:19,120
the assertion criteria, they provide

771
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:22,320
that. um what condition it was curated,

772
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:23,840
classified for um and who the submitter

773
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,600
was

774
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:28,399
um and when that information was put in

775
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:31,679
in ClinVar and if it's been updated um

776
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:33,200
if they have evidence that is shown. So

777
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:35,440
if you see the second submitter, we have

778
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,519
it under comet. Um we love to see

779
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,519
evidence by the way. Um it's important

780
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:41,200
to know why a group came to a

781
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:43,840
classification

782
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,600
um and what evidence they used. And then

783
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:48,080
all this information from the submitters

784
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,840
is then aggregated at the top to a final

785
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:52,480
classification.

786
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:54,480
Um and Climber uses a review status to

787
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:58,000
indicate their level of confidence on

788
00:33:54,480 --> 00:34:01,039
that variant record. So if there's and

789
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,679
review status is just

790
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:07,840
at the top there.

791
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:11,280
Okay. Let's see. There we go. Okay. So

792
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:13,359
if you get zero stars, it means that no

793
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,040
assertion criteria was provided. So you

794
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:19,119
don't know what framework they use to

795
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:21,760
classify a variant. Um they get one star

796
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:24,480
if only a single submitter provided a

797
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,560
submission or if multiple submitters did

798
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,639
but they disagree which is the case here

799
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:31,440
where you can see it's conflicting um

800
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:34,159
classification. So that gets a one star.

801
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:36,639
Um, two stars if multiple submitters

802
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:39,040
agree, three stars if it's a clinion

803
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,960
expert panel because of our FDA status,

804
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:44,480
and then four stars if it's a practice

805
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:47,480
guideline like CFTR, CFTR in um, cystic

806
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,480
fibrosis.

807
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:55,440
Um now if we start to think of the

808
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:58,720
landscape of rent records in ClinVar um

809
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:02,640
the vast majority of them only have a

810
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:05,680
single submission. It's about 76%.

811
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:08,320
um 9% of these are actually associated

812
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:12,640
with conflicting classifications

813
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:14,400
and of that 1% which equates to 44,000

814
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:17,760
at the time because this is based on the

815
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:20,000
June data set from Climbber. Um 1% of

816
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:22,720
these are considered clinically

817
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,079
significant conflicts, right? These

818
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,480
these are the ones that kind of worry

819
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:29,839
you a little bit. um they're they're the

820
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:31,280
ones where um in a variant record you

821
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:33,680
have a submitter or submitters that

822
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,839
think the variance is reportable path

823
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,599
likely path and then submitters who

824
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:39,440
think actually the evidence isn't enough

825
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:41,040
it's it shouldn't be reported it's a v

826
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,320
likely benign benign so you can

827
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,560
understand that that would be quite

828
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,000
confusing to someone who's gone into

829
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:48,800
clever looked at the variant and

830
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,200
thinking so what is it which one is it

831
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:54,480
um and when you look at it subdivide

832
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:56,800
further on the top right um the majority

833
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:59,520
ity of those clinically significant are

834
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:02,880
actually at the border of being likely

835
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:05,040
pathogenic versus a vis. So the ones

836
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,599
where like there's there's just enough

837
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:09,839
evidence but also for some not just

838
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:12,000
enough like it it could go either way

839
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:14,320
and those are the ones that really can

840
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,640
be quite challenging um to know which

841
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:20,320
bucket they should be in.

842
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:22,880
Sover's goal was never to actually try

843
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:24,960
to pass any judgment on the accuracy of

844
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,280
the submissions that they receive. They

845
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,280
just house them. Um, and neither were

846
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:32,880
they planning to review them over time.

847
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:35,839
Um, but it's become clear that some

848
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:37,680
submissions are just inaccurate or just

849
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:40,240
really old and are missing newer

850
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:42,079
evidence has come out. And so there's

851
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:44,240
been calls over time to essentially

852
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:48,359
clean up Clinbar.

853
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:48,359
So that's where Clinton steps in.

854
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,839
It will step in in a moment.

855
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,839
Let me do it from the computer.

856
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:06,640
Okay, there we go. Um, so this is done

857
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:09,119
in the form of what we call the Clinen

858
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:12,000
Curation of ClinVaver or CBC working

859
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:13,839
group. So this is Heidi's brainchild. um

860
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,400
this project

861
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:19,839
um and it's a group that her and I

862
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:23,200
co-chair together um where we review old

863
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:25,280
and outlier submissions in ClinVar to

864
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,520
improve the accuracy of the content in

865
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:30,720
there. Um and this is just revealing the

866
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:32,640
team that uh work spent a lot of time on

867
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:36,000
this project. It's it's complex so it

868
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:38,560
does require quite a bit of um scientist

869
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,560
power behind the scenes. Um, and it also

870
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:42,400
includes Melissa Landram, uh, who's the

871
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:47,079
PI of ClinBar. So, it's something we

872
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:47,079
really do handinhand with them.

873
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:52,160
Um, so a little bit more about this

874
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:54,000
project. Um, so we're focusing on really

875
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:56,160
obvious issues here. We're not trying to

876
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,720
do any kind of variant classification.

877
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:00,720
That would be a mammoth task for such a

878
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,079
small team. Um, and also somewhat

879
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:05,280
redundant when we have our variant

880
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:06,880
creation expert panels. um what we're

881
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,760
looking at are things that are what we

882
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:11,920
consider clearly inaccurate, right? Um

883
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:14,000
so a submission in order to meet that

884
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:16,400
category typically needs to meet two

885
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:20,320
qualities, which is that it's either

886
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:22,400
quite old. Um it's an outlier, so it's

887
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:26,320
causing conflict or it's lacking

888
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:29,280
supporting evidence. Um and so we review

889
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:31,119
those submissions. Uh we apply a flag

890
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,440
that those flag submissions are passed

891
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:35,440
on to ClinVa. Clever passes it on to the

892
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:38,640
submitter and basically the submitter

893
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:40,079
has 60 days to contact us or update

894
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:42,000
their submission with more evidence or

895
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:44,960
change their classification

896
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,800
before the flag goes live on Clenbar.

897
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,640
Um, and so what happens is that once a

898
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,079
flag is live, the submission is pushed

899
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,760
down to the bottom of the varant record.

900
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:53,760
It doesn't disappear. That information

901
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,520
in there can still be useful. It's just

902
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,280
pushed to the bottom and the

903
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:59,760
classification is removed from the

904
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,119
overall classification. So there's an

905
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,680
example down there where you can see the

906
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:06,079
flag submission and so that was a V that

907
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:09,119
was causing conflict but you can now see

908
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:11,680
after being flagged the classification

909
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:16,079
has now gone to just path likely path

910
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:18,240
essentially and gotten a two star. Um

911
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:20,079
so this project has been going on for a

912
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:23,280
few years but it officially went live

913
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:26,480
just over 2 years ago um in ClinBar. And

914
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:29,200
so in that time um almost 18,000

915
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:32,480
variants have been reviewed um leading

916
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:35,839
to just over 4,000 variants um

917
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:38,160
containing a flag submission in ClinBar.

918
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:40,240
Um so that's the amount of variants that

919
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:42,480
have a flag submission. But in terms of

920
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:45,200
the amount of actual flag submissions,

921
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:47,440
it's 5,222.

922
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,560
Um, and what we've done, because we want

923
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,000
to know what the community thinks of

924
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,280
this, right? This is a community

925
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,040
database, so we want to make sure

926
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,400
they're receptive and that this is

927
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:57,119
something they feel is working and

928
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:59,839
useful. Um, and so we've kept an inquiry

929
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:02,000
log to keep track of issues.

930
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:03,280
Um, if there are any, Clville will reach

931
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,599
out to us and connect us with the

932
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,760
submitter. We then investigate on our

933
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:11,280
end and respond.

934
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:14,880
Um, and so out of the 5,222

935
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:17,040
submissions, only 26 of them actually

936
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,720
were challenged by 21 labs. And

937
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,320
challenge is too combative. They really

938
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,240
were just like, "Hey, why was my

939
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:23,760
submission flagged?" Um, so that's

940
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,280
about.5%.

941
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:28,560
And a lot of those were actually in the

942
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:30,880
early days. Um, and so out of those, we

943
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:32,960
retracted seven flags on our end, and

944
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:35,200
then the remainder, the submitter

945
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:37,680
updated their uh submission with more

946
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:39,040
evidence. Um but again that was more at

947
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:42,160
the start when we were dealing with some

948
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:45,359
of the teething issues um as you can

949
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:47,200
imagine with a complex project. So it

950
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:49,920
still appears to be really well received

951
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:51,119
by the community. Um and we're now at a

952
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,839
stage where we're trying to think how do

953
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:56,560
we scale our efforts um with this

954
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:59,520
project.

955
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:01,040
Uh if you do find an error in ClinVar um

956
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:03,839
please send us the variant. We're always

957
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:06,160
happy to review them. We have a request

958
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:08,000
review form on the web page that you can

959
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,359
click in and put in your um the

960
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,359
information and details about the

961
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:12,359
variant.

962
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:17,040
Um so in the last little bit of time I'm

963
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:20,319
going to go through very two very quick

964
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:23,760
case studies um and the application of

965
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:24,880
the CBC project. Um one of them you need

966
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,720
to understand that there is a

967
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:29,359
relationship between gene curation and

968
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:31,440
variant curation. Gene cation needs to

969
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:33,839
be done first. And the reason for this

970
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:36,319
is that if you do curation, gene

971
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:39,280
curation and a gene gets limited or

972
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:41,119
below variance in that gene should not

973
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:44,560
get for that condition should not get

974
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:46,800
anything above a vos. Um if it scores

975
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:48,880
moderate the cap there is likely

976
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,720
pathogenic and if it gets strong

977
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,240
definitive then the full spectrum of

978
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:55,520
pathogenicity can be used for the

979
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:58,000
variant. Um so this is an example of a

980
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:01,200
gene curation on the FAM gene that was

981
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,040
done by our cancer expert panels. Um

982
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:05,920
there's three diseases, three different

983
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:08,160
classifications. Um I'm using the Fonei

984
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:10,480
anemia as an example where this received

985
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:13,040
a refuted classification meaning

986
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:15,440
variance in this gene for that condition

987
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:17,839
shouldn't get beyond a vos.

988
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,280
When we went and looked in ClinVar, that

989
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:21,200
is the case for the vast majority of

990
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:24,480
submissions, but there is a smaller

991
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:26,079
number that have uh classified their

992
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,079
variance as pathogenic and likely

993
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:31,760
pathogenic. And so this is obviously

994
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:33,119
very confusing um for outside um people

995
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:36,480
who are using ClinVar and looking at

996
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:38,880
Fonia anemia. And so we have a side

997
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:41,599
project going with the CBC work where we

998
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:43,920
actually review these low evidence gene

999
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:46,960
disease relationships and see if they're

1000
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,400
path likely path uh submissions in clin

1001
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:51,400
that need to be flagged when

1002
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,400
appropriate.

1003
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:57,040
The second case study is from the rare

1004
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:59,440
genomes project um which is at the broad

1005
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:02,240
and it's a patient-driven research study

1006
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:04,480
led by genomic experts and clinicians

1007
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:07,040
using genomic sequencing data to find

1008
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:11,200
answers for families with rare and

1009
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:13,359
undiagnosed conditions. Um and so in

1010
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:15,440
this example we had two siblings here a

1011
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:18,079
male and female in their 30s with a list

1012
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:20,800
of phenotypes that you can see there.

1013
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:23,680
and we used Seeker to analyze their

1014
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:25,200
genomic sequencing data. Quick plug for

1015
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:27,760
Seeker for anyone who's not familiar

1016
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:30,160
with it. Um it's a web-based resource.

1017
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:32,240
It's um publicly accessible and it's

1018
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:34,880
fantastic if you have genome exom

1019
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:36,560
sequencing data um for a given patient.

1020
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,480
You can put it in there and there's some

1021
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:40,720
preset filters that you can use to try

1022
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:43,520
and identify, you know, what varants

1023
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:46,240
could be um causing the disease being

1024
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:49,680
seen um in the phenotypes in in the

1025
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:52,400
given patient. So

1026
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:56,160
we used that and from that we identified

1027
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:58,160
variants in the KFBP gene. Um when we

1028
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:00,319
look at Gen CC there are multiple

1029
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:02,000
submissions including Clinen saying

1030
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:04,800
there's a definitive gene disease

1031
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:07,119
relationship for autotosoma recessive

1032
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,800
Goldberg sprintson syndrome which when

1033
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:10,800
we checked out that disease the

1034
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:13,359
phenotypes were a fantastic match for

1035
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:16,960
these siblings and so um we'd found what

1036
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:18,880
we call a genotype phenotype match here.

1037
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:21,599
I won't go into the variants too much um

1038
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:23,200
in interest of time except to say that

1039
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:25,920
with so there were two variants

1040
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:28,000
identified the first one um a nonsense

1041
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,680
variant had all the hallmarks of clearly

1042
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,400
being pathogenic

1043
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:33,920
um and in clin it was supported um with

1044
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:36,079
multiple submitters saying yep that's

1045
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:37,920
pathogenic. The second variant was a

1046
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:40,400
little bit trickier.

1047
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:42,800
um the team was able to put enough

1048
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:45,200
evidence to get it at likely pathogenic.

1049
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:46,800
But in ClinVar, this was one that was

1050
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:49,839
calling a causing a clinically

1051
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:51,440
significant conflict um with some

1052
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:53,680
calling it path likely path and one

1053
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,359
calling it a V us.

1054
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:57,920
So this is a great case study for the

1055
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:59,920
CBC project. Um when you look at the

1056
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:02,480
path likely pack versus VUS, we wanted

1057
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:04,640
to know why and what was going on there.

1058
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:06,720
So we looked at all the submissions um

1059
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:08,640
and the VS is at the top one wanted one

1060
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:10,960
wanted the likely path at the bottom and

1061
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:13,200
basically we ended up flagging the V

1062
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:15,119
essentially for three reasons. One it

1063
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,400
was an outlier was a lot older by

1064
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:20,079
several years than the other

1065
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:22,240
submissions. Two it was an uh it was

1066
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:24,000
causing the conflict and then three it

1067
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:26,079
had insufficient supporting information.

1068
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:30,000
It didn't have as much evidence as some

1069
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:33,520
of the newer um submissions did. So that

1070
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,960
met all the criteria for flagging um the

1071
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:37,920
submission and removing it from the

1072
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:39,920
overall variant record.

1073
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,760
So I hope I've convinced you in this

1074
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:44,079
time on the power of clinical genomic

1075
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:47,119
resources. As I said there's so much out

1076
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:48,560
there um just chose a subset focusing

1077
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:50,560
mainly on clinen and climber but there

1078
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:52,800
is a lot out there um and they're

1079
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:54,400
absolutely essential for diagnosis and

1080
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:56,000
discovery.

1081
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:57,680
um you know there's gene level, variant

1082
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,839
level, case level, there's also therapy

1083
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:02,160
level which I didn't get into as well.

1084
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:04,480
Um I always have to do the final plug at

1085
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:06,800
the end. Um if you are interested in

1086
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:08,319
volunteering for Clinen, there's the QR

1087
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:11,040
codes. We're always interested in having

1088
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:12,560
more biocurators and experts. Um but you

1089
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:15,359
can also find those forms on our

1090
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:16,800
website. Um and then I just want to

1091
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:19,440
finish off on this acknowledgement

1092
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:21,119
slide. Um including the translational

1093
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:23,920
genomics group which is where the broad

1094
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:26,640
clinen team is situated.

1095
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:28,800
Thank you. All this work is based on a

1096
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:31,800
consortium of people. So it is it is a

1097
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,800
lot.

1098
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:38,079
>> Great. If you have a question, come up

1099
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:40,880
to the mic and I'm going to quickly read

1100
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:42,319
one online first. Um for individual

1101
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:44,720
clinical labs, how do they get

1102
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:47,280
information for individual diagnostic

1103
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:48,800
test panels? Does each lab create their

1104
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,560
own panel or is there some sort of

1105
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:53,040
central database or guidelines? for

1106
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:55,520
example, which genes or broco mutations

1107
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:57,280
would be included on a cancer panel?

1108
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:59,040
>> Um, so one of the most commonly used

1109
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:03,119
ones at the moment and you can find that

1110
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:07,119
through Gen CC actually is panel app.

1111
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:10,000
Um, so they have like a traffic light

1112
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:12,160
system um for a given panel. So they

1113
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,480
have lots of panels in there saying um

1114
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:17,599
you know high level evidence is green,

1115
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:20,319
amber, yellow, I forget the three colors

1116
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:23,760
of the the traffic system essentially.

1117
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:27,200
Um and so that's a a great way to like

1118
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:29,280
get a preset pedal. Um and then

1119
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:31,280
obviously you can also cross check with

1120
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:33,680
GCC to see if there's agreements about

1121
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:37,200
the final classification for those genes

1122
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:39,119
and a given disease as well.

1123
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,880
Thanks for such a beautiful clear talk.

1124
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:42,960
Um I have two questions. One is the kind

1125
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:45,040
of obvious one about how is AI going to

1126
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:46,400
transform all your processes? And the

1127
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:50,079
other one was I've noticed in the

1128
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:51,839
screening world um people are like well

1129
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:53,359
actually the model that we have of like

1130
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:55,440
we've got genes linked to a disease

1131
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:57,920
we've got variants linked to a disease

1132
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:00,640
is like not sufficiently rich because

1133
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:02,800
you might think you people know oh but

1134
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:05,520
those variants in that part of the gene

1135
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:07,520
they tend to be much less penetrant than

1136
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:09,760
these ones that are over here. So I

1137
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:11,839
think there's like a felt need that we

1138
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:14,079
don't have a rich enough scheme to

1139
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:15,599
capture what we might want to pass on to

1140
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:17,200
patients particularly in the screening

1141
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:18,240
absence of phenotype world and I'm

1142
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:20,480
wondering if there are any thoughts

1143
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:22,000
about like making that underlying model

1144
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:25,440
richer

1145
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:28,880
so penetrance is a challenging thing to

1146
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:31,599
deal with um in our space um and I you

1147
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:33,520
know definitely for genes that uh really

1148
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:35,040
suffer from that um I can understand

1149
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:37,200
from a screening perspective if

1150
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,960
something has such low penetrance

1151
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:41,119
It's more a combination and within the

1152
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:42,720
same gene you they they know the

1153
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:43,599
clinicians know that some are low and

1154
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:47,839
some are high.

1155
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:49,520
>> Yes. Agreed. Um and so you know with the

1156
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:51,040
ones that have the the high penetrance,

1157
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:52,720
right? There's less concerns there. it's

1158
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:55,599
it's the ones that are are lower

1159
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:57,760
penetrant and um in terms of framework I

1160
00:48:55,599 --> 00:49:00,000
should say that there is uh so clinen

1161
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:01,760
does have a working group focused on

1162
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,079
like dealing with risk alils and

1163
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:06,079
penetrance and they've um started to

1164
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:07,280
work on and they've got two public

1165
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:09,200
they've got a publication and a white

1166
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:11,359
paper that's come out really providing

1167
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:13,200
guidance on how to deal with that um in

1168
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:14,800
terms of classifying but also reporting

1169
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,640
so I think there's more to come in that

1170
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,920
space but like agree that it's it's a

1171
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:20,319
common challenge especially in the

1172
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:22,000
cancer space as well um and then sorry

1173
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:23,680
what was First question,

1174
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,520
>> what's AI going to do for you?

1175
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:28,720
>> AI,

1176
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:32,240
it's the buzz word, AI. Um, I mean, we

1177
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:34,720
are working on that. Um, as I imagine

1178
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:37,119
every group is and I I think the hope is

1179
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:38,720
that a lot of what we do is so manually

1180
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:41,440
intensive.

1181
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:43,119
Um, and there's so many areas in there

1182
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:47,119
that really have the opportunity for

1183
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:49,680
automation, right? and and and um using

1184
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:51,680
uh int artificial intelligence to really

1185
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:53,680
do the work that we don't need to do

1186
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:55,359
like still have a human like overall

1187
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:58,079
review but there's just so many things

1188
00:49:55,359 --> 00:50:00,160
that are quite tedious. Um so we're

1189
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:01,680
looking into it. There's definitely lots

1190
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:04,079
of places along there that that could be

1191
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:06,079
done for sure.

1192
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:08,960
>> All right, thank you Pamela for a great

1193
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:08,960
primer.
