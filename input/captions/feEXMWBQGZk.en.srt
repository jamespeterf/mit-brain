1
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,119
in this video let us look at a basic yet

2
00:00:15,879 --> 00:00:21,359
important Concept in probability known

3
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:23,880
as linearity of expectations and use it

4
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:27,160
to deduce some interesting consequences

5
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:30,279
in combinatorics via the probabilistic

6
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:34,079
method linearity of expectations set

7
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:37,960
that if you're given random variables X1

8
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:40,920
through XM and constants C1 through

9
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:43,039
CM then when we took it when we take a

10
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,960
linear combination of these random

11
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:49,199
variables as such so C1 * X1 so imagine

12
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,600
these are real valued random variables

13
00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:56,039
and these are real constants for

14
00:00:50,600 --> 00:01:01,920
instance then the sum of these uh C1 *

15
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:04,199
X1 plus C2 * X2 and so on Plus CN * XM

16
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,600
so this sum has

17
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:08,840
expectation the following which can be

18
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,520
computed by Distributing this

19
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,560
expectation symbol across to the

20
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,799
individual

21
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,200
variables so this is a basic and

22
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:21,439
important property and it's worth noting

23
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:24,079
that a similar statement written for

24
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:26,400
products is often not true so it is not

25
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:28,280
usually the case that the expectation of

26
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,240
a product of two random

27
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:33,119
variables is the product of their

28
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:35,399
expectations unless you're in some

29
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,360
special circumstances such as when X and

30
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:40,200
Y are independent or

31
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,720
uncorrelated okay anyway let us focus on

32
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,600
the linearity of expectations and see

33
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:49,240
some ways to use this in combinatorial

34
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:51,360
applications and the first example is

35
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:53,240
the following question which will be

36
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,680
able to give a very quick and clean

37
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:58,320
answer the question is what is the

38
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,600
average number of fixed points of a

39
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:04,600
permutation of 1 through n

40
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,600
chosen uniformly at random as a reminder

41
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:10,039
if we

42
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:13,000
have numbers 1 2 3 4 here n equals to 4

43
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:16,319
then a permutation can be thought as

44
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,519
some way to map these numbers the sets

45
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:23,319
back to themselves in one to one

46
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:23,319
correspondence and a fixed

47
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:31,560
point is some number

48
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:34,040
that gets mapped back back to themselves

49
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,920
so in this permutation there are exactly

50
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,640
two fixed

51
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:41,200
points okay

52
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,760
great let's answer this question using

53
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,400
linearity of

54
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:47,080
expectations

55
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,920
well one way to think about the problem

56
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:52,680
is that well there are n factorial

57
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,360
permutations and maybe we want to try to

58
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,879
go about counting how many of them have

59
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,360
zero fixed points how many of them have

60
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:59,400
one fixed points how many have two fixed

61
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,720
points but that method can get pretty

62
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,760
cumbersome and pretty difficult quite

63
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,200
quickly however if we look at this

64
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,959
problem through the lens of linearity of

65
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,159
expectations there turns out to be a

66
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:14,519
very quick

67
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:17,599
solution and the method is to let

68
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:21,159
introduce some random variables let X I

69
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:25,440
be a random variable that equals to one

70
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:25,440
if I is a fixed

71
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:36,400
Point meaning that in this permutation I

72
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:36,400
gets mapped to itself and zero

73
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:44,239
otherwise so X of I is the indicator

74
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:47,959
random variable for the element I being

75
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,959
a fixed point of this random

76
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:55,560
permutation what's the expectation of XI

77
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:01,720
well this is the

78
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:01,720
probability that I is a fixed point

79
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:10,319
well this being a uniform permutation

80
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:12,400
chosen uniformly at random I is sent to

81
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,360
each of the elements 1 through n with

82
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,400
equal probabilities so in particular it

83
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,600
is sent back to itself with probability

84
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:23,079
1 /

85
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:23,079
n and then the number of fixed

86
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:31,440
points equals to the sum of the

87
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:40,600
X XIs so X1 plus X2 so on to xn and now

88
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,600
we can take expectation of both

89
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,280
sides and apply linearity of

90
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:56,520
expectations and see that while each

91
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,520
individual term is 1 /

92
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:02,639
n and there are n such terms so the

93
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:04,840
answer is one and that is the answer to

94
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,960
this question so the average number of

95
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:09,919
fixed points of a permutation chosen

96
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,280
uniformly at random is exactly one and

97
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,919
you see that there's a very quick

98
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,400
calculation once you get a hang of the

99
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:18,680
idea of of linearity of

100
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,039
expectations let us look at a slightly

101
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,080
more interesting

102
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:27,280
example and for this example we'll

103
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:27,280
consider the concept of a tournament

104
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,960
okay so a tournament is a concept in

105
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,960
graph Theory referring

106
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:40,360
to the

107
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:42,759
following there are nend vertices think

108
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,479
of nend players in some tournament and

109
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:48,680
between every pair of vertices we have

110
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:51,440
some directed Edge pointing in one of

111
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:54,199
these two directions so every pair of

112
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:57,880
vertices there's some Edge pointing to

113
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:57,880
one of the two directions

114
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:09,599
okay so that's an example of a

115
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,919
tournament I'll need to introduce

116
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:14,479
another concept which is that of a

117
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,479
Hamilton

118
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:30,479
path so a Hamilton path is a directed

119
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:32,520
path meaning we travel along the

120
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,560
directions of these ver these edges

121
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:39,280
according to their directions so

122
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,280
directed path that passes

123
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:47,800
through each

124
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:52,759
vertex so every vertex of the graph

125
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,759
exactly once no more no

126
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:58,039
less so let's see if we can find any

127
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:01,000
hilon paths in

128
00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:02,720
this in this examp example well I see

129
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,319
one so if we start with the middle

130
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:09,160
vertex and go along this one this Edge

131
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:11,080
then this Edge and then this Edge okay

132
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,560
so that's a hemoton path that goes

133
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:15,240
through all four

134
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,280
vertices each vertex passing through it

135
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:20,400
exactly once and it always traverses

136
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,400
along the direction of the

137
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:27,039
edges okay let us prove the following

138
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,520
theorem for every n

139
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,720
and there

140
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,919
exists a

141
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,879
tournament on N

142
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,240
vertices

143
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,759
with at least

144
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:09,039
n factorial * 2 to the minus

145
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:12,680
n +

146
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,680
one hoton

147
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:26,039
paths okay so in other words for every n

148
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:29,080
there is some way to orient the edges of

149
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:31,879
the complete graph on N vertices so that

150
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:34,839
it has lots and lots of Hamilton paths

151
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:38,519
specifically at least this many okay so

152
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:38,519
that's a theorem that we're aiming to

153
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:43,240
prove we will not prove this theorem by

154
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,320
explicitly constructing such a

155
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:47,720
tournament instead we'll invoke the

156
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:51,120
probabilistic method and show that a

157
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:53,080
random tournament has in expectation

158
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,720
this

159
00:08:53,080 --> 00:09:01,160
property so here's the

160
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:01,160
proof let's consider a random tournament

161
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,480
on N

162
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,600
vertices chosen uniformly at

163
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:30,200
random one way to do this is to take a

164
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:32,959
complete graph on n verticy and for

165
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,800
every Edge flip a Fair coin and use that

166
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:38,480
coin to decide which way the edge

167
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,480
orients of the two different

168
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:45,560
directions now let's think about the

169
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:47,600
number of Hamilton paths right so

170
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:55,360
each

171
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:55,360
path of the so each um

172
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,360
okay so each of

173
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,519
the N factorial permutations of

174
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:19,959
vertices

175
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,959
forms a directed

176
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:28,560
path okay so first consider a

177
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:31,519
permutation of vertices so for example 2

178
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:34,519
1 3 3 4 and think about what is the

179
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:37,680
probability that the edges that go in

180
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:40,200
the direction of these uh of this

181
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,959
permutation that the edges are all

182
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:46,040
oriented according to the

183
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:47,600
permutation well we have to Flip n minus

184
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:50,000
one coins and all of them have to come

185
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,120
up in such a way so that the edges are

186
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,600
pointing in the direction of this

187
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,880
permutation in order of this permutation

188
00:10:54,600 --> 00:11:00,680
so the probability

189
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:03,320
that this is a directed path for a for

190
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:05,720
each of these permutations is precisely

191
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:09,440
2 to the

192
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:12,600
minus parenthesis n minus

193
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,959
one okay and now we invoke the linearity

194
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,160
of

195
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:21,000
expectations to claim that the expected

196
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:21,000
number of Hamilton

197
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:30,320
paths must then be well each of the N

198
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:32,839
factorial permutations has probability

199
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,800
of 2

200
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:39,279
Theus n minus one of

201
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:41,519
being a directed path right so this is a

202
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:43,480
calculation that is analogous to the

203
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,480
calculation that we did in the earlier

204
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:48,360
part of this

205
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:52,200
video this is what happens in

206
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:56,040
expectation on average and

207
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:58,320
thus there must be some instance where

208
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,600
we can beat this average or at least be

209
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,200
at least as large as this average so

210
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,120
thus

211
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:07,320
there

212
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,320
exists a

213
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,519
tournament

214
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,519
with at

215
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:21,440
least this

216
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,440
many Hamilton

217
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:30,800
paths okay and that concludes the proof

218
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:33,920
of this theorem that we laid out earlier

219
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:37,199
so this is an example of applying

220
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:40,720
linearity expectations as a step in the

221
00:12:37,199 --> 00:12:43,560
probabilistic method to prove this nice

222
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:49,120
and simple result that there exist

223
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:49,120
tournaments with lots of Hamilton paths
