1
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:06,359
main question is like how can I help my

2
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:08,840
people when I came to India I saw this

3
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:11,320
potential of for example how technology

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:14,360
is affecting people's life here from

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:16,000
medical schools from universities even

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,039
if you go to a small shop there is like

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,680
integrated of technology and that was my

8
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:23,320
main motive to get into computer science

9
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:25,160
and from that point onwards I was

10
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,240
thinking okay I have learned all this

11
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:29,190
stuff for free now how can I give it

12
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,239
back to my community

13
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:35,320

learned from ocw to give back to his

27
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,640
community do you want to tell us a

28
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:14,799
little bit more about him yeah sure uh

29
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,799
today's guest is lad F andish man he's

30
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,159
originally from Afghanistan and is

computer science and computational

36
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,399
thinking field he's currently working on

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,079
his MIT micr Masters in statistics and

38
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:36,680
data science with the support of

39
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:39,439
emerging Talent after completing his

40
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,880
micr Masters in December Lula plans to

41
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,280
continue studying artificial

42
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,320
intelligence at a doctoral level and as

43
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,280
we've already mentioned one of Lula's

44
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,799
motivations for studying computer

45
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,799
science and technology is so that he can

46
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,159
create products and applications for

47
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:56,640
people in his home country of

48
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:59,399
Afghanistan he is particularly

49
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,280
interested in wanting to create open

50
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:03,479
learning resources that are taught in

51
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,320
the languages people in Afghanistan

52
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:08,200
actually speak that way everyone can

53
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,720
benefit from open learning the way he

54
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:12,680
did and he's made that hope a reality

55
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,160
earlier this year L fulla help launch

56
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,840
hosman lab an online learning

57
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:19,000
application that provides online

58
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:22,400
learning programming classes taught in

59
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,080
pan and Topol of FL FL Engineers the

60
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,200
software himself which is quite

61
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,959
impressive yeah it's really cool and it

62
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,680
took a lot for him to get to the place

63
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,599
where he's launching his own app in our

64
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,360
interview he tells us about how he used

65
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,599
to use the Moonlight to guide him

66
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,920
through his small Afghani Village to

67
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:42,159
learn chemistry from his uncle Before

68
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,239
Dawn and he's really never stopped

69
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:47,319
learning ever since I'm excited for our

70
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:50,360
audience to hear more about L's

71
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:52,800
curiosity and generosity his our

72
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:55,800
conversation with L andish from

73
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,800
Afghanistan

74
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:03,640
as AF

75
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:13,050
[Music]

76
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:20,519
asence hello everyone my name

77
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:23,760
is and my last name is andman I'm from

78
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:26,040
Afghanistan currently residing in India

79
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:30,439
and here I my I'm pursuing my

80
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:32,720
education and my main focus

81
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:35,480
and my main area of education is

82
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,760
computer science and artificial

83
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:40,519
intelligence uh so usually we like to

84
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:43,200
ask people you know how was your life

85
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:45,239
before finding open learning what were

86
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,879
you doing were you working were in

87
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:49,720
school like could maybe give us a brief

88
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:52,040
background on that when I was in

89
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,879
Afghanistan I used to live in a village

90
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:57,120
a place where there were plenty of

91
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:59,879
Natural Resources Rivers the mountains

92
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:03,720
and the clean ear a peaceful place to

93
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:06,720
live we the beautiful EOS of birds added

94
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:08,560
more to its richness everything was in

95
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,680
harmony with the nature but there was an

96
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,799
issue we did not have access to the

97
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:16,440
internet and there was very little

98
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:18,239
electricity my father always used to say

99
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,560
to me that we did not have this

100
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:23,040
opportunity as you have now please don't

101
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,479
waste it by the meantime when I was

102
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,120
living in my Village I had an uncle who

103
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:31,800
was very good in chemistry in fact

104
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:33,880
basically he was the best in the subject

105
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,440
during the day as he was busy with his

106
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:38,720
own work I was not able to reach him and

107
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:41,680
ask him for help but during night I was

108
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,720
used to go go to his house and ask him

109
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,280
to help me in my studies especially in

110
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:49,360
chemistry basically because uh we did

111
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:52,080
not have that much of electricity and I

112
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,240
used to rely on the Moonlight to

113
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,039
navigate to his home sometimes when

114
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,039
there was no Moonlight I had to take the

115
00:04:57,039 --> 00:05:02,960
help of Walls by touching those walls

116
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:05,199
and go to his home and on the other

117
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,240
instance for example we had a religious

118
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,360
scholar which he was far away from our

119
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:12,600
own village he used to teach on that

120
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:15,520
vage for one hour about Arabic and some

121
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,520
information about our religion and I had

122
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,400
to wake up before the dawn of the day

123
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,280
and I have to be there before everyone

124
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:24,800
else because his main responsibility was

125
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,880
to teach to those people not for me but

126
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,680
I had to be the first one to reach there

127
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,120
and take my lessons and come back to my

128
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:34,440
home just a quick question so like how

129
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,039
did you go from your village to uh Cabo

130
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,720
like how'd you like get into the

131
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:40,880
traditional education and what is the

132
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,400
traditional education in

133
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,759
Afghanistan from first grade till

134
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:49,240
seventh grade I used to study in my

135
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,759
Village so we are having schools and

136
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,840
then up to 12th grade we will be

137
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:54,759
studying in schools and after that we

138
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:57,840
will be having an exam to go to

139
00:05:54,759 --> 00:06:00,520
universities if you pass that exam and

140
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,479
then when I was in 7 and eighth grade

141
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:05,160
that amount of resources were not

142
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:08,280
sufficient for me and my father used to

143
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,919
push me to go more and to learn more and

144
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,800
through him I got those connection for

145
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,720
example that religious scholar and then

146
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,520
my uncle was obviously he was my

147
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:19,919
relative so he was there to offer and

148
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:22,560
help me and then after seven and eighth

149
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:25,400
grade because my uncle told me like you

150
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,759
have to move to cble because there we

151
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:30,560
had like for example electricity

152
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:33,880
internet was there then have had access

153
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:37,280
to better education then for four or

154
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:39,520
five years I used to study in kab so

155
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,680
when did you first

156
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,360
encounter ocw was it in any of those

157
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:47,000
grades or was it when you're heading

158
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:49,720
towards University at what point in that

159
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,919
educational Journey for the first time I

160
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,199
had to study too hard to get into

161
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:56,680
University and then when I passed that

162
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:59,000
exam I went to the university and

163
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:01,240
basically the curriculums were mostly

164
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,560
similar to the US because the kble

165
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:07,039
University was uh mainly supported by us

166
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,440
universities and Japanese universities

167
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,960
and we had some sort of same subjects

168
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:15,039
and then there we had one subject physic

169
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:18,120
one the curriculum was almost the same

170
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:20,280
as what we they used to teach in the USA

171
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,680
and then one day my friend brought one

172
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:25,360
lecture series and he showed me that

173
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,520
have you seen this uh then we started

174
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,840
looking for around 30 minutes into that

175
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,479
lecture series and then I asked him from

176
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,680
where you got this and do you have all

177
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:36,919
of these lecture series and he said yes

178
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:39,639
and then asked him please can you

179
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:41,919
transfer all these lecture series to my

180
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:44,400
flash card and then I got those lecture

181
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,319
series and like for around two months

182
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,800
three months I was watching them and

183
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:51,400
really I was stunned by the amount of

184
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:54,000
passion uh the easiness of understanding

185
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:56,680
those lectures that was the first moment

186
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,479
watch which I came to know about mitw

187
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:01,319
that was through a YouTube channel you

188
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:03,599
can say and then there was not that much

189
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:05,960
of high speeed internet in Afghanistan

190
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:08,280
we had this kind of Internet collapse

191
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:10,159
where there is a high speeed internet

192
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,000
and then if we pay for some amount then

193
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:14,919
in the exchange we will get for example

194
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,479
for 1 hour or 30 minutes of high speed

195
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:19,479
internet and then for example whenever I

196
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:21,639
was curious to know about something or

197
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:23,479
had difficulty in my studies I used to

198
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:26,199
go there and search the first time I

199
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:28,080
used to go through mitw website and then

200
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:30,159
I was looking whether this course is

201
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,159
available or whether something related

202
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:33,839
to my question or my subject is

203
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,279
available in the

204
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,399
mitw and if something was there then I

205
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:40,880
used to download PDFs I used to download

206
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,159
videos and come back to home and watch

207
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:46,040
all those lectures and read all all

208
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:48,399
those materials oh wow so you discovered

209
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,000
it through YouTube first me too me too

210
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,200
um I discovered through YouTube then

211
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,880
later I found out there were all these

212
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,760
other you know websites and so many open

213
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,200
learning resources that's a very

214
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:01,040
inspiring journey I wanted to ask

215
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,040
something about the language in which

216
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,240
the

217
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:06,040
traditional education back home was

218
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,160
storing you said yes they had a lot of

219
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:11,320
American influence in the education

220
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,800
system in Cabo but was it all in English

221
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:16,480
or it was all in Arabic and then because

222
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:20,160
ocw is in English and I wanted to know

223
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:23,560
how that was for you I would say this is

224
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:26,560
a point where most of us are finding

225
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:28,959
difficult to follow these lectures

226
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,320
because not all people are familiar with

227
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,760
English

228
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,800
and the language which we used to study

229
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:37,360
in Afghanistan is Persian and pasu in

230
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,880
kab it was Persian even though the books

231
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,399
were in English but uh teachers and

232
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:45,279
professors used to teach in Persian oh

233
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,959
persan and then for us it was a bit

234
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:50,079
difficult to follow the mitw lectures

235
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:51,959
unless we had previous education and

236
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:54,560
previous background in English some of

237
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:57,680
us used to follow private courses in

238
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,680
Afghanistan to learn English and luckily

239
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,640
I was one of those which I could uh

240
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:05,640
follow the lectures and understand the

241
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,800
concepts and the lessons and you know as

242
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,320
you started using uh these open

243
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,880
educational

244
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:14,880
resources did it start changing um how

245
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,720
you were performing in your traditional

246
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,640
education as well like were you getting

247
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,680
better

248
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:23,640
grades um or were you just learning more

249
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:25,920
about life in the world and it just made

250
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,399
you feel better as a human being maybe

251
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,880
you could talk about how it was making

252
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:33,120
you feel as you found this stuff how is

253
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:37,360
it affecting you personally yeah in fact

254
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:40,519
uh apart from getting uh good grades or

255
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:43,200
helping me in uh getting good grads in

256
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:46,720
in University in fact like it was kind

257
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,800
of an eye openening moment for me it was

258
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,120
not like just okay I will follow this

259
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,560
few subjects which I had in the

260
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:55,839
University but in fact it had opened my

261
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:58,480
eyes on different subjects on different

262
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:01,040
areas for example I didn't know anything

263
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,800
about computers are programming really I

264
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:06,240
didn't know like we didn't have that

265
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,959
much of idea like how much this computer

266
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,399
science and technology is changing the

267
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:13,360
world because in Afghanistan we we are

268
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:15,160
not that much advanced in the field and

269
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,720
we are not that much taking advantage of

270
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:19,800
this Fields so that's how it's not that

271
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:22,920
much famous in Afghanistan but through

272
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:24,480
mitw courses I came to know about

273
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:27,680
computer science and

274
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:30,680
programming and I feel that education is

275
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,360
not only about getting great in fact if

276
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:34,160
you're curious about something to know

277
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:37,399
more and then you are going deeper into

278
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:39,920
it and you getting better materials to

279
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:41,920
help you to understand the world uh that

280
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,800
that that's what matters the most for me

281
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,959
it's not only about getting grad you've

282
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:49,240
mentioned you had no idea of computer

283
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:51,800
science so I wanted to know did you end

284
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,560
up inevitably because there are some

285
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,440
things you're working on in the computer

286
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:58,560
science related field is that what you

287
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,160
are studying first of all in University

288
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,040
and then transition position into like

289
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,200
this whole new field of computer science

290
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,880
how was that for you no in fact I was

291
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,800
studying electrical and electronics

292
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:10,760
engineering so in Afghanistan especially

293
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,480
we don't have that much of subjects in

294
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:16,519
related to computer programming first

295
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:18,320
there I came to know about discourses

296
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:20,560
and then when I came to India here we

297
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,440
had subjects in this field in

298
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,160
programming even though the branch was

299
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:27,800
the same but because of different

300
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:29,880
curriculums we had a few subjects from

301
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:32,560
computer science as well there is a

302
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:35,079
course from intro to computer science

303
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:38,360
and programming using python from

304
00:12:35,079 --> 00:12:41,480
MCW and there are different versions of

305
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:43,560
it for example one was released earlier

306
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:46,639
and I like that one actually because

307
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:48,240
that Professor used to go more into

308
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,399
behind the concepts he used to teach

309
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,680
maths and later on for example now we

310
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:55,600
are having only slides and I don't like

311
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:59,519
that I like more of the traditional way

312
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:02,399
of using that white chart and Blackboard

313
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,800
yeah me too I like the sound of choke on

314
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,800
board it's really it's

315
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,279
therapeutic uh so you mentioned you did

316
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,639
electrical was that a passion is that

317
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:14,279
something you wanted to do is that

318
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:16,320
something that's widely done in terms of

319
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:19,800
your passions in life like the things

320
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:22,040
you like has ocw contributed a lot to

321
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,680
that outside the things you have to

322
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:25,360
learn you know because we all have

323
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,519
things we have to learn you know either

324
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,519
for the job or to get grades or you

325
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,639
mention something like that but any

326
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:35,920
other thing outside like something you

327
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:38,160
just enjoy learning yeah about my Branch

328
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,120
it's not that popular in Afghanistan in

329
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:43,240
fact they're more of civil engineering

330
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:45,440
and construction then as I mentioned

331
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:49,240
earlier that the way of navigating to my

332
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,959
uncle home so I was like okay can we do

333
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,199
something about electrical engineering

334
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:56,920
so that I I can help people to have more

335
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:59,399
electricity in my Village and then yeah

336
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:01,160
that was the main motive for me to

337
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:04,720
pursue electrical and electronics

338
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:08,040
engineering and honestly when I came to

339
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:10,199
University that was not what I thought

340
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:12,360
like there were like different

341
00:14:10,199 --> 00:14:14,199
misalignments between what I thought I

342
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:17,839
will be getting into universities and

343
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:20,399
then what was really there uh coming

344
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:22,639
through the your question about was

345
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:25,519
programming was part of my passion in

346
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:28,320
fact yeah there also like always I see

347
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:30,959
like how can I my main question is like

348
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,360
how can I help my people that's my main

349
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:35,639
passion when I came to India I saw this

350
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,720
potential of uh for example how

351
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:40,519
technology is honestly affecting

352
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:43,440
people's life here and from everywhere

353
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:46,199
every from medical schools from

354
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,120
universities to the even if you go to a

355
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:50,480
small shop there is like there is

356
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,440
integrated of technology and for example

357
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,880
Computer Sciences there people are using

358
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:57,240
it and making the people's life easier

359
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,560
there and that was my main motive to get

360
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,160
into computer science and

361
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:04,519
like I was trying to how can I help my

362
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:07,000
people there and from that point onwards

363
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:09,240
I was thinking of okay I have learned

364
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,959
all this stuff for free now how can I

365
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:16,600
give it back to my community and then I

366
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:19,759
came about an idea of like uh having an

367
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:21,920
online platform where students from

368
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:24,199
Afghanistan can learn about programming

369
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:27,199
and computer science because it's not

370
00:15:24,199 --> 00:15:30,000
that much familiar for s in Afghanistan

371
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:31,839
and then even if it's their people will

372
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,279
find difficult to get resources in their

373
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:37,279
own languages as I mentioned earlier one

374
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:40,600
of the problem which we had in about

375
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:42,360
mitw and most of these materials out

376
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,519
outside of Afghanistan is that most of

377
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,959
these materials are available in English

378
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:48,079
and many people in Afghanistan don't

379
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:48,920
know English so like I thought of how

380
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:52,199
can

381
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:55,759
I not make a clone

382
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:58,279
of which I cannot just for example few

383
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:00,920
subjects which really getting them to

384
00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:03,480
the uh uction to the computer science

385
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:05,680
and learn about computer science okay

386
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:07,800
this computer science is existed and

387
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,600
this really can help them in their

388
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,780
future and help other people in

389
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:15,659
Afghanistan as

390
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:15,659
[Music]

391
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:21,600
well you know you talked about how open

392
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,440
educational resources changed what you

393
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,759
were doing and your vision of the future

394
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,839
and you're working on this app now is

395
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,560
there anything else on the app you're

396
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,279
developing that you want want to tell us

397
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:34,160
about yeah basically that web

398
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:36,480
application is not a mobile app it's an

399
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:39,240
a web application where I have recorded

400
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,639
videos and I will put those videos in in

401
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,800
that application and then related to

402
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:47,079
that we will be having assignments we'll

403
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:50,040
be having GitHub repository with related

404
00:16:47,079 --> 00:16:53,160
to each lecture where they can go and

405
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:55,079
grab the code also as we go on if the

406
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:57,079
people like the material we will be

407
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:59,399
having online classes like just for

408
00:16:57,079 --> 00:17:00,759
example you are having from University

409
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:01,880
so that there will be a direct

410
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:04,120
interaction

411
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:06,120
between instructor and between the

412
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,959
students I think that can be more

413
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:10,480
helpful rather than just putting the

414
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:14,280
contents there nice and you're planning

415
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:16,360
to do all this in Persian English Arabic

416
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:18,839
yeah the content will be completely in

417
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:21,240
Persian because our native languages are

418
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:24,919
Persian and PTU mostly the people are

419
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:27,319
using these two languages and for now I

420
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:30,679
will be adding uh the contents in

421
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:33,240
Persian language and then later on I

422
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:35,760
might do it in p as well but for now it

423
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:38,240
will be in pers that's really awesome

424
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:42,799
one question we get uh from the director

425
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:45,960
of MIT open course whereare but if you

426
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:48,640
had magical abilities you had a magic

427
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:51,240
wand is there anything that you would

428
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:54,760
want to see happen with open educational

429
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:59,480
resources at MIT I feel I want two

430
00:17:54,760 --> 00:18:03,919
things to happen first one is I want MIT

431
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:07,480
ocw to be Universal knowledge of where

432
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:11,240
all students can come and learn from it

433
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:14,600
on top of that I want all the lectures

434
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:16,799
be there from mitw because now all of

435
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:19,280
them are not there I want all the

436
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:21,880
lectures to be there for example if the

437
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:24,960
lecture is recorded today I want them to

438
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:29,240
be there in the

439
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:31,480
mitw and then the other thing is just it

440
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,360
would be my wish if we have lectures in

441
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:35,120
all

442
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:37,320
languages for example in different

443
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:40,559
languages so that everyone can

444
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:42,840
regardless of their native language can

445
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:45,000
come and learn well you could help

446
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:47,640
because I'm seeing Pion is spoken by

447
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,679
around 70 million people so yeah who

448
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:52,000
knows but I also feel you on the languag

449
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:54,840
is bit yeah yeah I would also suggest

450
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,120
the same how does your vision of the

451
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:59,600
future and the future of the world

452
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:02,480
change when you think about open

453
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:04,960
educational resources do you see there

454
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:08,240
being many more opportunities for more

455
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:10,200
Learners like you or what do you kind of

456
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,440
see when you think of the future now

457
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:15,000
that you've used open educational

458
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:17,919
resources yeah honestly speaking it

459
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,360
helped me to understand that if we

460
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:23,520
Empower other people without expecting

461
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:26,000
something in return definitely if that

462
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:29,240
return is not directly to us and that

463
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,039
will help other people's lives

464
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:34,559
and then sometimes seeing all this

465
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:36,600
cruelty around the world and uneven

466
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:38,919
distribution of resources and

467
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:41,440
opportunities around the world it makes

468
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:45,159
me sad to think that we are living in

469
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:47,919
this world and then seeing courses and

470
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:50,159
institutions like MIT Stanford car

471
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:53,480
millon where they are putting all their

472
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:56,760
contents for free for other people to

473
00:19:53,480 --> 00:20:00,600
learn that makes me believe more into

474
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:03,600
the humanity and there is Al fredman I'm

475
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:06,240
listening more to his podcast he always

476
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,960
says that I believe more that humans

477
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:12,559
will prevail and I believe that in to by

478
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:16,919
seeing this all contributions from other

479
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:19,640
institutions from MIT and I feel that as

480
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:22,880
long as we are helping each other we can

481
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:25,159
have a better world and our Humanity

482
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,520
will prevail for sure I feel you

483
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:29,120
education should be it's what's actually

484
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:33,240
Chang in the world it's how we change

485
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:35,640
the world and clearly we have examples

486
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:38,480
of that working your own journey is a

487
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:40,240
clear Testament to that I really liked

488
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,320
your journey all the way from like the

489
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,840
ruler part you know studying by the

490
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:47,600
Moonlight I can relate to that I also

491
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:51,360
grow up in the village then you come to

492
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:55,240
like the town part of your country and

493
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:57,919
then so in all this I just wanted to

494
00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:00,720
know do you see yourself continuing

495
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:02,559
first of all to use ocw materials first

496
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,799
and foremost that would be my first

497
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:08,080
question and the second one maybe would

498
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:10,600
be how do you see yourself now you know

499
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:13,880
a lot has changed okay first of all

500
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:18,200
about am I still learning I think I'm

501
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:20,799
young and even though it doesn't matter

502
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:23,960
that much how old or how young you are

503
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:26,880
as a human being we should always learn

504
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:29,120
and be more curious to know about our

505
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:33,080
universe about our nature

506
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:36,960
and definitely yeah I do I do honestly

507
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:39,520
like as of now this mitw and open

508
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:42,120
education resources from other resources

509
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:45,480
these are these are my main resources

510
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:49,640
where I'm learning and getting my

511
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:51,200
answers yeah my advice would be for my

512
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:53,880
younger self

513
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:57,000
to believe in

514
00:21:53,880 --> 00:22:01,520
yourself believe in your guts which you

515
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:04,080
can do any anything possible and do not

516
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:06,080
restrict your imagination to these

517
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:09,000
things which you can see around there

518
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:12,720
are many things and more things uh which

519
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,240
you can explore and do just not related

520
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:21,200
to your

521
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:23,840
[Music]

522
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,600
environment another great conversation

523
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,840
manual L fulla's life really changed a

524
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:31,200
lot from using the Moonlight to to guide

525
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:33,200
him to chemistry classes that his uncle

526
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,400
would teach at his house to living in

527
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,520
India and starting his own

528
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,520
application and I love how he's so

529
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,679
dedicated to paying it forward for his

530
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:44,159
community what's your biggest takeaway

531
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,720
from our conversation with Le fer I

532
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:48,440
agree with you Michael my biggest

533
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:53,520
takeaway I guess would

534
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:56,440
be how much a person can achieve you see

535
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:59,360
laf has done a lot not only did he just

536
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:01,360
power through the Limited of his

537
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,640
environment to go and Achieve great

538
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:06,039
things go to India on scholarships but

539
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:08,799
he's also doing a lot not only did he

540
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:11,000
plan to develop a platform to give back

541
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:15,520
home but he engineered it himself which

542
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,440
goes to show the heart that some of our

543
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,000
Learners really have and how much they

544
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,679
really enjoy these resources that they

545
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,039
feel that they should give back to the

546
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:26,440
community for a person who was just

547
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:29,240
receiving courses on a flash dis to a

548
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:31,799
person who's now giving back that same

549
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:34,640
service that same reward to his

550
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:37,240
community that to me is a really noble

551
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,960
cause and something that's really

552
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:41,400
inspiring to the rest of our Learners so

553
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,720
anything else you want to add Michael

554
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:46,679
what was your takeaway from this story

555
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:49,880
yeah I think lul is a living example of

556
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:52,640
what the open Learning Community is all

557
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:54,640
about especially at MIT uh we have all

558
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,919
these resources open

559
00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:00,799
courseware um but everything can be

560
00:23:56,919 --> 00:24:03,240
better and the idea behind open learning

561
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:08,360
in general is what can you add to this

562
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:10,440
story now and Lula has added a lot so

563
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:13,679
you know translating everything that

564
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:16,000
he's learned to Persian on its own is a

565
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:18,640
Monumental task but then creating an

566
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:22,120
application to share that information

567
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:24,159
freely was just another layer of

568
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:26,919
extraordinary giving back to the

569
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:29,840
community and I think it is a great

570
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:31,840
example for all of us to drive to is if

571
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:34,760
you benefit from these

572
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:36,760
resources if you benefit from learning

573
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:39,000
figure out how to share it with your

574
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:41,559
community with your family with your

575
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,000
friends and don't stop there just keep

576
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:47,240
going because when you pay it forward it

577
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,159
