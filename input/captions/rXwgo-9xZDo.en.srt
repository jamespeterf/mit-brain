1
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,279
let's get started uh I'm a little under

2
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:19,000
the weather today so uh but don't take

3
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:20,600
my lack of enthusiasm my my slower style

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,600
today for a lack of enthusiasm about the

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,000
topic because today we're going to cover

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,480
one of my very favorite topics in

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,880
economics and the one I've bue a lot of

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:31,519
my life just studying which is social

9
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:35,680
insurance um so today we're going to

10
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:37,160
we're going to start back where we ended

11
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,440
we're going to ask we're going to start

12
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,360
back where we ended the last lecture

13
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,520
remember the last lecture we talked

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,520
about information imperfections we

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,600
talked about uncertainty and then we

16
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,480
talked about how why people would want

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,760
insurance and why people do spend

18
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,000
trillions of dollars or insurance but we

19
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,600
also mentioned the government also

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,640
spends trillions of dollars or insurance

21
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:57,800
and we asked why and the answer lies in

22
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,559
the problem of asymmetric information

23
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:04,040
now in the used car market example I

24
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:05,439
covered last time buyers know more about

25
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,560
the car they're selling I'm sorry

26
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:08,840
sellers know more about the car they're

27
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,320
selling than buyers know and that led

28
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,880
that asymmetric information led the

29
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:16,080
market to potentially collapse Insurance

30
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:18,119
markets is the opposite here the buyers

31
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,759
know more than the seller does but the

32
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:23,560
problem is the same so for example

33
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,159
suppose you want to start a new health

34
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,520
insurance company for MIT graduates MIT

35
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,360
graduates need health insurance uh so

36
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,439
you want to start a new company you

37
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,479
figured these are pretty pretty healthy

38
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:36,000
people health insurance will be cheap

39
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:39,399
indeed you figure you have data that

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,840
says there's 100 that out of a class of

41
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:42,040
100 graduates let's say you're going to

42
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:46,520
sell the 100

43
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:49,520
graduates 90 of them are very careful

44
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:51,840
people and they the only risk once again

45
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:55,240
like last time I was getting hit by a

46
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:58,360
car and for those 90 PE or for those 90

47
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:01,079
people there's a 10% chance that they'll

48
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:04,920
have a $10,000 bill

49
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:07,719
and a 90% chance that they'll have no

50
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,039
cost that's the expected cost for those

51
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:12,360
people for those careful

52
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:14,560
people now for the less careful people

53
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,640
or we often refer to as the sicker

54
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,720
people um uh let's do this with sickness

55
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,280
let's not do this with with car

56
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,800
accidents let's just say there's illness

57
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:26,599
you can get health we'll call these

58
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:29,040
healthy people the healthy types H have

59
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:32,080
a 10% chance of getting this sickness

60
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,400
and 9% chance of nothing happening the

61
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,400
sick

62
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:39,360
people the um and that's uh and then you

63
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,680
know the remaining 10

64
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,599
people the remaining 10 people out of

65
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:49,000
the 100 have a 50% chance of getting

66
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:51,480
sick and incurring a 10K Bill and a 50%

67
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,040
chance of nothing and that's the sick

68
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:58,000
people okay this is all data you

69
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,319
know this is data given to you that is

70
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,239
statistically accurate it's a separate

71
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,480
issue about what about when you don't

72
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:04,599
know the information we'll come back to

73
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,799
that but for now M you know this

74
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:07,680
information okay so what you do is you

75
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:10,319
say

76
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,080
look I then know the expected value of

77
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:16,799
buying Insurance to MIT students when I

78
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:20,040
sell to those 100 people my expected

79
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:23,239
cost if I sell this 100 people my

80
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:26,760
expected cost is what well my expected

81
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:29,519
cost for the healthy people is a th a

82
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,360
10% chance of 10,000 I expect to cost a

83
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,799
th000

84
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:36,159
for the healthy

85
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:38,200
people and my expected and they are 90%

86
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,959
of the

87
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:43,319
population okay so a th expect to cost

88
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:47,159
health people they're 90% of the

89
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:49,920
population and for the sick people an

90
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:52,360
expected cost of $5,000 because they

91
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,879
might get sick 50% of the time and that

92
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:58,519
happens 10% of the

93
00:03:54,879 --> 00:04:01,720
time so by statistical simple statistics

94
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:01,720
my expected cost

95
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:07,959
is400 so I expect that when I sell

96
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:12,519
insurance I will pay out

97
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:14,959
$1,400 okay so I say well if I sell

98
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:17,079
insurance for

99
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:20,160
$1,500 as long as people a little risk

100
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:21,239
averse they want to buy it right $1,400

101
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,479
everyone want to buy as long as they're

102
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:26,120
not risk

103
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:28,320
loving if I I charge $1,500 then then at

104
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,280
least the risk unless unless you a

105
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,840
little risk averse they'll buy it and I

106
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,880
can make a profit so I roll in I sell

107
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,720
insurance for

108
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:38,440
$1,500 and I make a tidy profit I think

109
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,600
of $100 on 100 people each

110
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,800
$10,000 why am I

111
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,639
wrong why do I not in fact make that

112
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,960
profit why in fact might I lose

113
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:49,240
money why is that math wrong why if why

114
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:53,160
IFI were for

115
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,160
$1,500 might I in fact lose

116
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,720
money

117
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,520
yeah purchase yeah because I assumed

118
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,160
everyone buys it but I don't have the

119
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,759
power to make everyone buy it so who's

120
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:08,479
actually going to buy it well let's

121
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:10,720
think about that all the sick guys if I

122
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,840
charge

123
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,479
$1,500 this is an incredible deal for

124
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:18,000
the sick guys right the expected value

125
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:21,080
of the insurance is

126
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,280
$5,000 and I'm charging the, 1500 and

127
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:25,039
the risk of Earth so they're like this

128
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:27,400
is a great deal what about the healthy

129
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:30,840
guys well the expected value of

130
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:35,000
insurance them is a th and I'm char of

131
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:37,080
1500 so unless their risk premium is 500

132
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,960
or more they won't

133
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,360
buy so let's let's imagine some

134
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,520
distribution of risk premiums out there

135
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:47,680
in the population and let's imagine that

136
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:50,160
it's such that um only half the healthy

137
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,520
guys decide to buy when I charge

138
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,160
1500 I that half number is just a made

139
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,440
up but there's some distribution of risk

140
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,680
aversion some the guys are super risk

141
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,919
averse they'll easily they'll happily

142
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,400
buy 1500 some aren't very risk averse

143
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:03,680
they won't buy A5 00 let's say half buy

144
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,039
so now what do I pay out at the end of

145
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,360
the year what do I pay out well to my

146
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:10,680
sick

147
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:13,639
people to my 96 people I pay

148
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:16,039
out uh to my to my 96 people I pay out

149
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:21,599
on average

150
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:24,440
$45,000 okay I pay it on average uh

151
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:28,039
uh uh I'm sorry for my 9 sick for my 10

152
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:30,280
sick people I paid on average

153
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:31,199
$5,000 okay that that's why I pay my 10

154
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:34,160
sick

155
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,360
people that's my expected payout what if

156
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,720
my healthy people I said only only 45 of

157
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,919
the healthy people choose to buy right

158
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:46,120
so for those people I have a

159
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:48,639
45 times a $1,000 payout in expectation

160
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,639
so my

161
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:54,199
payout uh my payout is uh

162
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:03,680
$95,000 okay for $ 45 ,000 people okay

163
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,479
for 45 people but what's my

164
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,319
revenues well how many people have I

165
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:10,680
sold

166
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:13,400
to 60 people 10 sick and 50

167
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:17,800
healthy I'm sorry I i' I've sold to 55

168
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:21,840
people 10 sick and 45

169
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:27,639
healthy okay what's 55 time

170
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:30,879
150 well 55 time 150 is only 82 thou is

171
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:30,879
only 82250

172
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,720
so I have paid

173
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,840
out

174
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:40,960
$95,000 but I've only

175
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,800
collected a little more than $82,000 so

176
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,639
I lose

177
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,639
money therefore I don't offer the

178
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:50,879
insurance this is the flip of the car

179
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,319
example in the car example because I

180
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,440
don't know what's a what's a lemon and

181
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,960
what's not a lemon I don't buy the car

182
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,840
here because I'm not sure who's sick and

183
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,319
who's not if I offer at that price I'm

184
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:02,479
going to lose money someone off someone

185
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,919
offer it now you might say to me well

186
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:06,599
that's because you were dumb you chose

187
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,000
too low too low a price what if I just

188
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:11,120
rais the price to

189
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,120
$2,000 maybe that'll solve my problem

190
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,680
well at

191
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:18,159
$2,000 I make a lot more money per

192
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,159
person but what else happens at

193
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:22,919
$2,000 fewer Health even fewer healthy

194
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:25,000
people

195
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:27,960
buy so if at

196
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,639
$2,000 only 10 healthy people buy

197
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:33,599
instead of 45 I I'll still lose

198
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:36,719
money the point is this problem of what

199
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,719
we call adverse

200
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,959
selection adverse selection which is

201
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,159
only the

202
00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:47,959
people on whom you're going to lose

203
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:49,920
money want to buy screws up Insurance

204
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:51,920
markets once again let me be clear on

205
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,600
this since only the people for whom it's

206
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,920
a good deal want to

207
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,959
buy and you lose money on the people for

208
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,079
it's a good deal you make money people

209
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,640
it's a bad deal right it's a bad deal

210
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:01,200
for the healthy if you charge more than

211
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,600
a thousand it's a bad deal for them

212
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,880
you're making money on them so

213
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,440
essentially what's Insurance doing it's

214
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,000
taking money from the

215
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,320
healthy exter healthy to cover your

216
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,440
costs on the

217
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,399
sick that only works if the healthy will

218
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,640
play If The Healthy won't play it

219
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:21,480
doesn't

220
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,480
work okay questions about

221
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:27,399
that so what happens in the real world

222
00:09:25,079 --> 00:09:30,000
well if there's five possible outcomes

223
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:32,040
here five possible outcomes

224
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,959
okay outcome

225
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:36,720
one outcome one is the one good outcome

226
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:41,519
which is the health people are so risk

227
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:44,440
averse enough of them buy so if there's

228
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:47,440
enough risk

229
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,440
averse

230
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:53,800
healthy then you can make this work

231
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:56,120
right if more if if something like 70 of

232
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,440
the 95 90 healthy people buy I don't

233
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,800
know I forget what the crossover point

234
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,800
is we should add that to the not SP

235
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,320
there's an error in the notes just say

236
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,519
45 not 50 and we should add what the

237
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,200
crossover point is I don't can't do it

238
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:08,079
in my head but there's some crossover

239
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:11,079
point where if enough healthy people buy

240
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:13,279
I will make money at $1,500 or

241
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:15,600
$2,000 so the first outcome is it all

242
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,480
works out yes there's average selection

243
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,640
but it's not so bad because the healthy

244
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,720
are very risk

245
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,160
averse that's outcome

246
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,640
one outcome

247
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:29,320
two is the market collapses the market

248
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:32,000
fails why do the market fail because

249
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:35,120
because at any price the adverse

250
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,680
election is so bad I can't make money I

251
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,959
never get enough profitable healthy to

252
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:44,399
cover my unprofitable

253
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:46,480
sick so the market fails that's the

254
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,600
second possible

255
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:53,560
outcome there's a third

256
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,560
outcome I could just sell to

257
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:02,399
sick let's say I rolled in and I said

258
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:04,760
I've got insurance for MIT graduates

259
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,760
it's going to be

260
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:09,560
$5,500

261
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:12,440
well at that point as long as the sick

262
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:16,000
are somewhat risk averse they'll buy

263
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:17,519
it or if they're $5,100 if they're all

264
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
risk averse they'll buy it and I'll make

265
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,920
some money so I could just sell the sick

266
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,040
people at that high price no Health

267
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,279
people want the health people want it

268
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,480
great go for it I'm happy to have them

269
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,720
but that's just icing I then make money

270
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,160
on the sick as long as I set the price

271
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,040
above 5,000

272
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,000
so that's another thing I could do I

273
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,200
could just have a health insurance

274
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,320
policy for the sick priced at the price

275
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,639
for the sick and I know the healthy just

276
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:43,880
won't take it or if they do it's only

277
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:43,880
icing okay a fourth thing I could

278
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,839
do is I could just

279
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,360
discriminate I could say I'm going to

280
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:53,560
sell insurance at

281
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,680
$1,500 I'm G to test you when you come

282
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:58,320
in if I find you're sick I'm not going

283
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,000
to sell to you if I find you're healthy

284
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,760
I'm going to sell to you

285
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,560
turns out totally legal until the

286
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:08,480
Affordable Care Act passed so for most

287
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,920
of my life insurers were totally legal

288
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,200
to say if you're sick I'm not going to

289
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,360
sell you insurance or if you get sick

290
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,399
I'm going to drop you from insurance as

291
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,440
I hope you can see that sort of

292
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,600
undercuts the whole idea of insurance

293
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,800
well your insurance is to get healthy

294
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:23,399
people to cross upside sick people and

295
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,279
you drop people as soon as they're sick

296
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:28,079
then it doesn't really provide insurance

297
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,440
so insurers were totally free to do that

298
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,519
before the Affordable Care Act pass and

299
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:35,880
I'll talk more about that the last

300
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:38,160
lecture okay finally there's a clever

301
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:40,040
solution which I don't the math is hard

302
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,360
so I'm just give the intuition which is

303
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:44,959
you can

304
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,959
sell different

305
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:52,160
products that is what I can do is I can

306
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:55,480
sell two

307
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:59,440
products comprehensive

308
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:03,320
insurance for $5,500

309
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:06,600
and crappy insurance for

310
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:09,040
$1,500 as long as the sick people don't

311
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,880
want the crappy Insurance then what have

312
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,279
I

313
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:14,600
done I've solved the asymmetric

314
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:17,240
information Problem by getting people to

315
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,399
reveal their underlying health remember

316
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,120
my problem is I don't know who's sick

317
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,440
and who's healthy I know the Aggregates

318
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,680
but I don't who's sick and who's healthy

319
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,079
if people had sick and healthy stamped

320
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,560
on their forehead I'd be done but I

321
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,760
don't know that but if I offer a very

322
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,680
good product that's expensive and a

323
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,199
shitty product that's cheap

324
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,399
people will tell me their type by what

325
00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:35,880
they buy the health people will buy the

326
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:37,560
crappy product sick people buy the the

327
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,959
other product and I'll make money on

328
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:42,160
both so that's another thing I do have

329
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:45,560
have you ever heard of an HMO that's

330
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,760
what an HMO is okay basically that's

331
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,360
what we've done with health insurance in

332
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,160
America to try to deal with this problem

333
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:53,079
has created

334
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:56,120
less high quality insurance for the

335
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:58,000
healthiest people that they can buy

336
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,560
cheaply okay so that's another thing we

337
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,199
can do

338
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:04,920
okay here's the key

339
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:07,199
Point all of

340
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:10,519
these are market

341
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:12,000
failures all of them you may say I know

342
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:13,120
that's a market failure but why is it

343
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,399
market failure if you just sell to the

344
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,399
sick why is that a market

345
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:23,800
failure

346
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:25,800
yeah L some people yeah there are trades

347
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,079
that with perfect information I would be

348
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,759
happy to make and they would be happy to

349
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:32,320
make them not being made so long as

350
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:34,880
imperfect information information

351
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,519
asymmetry leads to trades not being made

352
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,680
that most both make both sides better

353
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:42,120
off then that's a market failure so the

354
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,519
sick it's a market failure likewise if I

355
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,639
discriminate that's a market failure

356
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:48,360
because there's sick people who would

357
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:49,399
happily pay me $50 $200 for insurance

358
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,839
but I don't know they are so I can't

359
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:53,639
sell them at

360
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:55,720
50200 finally even selling different

361
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:59,399
products is still a market

362
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:01,600
failure the reason is because

363
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:05,199
what you can see from the insurance

364
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:08,959
model we set up last time is a typical

365
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:10,720
risk averse consumer wants complete

366
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,480
insurance they don't want partial

367
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,040
insurance they want to basically make

368
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,920
sure that their consumption is the same

369
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,399
no matter if they get hit by a car or

370
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,639
not and partial Insurance isn't as good

371
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:21,720
because once again the extra they keep

372
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,519
doesn't compensate for how much they

373
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:26,360
lose they hit by the car so incomplete

374
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:29,120
insurance is also a market

375
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:31,120
failure so the point is unless you

376
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,880
enough risk vers healthy the market will

377
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:38,600
not deliver the welfare maximizing

378
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:38,600
outcome okay questions about

379
00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:46,720
that okay so now once again as I said

380
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,160
the principle that I teach in my classes

381
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,720
is the market knows best until the

382
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,240
market fails and then there's a

383
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,480
potential role for the government but

384
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,040
it's only a potential role for the

385
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,519
government and the reason it's

386
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,800
especially confusing here is there's

387
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:00,880
many different ways the government could

388
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:03,240
come in and solve this problem and in

389
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:06,480
fact governments around the world do

390
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,800
this in three different ways they solve

391
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,199
this problem three different ways the

392
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,199
first way so what about Government

393
00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:19,079
Solutions the first way government

394
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,079
solved this problem is with

395
00:16:20,199 --> 00:16:26,920
subsidies let's go back to our

396
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:29,360
example what if I said to everyone who's

397
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:33,880
an MIT graduate

398
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:35,759
I will give you $500 if you buy

399
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,720
insurance then the original product

400
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,639
would

401
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:42,959
work because the $1,500 I would charge

402
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:44,639
them like let's say I the government say

403
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,440
I'll give $500 well the F the insurance

404
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:49,920
I'm offering $1,500 so it's then a good

405
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:51,480
deal for both sides so they both buy it

406
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,480
so in substance one way to combat

407
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,600
average selection is through price if

408
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,880
you make it cheap enough the healthy

409
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,040
will

410
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:01,160
buy so subsidies just naturally offset

411
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,720
selection if I get a $500 subsidy in my

412
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:05,240
previous example it's a good deal for

413
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:08,400
everyone and everyone buys and we get

414
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:10,240
solution one we get this one everyone

415
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,160
buys

416
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:16,199
okay that's one

417
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:17,079
option indeed we use that option A Lot

418
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:21,360
in the

419
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:23,839
US in the US we massively subsidize

420
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:27,160
Private health insurance how do we do

421
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:29,520
that well one way we do it is through

422
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:32,080
our tax code here here's a interesting

423
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,960
feature of tax code if MIT pays me in

424
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,919
wages I get

425
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,480
taxed I'm not giving away too much

426
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,600
private information say if you add up

427
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:41,280
the tax rate I pay to Massachusetts and

428
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,160
to the federal government my tax rate

429
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,799
approach is 50% so I get to keep about

430
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:49,360
half of what I make okay but if MIT

431
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:51,919
gives me health insurance it's not

432
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,760
taxed so if MIT says to me John do you

433
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:56,159
want

434
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:58,000
$1,000 in health insurance or $1,000 in

435
00:17:56,159 --> 00:18:00,120
wages I say wait a second if you give me

436
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,080
,000 in wages I get to buy $500 worth of

437
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,559
goods you give me $1,000 worth of health

438
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,320
insurance I get $1,000 worth of health

439
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:08,159
insurance I'll take the health insurance

440
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,200
and that is partly why most people in

441
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:11,960
America get their health insurance

442
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,640
through their employer we bribe them to

443
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:16,960
we bribe them to by taxing their wages

444
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,960
but not taxing their health insurance

445
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,720
that's a massive subsidy that cost us

446
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:24,280
government $300 billion doll every

447
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:26,159
single year big money that we're paying

448
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:29,159
to bribe people to buy private

449
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:30,280
insurance okay so that's one example of

450
00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:31,559
how a government could come in and try

451
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,840
to solve this

452
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:37,480
problem a second

453
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:39,159
example is through a mandate any of you

454
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,760
followed Health Care policy debates when

455
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:42,080
you were younger remember this term of

456
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:44,679
the Mandate it was a big centerpiece of

457
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,880
the debate over the Affordable Care Act

458
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:47,799
which is what if I just say everyone has

459
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,919
to

460
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:54,880
buy I say healthy sick alike you have to

461
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:56,640
buy then basically I get this outcome

462
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,200
again because I force everyone to buy so

463
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,559
I know what the price is remember I know

464
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,799
an aggregate the price should be I just

465
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:04,000
don't know who's going to buy and who's

466
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:06,360
not so I force everyone to

467
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,960
buy everyone comes in and and I know

468
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:14,200
what price to set okay

469
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,840
now you might think well gee that seems

470
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:18,480
like a way better option than option one

471
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:20,480
option one costs the government a ton of

472
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,679
money option two cost the government

473
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,360
nothing other than just say buy

474
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:26,799
insurance but in fact who gets upset

475
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,880
when there's a

476
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:32,120
mandate which particular group is is

477
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,120
most upset when you mandate health

478
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,240
insurance the healthy who are not super

479
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,360
risk

480
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,880
ofe they are getting hit they didn't

481
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,840
want to buy insurance

482
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,720
at500 you're forced them to do something

483
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,159
they didn't want to do that's

484
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,960
politically very challenging as we

485
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:49,440
learned with the Affordable Care

486
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,799
Act okay which is that it's politically

487
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,679
very challenging to force people do

488
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,159
something they don't want to do in the

489
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,520
American political

490
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:58,240
system so in some sense you can give a

491
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:00,720
mandate at sort of implicitly forcing

492
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,760
the health to subsidize the sick that's

493
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,120
great because it gets the government out

494
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:08,400
of the way but it's essentially pissing

495
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,679
off the healthy non-risk averse people

496
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,799
and believe me during the Affordable Car

497
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,760
Act debate every single one of them sent

498
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:16,159
me an email okay people did not like

499
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,280
that feature uh of the Mandate in the

500
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:19,039
Affordable Care Act and eventually the

501
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,760
Mandate went away for that

502
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,720
reason okay we but we have mandates

503
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:26,039
they're not

504
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,159
new okay for example the oldest program

505
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:29,799
of this type in the country is called

506
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,880
Workers Compensation Insurance

507
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:33,520
that's a program that ensures you you

508
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,440
get hurt at work that's been a mandated

509
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:38,039
benefit of employers since the early

510
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,320
20th century no one's protesting workers

511
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:41,480
comp

512
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:43,640
mandates in Most states you're mandated

513
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,720
to buy auto insurance people don't

514
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,000
protest that they about how

515
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,520
expensive auto insurance is people don't

516
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
protest it so interestingly mandates are

517
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:52,039
not A New Concept brought up by the

518
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,200
Affordable Care Act it was just this

519
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:55,200
application they got people very

520
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,919
upset the final option for the

521
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:01,520
government

522
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:03,880
is you can just provide the

523
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:07,520
insurance cut off the middleman say

524
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:09,440
sorry John we're just going to have gov

525
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,640
care it's going to be whatever it's

526
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,799
going to be and if we lose money we lose

527
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,960
money because we're the government we

528
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:15,880
don't need to break

529
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,960
even we're just going to provide

530
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,120
it obviously you can combine it with

531
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,120
subsidies you say provide it we're going

532
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,120
to subsidize so everyone's in or you

533
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,240
just provide it and make it free this is

534
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,559
what most countries do most countries

535
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:29,320
say we have a national health insurance

536
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,400
system it's free take Canada

537
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,679
when you're born you're entitled to

538
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,360
national health insurance it's free you

539
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,840
just go there's no ad selection because

540
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,080
it's free when stuff's free there's no

541
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:38,520
aers

542
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,400
selection okay so that's another way you

543
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,919
could do is have the government just

544
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:43,360
provide it indeed that's what most of

545
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:47,799
the world

546
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,799
does okay questions about any of

547
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:54,679
that

548
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:56,039
yeah uh private insurers at all no

549
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:57,039
mandate tell private insurers because

550
00:21:56,039 --> 00:22:00,039
when you mandate you're giving them more

551
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,039
customers

552
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:07,559
know government Health thing back then

553
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,720
like some private insurance because what

554
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:11,240
the government did is they wanted to

555
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,600
make a trade they said we'll mandate

556
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:15,240
insurance but you need to stop

557
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,200
discriminating that was the trade was

558
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,679
they're saying you're discriminating

559
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,600
because of adverse selection here's the

560
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,880
deal we're going to offer you stop

561
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,720
discriminating and we'll end your

562
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,080
adverse selection some people would

563
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,760
rather discriminate and they're upset

564
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:29,360
about

565
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:32,520
it okay good question now the bottom

566
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:34,320
line is this all sounds pretty good

567
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:37,240
we've got a problem we've identified

568
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,559
potential Solutions most governments of

569
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,880
the world are using some combination

570
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:43,559
Solutions what's the problem well the

571
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:46,400
problem is that there's another asmsc

572
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:48,159
information problem which poses a a

573
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:52,919
fundamental tradeoff and that's what we

574
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:52,919
call the fundamental social insurance

575
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:00,360
tradeoff and that other problem that

576
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:03,760
other a information problem is what we

577
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,760
call moral

578
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,320
hazard the other asymmetric information

579
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:19,400
is what we call moral hazard that's

580
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:22,240
basically the adverse behavior that is

581
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:25,320
encouraged by uring against an adverse

582
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:30,039
event when you Ure against an adverse

583
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:31,679
event you can cause adverse Behavior

584
00:23:30,039 --> 00:23:33,480
so basically for example if families buy

585
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:34,480
fire insurance for their homes they may

586
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,039
be less likely to have a fire

587
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,039
extinguisher in the house they don't

588
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:40,600
need it because their house is insured

589
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:42,400
if it burns down if people have health

590
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,760
insurance maybe they're less worried

591
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,720
about taking

592
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,600
precautions okay I'm not feeling so well

593
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:50,200
today I de thought I'd come in with a

594
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,480
mask be okay but if I have health

595
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,640
insurance maybe I

596
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:56,720
wouldn't you know so basically maybe

597
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:58,799
there's risk people take and then

598
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,480
also take another example one of the

599
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,960
biggest Insurance programs in America is

600
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,840
unemployment insurance insurance you get

601
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:06,240
if you lose your job well if we insure

602
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:08,080
you for the money you lose when you lose

603
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,760
your job what's the incentive to search

604
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,799
for a new job remember Leisure is a

605
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:14,600
normal

606
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:16,760
good these are all forms of moral hazard

607
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:18,600
and the best and most fun examples come

608
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:20,000
in the context of workers compensation

609
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:23,039
which I already mentioned already that's

610
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,720
a $60 billion a year program that

611
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:29,080
ensures people for injuries that are job

612
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,320
related the problem is now you might

613
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:33,480
think well that sounds like really

614
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,919
sensible Insurance the problem is a lot

615
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,520
of these problems are actually hard to

616
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:39,320
diagnose and hard to figure out their

617
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:41,440
job related if someone is at a machine

618
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:44,000
you watch them saw their arm off that's

619
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,679
pretty easy if someone says I've been

620
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,200
driving all day and I have back pain and

621
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:50,600
I can't stand up that's

622
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:52,919
harder most of claims for workers

623
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:56,559
compensation today are mostly pain and

624
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:59,679
mental health those are hard things to

625
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:03,159
evaluate as a result

626
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:04,279
um and then on top of that workers so

627
00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:05,520
you've got two problems workers

628
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:07,559
compensation one is it's hard to

629
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:10,799
evaluate if people are really

630
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:13,039
injured the other is if they are injured

631
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:15,320
they get a pretty attractive benefit if

632
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:18,960
you miss work and get Workers

633
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:21,440
Comp you get 75% of the wages you would

634
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,880
have gotten if you worked so you can sit

635
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,240
at home and get 75 remember Leisure is

636
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,720
normal people would rather not work so

637
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:29,080
you can work or sit at home with 75% of

638
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,880
your Wes but it's better than that

639
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:34,000
because your wages are taxed and workers

640
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:36,279
comp Isn't So for a typical worker after

641
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,919
tax their workers comp amounts to about

642
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:40,080
90% of what they take home working so

643
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:42,440
you got a program which says look

644
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,120
Leisure is a normal good I'm going to

645
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:46,440
pay you roughly 90% of what you'd earn

646
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:49,279
at work all you have to do is pretend

647
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:50,320
you're hurt that's a clear incentive for

648
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:54,399
moral

649
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:56,320
hazard okay so basically the idea is

650
00:25:54,399 --> 00:25:57,679
that there might be moral hazard is

651
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,360
something like workers comp and there's

652
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:01,960
been a large really fascinating

653
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:05,080
literature this tried to measure

654
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:08,559
that sometimes there's fun examples my

655
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:11,279
favorite example was the woman who in in

656
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:13,279
what state what state I'm talking about

657
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:15,640
bad behavior what state am I talk about

658
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:19,840
Florida right come on so there was a

659
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:21,320
woman in Florida who was at her desk uh

660
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,600
while she was at her desk a sprinkler

661
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,919
had fell out of the ceiling and landed

662
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:26,760
on her desk and shocked her she looked

663
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:28,799
around bonked herself on the head with a

664
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:31,559
sprinkler desk with with the sprinkler

665
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:32,440
piece and claim workers comp but of

666
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:34,720
course you know the reason I'm telling

667
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:37,159
the story is All on

668
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,880
camera okay have any guys ever heard to

669
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:40,240
show Wicked Tuna it's about tuna fishing

670
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,440
out of gloss about a guy wrestles these

671
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,600
thousand two ton Tunas onto his boat

672
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,760
turns out the whole time I was on Wicked

673
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,520
Tuna he was collecting workers

674
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:49,760
compensation because he couldn't

675
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:52,279
work okay there are lots of fun really

676
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:55,120
fun examples but we care about an

677
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:58,600
economics is not stories we care about

678
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:00,960
facts and how do we test in empirical

679
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:03,520
economics whether moral hazards a real

680
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:06,679
problem but well the way we do it is we

681
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:09,600
say it turns out that what you get from

682
00:27:06,679 --> 00:27:11,840
workers comp varies across different

683
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:14,399
states and over

684
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:17,279
time so let's say I'm in one state

685
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:19,840
Andrew's in another state Andrew State

686
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:21,200
randomly raises the benefits now there's

687
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,480
no reason Andrew should be more injury

688
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,640
prone just because the state rais the

689
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,360
benefits but if Andrew becomes more

690
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,960
likely to be injured when the state

691
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,320
raises its benefits clearly that's moral

692
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,640
hazard because there's no other reason

693
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:32,799
why just because the state rais benefits

694
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:35,440
Andrew should be more injury prone and

695
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:37,640
the evidence that is incredibly powerful

696
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,640
we talked about the elasticities the

697
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:43,919
evidence is that for every

698
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:47,200
10% that benefits go up people Miss 10

699
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:50,159
to 20% more work an elasticity of one to

700
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:53,080
two people are very responsive to these

701
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:55,480
benefits and that's C evidence of moral

702
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:58,799
hazard

703
00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:01,120
okay um so

704
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:03,679
moral hazard exists but we might ask

705
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,799
look so what's the problem okay every

706
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,240
selection I explained the problem the

707
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:08,600
market collapses that's pretty bad

708
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,919
collapse we know is a bad word that's

709
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:13,919
bad what about moral hazard why is it so

710
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:16,080
bad well it's bad for two

711
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:19,559
reasons the

712
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:22,120
first is you

713
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:24,679
remove

714
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:26,919
productive labor

715
00:28:24,679 --> 00:28:29,640
Supply let's just do some quick math to

716
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:33,000
show why this is

717
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:35,600
imagine that an individual is choosing

718
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,600
between staying at home is choosing for

719
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:40,480
the for the marginal hour do I stay at

720
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:42,480
home or do I

721
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,760
work well we know the way they'll make

722
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:47,440
that decision is they will

723
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:50,399
maximize their utility over consumption

724
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:53,279
and Leisure subject to some budget

725
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:56,240
constraint and we know that this will

726
00:28:53,279 --> 00:29:00,720
yield the first order condition that

727
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:03,039
du DL or the margin utility of leisure

728
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,320
equals the

729
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:07,559
wage that will be the equilibrium

730
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:10,159
condition why because it's where

731
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:12,120
marginal benefits equal marginal costs

732
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:15,120
what's the marginal benefit of staying

733
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:17,679
home how much happier it makes you the

734
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,720
Marg utility of leisure what's the

735
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,440
marginal cost of staying at home you

736
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:24,600
give up your wage

737
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:26,320
W so an efficient market this is a very

738
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,799
important Insight by the way many people

739
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,240
talk about work as a virtue that is

740
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:32,159
wrong

741
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:33,799
work is not a virtue okay people should

742
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:36,080
only work until this condition is true

743
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:38,279
if you're someone who reallying hates

744
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,760
work because you're really disabled it's

745
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:43,440
awful you shouldn't work it's not like

746
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:44,919
God has said we must work okay the right

747
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,679
the optimal social conditions people

748
00:29:44,919 --> 00:29:49,120
should work until this condition is

749
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:51,679
true which means no one should work all

750
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:53,360
the time that can't be true 24 hours a

751
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:55,720
day for everyone at some point you got

752
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:58,120
to sleep and some people should work

753
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,919
less or more than others okay that's

754
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:02,720
what's

755
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:05,760
optimal okay now imagine

756
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:09,080
that um and we

757
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:10,960
know that the wage in a perfectly

758
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:13,480
competitive labor market equals the

759
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,799
marginal revenue product of labor we

760
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,480
know that's where the wage comes from in

761
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:18,480
a perfectly competitive labor

762
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:21,559
market

763
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,360
okay so basically think of this from the

764
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:26,000
from the employer perspective from the

765
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:27,240
employer perspective I take Leisure

766
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,519
until the Val Leisure equals the value

767
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:31,159
of what i' produce at work okay so

768
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:32,200
basically what we want in society want

769
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:34,000
people trading off the value of what

770
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:36,720
they produce at work versus how much the

771
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,760
value they get from sitting at home but

772
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:41,840
now suppose I tell

773
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:44,480
you that for every hour you sit at home

774
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:48,000
you also get an amount

775
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:53,039
G well now if I sit at home what do I

776
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:54,600
get I get du DL plus G and I set that

777
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:56,440
equal to the marginal revenue product of

778
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,840
labor so

779
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,880
DL plus G

780
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:02,919
I said equal the margin product of

781
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:05,000
labor let's think for a second about

782
00:31:02,919 --> 00:31:07,799
what this does to my leisure

783
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,519
decision this means I set my margin

784
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:11,760
utility of

785
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:13,880
leisure

786
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,840
above I'm sorry I set margin utility

787
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:18,880
leure below my marginal product because

788
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:21,440
G's positive I set my margin ility of

789
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:26,000
leisure equal to mrpl minus

790
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:28,639
G does that imply more Leisure or less

791
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,880
Leisure than what we know is a efficient

792
00:31:28,639 --> 00:31:34,039
we know efficient is DL equals mrpl if

793
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:37,880
DL plus g equals

794
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:41,039
mrpl am I supplying more Leisure or less

795
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:45,080
Leisure than the efficient

796
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:45,080
outcome we know this yeah go

797
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:51,600
ahead more because remember as Leisure

798
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,559
goes up Margin utility goes down we know

799
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:58,080
we want Mar since G is positive to keep

800
00:31:54,559 --> 00:32:00,639
it equ PL DL has to go down

801
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:03,799
doodl goes down by taking more Leisure

802
00:32:00,639 --> 00:32:06,240
so by offering this benefit I've created

803
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:08,720
inefficiency I'm C to take more Leisure

804
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:12,120
than is optimal the optimal Leisure

805
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:15,159
would be DL equal mrpl but I'm making DL

806
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:17,720
equal to mrpl minus G so I'm causing

807
00:32:15,159 --> 00:32:20,159
them to take too much leisure in other

808
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:22,200
words I'm getting in the way of

809
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:25,000
productive trades there's a productive

810
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:26,840
trade to be made here which is I work

811
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,760
you pay me but now I'm like it I'm

812
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:31,039
not going to work because I get G so

813
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:33,399
that's a productive trade that goes away

814
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:35,600
because of moral hazard and that's why

815
00:32:33,399 --> 00:32:37,440
we care that's a dead weight

816
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,760
loss

817
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,639
okay there's a second there's a second

818
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:44,720
problem which is sort of minor but

819
00:32:41,639 --> 00:32:47,440
important but which to remember which is

820
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:50,080
that how do we pay for social insurance

821
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:52,120
programs by taxing

822
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:54,120
workers the less people work the more

823
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:58,159
taxes we have to raise on everybody else

824
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:58,159
so it means higher tax rates

825
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:02,360
because if we're shrinking the base of

826
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:04,039
workers but we got to pay for all these

827
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:05,480
workers sitting at home that means

828
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:07,639
higher tax

829
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:09,559
rates and we'll talk later about why

830
00:33:07,639 --> 00:33:11,600
higher tax rates cause

831
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:12,880
inefficiency so this leads us to the

832
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,679
fundamental

833
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:18,080
tradeoff with social insurance on the

834
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:20,039
one hand unless the government

835
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,919
intervenes there will be a market

836
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:24,240
collapse unless you get condition one

837
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:26,480
and we have lots of evidence condition

838
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,440
one has in met in most markets the

839
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,919
market will collapse and that is bad

840
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:32,919
that's a welfare loss on the other hand

841
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:34,760
by providing that insurance we create an

842
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:35,919
offsetting welfare loss which people

843
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:38,760
don't work as

844
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:40,000
hard what does that mean well that has a

845
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,960
simple

846
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,440
implication which is we should have

847
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:47,639
social insurance but it shouldn't be too

848
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,080
generous clearly the right answer is not

849
00:33:47,639 --> 00:33:52,120
zero social insurance unless moral

850
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:53,679
hazard is like deadly I mean you know

851
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:55,039
this is just you're losing some product

852
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:58,679
this one people starve if they don't

853
00:33:55,039 --> 00:34:00,600
have insurance so clearly want some

854
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:03,320
insurance but if we have too much we

855
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:06,080
might encourage people to sit at home so

856
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:07,880
the ideas we want in between want a

857
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,879
tradeoff want enough insurance we won

858
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:12,040
starve but not so much that we cause a

859
00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:15,960
lot of moral

860
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:18,119
hazard okay and to see that let's talk

861
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:20,480
about the largest social insurance

862
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:23,960
program in America which is the Social

863
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,960
Security program

864
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:37,800
we have a number of social insurance

865
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:39,639
programs in America I mentioned workers

866
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:41,040
compensation if you get H at work I

867
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:42,079
mentioned unemployment insurance if you

868
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:46,119
lose your

869
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:47,839
job our biggest aggregate social

870
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:49,480
programs are for healthcare I'll talk

871
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:51,119
about them in the last lecture they're

872
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:54,040
called Medicare and

873
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:56,119
Medicaid okay but the single biggest

874
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:59,160
program of social insurance at about

875
00:34:56,119 --> 00:35:01,440
$800 billion a year

876
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:04,920
is social

877
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:08,280
security Social Security is insurance

878
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:11,480
against the income loss that comes from

879
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:13,440
retirement soci is insurance against the

880
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,560
income loss of retirement it's ensuring

881
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,359
you to make sure that once you're

882
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:20,599
retired you have enough money and don't

883
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:22,560
starve let's talk about how it works

884
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:23,720
here's how Social Security works first

885
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:26,079
when you

886
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:28,280
retire you get a check from the

887
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:30,520
government

888
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:32,200
you get a check from the

889
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:36,599
government

890
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:39,400
okay that check is a function of how

891
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:43,040
much you made before you retired that

892
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:45,720
check is

893
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:48,280
Progressive what does that mean that

894
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:49,839
means that if you're very poor you get a

895
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:52,280
check that's almost as much as you made

896
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:53,880
before you retired if you're rich you

897
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,920
get a check that's about 30% of what you

898
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:57,640
made before you

899
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:58,800
retired so you get a check that

900
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,119
basically depends on how much you made

901
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,839
before you retire but in a Progressive

902
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:02,640
Way the more you made before you retire

903
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:03,880
the less you get back from the

904
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,119
government everybody gets something

905
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:08,880
everyone gets at least

906
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:11,599
30% but there's a range 30 to

907
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,800
90 actually I'm wrong it's at least 15%

908
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:15,680
there's a range 15 to 90 over which of

909
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,920
VAR so Bill Gates will get Social

910
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:20,319
Security start to keep picking on Bill

911
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:23,240
he'll get Social Security but only get

912
00:36:20,319 --> 00:36:26,319
15% of his previous

913
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:30,599
wages uh or or or you know subit to a

914
00:36:26,319 --> 00:36:32,319
cap so even less okay you get this check

915
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:36,480
until you

916
00:36:32,319 --> 00:36:38,720
die it's what's called an

917
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,200
annuity this is an important term not a

918
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:43,440
lot of people know financially Savvy

919
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:44,880
people an annuity is the opposite of

920
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,160
life insurance we all know life

921
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:50,160
insurance life insurance is I pay money

922
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:53,119
while I'm alive and when I die my

923
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:57,000
descendants get a check a new is the

924
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:59,839
opposite a new is I pay money now they

925
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,240
send me a check as long as I'm alive and

926
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:04,160
then it ends when I

927
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:05,400
die so if I want to Nei tize my wealth

928
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,920
what i is I'd walk into a broker's

929
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:09,280
office I'd say here's my money I'm give

930
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,440
it all to you now and you're gonna send

931
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:14,440
me a check until I

932
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:17,240
die why is this

933
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:18,920
appealing it's appealing because we

934
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:22,160
don't know when we'll

935
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:25,160
die and as a result savings for

936
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:27,359
retirement is very imperfect

937
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,680
definitionally you will always save if

938
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:30,280
you you just use saving for retirement

939
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:33,400
always save either too much or too

940
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:36,400
little if you live longer than you

941
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:37,760
thought you'll save too little if you

942
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,960
die sooner than you thought you'll save

943
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,079
too much now if you care about your kids

944
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,359
that's a different thing but let's let's

945
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:45,160
talk about a childless

946
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:46,480
person okay so basically the point is

947
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,800
savings isn't perfect because you don't

948
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:51,960
know when you're going to

949
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:54,760
die annuities are insurance against that

950
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:56,160
uncertainty think about it just like

951
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:58,520
health insurance insures you against the

952
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,400
medical bill a UI isure you gu how long

953
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:01,839
you're going to live you turn out to

954
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:04,079
live a long time then your nity will

955
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:06,079
turn out to be a good deal youve paid an

956
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,599
AM and you get a check forever if you

957
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:09,000
turn out to live only short time rity

958
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:10,200
would be a bad deal just like with

959
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,440
health insurance Health if you turn out

960
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,240
to be healthy health insurance is a bad

961
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,400
deal turn out to be sick it's a good

962
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:17,680
deal but you still want it because you

963
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:19,520
want to smooth your consumption and

964
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:23,599
that's what annuities

965
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:27,200
do okay now that is the

966
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:29,760
benefit of Social Security that we make

967
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:32,000
sure sure that people have enough money

968
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:34,359
till they die they don't

969
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,680
unave that they don't unave and end up

970
00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:36,400
without enough money because they didn't

971
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,480
think they're going to live that long

972
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,680
they live a long time and suddenly

973
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:41,400
they're they're they're

974
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:43,640
impoverished okay indeed one of the

975
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,560
reason we set up Social Security was

976
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:46,599
because there'd be all these

977
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:48,079
impoverished people especially after the

978
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:49,359
Great Depression the main motivation

979
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:51,319
social SEC is the Great Depression wiped

980
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:52,480
out a bunch of people's savings and

981
00:38:51,319 --> 00:38:54,760
we're worried they wouldn't have enough

982
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,440
money to live till till their death so

983
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:58,599
we set up this

984
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:01,720
program on the other

985
00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:02,680
hand there's a moral hazard element of

986
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:05,960
social

987
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:07,480
security which is remember how do you

988
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:09,960
qualify for Social

989
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:12,680
Security by

990
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:15,160
retiring retirement is a

991
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:16,319
choice Leisure is normal people would

992
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:18,599
like to be

993
00:39:16,319 --> 00:39:21,839
retired so the more generous we make

994
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:24,040
Social Security the earlier you'll

995
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:25,880
retire because basically we're saying go

996
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:28,200
back to go back to the math over

997
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:29,319
here think about this not as a period by

998
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,240
period decision but a year-by-year

999
00:39:29,319 --> 00:39:33,119
decision this year do I want to work

1000
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:34,319
well this year I think gee how much do I

1001
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:36,720
value Leisure if I sit at home versus

1002
00:39:34,319 --> 00:39:38,640
how much will I make this year as aside

1003
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:40,880
should I work or not well now I'm gonna

1004
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:43,520
be more likely to quit because if I quit

1005
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:45,960
I Get Money I get if I don't

1006
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:48,440
work so I've essentially put a thumb on

1007
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:51,000
the scale for quitting I've put a thumb

1008
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:52,800
on the scale for retirement so the moral

1009
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,119
hazard aspect of Social

1010
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,119
Security is it causes increased

1011
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:59,599
retirement why is that bad well because

1012
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:02,520
old workers are productive not that they

1013
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:05,599
shouldn't retire but they should only

1014
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:06,880
retire when this condition is true not

1015
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:10,599
when this condition is

1016
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:12,839
true okay they're retiring too early and

1017
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:16,640
in fact there's tons of evidence from

1018
00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:21,240
very well crafted studies that social

1019
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:24,119
security has a huge impact on

1020
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:25,560
retirement okay there's a really cool

1021
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:26,720
and basically the way they study this

1022
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:28,000
offit is by looking at the fact that

1023
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,520
social security has have certain ages at

1024
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,839
which you a minimum age and when you

1025
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:33,240
lower that minimum age all of a sudden

1026
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:35,200
everyone retires earlier and you raise

1027
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:36,160
people retire later in Germany the minim

1028
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,760
age was

1029
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:40,720
60 and the average reement age was

1030
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:43,760
58 cou people retire early because they

1031
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:45,440
have their own money they raised to 65

1032
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:47,000
within five years the average retirement

1033
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,880
age in the whole country of Germany was

1034
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:52,440
63 think about that within five years an

1035
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:55,560
entire country change went retired by

1036
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:59,000
five years pretty phenomenal okay that

1037
00:40:55,560 --> 00:41:00,839
illustrates the power of moral hazard

1038
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,079
illustrates the power and that says

1039
00:41:00,839 --> 00:41:06,599
there's a

1040
00:41:03,079 --> 00:41:08,480
tradeoff so basically the question is

1041
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:11,359
how do you think about this

1042
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:13,720
tradeoff well you write down an economic

1043
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:16,560
model and you talk about the benefits of

1044
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:18,920
insuring against longevity and the cost

1045
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,319
of early retirement you come out with

1046
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:21,400
some optimal social security number this

1047
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:23,720
isn't what we do here we'll do that in

1048
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:25,800
1441 if you want to follow up that's in

1049
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:28,200
1441 write down a model we put both

1050
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:30,000
these things in one model and optimize

1051
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,760
and you get some optimal level of Social

1052
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,359
Security turns out it's probably not

1053
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,119
that far from where we are social SEC

1054
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:36,880
average replaces about 45% of people's

1055
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:39,640
wages across everyone that's probably

1056
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:45,160
not a terrible number given this

1057
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:47,760
tradeoff okay but the problem is this is

1058
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:50,920
a much bigger issue in Europe than is in

1059
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:53,520
the US because of a seemingly harmless

1060
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:56,040
little tweak in the way we do social

1061
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:57,960
security versus the way you do social

1062
00:41:56,040 --> 00:42:00,079
security so social care is an age of

1063
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:02,079
early retirement the earliest of which

1064
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:03,599
you can get your benefits so the way it

1065
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:05,960
works in Social care in the US is as

1066
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:06,680
soon as you're 62 you can start getting

1067
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:10,680
a

1068
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:14,040
check but if you wait till 63 we'll give

1069
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:15,440
you a bigger check why because you're

1070
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:17,800
going to get it for a fewer years your

1071
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,720
death dat's the same see like at 62

1072
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:21,280
you're going to die to 162 to 100 and we

1073
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:23,480
give you X if you get 63 to 100 we're

1074
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:25,880
going to give you X plus a little bit to

1075
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:27,839
give you the same total by age 100 so we

1076
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:31,720
basically have what we call in Social

1077
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:31,720
Security an Actuarial

1078
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:38,319
adjustment we basically look the longer

1079
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:40,520
you work the more money will let you

1080
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:42,319
keep because you're going to get fewer

1081
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:45,319
years of benefits it's a

1082
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:45,319
trade-off

1083
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:52,920
okay the the issue is getting this

1084
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:55,599
actual adjustment right can strongly

1085
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:57,920
impact people's works decisions so let's

1086
00:42:55,599 --> 00:43:00,720
say Let's do an example let's say you

1087
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:04,160
earn y percent per

1088
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:05,839
year and Social Security replaces K

1089
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:08,160
percent of that remember I said an

1090
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:11,599
average social security rep about 45% so

1091
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:13,319
K would be 0.45 or 45% in the US so

1092
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:14,520
Social Security replace about 45% and

1093
00:43:13,319 --> 00:43:15,720
ignore the fact that rich people and

1094
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:17,599
poor people are different Imagine One

1095
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:19,760
representative person that

1096
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:21,079
representative person earns Y and when

1097
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:23,920
they retired they're going to get K

1098
00:43:21,079 --> 00:43:26,440
times Y where K is a number less than

1099
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:29,119
one and let's imagine that you're going

1100
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:29,119
to live until

1101
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:35,599
80 live till

1102
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:37,319
80 and you're deciding should I retire

1103
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:41,800
at age 62 or

1104
00:43:37,319 --> 00:43:45,119
not should I 62 or work till 63 well if

1105
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:47,760
I retire 62 what do I get from Social

1106
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:49,760
Security well I get the present

1107
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,559
discounted value remember I got to pdv

1108
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:58,280
it because the money's coming in the

1109
00:43:51,559 --> 00:44:02,240
future okay of getting 18 years

1110
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:04,760
of K * y i retired

1111
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:06,599
62 I get it for 18

1112
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:08,359
years and it's going to be in the future

1113
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:13,119
so I got to pdv

1114
00:44:08,359 --> 00:44:15,839
it if I work till 63 what do I get if I

1115
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:19,920
work till

1116
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:28,680
63 well then I get y I get the

1117
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:31,280
pdv of Y this year plus 17 * k time y

1118
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:33,680
because I get it for one fewer

1119
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:36,920
year so what's the difference between

1120
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:39,280
these two the difference these two is 1

1121
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:42,680
minus K *

1122
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:46,760
y That's the difference between these

1123
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:50,200
two if you work one more year you get

1124
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:53,920
one minus K * y

1125
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:56,720
more this is the questions about

1126
00:44:53,920 --> 00:45:00,680
that why is this important because this

1127
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:01,960
k term effectively is a tax think about

1128
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:05,520
it if I work one more year without

1129
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:06,880
Social Security what do I get why if I

1130
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:09,480
work one M with Social Security I get

1131
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:11,000
one minus K times y why is that because

1132
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:12,640
I'm giving up the money I could have had

1133
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
by sitting at

1134
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:17,400
home and my decision is always sitting

1135
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:21,680
home versus working so it's a

1136
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:24,000
tradeoff the bigger K is Imagine K was

1137
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:27,319
100% imagine K was

1138
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:30,920
one and Leisure is normal when anyone

1139
00:45:27,319 --> 00:45:32,880
work past 62 no why' you work past 62

1140
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:34,359
you get the same thing if K is one that

1141
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,440
means if I work I get Y and if I'm home

1142
00:45:34,359 --> 00:45:37,480
I get Y and leure is normal why would I

1143
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:41,319
ever

1144
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:43,760
work so the bigger K is the bigger the

1145
00:45:41,319 --> 00:45:44,920
moral hazard is the less is that of

1146
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,880
there is to

1147
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:50,440
work okay so what do we do in the US to

1148
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:53,319
offset that we have a simple what I call

1149
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:56,079
Actuarial adjustment which is we say if

1150
00:45:53,319 --> 00:45:57,520
you work till 63 we're gonna give you an

1151
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:02,079
extra bonus

1152
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:04,839
we're going to give you y + 7 * K * y

1153
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:08,040
time 1.06

1154
00:46:04,839 --> 00:46:11,520
7 we're going to give you more and that

1155
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:13,839
1.06 7 is calculated so that you're

1156
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:17,119
indifferent so the average person is

1157
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:18,640
indifferent yes they give up K but they

1158
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:20,680
get more per

1159
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:22,319
month and it's calculates the average

1160
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:24,960
person is

1161
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:27,200
indifferent okay so roughly speaking in

1162
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:29,559
the US when you're deciding to retire 62

1163
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,760
or 63 Social Security shouldn't affect

1164
00:46:29,559 --> 00:46:33,920
that

1165
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:35,400
decision it's basically pretty neutral

1166
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:37,280
now let's go to the

1167
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:40,640
Netherlands in the Netherlands two

1168
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:43,520
things are different K instead of being

1169
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:43,520
0.5 is

1170
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:48,160
0.9 B the second thing different they

1171
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:50,920
don't have

1172
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:54,160
this so in the Netherlands your decision

1173
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:56,440
is do I work age 55 is early retirement

1174
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:57,400
age your decision is do I work till age

1175
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,640
55

1176
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:02,319
and get

1177
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:04,880
y do do I work my 56th year and get y or

1178
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:07,079
do I stay at home and get K * Y which is

1179
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:10,240
90% of

1180
00:47:07,079 --> 00:47:11,880
why okay people understand that that's

1181
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:14,000
your decision but it's even worse than

1182
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:15,079
that because how does the Netherlands

1183
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,520
pay for this

1184
00:47:15,079 --> 00:47:20,880
program by taxing workers taxes you

1185
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:23,359
don't pay if you don't work so if you

1186
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:26,559
work you get why but you lose almost

1187
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:29,079
half it in taxes so you get half y if

1188
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:31,720
you don't work you get 90% of why you

1189
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:33,280
make money by not working even MIT

1190
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:36,000
students might find that

1191
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:39,160
attractive as a result literally no one

1192
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,880
works past age 55 in these countries we

1193
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:42,640
essentially made it not in their

1194
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:44,240
financial interest some people go back

1195
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,559
to work off the books and sort of jobs

1196
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,960
that aren't recorded so they can make

1197
00:47:45,559 --> 00:47:48,319
some money but that's why I see all

1198
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,480
these old people sitting around cafes in

1199
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:50,720
Europe having a great old time in the

1200
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:53,240
middle of the

1201
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:55,040
day because basically there's no

1202
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:56,000
Financial benefit to working we're

1203
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,160
essentially making you IND different

1204
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,599
even working and nonworking once you've

1205
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:01,240
reach the retirement

1206
00:47:58,599 --> 00:48:04,520
age so that is an

1207
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:06,960
example of moral hazard that's an

1208
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:10,880
example setting the benefits too

1209
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:12,839
large so that the moral hazard benefits

1210
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:14,920
the the moral hazard cost is enormous

1211
00:48:12,839 --> 00:48:16,839
rela to potential smoothing if the

1212
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:19,079
Netherlands for example lower than 90%

1213
00:48:16,839 --> 00:48:22,640
or even just introduce a factor like

1214
00:48:19,079 --> 00:48:24,359
this that would offset things a lot so

1215
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:26,359
the point is this is sort of a wonky

1216
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:28,400
discussion but the point is this shows

1217
00:48:26,359 --> 00:48:30,200
you how the little wonky numbers that

1218
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,599
policy makers fight about all the time

1219
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:33,359
could have a fundamental impact on the

1220
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:37,000
way an entire economy functions

1221
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:39,079
literally by setting K to 0.9 and by not

1222
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,520
having this Actuarial adjustment the

1223
00:48:39,079 --> 00:48:42,000
Netherland essentially taken every old

1224
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:44,920
person out of the labor

1225
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:47,480
force that's a pretty fundamental change

1226
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:48,839
and that's something that policy makers

1227
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:50,960
that's why I love policymaking that's

1228
00:48:48,839 --> 00:48:52,240
what policymakers need to think about is

1229
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:53,839
essentially what are the unintended

1230
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:56,000
consequences what I started the semester

1231
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:57,920
with I want to ensure people in

1232
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,720
Netherlands if they can't work anymore

1233
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,880
but I don't want to take every old

1234
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:04,040
person out of the labor force and that's

1235
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:06,119
what they end up doing okay that's all I

1236
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:07,400
got for today um hope you guys had a

1237
00:49:06,119 --> 00:49:10,400
good Thanksgiving and we'll come back

1238
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:10,400
Wednesday
