1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,840
There are hundreds of millions of people

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,759
in the world with type 2 diabetes and

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,000
obesity and the numbers are expected to

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,639
rise. A big part of the mission of the

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,240
Novonautics Foundation is to increase

6
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,719
prevention and treatment of cardium

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,119
metabolic disease. So in Denmark we have

8
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:19,760
a strong tradition for research in

9
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:22,240
cardiumabolic disease and connecting

10
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,439
this to the broad institute which is

11
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:28,640
really good at conducting uh research at

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,240
scale. This is uh a really powerful

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,920
partnership. The Nova Norris Foundation

14
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,160
Center at the Broad Institute is a

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,719
center that has a unique architecture

16
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,120
that connects competences in the Danish

17
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,879
life science ecosystem with competences

18
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,719
at the Broad Institute to understand the

19
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,520
genetic mechanisms underlying type 2

20
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:48,480
diabetes and obesity. Type 2 diabetes is

21
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,800
a highly heterogeneous disorder. So by

22
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,520
understanding individual subtypes early

23
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:57,039
on, we are aiming to be able to

24
00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:00,480
intervene and eventually cure diabetes

25
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:02,399
by identifying the biology that

26
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,559
underlies these individual subtypes of

27
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,360
of type 2 diabetes. Together with

28
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,600
Molina, uh my lab and her lab are

29
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,400
looking at how genetic variance

30
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,360
influence the risk of diabetes. The way

31
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:19,040
we're doing uh this is u measuring or

32
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,520
looking at an sites. So um fat cells in

33
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,080
the body. So rather than dissecting an

34
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:28,759
individual genetic risk locus one step

35
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:31,560
at a time typically taking years we have

36
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:34,799
implemented an edible site or fat cell

37
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:38,079
model derived from thousands of patients

38
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:41,439
over from the MGB um um bioank and we

39
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:45,280
developed ways of reading out biology at

40
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:49,200
scale resulting in an immense amount of

41
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:52,640
data. The expertise of my lab is that we

42
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:56,079
are very interested in uh making and

43
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,799
developing AI models that can integrate

44
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,640
various different types of biological

45
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,759
data. We are then trying to find

46
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,079
patterns that try to explain why a

47
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:09,280
genetic variant is influencing your risk

48
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:11,039
of uh type two diabetes. We also

49
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,959
collaborate with people. I and I think

50
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,760
that's really important. I've had

51
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:18,879
several PhD students from my lab that

52
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:22,560
have uh visited abroad and also Molina's

53
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:24,640
lab and a major benefit of uh being part

54
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,800
of the Novon Foundation Center at the

55
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,640
Broad. It's kind of like you know having

56
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,640
another home or another workplace where

57
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,000
people really care about you. We always

58
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,360
say that if you're part of this center

59
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,040
you're in the bridge building business.

60
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,959
We really just fully onboarded the

61
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,560
Danishbased scientists into the Broad

62
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,640
Institute as part of this collaboration.

63
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,000
Molina and Simon's collaboration is a

64
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,920
perfect exemplar for what's happening

65
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,519
across the entire center. We see an

66
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,800
incredible amount of opportunities to

67
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,640
take the discoveries that we're

68
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,560
currently making and then bringing them

69
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,239
to patient populations in Denmark and

70
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,120
elsewhere. What excites me the most

71
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:58,400
about the new Foundation Center at the

72
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,080
Broad is the great connections that have

73
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,840
been built, the excitement that's in the

74
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,760
center, the excellent science that is

75
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,519
being produced and hopefully the ability

76
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,910
to move towards better treatment of

77
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:14,789
cardabolic disease in the future.
