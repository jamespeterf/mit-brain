00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,319
one of the biggest breakthroughs in

3
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:06,080
generative AI has been the ability of

4
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,719
large language models to actually

5
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:11,559
generate code some of these models can

6
00:00:08,719 --> 00:00:14,920
actually produce code that is difficult

7
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:17,160
even for humans to write however as we

8
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,720
prob deeper we find that they're

9
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,600
actually quite different from the way

10
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:24,720
programmers think about code they have

11
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:27,720
different skills they have different

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,480
capabilities and so what we find is that

13
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:33,600
they can provide substantial help if

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,360
working collaboratively with a person

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,719
and in particular when the feedback

16
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:41,000
comes from a human then there is a

17
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:43,920
really substantial difference in terms

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,320
of the set of problems that the model

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,520
can actually solve humans do get

20
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:52,559
significant productivity benefits when

21
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,359
using them to help them write code for

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:59,399
