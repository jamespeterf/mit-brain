we're actually recording this this is

16
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:51,360
something we've been talking about for a

17
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,920
while now I think over 13 14 months do

18
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,440
you remember the first conversation we

19
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,559
had about starting this podcast I do I

20
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,640
actually remember that conversation a

21
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:03,039
lot this was 16 months ago

22
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,839
I had reached out to you over LinkedIn

23
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:08,600
you know a story had been written about

24
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:12,960
you in MIT news yeah we scheduled a call

25
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:15,439
to uh connect and the first thing I see

26
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,640
on once the camera finally comes on is

27
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,840
just like this dark

28
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:24,759
room with with with with you sitting in

29
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:27,240
the room and uh you know later I figured

30
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:30,479
out like the power had been off and

31
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,880
kalala I ran from walk that day

32
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,079
I came earlier home I Was preparing

33
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,799
myself a little meal so I was like

34
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:40,360
blasting music on my laptop and I was

35
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:43,680
consuming the laptop's battery so I get

36
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:47,040
on I'm tethering from my phone my batter

37
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,560
is low that first conversation became

38
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,640
you know this idea about open Learners

39
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,439
making a global community of open

40
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:58,079
Learners and creating this podcast of

41
00:01:54,439 --> 00:02:01,719
the might surprisingly they said

42
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:04,000
yes and you know later here we are uh

43
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:06,560
but for our listeners who are unfamiliar

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,440
um open coare is an online publication

45
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,360
of nearly all of mit's courses and

46
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,239
content it's available to all Learners

47
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:17,040
all over the world it's free MIT open

48
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:19,840
courseware is one of a collection of

49
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,360
open educational resources at MIT open

50
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,840
learning you know and one thing that

51
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:27,760
might be helpful to know is why we in

52
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,519
particular wanted to start this podcast

53
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,720
you know just like the Learners we will

54
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:35,400
be featuring in each episode we both

55
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,440
have our own open course where story and

56
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,239
Emanuel you know we should start with

57
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,159
you um maybe tell us a little bit about

58
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:46,360
your story yeah like I mentioned before

59
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:49,360
I'm from Uganda a small country in East

60
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:52,560
Africa and I've been i' been learning a

61
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,239
lot of things online and then one day I

62
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,920
really wanted to look into this a I

63
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,879
think so on my journey I'm looking to it

64
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:02,239
when I'm on YouTube searching something

65
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:05,360
and I see course on AI my first shock

66
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,120
was this which MIT is this this can't be

67
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,360
the MIT you know why would they give out

68
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,799
knowledge for free I check out the

69
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,879
courses in my skepticism I first

70
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:15,200
download a psychology course I watched

71
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:18,120
the full course I thought to would take

72
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,720
me months I watched it in a really short

73
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,840
time cuz it was really really

74
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,360
interesting so I told myself I should

75
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,000
thank this professor it's the least I

76
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,040
could do uh but some days later the

77
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,599
director of ocw writes me back and

78
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,439
they're like we like to do a story about

79
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,720
you

80
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:35,280
I always tell the team that at first I

81
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,640
thought they trying to scam me or

82
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,760
something like why what what do you want

83
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:42,879
for me but turns out it was a really

84
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:45,840
great experience there were real legit

85
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,200
the Articles came out and then I say now

86
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,080
meeting the people in the background

87
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,560
Michael reached out then we got on calls

88
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,480
with more

89
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,840
people and the journey has been amazing

90
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:01,439
since so Michael what was your story

91
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:05,680
like yeah so during 2019 I graduated

92
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:08,120
from undergrad 2020 roll around and I'm

93
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,760
getting ready for my first art show of

94
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:15,480
about six to eight oil paintings and the

95
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,840
pandemic happens So within two months

96
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,359
I'm

97
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:21,359
unemployed and it doesn't look like art

98
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:24,560
is going to be coming around soon I was

99
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,759
a public artist before that doing murals

100
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,199
and

101
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,280
sculptures and I knew I need to make a

102
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:32,759
change I had heard people were still

103
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:36,000
hiring in finance and I knew technology

104
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:38,360
was still hiring so I started looking

105
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,240
for free resources online where I could

106
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:44,160
learn finance and Technology I stumbled

107
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:46,800
upon MIT open course fors YouTube

108
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,039
watched Andrew Lo's Finance Theory one

109
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,639
course and the rest is sort of History

110
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:55,880
you know that's that's just my story in

111
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:58,440
a short form so ocw changed our lives

112
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:00,880
and connected us with Learners from all

113
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:03,120
over the world which is amazing for me

114
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,160
personally and the point of this podcast

115
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,800
is to share their stories what led them

116
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:11,360
to ocw what their experiences with ocw

117
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,680
was like and how their lives have

118
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,880
changed because of it over time given

119
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,639
the different backgrounds will be

120
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:20,120
speaking to Learners from all over the

121
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,880
world so in each of the six episodes

122
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,600
this season we share a story of a

123
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:26,199
learner from a different part of the

124
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:29,160
world each learner will tell their story

125
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:31,560
in their own words uh so today we will

126
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:35,199
hear from Maria eduarda babosa she's

127
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:38,360
from sou Pao Brazil Emanuel and I first

128
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,639
met Maria um last year towards the end

129
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:42,520
of

130
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:46,560
2023 and the thing that really struck us

131
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:49,440
about her story was the fact that there

132
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:52,479
was this learner that was ambivalent

133
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,720
about learning she was probably smarter

134
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:57,720
than the rest of the people in her

135
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,000
school and her class but she was just

136
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:04,000
disengaged you know through the power of

137
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,759
MIT open courseware and her ability to

138
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:11,039
learn new knowledge in English she was

139
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:14,120
able to transform her life in a way that

140
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:16,080
uh many people aspire to but few people

141
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,520
follow through on but I think that's

142
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:22,000
enough of us talking about Maria let's

143
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:27,639
hear from Maria herself here is Maria

144
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,639
eduarda Barbosa from Salo Brazil

145
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:39,080
my name is Maria I'm from Rio Brazil but

146
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:41,520
I live in s Pao where I go to medical

147
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:44,240
school in the University of s Paulo so

148
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,680
I'm going into my second year right now

149
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:50,960
and I'm

150
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:54,160
22 I want to have a career in

151
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:57,759
research I've always wanted to teach

152
00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:00,800
like for long as I can remember I like

153
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:04,080
to run and last year I ran a half

154
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,479
marathan for the first time so you can

155
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,039
probably tell just from that

156
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:09,440
introduction that Maria is an

157
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:12,120
enthusiastic person who is passionate

158
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:15,639
about her own education but according to

159
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:18,960
her it wasn't always that way my father

160
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:22,360
is in the military so uh when I was 14

161
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:25,840
we were transferred for the first time

162
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:29,080
and that was very hard on me and I went

163
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,840
to like this small school so I went to

164
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:35,360
the small school and it

165
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:38,000
was not challenging so to speak at some

166
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,280
point I realized I wouldn't I could not

167
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,879
possibly fail even if I didn't like know

168
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:44,639
homework because I would a the test and

169
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:47,520
that would give me enough grade to pass

170
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,520
and so I wouldn't fail I knew it there

171
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,720
was like this teacher who was the math

172
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,159
teacher and the physics teacher was also

173
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:57,319
very helpful in that sense and one of

174
00:07:54,159 --> 00:08:00,080
them came up to me and said someone like

175
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:04,840
you really should be studying

176
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:08,120
this was the first time when someone

177
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:11,240
demonstrated he expected me to be more

178
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:13,479
than what I already was and that was so

179
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,919
special for me and I and I was like oh

180
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:19,159
what the hell am I doing with my life

181
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:22,560
and at that point I was like okay I'm

182
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:25,840
going say something um okay everyone

183
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:28,440
says like calculus is really hard let's

184
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:31,639
see if I can learn it I Googled like

185
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:35,320
calculus intr trory course and that led

186
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:37,719
me to Professor gilber Gilbert Strang

187
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:40,880
calculus big picture which is to this

188
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:42,919
day one of my favorite classes of any

189
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:46,720
topics like

190
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:48,600
ever and I was fascinated and I was

191
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:52,720
expecting to like challenge myself and

192
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:57,920
and sure I did but I started to enjoy it

193
00:08:52,720 --> 00:09:00,399
like a lot and I was like doing this

194
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:04,240
while I was not a at school and things

195
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:07,040
started changing for me pretty rapidly I

196
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,040
could relate to

197
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,880
that so I understand her view of not

198
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,800
feeling challenged enough and then you

199
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,959
meet these other people who are teaching

200
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,680
you the same thing but in a more amazing

201
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:22,079
way and for the first time ever it makes

202
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:26,200
sense so I can I can relate to that I

203
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:28,440
was also uh a unconventional learner

204
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,839
that struggled to stay engaged in

205
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,640
Traditional School

206
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:35,079
so I definitely relate to that Journey

207
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,560
but also the idea that when you first

208
00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:39,480
see Gilbert string it kind of makes you

209
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:42,399
start thinking about education and

210
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:45,200
learning these complex topics such as

211
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,640
calculus and linear algebra more

212
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,720
userfriendly

213
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:54,240
and um you know just inspiring you to

214
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:54,240
learn more about these complex

215
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:59,839
topics and Michael we ask Maria to

216
00:09:58,079 --> 00:10:02,279
reflect on the challenges she fa at the

217
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,160
start of her ocw journey one common

218
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:07,480
obstacle for many in the global learner

219
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:11,519
Community is all ocw classes are taught

220
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:14,839
in English so I actually took very few

221
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:17,880
English classes as a kid but when I was

222
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:19,640
very young my older siblings they they

223
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:22,040
spoke English and they would speak

224
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:24,360
sometimes uh between them so that I

225
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:26,560
couldn't understand but I was a kid I

226
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:29,640
was like a machine of learning languages

227
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,640
so I I I picked something up at at that

228
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:37,519
point between 12 and

229
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:40,160
13 uh my mother was involved in

230
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:43,560
the let's say an institution inside the

231
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:47,920
Catholic Church which which deals with

232
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:52,680
refugees and so we received a family of

233
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:55,160
refugees um at our house and there and

234
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:57,920
there was a guy who was like a little

235
00:10:55,160 --> 00:11:01,480
bit older than me and if you haven't

236
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:03,600
realized I tend to talk too much and so

237
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,959
I didn't consider the possibility of not

238
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,959
talking to him for for the other

239
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:10,959
language option I I didn't even know the

240
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:14,440
alphabet so I picked English and

241
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:18,120
practiced a lot throughout these months

242
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:20,600
and that that get that made me really

243
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:25,880
comfortable with with English and then

244
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:28,600
like a few years later I met uh ocw and

245
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,800
started using it like pretty much every

246
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,519
day

247
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:35,519
so taking classes in English wasn't the

248
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:38,360
only first Maria encountered when she

249
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:41,320
started ocw it was also her first time

250
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:43,800
taking classes online I think it was one

251
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:47,200
of the first times I was doing learning

252
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:49,680
by the sake of learning and that was the

253
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:52,399
main transition for me not from like uh

254
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:56,560
seeing the professor and or watching

255
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:59,760
online classes it was like uh

256
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,320
from sometimes liking something and

257
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,279
maybe studying a little bit maybe

258
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:07,279
studying to get a medal on that Olympia

259
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:09,519
or but this was more like I I want to

260
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:13,079
see what I I want to see what this is so

261
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:15,519
I was like they out of curiosity and

262
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:17,639
self motivation and so that was the

263
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:20,160
biggest transition for me was not it

264
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:23,079
wasn't hard at all to go to online

265
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:26,040
actually but one thing that really

266
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:29,600
helped me helped me was like uh at the

267
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:32,720
same time to be like more open and

268
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:35,959
honest about it and to be more humble in

269
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,519
the sense that okay like you do you do

270
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:40,600
you do like the last part of calculus

271
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:43,519
course which was in edex I think it was

272
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:46,199
calculus 1C you do infinite serious you

273
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,959
do not think you're so smart anymore

274
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:50,680
Maria may have been questioning herself

275
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:52,600
at the start of her ocw journey but when

276
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:55,199
she was done her professors were

277
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,920
questioning how she knew so much

278
00:12:55,199 --> 00:13:00,760
interesting if you ask me actually one

279
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,639
day one Professor asked me so what was

280
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:05,720
your first undergraduate course and I

281
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:08,480
was like no I didn't have another

282
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:11,199
undergraduate course I just uh watched a

283
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,519
bunch watched a bunch of of ocw classes

284
00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:16,959
and he was like oh that's great I

285
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,959
thought it had learned chemistry or

286
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:24,240
something Maria shares how ocw changed

287
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:27,600
both her professional and personal

288
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,639
trajectories I wasn't very close to to

289
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:33,040
my friends even at that time because I

290
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:35,120
was so Shell Shocked from the from

291
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:38,199
moving from R to

292
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:41,040
Brazilia and so i' be home and I would

293
00:13:38,199 --> 00:13:43,880
count a days oh how long do I have until

294
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:46,279
I go back home you know uh because I

295
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:49,440
really didn't like the city and I I

296
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:52,440
missed everything like so bad what

297
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,279
happened was like I started having

298
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,880
something to something more to think

299
00:13:54,279 --> 00:14:00,120
about uh I think it made me a lot more

300
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:04,560
useful for the people around me and

301
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:07,959
that um opened me up for them and then

302
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:12,680
uh as a consequence I was happier I was

303
00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:15,120
learning more stuff and I was uh more

304
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:18,880
integrated uh to to my

305
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:21,440
community after finishing ocw Maria was

306
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:24,279
happier more social and more grounded

307
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:27,000
than she was before she also noticed she

308
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:29,800
was approaching learning

309
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,880
differently and so I sat that

310
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:36,360
the point where I where I think ocw has

311
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:39,000
made like the most difference in my life

312
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:41,519
is after I got into the university

313
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,639
because I was really comfortable with

314
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:46,800
not knowing things and that's like a

315
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,959
lesson that I try to bring to my

316
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:52,000
colleagues like all the time because

317
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:55,560
they always want to give like this so

318
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:59,480
specific and fancy answers and sometimes

319
00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:02,320
the the answers do not exist and they

320
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:06,040
think they should know because all their

321
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:09,560
education was geared towards a test they

322
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:11,680
had to do well on so it creates a

323
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:14,560
culture of

324
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:17,920
validation and one colleague of mine

325
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:19,839
she's amazing and she was like okay I

326
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:23,880
know I made this mistake I know I did

327
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:26,320
not answer that correctly but and but I

328
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:28,639
want I want to know how do you study

329
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,680
because I don't feel like I'm learning I

330
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:33,079
feel like I'm lost sometimes when we're

331
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:35,560
studying together and I was like okay

332
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:37,480
sometimes I also feel lost and then I I

333
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:41,639
tell you guys I'm I'm lost because I get

334
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:44,079
lost the difference is I do not think oh

335
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:46,880
I'm lost because I'm stupid I think I'm

336
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:50,319
kind of lost because I haven't learned

337
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,880
this yet and sometimes you the best

338
00:15:50,319 --> 00:15:54,120
thing you can do is to ask what you

339
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:57,480
think is the stupid questions because

340
00:15:54,120 --> 00:16:00,839
odds are you're not the only one with

341
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:03,839
that questions and what was learning at

342
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:06,120
ocw at that point was so key for me to

343
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:09,040
grow as a student and as a person

344
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:11,399
Maria's ocw Journey also inspired the

345
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:14,120
people around her including some of the

346
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:16,480
youngest members of her family and in my

347
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:21,199
family this is kind of cute because I

348
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:23,079
have a small niece she seven now it's

349
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:25,720
it's nice because I don't live in the

350
00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:28,199
same city and when I come came to visit

351
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:31,319
she was we spent a little bit of time

352
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:33,839
together and we were kind of doing

353
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:37,199
chemistry experiments and she was so

354
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:41,759
excited and her eyes were glowing and it

355
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:44,519
was so funny and I think that aspect of

356
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:46,600
not trying to do something useful just

357
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:48,120
trying to do something that's

358
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:51,399
beautiful

359
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:54,639
and that that's something I I want to

360
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:57,199
bring to her and and I I think that's

361
00:16:54,639 --> 00:17:01,880
that's working because people are so

362
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:04,000
like uh St that useful usefulness thing

363
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:06,480
and it's like I play the guitar I will

364
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,959
never make any money playing the guitar

365
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,760
and I couldn't care less and I think

366
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:15,400
sometimes with our studies and what I

367
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:17,640
want to bring to to to my niece I think

368
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:20,839
there are two good reasons to study one

369
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:23,360
of them is to be of service and the

370
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:28,199
other one is to contemplate things is

371
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:29,799
like art is the product of your studies

372
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:33,000
are not

373
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:37,360
what what you do with it directly it is

374
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,360
the person you become while you're

375
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:44,480
studying I think some of the people that

376
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:46,760
I've inspired the most in my ocw journey

377
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,600
has been other Learners around the world

378
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:52,960
I think I've given a lot of

379
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:55,120
people um the fuel to light the fire

380
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:58,039
that's within all of us to become a

381
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:01,039
better person to keep learning to always

382
00:17:58,039 --> 00:18:03,440
be curious you know to keep you know and

383
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:06,480
it's not just studying for studying sake

384
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:09,000
it's really like how can I expand my own

385
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,360
Consciousness how can I expand my view

386
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,880
of the world and how can I bring these

387
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:17,080
Frameworks back to my family my friends

388
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,080
my

389
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:21,159
community beautiful beautiful you

390
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,240
mentioned something about inspiring

391
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:25,960
Learners all over the world that's

392
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:29,200
something that took me by surprise I

393
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:31,720
would say but also from studying for the

394
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:34,640
sake of becoming a moreful person most

395
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:36,480
of the courses I take I did have done so

396
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,080
far and I'm currently doing on

397
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,559
ocw were for personal reasons I studed

398
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,880
psychology not because I work in

399
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,760
Psychology but because I like psychology

400
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,039
I studed everything else from there for

401
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:49,760
the love of it so obviously her cew

402
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:52,240
workk had a profound impact on Maria we

403
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,840
asked her if she had any advice for

404
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,520
others around the world who are

405
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:59,240
considering ocw any other Learners any

406
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:02,360
curious people what advice you have for

407
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:05,400
them one thing I would say it's like

408
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:08,200
this is just the beginning they're not

409
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:11,559
this is very cool but do not close your

410
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:14,880
eyes and be so stubborn with things

411
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:18,159
remain open to learn to learn new things

412
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,039
do not be so confined to your Niche uh

413
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:22,760
and actually for me and for everyone

414
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:24,880
who's like in their teens or early 20s I

415
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:27,760
hate to break that to you but you do not

416
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,600
have a niche and you don't have to like

417
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,080
close your mind now

418
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,320
remain open to learn new things and of

419
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,159
course when you love something you

420
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:39,000
probably have some constructive

421
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:40,000
criticism for that thing as well Maria's

422
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,360
advice to

423
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,919
ocw get more of it this is sort of a

424
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:48,080
funny one because I was kind of thinking

425
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:50,600
the other day I don't even

426
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,720
remember what I was looking for but I

427
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,960
remember there was like a bunch of

428
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,480
things it was biophysics it was

429
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,159
biophysics and I didn't find a lot of a

430
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:02,679
lot of stuff and I was like

431
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:07,679
I might be be like being totally unfair

432
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:09,840
to the usw team do not be afraid of like

433
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:13,000
oh you know maybe people won't want to

434
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:16,720
come here I doubt it I double doubt it I

435
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,520
triple doubt it actually um I wanted to

436
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,159
go to MIT because of ocw people will

437
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,679
know the institution better people will

438
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:26,600
want to collaborate with it please uh

439
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:29,120
record more courses because sometimes we

440
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:31,320
want to we want to learn by a physics

441
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,200
with someone like youber stringers or

442
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,440
Barber

443
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:38,320
Imperial even though Maria is done with

444
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:40,440
her ocw cewor for now she continues to

445
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:43,480
reflect on where she would have been

446
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:45,880
without it in the last last time I I

447
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:50,120
talked with someone from the team I was

448
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:52,880
at at the roof of my grandmother's house

449
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:54,960
it was a place where we hang our clothes

450
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,360
to dry them up but you don't know what

451
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,480
it is because in the US when you take

452
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:02,080
out your clothes from the machine

453
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,600
they're already dry it's a very

454
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,840
different

455
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,919
reality very different culture very

456
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:12,039
different place as a also because here

457
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:15,320
it is warm enough so that things can dry

458
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:20,120
up pretty quickly it's far it's it's

459
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:22,600
like this how much further this

460
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:26,200
initiative has brought mit2 level

461
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:29,200
education is what I want to convey and

462
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:32,279
maybe I wouldn't have become the person

463
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:35,840
who's like a student who's passionate a

464
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:38,240
enough about studying to get into the

465
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:41,799
medical school I got into it probably

466
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:45,919
wouldn't be where I'm at today if that

467
00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:48,880
this initiative didn't exist and so um I

468
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:52,080
cannot express my gratitude

469
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:54,960
enough and Maria's clothes drawing is

470
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:57,039
the perfect visual because it gets at

471
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,159
this bigger theme Emanuel and I are

472
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:01,880
trying to convey in the season of open

473
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:05,400
Learners While most of the classes at

474
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:08,520
MIT are taught in Cambridge

475
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:11,960
Massachusetts m Open courseware is a

476
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:15,480
global program and phenomena I wouldn't

477
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:18,159
be where I'm at today if it wasn't for

478
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:20,799
these kinds of platforms not only

479
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:24,000
because they give me the opportunity to

480
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:28,120
have like MIT level education in my

481
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:30,240
small small High School library in

482
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:34,919
Brazil

483
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:38,240
still but because it shows me it opens

484
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:42,960
the window to a w that was not part of

485
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:47,919
my ward and as a result I grew up and I

486
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:50,960
learned to really love learning and

487
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:54,880
doing it for the sake of it so when

488
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:58,520
you're if if this platforms do not exist

489
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:01,200
people are confined to their geography

490
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:03,320
and this is not fair people are confined

491
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:06,840
to their geography and they do not reach

492
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:09,760
their full potential because they do not

493
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:13,240
know everything that's out there because

494
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:16,080
they have very good grades in this small

495
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:18,840
place in this small school which is fine

496
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:21,400
but they could be doing more and they

497
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:25,039
could be better for their communities

498
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:27,720
and better people as a result of it and

499
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:29,720
it's like number one the knowledge they

500
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:33,679
provide and number

501
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:37,679
two uh an open door to the world and

502
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:39,880
it's like oh hey you in Brazil like you

503
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,600
want to challenge yourself or something

504
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:44,640
you want to learn something

505
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:48,600
new yeah that's whole world of there you

506
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:51,440
have no idea and that's exciting and

507
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:52,520
that that changes your perspective on

508
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,480
life and

509
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:58,200
education and that's the key of it it

510
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:01,039
gives people hope and G it gives people

511
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:04,159
IDE ideas about the warden and that's

512
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,159
like the main thing for

513
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:11,240
me well Michael that's episode one in

514
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,559
the

515
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:17,039
books how do you feel I'm feeling great

516
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:19,799
I'm so excited and honored that Maria

517
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:21,840
was willing to share her story with us

518
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:24,720
and engage with our audience how about

519
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:27,240
you I'm psyched I'm psyched I'm psyched

520
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,520
that we're first of all doing this and

521
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:32,159
I'm excited and great F that we got to

522
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:35,039
this stage and we are speaking to great

523
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:37,600
people like Maria uh for the first

524
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:39,320
episode I won't have it in any other way

525
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:42,559
so do what's your biggest takea away

526
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:44,480
from Maria's story I I think my biggest

527
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:46,000
takeaway and this is something we

528
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,200
touched on in our very first

529
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,760
conversation with Manuel

530
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:56,440
was MIT open course where the people at

531
00:24:51,760 --> 00:25:00,360
open learning are you know tenaciously

532
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:03,480
going after the this Grand Narrative of

533
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:06,600
fulfilling the destiny of the internet

534
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:08,840
you know what what better way can we

535
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:11,600
show that Destiny being fulfilled than

536
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:14,360
an naturual learner that has been

537
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:17,080
impacted in such a deep and profound way

538
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:19,880
that it literally changed her life um

539
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:22,880
for the better with free information

540
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:25,320
that was freely given over the Internet

541
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,799
yeah I hear you I hear you yeah so how

542
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:30,039
about you Emanuel this this has been

543
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:33,320
grand and you mentioned something about

544
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:35,799
the information age and I feel my

545
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:38,120
biggest take away from this is first of

546
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:41,240
all this works this not works but this

547
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:43,039
is real this is actually changing lives

548
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,440
you will hear several stories in the

549
