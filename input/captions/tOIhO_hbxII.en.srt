00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:08,040
hello everyone I'm Manisha and I'm here

2
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:11,040
with telis technology presenting before

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:14,400
you all sense Symphony a technology

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,680
platform which will bring you closer to

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,119
reality most of the multi-sensory

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,119
experiences generally have audio visual

7
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,039
and nowadays even haptics but something

8
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,920
is generally missing out there and that

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,199
is the sense of smell we are trying to

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,960
solve this

11
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:33,239
problem mainly the scent issue has been

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,040
used lot many times as an example in

13
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:38,879
different VR situations in theaters but

14
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:40,480
we Face a small problem there and that

15
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,480
is related to the storage or the

16
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,800
handling sometimes it relates to the

17
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,440
cross-contamination of the fragrances

18
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,520
within the system and even in the

19
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,360
environment once they're dispensed and

20
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:53,239
the ventilation issue as we continue to

21
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,680
solve these problems through our

22
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:58,000
technology which we developed at MIT and

23
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,199
later on after I graduated from the

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,719
program we can now uh provide scent

25
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:06,119
modules of different form factors in

26
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:08,560
different sizes even in the shape of a

27
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:11,240
button as well but what's unique about

28
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,640
our technology is the way we encapsulate

29
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:16,320
these fragrances we make sure that they

30
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:19,040
are not anym in liquid format and cannot

31
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,079
be oxidized directly in air our

32
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,159
technology ensures that the fragrances

33
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:26,520
we encapsulate live for longer period of

34
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,640
time somewhere between few months to few

35
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,560
years as

36
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:33,119
well with s Symphony we are trying to

37
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,640
empower and make the experiences more

38
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:38,920
and more immersive in 2D virtual reality

39
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,920
in communal spaces and even in personal

40
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:44,840
spaces where you just exposed to

41
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:49,640
fragrance near your space our journey

42
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:51,600
started with just doing um some uh pilot

43
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,719
projects here and there and we

44
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,920
accidentally landed up a project related

45
00:01:53,719 --> 00:02:00,719
in uh VR movies in Hollywood movie

46
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:04,159
called as LM musk it takes a minute to

47
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:07,680
example of what we did um and how this

48
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:11,160
impacted in the VR space we um demoed

49
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:14,280
our work at K and then got the LA

50
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:16,840
Infinity award as well some of the

51
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:20,040
testimonies are here could see why he

52
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:22,160
was the originator of this piece you

53
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,319
notice different scents in the

54
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,879
experience um they were all I think

55
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:28,560
they're all like kind of custom made for

56
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,040
the film that's what I heard it's

57
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,840
phenomenal I think was

58
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,040
but now we're going a step forward we

59
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,959
are trying to integrate our platform

60
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:42,239
with generative AI so we can throw in

61
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:46,360
any kind of multimedia XR VR videos and

62
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:49,319
generate sense for any platform our our

63
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:52,480
system has incorporated more than 3,000

64
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:55,599
ing uh fragrance ingredients which again

65
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:59,080
dispense any kind of fragrance just like

66
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:02,720
an AI perfumer would do on the Fly this

67
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:05,959
is how we we do it our technology uses

68
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,879
local models which are deployed with our

69
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:11,959
overlaying technology and using all

70
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:15,360
those cues we are able to pick up the

71
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:18,200
kinesthetics the emotions the uh

72
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:22,239
pictorial imagery and then dispense a

73
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:24,799
related fragrance the back end U I would

74
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,360
like to explain here for any common

75
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,840
person who's looking at these two images

76
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,360
would be like oh wow this is a fruit

77
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,879
basket what's the real difference but

78
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:36,080
with our technology we are able to give

79
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:38,519
a final odor as an output which is more

80
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,840
closer to a real human experience as you

81
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:44,239
can see here a cut mango uh picture is

82
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,680
going to actually smell like a final

83
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,840
mango scent whereas in the other case

84
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:52,079
it's more on the citrusy side has a

85
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:54,920
banana note to it um our team has

86
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:57,360
expertise uh looking at fragrances in

87
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:59,760
wide spectrum uh we've been working in

88
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,400
the space since 2016 while I started my

89
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,799
SE Arch at MIT exploring how fragrances

90
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,760
can impact sexual arousal and then we

91
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:10,280
delved into developing uh scent cameras

92
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,560
and examining fragrances and how they

93
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:15,159
impact human physiology so what's next

94
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,120
we are developing the world's first

95
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:20,440
digital sent library and we are looking

96
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:24,320
to collaborate with people in the scent

97
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:27,440
industry in retail in fashion in um

98
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:30,639
experimental design and also an arvr

99
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,639
thank you
