1
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:24,160
Thank you everyone for coming back after

2
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:28,160
the coffee break. Um our next session

3
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:31,760
our moderator is uh Kurt Newton stepping

4
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,079
in. uh the previous moderator is okay

5
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,320
but she won't be ava a available for

6
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,280
this session. Uh and with that I'll pass

7
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,440
it on to Kurt.

8
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,760
>> All right. Uh coming out of our our

9
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,040
first session we now you know where it

10
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,480
was I think was teed up in a really

11
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,719
interesting way with the kind of the

12
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,879
final discussion what's going on with

13
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,760
the sort of human side of this the the

14
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,079
social uh decision making the

15
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,160
motivations and such. we get into the

16
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:01,199
the the human landscape for these

17
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:04,239
networks and we have you know again a a

18
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:06,640
wonderful series of three uh speakers uh

19
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,439
starting with Nathan Phillips uh and

20
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,479
then uh we'll hear from Chris Rae and

21
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,760
last uh Kelsey Worth and then as we did

22
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,560
with the previous session then we'll

23
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,119
we'll go from the presentations into uh

24
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,240
into a Q&A session. So over to you

25
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,960
Nathan.

26
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:26,320
>> Right. Thank you, uh, Kurt. And let's

27
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,799
see, is this the slide advancer thingy?

28
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:32,079
Okay, great. All right. Well, I'm here

29
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,079
to share with you how a mildmannered

30
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:37,200
forest ecologist

31
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:40,320
ended up in a room with engineers and

32
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,000
law experts and policy people and

33
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,159
activists

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,079
uh to work on the energy transition. So,

35
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,280
I'm going to give you that ecological

36
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:52,640
viewpoint of this energy transition. And

37
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:56,399
it started for me as this mildmannered

38
00:01:52,640 --> 00:02:00,000
uh ecologist who learned uh stumbled out

39
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:02,240
of my lane and learned that gas leaks

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,320
damage trees. So I study the plumbing of

41
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,280
trees and I wanted to know why what's

42
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,239
going on. Uh this is in Newton about

43
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:13,120
three blocks away from where I live and

44
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:15,360
seeing uh the loss of the tree canopy

45
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,920
was really heartbreaking as a as a

46
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:22,720
person uh but also as a scientist like

47
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:24,640
what is going on and from that moment

48
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,760
things started moving. I had an

49
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,319
accidental toolkit for understanding the

50
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,239
problem of methane leaks because I was

51
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:35,920
looking at how greenhouse gases are

52
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:38,319
exchanged from soils and leaves and the

53
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:41,760
same kind of equipment could be used to

54
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:44,400
document where this greenhouse gas was

55
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,959
leaking from the streets and sidewalks.

56
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,640
So we got funded to do a research study

57
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,959
in the city of Boston where we

58
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:56,319
documented 3,356 gas leaks across the

59
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:59,519
city. Uh that was in 2012. And this is

60
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:02,080
where as an ecologist

61
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:05,280
I started thinking about kind of

62
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,519
biomimicry and thinking about the eco

63
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,519
the city as an ecosystem. We had a grant

64
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,760
called urban metabolism at the time from

65
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,640
the National Science Foundation and it

66
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:17,200
was the lens of using living things to

67
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,440
think about how cities function. And as

68
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,120
a tree physiologist, it became clear,

69
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,040
you know, this gas network, this thing

70
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,840
that's having this kind of metabolic

71
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:30,000
problem is like a tree. It's got trunks

72
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:33,599
and it's got branches and twigs and we

73
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,080
we need to fix this uh problem. And

74
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:39,280
that's where the the idea of the

75
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,840
transition started to come in. Uh can we

76
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:46,480
prune the tree? Can the tree retract and

77
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:48,000
a new system uh grow from there? Now

78
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,159
things were happening at the same time

79
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,080
like the collapse of the gas system in

80
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:56,959
the Marramac Valley where uh system

81
00:03:54,080 --> 00:04:00,319
level failures were happening and we

82
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:03,599
realized in talking with folks like Zanb

83
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:06,720
and Audrey and Heat that to solve

84
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:09,040
problems like that we need to think

85
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,840
bigger. We need to make the problem

86
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,760
bigger. And coming back to the gas leaks

87
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,920
problems on the streets and sidewalks of

88
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,479
of of Boston and the greater Boston

89
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:21,359
area, it became apparent to me that I

90
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:24,639
needed to think bigger as an ecologist.

91
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:27,919
And when I started to see things like

92
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:31,199
new trees, this is in Roslandale, being

93
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:33,040
planted into active gas leaks and the

94
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:36,639
money that was being spent and the labor

95
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,639
and energy that was being spent to plant

96
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,720
urban street trees in a place where we

97
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,880
knew they were going to die. So the gas

98
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,440
in the soil here is at about you can't

99
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:48,720
see it but it's like 15% in the soil.

100
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:52,080
That tree was not going to live. Um to

101
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:55,680
see things like uh okay the fixes made

102
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:58,080
after the problem has wre havoc on the

103
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,680
tree. So there's the empty tree pit and

104
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,520
there's the patch that fixed the gas

105
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:05,680
leak after the uh fact. So it became

106
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,919
apparent to me that what we call

107
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,840
infrastructure ecology

108
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:15,600
is about the wires and the pipes and the

109
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,680
streets and and all of those things. But

110
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,840
it's also about the knowledge networks

111
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,240
and the systems and the institutions

112
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,440
that need to communicate to actually get

113
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:28,720
the problem uh fixed. the coordination.

114
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:31,600
Uh just here's another example in what

115
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,560
we uh call the circle of death in Newton

116
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:37,840
which is right over the mass pike where

117
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,000
you can see the new pavement here. You

118
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:45,039
can see the line where the uh lighter

119
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:48,720
grade shade shade becomes darker and the

120
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:51,440
uh new pavement being cut up like two

121
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,000
weeks after it was put down to uh

122
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:57,840
address a gas leak. That's a 10-in cast

123
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,560
iron uh gas mane there. And so this

124
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,520
problem really I couldn't avoid as an

125
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,400
ecologist to think about how we need to

126
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,960
bring all of the stakeholders and we

127
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,759
need to think about the colllocated and

128
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,160
interdependent critical infrastructure

129
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:17,039
including the trees and everything else

130
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,280
as an ecosystem. That's the only way

131
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:22,160
we're going to solve this problem. And

132
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:24,800
so that's what inspired me so much about

133
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:29,199
being here and connecting with groups

134
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:31,600
like mothers out front and heat where we

135
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:35,600
weren't I was no longer being restricted

136
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:37,280
to my discipline of forest ecology. I

137
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,800
was connecting with people who were

138
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:44,479
thinking in a much more inclusive and

139
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:47,120
holistic uh manner about all of the

140
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:49,120
actors and entities that need to come

141
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:52,479
together. So I feel like a more holistic

142
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:55,199
uh ecologist. Uh this exemplifies to me

143
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:58,240
the way we need to see beyond the

144
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:01,360
surface and make the connections uh that

145
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:05,039
are there uh under the streets uh and

146
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:08,319
with other stakeholders. And so what

147
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:13,919
continues this work the for me is being

148
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:19,360
involved in the uh project in Framingham

149
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:21,280
that is happening and to come back to my

150
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,680
uh profession as a tree physiologist and

151
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:26,160
an ecoysiologist is really fulfilling

152
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,319
because it's like a a circle has come

153
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,360
back around where we are now as part of

154
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,199
this big project with so many different

155
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:38,000
uh academic research researchers and

156
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:41,759
others. Uh my part of this is to come

157
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:45,120
back to look at tree health. So do these

158
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:49,360
thermal networks uh have any effect on

159
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:52,639
the tree canopy? Sometimes in in science

160
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:56,400
a nonresult is actually a really great

161
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:59,039
thing to have. And after uh our research

162
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,960
in two years of looking at the tree

163
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:04,720
canopy where this infrastructure has

164
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:06,479
gone in, we don't see any uh negative

165
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,199
impact on the trees. We're going to

166
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:12,479
continue to monitor this the urban

167
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:14,800
canopy in this area because there may be

168
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:17,360
some subtle changes. If you change the

169
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,599
thermal environment in the soil, there

170
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,160
may be a change in when the leaves come

171
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:23,680
out or when the leaves drop and it may

172
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,599
be species dependent. So, lots of

173
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,879
interesting questions, but really

174
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:32,000
gratifying to to know that there's we're

175
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:35,519
not seeing any negative impact on uh the

176
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,399
e the actual ecosystem and and just that

177
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:41,200
you know uh there was a term that a

178
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,519
famous uh thinker and writer and

179
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,279
philosopher came up with who was not an

180
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,800
ecologist but came up with a very

181
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,160
important ecological term called

182
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,640
succession. And that was Henry David

183
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,920
Thorough in conquered succession the

184
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:56,800
change in ecosystems over time and so

185
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:59,839
it's really gratifying to be part of a

186
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,640
project was which is looking at that

187
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:05,519
transition from our fossilfueled

188
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:08,480
infrastructure into this new

189
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,240
infrastructure where we're not seeing

190
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,120
negative impacts on the trees here and

191
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,760
we're likely to see a healthier tree

192
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:18,560
canopy in places like the place where I

193
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:21,519
saw the tree uh being damaged in my own

194
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,839
city of Newton. So, uh, thank you and

195
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,760
I'll leave it at that. There's my friend

196
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,440

197
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:31,000
