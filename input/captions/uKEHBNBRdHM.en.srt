1
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:13,960
Do we have any Canadians in the room?

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,960
Anybody from Canada?

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,840
Not a one. Usually they're loud and

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,760
proud, but somebody surely knows who

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,680
this is.

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,080
Who is it?

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,320
>> Wayne Gretzky. That's exactly right.

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,840
Now, Wayne Gretzky is known for a number

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,599
of sayings, but there's one in

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,000
particular that I want to highlight

11
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,719
today that will be the through line for

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,120
the rest of our session together.

13
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,040
He talks a lot about the direction in

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:43,320
which he skates. Does anybody know this

15
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,320
famous Wayne Gretzky quote?

16
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,920
No hockey fans, huh?

17
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,559
>> Yes, that's it. He says, "I skate to

18
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,719
where the puck is going to be, not where

19
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,320
it has been." And I think this is

20
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,680
extremely important when we think about

21
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,359
the ways in which artificial

22
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,799
intelligence is changing the way that

23
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,240
companies start and scale. This is

24
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,159
something that we'll talk about, but my

25
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,760
core belief is that we as society are

26
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,600
creating more problems than we are

27
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,280
solutions on a daily basis. And the best

28
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,360
way to address this fundamental

29
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,439
challenge is through AIdriven

30
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,479
entrepreneurship. This gives us all

31
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:22,000
sorts of benefits as we go to create the

32
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,720
companies that will help to address

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,320
these problems.

34
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,479
My background is as a software engineer

35
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,840
and I believe that there is so much from

36
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,439
the software world that can be applied

37
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,360
in the creation of companies

38
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,759
systematically programmatically bringing

39
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,000
companies to life.

40
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:41,439
I've spent years teaching

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,040
entrepreneurship here at MIT.

42
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,960
We've taught two forms of

43
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,399
entrepreneurship primarily. First, small

44
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,799
medium enterprise. Those companies that

45
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,640
scale linearly, they have capped growth.

46
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,759
They serve local markets, but they

47
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,759
require very little upfront investment.

48
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,880
They can get off the ground without much

49
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:01,759
investment at all. And innovationdriven

50
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,520
enterprises, companies that scale, these

51
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,159
companies scale globally, have global

52
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,399
impact, but require significant upfront

53
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,640
investment to get off the ground. That's

54
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,840
the area that you see shaded below the X

55
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:16,879
axis. Innovation driven enterprises have

56
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,440
phenomenal impact all around the world.

57
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:21,840
These two forms of entrepreneurship have

58
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,800
long been what has enabled entrepreneurs

59
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,640
to get off the ground. And we've helped

60
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,400
many entrepreneurs here at MIT through

61
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,400
our methodologies take their ideas,

62
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,280
their research, their technology and

63
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,120
turn that into business plans.

64
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,959
We've helped entrepreneurs take those

65
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,959
business plans and turn them into

66
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,560
businesses. businesses that are out in

67
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,080
the world that have that phenomenal

68
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,640
impact.

69
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,959
And we talk a lot about tactics, how to

70
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,640
actually do things. MIT is such an

71
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,599
applied place. Coming back to the men's

72
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,879
modest mindset and tactic, this is

73
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,160
something that we talk about, but we

74
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,239
have to define our terms. What is a

75
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,480
tactic? It's an action or strategy

76
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:01,760
carefully planned to achieve a specific

77
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,319
end. But the key word here is action.

78
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,879
Action. So, how do entrepreneurs get off

79
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:09,360
the ground? Well, they have to not only

80
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,959
know what to do and why to do it, but

81
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,800
how to do it. And that's something that

82
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,319
we spend a lot of time looking at. To

83
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,920
really understand this, we have to go

84
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:20,000
back 2500 years. There's a book that was

85
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,920
written 2500 years ago. Does anybody

86
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,040
know what that book might be?

87
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,280
I see a smile.

88
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,120
I love that smile, by the way. and sir

89
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,519
over here in the in the white shirt. I

90
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,440
got to say I was so excited getting up

91
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,400
here today because he was like at the

92
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,840
beginning of the talk he was like

93
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,760
sitting there in his seat like like

94
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,680
leaning forward. He was so ready to go

95
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,840
and I love that. That gives me all the

96
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,360
energy in the world. But what book was

97
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,040
written 2500 years ago? It was written

98
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:52,799
by a Chinese military strategist.

99
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:54,640
Sunsu. The art of war. Yes. And in the

100
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,120
art of war, Sun Sue says, "Strategy

101
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:00,239
without tactics is the slowest route to

102
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,959
victory. Tactics without strategy is the

103
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,480
noise before defeat." And I think this

104
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,760
is extremely important in what we're

105
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,360
seeing happening with artificial

106
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,680
intelligence and the creation and

107
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,040
scaling of ventures today. Far too many

108
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,959
people are thinking about business

109
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,200
fundamentals here and artificial

110
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,280
intelligence over here. But it is truly

111
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,199
the integration of these two things, the

112
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,359
strategy and the tactics that is

113
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:24,000
enabling businesses to successfully get

114
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,759
off the ground. Entrepreneurship and the

115
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,759
ways in which we create companies is

116
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,600
changing rapidly. We're seeing more

117
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,759
people pursue entrepreneurship which is

118
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,120
phenomenal and it's one of the ways in

119
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,040
which we can address that fundamental

120
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,720
challenge that I started with creating

121
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,720
more problems than solutions on a daily

122
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,720
basis. Now I found this ridiculous and

123
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,199
hilarious at the same time. Many of you

124
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,919
will be familiar with the age-old sell

125
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,080
me this pen exercise. And I brought

126
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:53,120
everybody a gift that I I scooped off

127
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:56,400
the back table. [laughter]

128
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,759
I got everybody here a pen.

129
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,400
You're welcome to take one and then I'll

130
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,400
ask you to pass it.

131
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,960
Can you just take the bin? Cuz if we sit

132
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,039
and wait for me to pass them all around,

133
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:13,280
we'll be in big trouble. So sell me this

134
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:14,560
pen. Can you sell me the pen? Yeah.

135
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,199
What do you have to do to sell somebody

136
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,199
a pen these days?

137
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:23,400
It's very simple. Very, very simple.

138
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,919
THAT'S IT. RIGHT. THAT'S IT. THAT'S ALL

139
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:35,199
YOU HAVE TO DO THESE days to sell

140
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,639
somebody a pen. Now, the challenge that

141
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,800
this presents is that we see people

142
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,039
buying AI, this AI, that for no reason,

143
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,240
creating no real value. And I think

144
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,160
that's where the strategy and the

145
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,639
tactics really come into play and become

146
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,560
even more important. How do we make sure

147
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:52,240
that uh these companies that are coming

148
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:54,240
out emerging with AI uh products are

149
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,360
actually creating real value out in the

150
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,360
world. This is something that we'll talk

151
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,960
about, but anybody now can create a

152
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,080
company which is phenomenal. We just

153
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,280
have to make sure that we don't wind up

154
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,720
back in that position where they're

155
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,960
selling things that don't create real

156
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,960
impact. Anybody can create a business

157
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,880
plan and that's a phenomenal thing.

158
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,720
Previously, the most experienced

159
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,400
entrepreneurs were those who started

160
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,160
with a really concrete business plan,

161
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,479
something that was really solid. Now,

162
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,400
when we think about those entrepreneurs,

163
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:21,520
they're either experienced, educated, or

164
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,520
trained in starting companies. But not

165
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,319
everybody is necessarily experienced,

166
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,720
educated, or trained. But now with AI,

167
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,400
anybody can create a business plan

168
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,639
that's high quality, comprehensive, and

169
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,479
rigorous that gives them the same

170
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,800
starting point as any EXPERIENCED

171
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,400
ENTREPRENEUR. THAT'S SO POWERFUL. WHAT

172
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,080
THAT means that anybody in this room can

173
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,319
go and start a company. Now, I'm not

174
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,160
telling you to go leave your jobs and

175
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,639
start a company. But what I am telling

176
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,600
you is that in your companies, you have

177
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:52,639
the potential to move the needle for the

178
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:55,120
organization at large by leveraging this

179
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,520
AIdriven entrepreneurship uh

180
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,520
methodology. But to really understand

181
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,759
this, we have to just recognize where we

182
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,319
are in the broad strokes. Where are we

183
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:06,800
in the global adoption of AI? I think

184
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:09,599
back often to

185
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,919
downloading music online. Some folks in

186
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:14,960
this room will remember Limewire where

187
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:17,120
you'd go and probably illegally download

188
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,479
a song. You'd press download, you'd go

189
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,919
eat dinner, you'd come back and it would

190
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:23,759
still be only like 37% downloaded.

191
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:26,000
And when I go and I prompt some of the

192
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,160
AI tools that are out there today, like

193
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,240
um some of the code generation tools, I

194
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:34,160
press go and then I sit there and I

195
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:37,440
wait. And I call this the

196
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,599
dialup era of AI.

197
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,520
You press a button and you have to wait

198
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,440
for it to produce a response. We're

199
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,039
still in the very early days here. What

200
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,560
that means is that for entrepreneurs,

201
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,639
there's phenomenal opportunity in front

202
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,080
of us. That opportunity is to leverage

203
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,280
this in the process of starting and

204
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,919
scaling companies.

205
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,520
I found this investor update to be

206
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,800
phenomenal. I think this uh should

207
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,160
really open your eyes to what's

208
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,000
happening and what's changing out in the

209
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,759
world. This is an investor update that I

210
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
received. It says, "We spent the last 28

211
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,479
months reducing the workforce from 218

212
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,319
to 29 members, reducing burn, the amount

213
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:14,879
of money that they spend every single

214
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:16,319
month from $2.1 million to $300,000 and

215
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,960
made progress improving the core

216
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:21,280
metrics." You can read on, but the long

217
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,759
and short of this is that revenue is up,

218
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,840
renewals are up, and burn is down

219
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,759
significantly.

220
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,879
Companies are becoming more efficient

221
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,080
and they are emerging into the

222
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,479
marketplace and stealing market share

223
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,320
from incumbent organizations faster than

224
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,479
ever before.

225
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,919
So if we come back to these two forms of

226
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,560
entrepreneurship, what does this mean?

227
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:43,680
How what if we could have the best of

228
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:47,440
both worlds of small medium enterprises

229
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:49,200
and these innovationdriven enterprises?

230
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,640
That's what I'd like to introduce you to

231
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:55,440
today. AIdriven enterprises, AIDes.

232
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,880
AIDES bring the best of both worlds from

233
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,200
theme entrepreneurship and

234
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,800
innovationdriven entrepreneurship to

235
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,519
create companies that start and scale

236
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:07,440
and achieve phenomenal impact with far

237
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:10,720
fewer resources in far less time.

238
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,160
The orange line that you see here,

239
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,680
this is an example of one of those

240
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,760
AIdriven enterprises. I will give you

241
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,760
concrete examples as well, but I want

242
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,880
you to think about what happens when

243
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:23,839
with very limited upfront investment and

244
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:27,600
very short time to market, we can get a

245
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:29,440
company off the ground that scales that

246
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,959
has phenomenal impact in the world. What

247
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,800
if

248
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:35,200
in any of the regions that you all are

249
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,920
from around the world, we created

250
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,839
thousands of orange lines like you see

251
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,000
on the slide?

252
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:45,120
Think about the economic impact

253
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,279
potential that would have. Many regions

254
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,920
are constrained by access to risk

255
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:52,959
capital. But with this model, we need

256
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:55,200
far less risk capital. And many regions

257
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:58,000
suffer when one big innovationdriven

258
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,399
enterprise, one large organization goes

259
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,080
out of business or starts to lose market

260
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:05,200
share. What happens? Jobs are lost. We

261
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,720
always think of innovation-driven

262
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,680
enterprises as being beneficial to the

263
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:12,000
economy because they create jobs. They

264
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,959
create a lot of jobs. But the reality is

265
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,920
that also creates risk in the economy.

266
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:19,920
So aides serve entrepreneurs, serve risk

267
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,320
capital, serve government. They serve

268
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,320
truly everybody. And ultimately for each

269
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,440
and every one of us in this room, they

270
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,760
help us to solve many of our pressing

271
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,839
problems.

272
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,079
So a lot of people say, "Well, Paul, AI

273
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,360
is just for AI companies." And one of

274
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,600
the things I would say to that is that

275
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,480
AI is for every single company and every

276
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:43,200
single sector in every organization.

277
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,680
An AIdriven enterprise is not an AI

278
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,600
company. It is a company that leverages

279
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,240
artificial intelligence regardless of

280
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,800
what sector they're in in every

281
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:56,000
functional area. business planning and

282
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:58,720
strategy, operations, go to market,

283
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,680
sales and marketing, uh, finance,

284
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,680
operations, HR, every single functional

285
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,959
area. And that is what enables these

286
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,360
companies to get off the ground and

287
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:10,720
scale so rapidly. There's far more that

288
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:13,120
you can read on the AID methodology on

289
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,399
this form of entrepreneurship online.

290
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,240
But I want to get a quick read of the

291
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,079
room. How comfortable are folks with AI

292
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,920
today? We're going to do like one to

293
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:23,600
five, but I don't think the uh slide is

294
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:27,120
working. But let me ask you

295
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,440
on a scale of 1 to five where one is I

296
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,560
use chat GPT

297
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:35,440
and three is I use other AI tools

298
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:38,720
besides chat GPT co-pilot Gemini etc.

299
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:41,519
And five is I have 37 AI agents running

300
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,760
my life right now. Where are you? Who's

301
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,839
a one?

302
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,839
Who's a two?

303
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:54,160
Who's a three?

304
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:58,160
Who's a four? Who's a five? Yeah. Oh,

305
00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:00,800
>> more or less. That's wild.

306
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:03,600
I have questions.

307
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,120
A lot of them.

308
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,639
That gives us a sense of where people

309
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,160
are in their understanding and their

310
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,160
comfort level with these tools. But I

311
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,320
want to talk about the trends that we're

312
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,760
seeing in these AIdriven enterprises. We

313
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,320
are seeing the product development life

314
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,560
cycle shrink significantly. What used to

315
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:23,360
take years to develop a product. If we

316
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:27,040
look back 50 years ago has decreased to

317
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:29,200
days, hours, minutes, and in some cases

318
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,800
actually milliseconds.

319
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,560
Just yesterday, Google released an

320
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:37,600
update that uh their search now produces

321
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,200
personalized uh user interfaces based on

322
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,399
what you're searching, based on your

323
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:44,720
personalized account. In many cases, now

324
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,240
products products interfaces are being

325
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,600
developed on the fly. When you click a

326
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,600
button, that interface is being

327
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,519
generated just for you, right before

328
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,519
your eyes. Product development life

329
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:56,160
cycles have shrunk significantly. Many

330
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,600
of it is thanks to these just to get a

331
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:01,839
sense around the room. Who's used one of

332
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:03,680
these tools or something like it?

333
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,639
Wow. Look around the room for a second.

334
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,760
Can you put your hands back up?

335
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,959
Everybody look around the room for just

336
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,399
a second. That's wild. Now, for those

337
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:13,360
raising their hands, I have bad news for

338
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:16,639
you, which is that for everybody else, I

339
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,760
am granting you one day off next week.

340
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,360
Anybody who hasn't tried one of these

341
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,880
tools, you get one day off of work next

342
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,360
week. I don't know that it's really in

343
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:26,079
my purview to grant that day off to you,

344
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,880
but screw it. You can tell your boss to

345
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:31,920
come talk to me. I think you need to go

346
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,680
spend just one day and you need to go

347
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,560
invest in what I call tinker time.

348
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,000
Tinker time is taking one big step back.

349
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,560
The reason why many people probably

350
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,120
haven't tried these tools is because

351
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,720
your day job has going concerns. You

352
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,160
have deadlines, you have timelines, you

353
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,240
have so many things that you need to

354
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,800
accomplish, which means you can't take a

355
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,959
step back to experiment. So, one day

356
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,959
next week, that's your opportunity to

357
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,720
experiment. There's plenty of these

358
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,920
tools and I'd encourage you to go try

359
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:03,240
them. Now, who here uh knows what vibe

360
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,240
coding is?

361
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,839
Okay, if you don't know what VIC coding

362
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:09,680
is, it's not too late to ask. In a month

363
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,760
or a year, it will be too late. So, for

364
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,399
now, go invest in playing with these

365
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,240
tools and prompting one of these LLMs to

366
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:19,279
go create a new software product with

367
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:21,519
plain text and it will produce that code

368
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,199
for you.

369
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,199
But it's not just about development life

370
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:27,279
cycles. If we talk about the trends that

371
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:29,519
we're seeing, the amount of time that it

372
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:31,920
takes to get users is decreasing

373
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:34,079
significantly as well. What took Netflix

374
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:37,680
years to get to 1 million users took

375
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:42,000
Chat GBT 5 days and threads just 24

376
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:44,560
hours. I don't use um X much, but there

377
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,959
is one post on X that I absolutely love

378
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,600
from March of this year. It's a post

379
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:51,839
from Sam Alman and he says, "The chat

380
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,160
GBT launch 26 months ago was one of the

381
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:59,279
craziest viral moments I had ever seen

382
00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:01,199
and we added 1 million users in 5 days."

383
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:04,240
If you've seen this post, then you know

384
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:07,680
he goes on to say we added 1 million

385
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:09,120
users in the last hour. So the question

386
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,279
I would pose to you is when was the last

387
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,760
time your company added 1 million users

388
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:15,440
in an hour or whatever that equates to

389
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,959
that level of scale in your

390
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,560
organization.

391
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:21,600
This is what's happening and this is how

392
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,560
companies are entering the market today.

393
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,920
But it's not just about product

394
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,839
development life cycles and it's not

395
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,000
just about user acquisition. It's about

396
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:30,639
revenue. This is one of the things that

397
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,760
separates the dot boom and bust from

398
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:35,440
what's happening today.

399
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:37,680
The vanity metrics that people were

400
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,399
tracking and investing in back in the

401
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,920
dot bubble days. Here we have companies

402
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,160
actually generating revenue creating

403
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:47,120
real value out in the world. So what

404
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:50,880
took docuign 9 years to hit $100 million

405
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:53,120
in annual recurring revenue took cursor

406
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,800
under a year.

407
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,920
And it's not just about how much money

408
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,759
they can bring in. And it's not just

409
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,880
about how many users they can attract.

410
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,399
And it's not just about the product

411
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,079
development life cycle. It's about how

412
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:05,040
much human capital they need to get

413
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:08,079
things off the ground, how much time,

414
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:11,759
how many human hours. What took Airbnb

415
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:14,320
and LinkedIn over 500 people to hit that

416
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:17,839
same $100 million in a annual recurring

417
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:21,600
revenue benchmark took Cursor just 20

418
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:24,800
people. So think about this. 20 people

419
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:27,040
in under a year to go from zero to $100

420
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,360
million in annual recurring revenue.

421
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:33,759
That's pretty phenomenal.

422
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:36,160
And the old startup scale up model is

423
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,839
not necessarily the case anymore. With

424
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,360
these companies with smaller teams, we

425
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,399
don't see them moving into big office

426
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,920
buildings. We don't see these

427
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,120
entrepreneurs giving up quite as much

428
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,880
equity in their companies. They're

429
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,639
retaining more ownership, which is

430
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,880
really exciting and a good thing for

431
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:51,199
entrepreneurs. Most things that are good

432
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,440
for entrepreneurs is good for society at

433
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:55,839
large.

434
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,279
And we won't go through this in too much

435
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:00,480
detail, but again, I want to come back

436
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:02,800
to the idea that if you had thousands of

437
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,000
these AIdriven enterprises, oh, and I

438
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,679
guess the video doesn't even work. BUT

439
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,240
IF YOU HAD THOUSANDS of these AIdriven

440
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:11,760
enterprises, you would have a much more

441
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,280
distributed economy that has less risk.

442
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,919
And that's something that again is good

443
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,919
for all of us.

444
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:22,240
All of this comes back to the metrics

445
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:24,160
that we track. The metrics that we track

446
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,959
for these companies. What's happening is

447
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:29,679
we're seeing a lot of entrepreneurs, a

448
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,120
lot of startups who raised a preede

449
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,720
round of funding, a seed round of

450
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,960
funding, a series A round of funding,

451
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,880
who are blowing it out of the water by

452
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,360
all accounts. If you look at most

453
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,400
traditional metrics, but when they go to

454
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,679
raise their next round of funding,

455
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,360
they're finding out that they're

456
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,039
actually way behind. Despite having

457
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,919
phenomenal metrics in their last few

458
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:51,280
rounds, the goalpost has moved since

459
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,320
they brought the last round of funding

460
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:56,320
into the company because investors are

461
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,760
seeing far more efficient companies out

462
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,640
in the marketplace that they would

463
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,840
rather put their capital into.

464
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,160
So, what does that mean for these

465
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,760
entrepreneurs? It means that they're a

466
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,520
little bit out of luck.

467
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,559
These AIdriven enterprises are being

468
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:13,600
measured on annual recurring revenue per

469
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:15,919
FTE or full-time equivalent.

470
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:19,120
What is your company's ARR to FTE

471
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:20,400
metric? Does anybody know? I want you to

472
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,760
think about that one for just a second.

473
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,280
And I don't need you to tell me. I don't

474
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,520
need you to tell other people in the

475
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,280
room, but it's very important to me that

476
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:30,280
you know what this metric is for your

477
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,280
company.

478
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,520
If we compare that to some of the

479
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,200
bloated unicorns of yesterday

480
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,480
and some of the autonomous businesses

481
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,400
that are emerging now, we see very

482
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,960
different numbers. Very different

483
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:48,240
numbers here. If we look and we see

484
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:50,720
companies like Bench at $23,000 ARR to

485
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,640
FTE and then we look and we see these

486
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:57,440
autonomous businesses like Lovable at

487
00:18:52,640 --> 00:19:00,799
$600,000 per FTE or Bolt.new at $1.3

488
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,320
million per FTE. That's phenomenal.

489
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,799
That's an efficient business. That's a

490
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:07,440
business that is growing at a rapid clip

491
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:09,200
and bringing in significant revenue per

492
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,240
FTE.

493
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:14,799
Now, we think about what an organization

494
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,480
is. When you hear the word organization,

495
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,640
what comes to mind? What do you think

496
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:22,600
about

497
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,600
organization? What do you think?

498
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,160
>> Industry connections. Okay, great.

499
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:33,520
Somebody else. What do you think when

500
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:38,160
you hear the word organization?

501
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:41,039
>> A group of people. Who said that?

502
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:43,840
Do you do you like study the dictionary?

503
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:46,320
>> Cuz you're like right on. A group of

504
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:49,280
people who work together in an organized

505
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:53,200
way with a shared purpose.

506
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:56,160
Now, I believe that this definition

507
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,840
is outdated. If anybody has a contact at

508
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,160
Miriam Webster, I would love to chat

509
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,000
with them. I believe that this

510
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,600
definition is outdated. Why? Because the

511
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
keyword people, what is the most

512
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,280
inefficient part of every organization?

513
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Think about your organization. What's

514
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:13,200
the most inefficient part?

515
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,720
It's the people. It's all of us.

516
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:20,160
We're all irrational in some ways. We

517
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:22,000
have, beliefs, thoughts, feelings. And

518
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:24,720
the reality is that organizations are no

519
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,760
longer just about people. organizations.

520
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,159
I'm not saying we should get rid of

521
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,440
people, just to be clear.

522
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,600
But what I am saying is that we should

523
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,000
be redefining

524
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,520
this word to reflect what organizations

525
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,080
really are today, which are a group of

526
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:41,760
nodes where some nodes might be humans

527
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:43,039
and some nodes might be AI agents.

528
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,880
They're still working together in an

529
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,400
organized way with that shared purpose,

530
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,720
but they're far more efficient because

531
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:52,080
of it.

532
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:54,720
And we're seeing the emergence of many

533
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,720
many companies that are run by one

534
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:00,080
person but that have phenomenal revenue

535
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:02,799
metrics and phenomenal value valuations.

536
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,799
Now I still believe that in any one

537
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:06,240
person unicorn company the most

538
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:08,799
inefficient part of that company will be

539
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,880
the one person.

540
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,000
And this is because of founder

541
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,919
everything. A lot of people talk about

542
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,600
founder sales. Founder-led sales is the

543
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,280
founder going out and selling on an

544
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,720
ongoing basis, but founder-ledd

545
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:22,880
everything is founders going out and

546
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,640
doing every functional role within the

547
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,720
organization and leveraging AI to be

548
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,720
more efficient in doing that. That's the

549
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,240
key thesis behind my book, Startup

550
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,919
Tactics.

551
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,039
What I've done recently is I've begun

552
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,520
going down the path of building

553
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,640
companies in just 30 minutes. Can you

554
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,720
build a company and get it off the

555
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,640
ground in 30 minutes? Well, we put that

556
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,640
to the test. And the reality is you

557
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,840
absolutely can. These are the tools that

558
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:47,520
I've used to do it and make it happen.

559
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:50,559
The process of starting a company used

560
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:54,159
to take months if not years, but now it

561
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:56,400
can be shrunk down to 30 minutes, a day,

562
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,559
a week, what have you. These are the

563
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,360
tools and not to say these are the only

564
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:03,360
tools, but this is a very powerful uh

565
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,840
mixture of tools that you can use to get

566
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,120
a company off the ground.

567
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,520
Why does this matter? Why does this

568
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,679
matter for everybody here? If we look at

569
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,520
the data, 52% of the companies from the

570
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:16,080
Fortune 500 from 20 years ago are not on

571
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,200
the list today. Somebody asked me, Paul,

572
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,200
like what did this look like over the

573
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:22,240
course of time? What was the trend? And

574
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:26,080
if we go back from 63 to 83, there was a

575
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:30,159
35% drop off on the Fortune 500. From 83

576
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:31,760
to 2003, that drop off was 40%. And I

577
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:34,640
just told you that in the past 20 years,

578
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:36,880
it was 52%. So the question that I will

579
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:40,480
pose to you all is what will this drop

580
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:43,360
off rate be in the next 20 years? What

581
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,720
do you think it'll be?

582
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,799
>> What was that?

583
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,799
>> 80%.

584
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:51,799
99. Where where's the pessimist in the

585
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,799
room?

586
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,840
I I don't know. None of us know. We

587
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:02,159
can't see the future. But I feel

588
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:05,200
confident with my estimate that it's

589
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,400
going to be 70% or more. That's

590
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,760
extremely important for the folks in

591
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,520
this room because we need to find the

592
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,039
ways to move the needle for our

593
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,240
organizations to ensure that they do

594
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,559
still exist and they are still

595
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,159
prominent.

596
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,440
But it's also a question of what will

597
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,960
the startups that are emerging into the

598
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,280
marketplace today and eating away at our

599
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,880
market share, what will they look like.

600
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:26,480
I also believe that AI is going to put

601
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,679
entrepreneurs out of business.

602
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,760
The entrepreneurs in the room are

603
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:32,080
sweating now.

604
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,480
I believe that AI will start and run

605
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:37,760
companies

606
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,840
with humans behind the scenes.

607
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,679
Maybe

608
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,440
I believe there's a world in which we

609
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:47,120
could have a company that is start

610
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:48,320
started and run by AI.

611
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,520
People thought I was crazy. So I said,

612
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,159
"Well, there's only one way to find out.

613
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,679
Let's go ask Chhat GBT." This is a yes

614
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,799
or no question. Will there be businesses

615
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,039
in the future that are created and

616
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:59,600
managed by AI without any humans in the

617
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:59,600
loop?

618
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,400
If you had to place a bet on a human CEO

619
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,720
who wakes up every morning, takes in

620
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,880
data, reports from the day before, rep

621
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,720
prioritizes what's going to advance the

622
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:23,279
organization, and then delegates to

623
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:25,440
their team, or an AI CEO that's been up

624
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:27,120
all night long taking in data, rep

625
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,400
prioritizing, delegating to other AI

626
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:33,440
agents. all night,

627
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:35,760
every hour, every minute, every 30

628
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,080
milliseconds. Who would you place a bet

629
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:42,039
on? I want to get a read of the room.

630
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,039
Who would bet on the human CEO?

631
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:49,240
>> What's that?

632
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,240
>> You're betting on one or the other.

633
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,159
>> It's a phenomenal question. We're

634
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:59,360
betting on revenue.

635
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:03,919
Who's betting on the human CEO

636
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:06,159
and who's betting on the AI CEO?

637
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,760
Wow. Over the course of the past 18

638
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:10,080
months, I've asked this question of many

639
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,679
many people and I've slowly slowly seen

640
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,159
a progression of people betting on the

641
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:17,840
human CEO to betting on the AI CEO. In

642
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:19,840
this room, I think maybe uh is the most

643
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,600
forward-looking and the most willing to

644
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,200
bet on the AI CEO. And I think that's

645
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,520
phenomenal. One of the things that we've

646
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,840
done is we've taken this hypothesis that

647
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:30,240
we can have AI run companies and we

648
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:32,240
started building just that a software

649
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,080
platform upon which AI agents can create

650
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,520
their own companies. And it is one of

651
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:38,559
the most fascinating things I have ever

652
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:40,640
seen in my entire life. The first thing

653
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:43,200
the AI agents that were running this

654
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,200
company wanted to do, they wanted to go

655
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:48,400
have meetings with each other. And I

656
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:50,640
promise you, they learned that from us.

657
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,080
But the reality is is that we now have

658
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,000
AI agents that are out there running

659
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,480
companies that have sold real products

660
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,400
to real people out in the real world.

661
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,640
Real people have paid AI agents money

662
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:03,120
for products.

663
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,600
We've now had the first unit profitable

664
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,520
sale of a product from an AI agent to a

665
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,279
human. And this I think is really

666
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:12,000
important as we look at what happens

667
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:14,480
next as enterprises continue to scale

668
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
and how AI companies emerge into the

669
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,760
marketplace. But at the end of the day,

670
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,520
this is the technology is not what's

671
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,400
important. It's about leadership's

672
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:24,159
understanding of how best to leverage

673
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,480
the technology. And that's what our

674
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:28,799
research has shown is one of the biggest

675
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,200
threats to established organizations

676
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:35,200
today.

677
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:39,200
In many conversations with board members

678
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:41,279
of Fortune 500 companies, I've asked,

679
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,880
"Tell me, how often does AI come up in

680
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:45,760
your board meetings?"

681
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:48,799
And the response to that is, as you

682
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:51,679
would expect, several times every

683
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:55,200
meeting.

684
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:56,799
But what I didn't anticipate was that

685
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,320
nobody on the board actually understands

686
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:59,600
AI.

687
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,559
They're talking about it, but there's a

688
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:06,720
lack of literacy. And so we went out and

689
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:11,039
we collected data from the S&P 500 over

690
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:14,720
5,000 bless you board members uh over

691
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:16,559
6,000 uh uh seuite executives and we

692
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,159
analyze all of their earnings calls all

693
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:20,159
of their social media posts. We analyzed

694
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:23,120
all of their patent filings. We analyzed

695
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:25,039
all of their uh uh websites and job

696
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,279
postings. And what we found is that

697
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:30,159
there is a very clear link from AI

698
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:32,400
literacy leads to AI advocacy leads to

699
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,159
AI orientation for the company overall

700
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,400
and ultimately leads to AI

701
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,480
implementation. But without that AI

702
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,799
literacy upfront, those large

703
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,400
established organizations are at

704
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:44,480
significant risk from a leadership

705
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:46,880
perspective. This data that we've

706
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,799
collected uh led to a variety of key

707
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,640
insights. But the thing that I really

708
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:53,600
want to emphasize for this group here is

709
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,440
that leadership literacy

710
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,720
is what's driving AI implementation in

711
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,799
these organizations and giving them a

712
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:01,120
fighting chance at standing up against

713
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:02,480
these AIdriven entrepreneurial ventures.

714
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:05,760
Those new companies that are starting

715
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,960
and scaling rapidly. This data this data

716
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,960
is something that we're publishing that

717
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,200
will come out next year. But it's very

718
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,640
clear that there is a need for

719
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,399
leadership teams in established

720
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,120
companies to invest in AI executive

721
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:19,919
education to upskill their people to

722
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:22,559
establish the AI advocacy roles and to

723
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:23,919
align AI and innovation strategy

724
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:25,840
together because that's where we're

725
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:28,880
seeing companies make the biggest moves

726
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:30,240
steps forward. Um as we go through that

727
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:33,200
these are the questions that I'll leave

728
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,720
with you for reflection. But the number

729
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,360
one thing that I would say because our

730
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:39,760
companies don't give us tinker time, you

731
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:41,520
have to start with yourselves to give

732
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,200
our organizations a fighting chance

733
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,480
against these AIdriven entrepreneurial

734
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,679
ventures that are starting and scaling

735
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,159
rapidly. You have to start with

736
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:51,120
yourself. These are the tools that I'm

737
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:54,159
using every day to start companies and

738
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:56,559
to run companies. Um, what I would say

739
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:59,440
though is there's a definite risk of

740
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:01,600
what I call tool trial trauma. And

741
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,520
actually, I signed up for a tool, a free

742
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:06,399
trial, months and months ago, and

743
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,760
apparently that tool created an AI

744
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:09,279
version of me that's been talking to

745
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,520
people online, and I was just notified

746
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:13,919
of it by email. And it's super

747
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,840
dystopian, but it is the reality. Um,

748
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,919
there's tons of stuff that you all can

749
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:20,240
leverage and take with you afterwards.

750
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:21,760
We have all of the workbooks for startup

751
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,840
tactics, getting businesses off the

752
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:26,880
ground, or entrepreneurial ventures off

753
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:28,880
the ground quickly. We also have the AID

754
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,720
opportunity workbook for established

755
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,720
organizations. This workbook helps you

756
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:36,159
answer the most common question I get,

757
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,840
which is WTF, do I do with AI? There's a

758
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:40,960
million things we could do, but what

759
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:42,799
should we do? And a new book that will

760
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,440
be coming out next year called No One

761
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:47,520
Works Here. This book will uh look at

762
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:50,720
what it means for an AIdriven

763
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:52,880
organization to continue to exist. To

764
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,279
wrap up, I want to leave you with one

765
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:57,360
key takeaway. that is that the global

766
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:59,840
economy is changing rapidly with

767
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:03,679
AIdriven enterprises, but we're still in

768
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:05,440
this dialup era of AI. For us as leaders

769
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:07,360
at established organizations to make

770
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,880
sure that we have a fighting chance

771
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,240
against these new entrepreneurial

772
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,559
ventures that are starting and scaling

773
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,960
rapidly, we have to make sure that we're

774
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:18,955
taking one big step back and skating

775
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:20,975
where the puck is going. Thank you.

776
00:30:18,955 --> 00:30:20,975
[applause]

777
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:25,560
>> [applause]

778
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,760
>> questions for Paul.

779
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:35,080
>> Oh, nice.

780
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:35,080
>> Oh, two arms. Set up. Thank you.

781
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,880
>> Thank Thank you. That was really

782
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:39,520
interesting. As

783
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,760
>> what's your name?

784
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,919
>> Jill Jones. And wonderful here from

785
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:46,960
Wales with my colleague Annie. Lots of

786
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:49,600
other people. Um, super interesting.

787
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:51,600
We're both business angel investors and

788
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:54,240
we are overwhelmed with what we should

789
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:57,360
look for when a company presents to us

790
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,240
and says that they are using AI.

791
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:02,440
Any

792
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,440
>> if I may, it's probably

793
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:06,720
>> You're just overwhelmed and you don't

794
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,960
know how to evaluate it.

795
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,240
>> Yes. Yeah, that that's it. I mean,

796
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:13,120
everybody's saying that they're using

797
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,880
AI, but what should we be looking for?

798
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,399
We're sector agnostic so we're get

799
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,360
seeing so much coming through and we

800
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:18,080
just don't know what we should be

801
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,240
looking for.

802
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,440
>> Yeah. The thing that I would say is it's

803
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,960
really important that that line of

804
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,679
questioning that you present them with

805
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,200
your your diligence process looks at

806
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:28,480
where within the organization are they

807
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,320
using it. Are they using it surface

808
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,080
level and they ask chat GPT some things?

809
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,480
Sometimes you remember the scale of one

810
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,840
to five that I presented you with. I

811
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,600
would dig deeper into that and

812
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,120
understand how they're using it and

813
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,120
where they're using it where within the

814
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:43,200
business which functional areas and the

815
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:45,919
level of depth to which they are using

816
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,279
it for internal operations. I would also

817
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:49,679
uh recommend that you think about the

818
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:52,640
different levels of AI adoption in these

819
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:56,159
uh emerging companies which is an

820
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:58,320
individual could be using it or they

821
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:00,880
could be collaborating in the same tools

822
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:02,399
together and that drives far better

823
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,320
efficiencies. So I would be looking at

824
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:06,240
that as well. Where are they using it in

825
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:08,480
the organization? At what level of depth

826
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:11,679
and are they using it as a team or are

827
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:13,600
they using it kind of solo individually?

828
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:16,202
Thank you, Jill.

829
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:18,320
>> Hey Paul, Mario here. It traditional

830
00:32:16,202 --> 00:32:21,360
[clears throat] SAS companies build

831
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:23,519
average solutions for a common problem

832
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,120
that averages out between a a bulk of

833
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:28,640
people, right? With these solutions

834
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:31,600
going this fast in two to five years, I

835
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:33,919
could foresee a a solution that a system

836
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:36,240
that that creates solutions for the

837
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,760
individual. How do you see the impact of

838
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,360
company building for that? Because at

839
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,960
some point it won't make sense to build

840
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,000
companies to build solutions, right?

841
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,519
Because everyone will have the

842
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,440
capability to do that. How do you

843
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:47,600
foresee that future?

844
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,120
Uh I think that's a phenomenal question

845
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:52,159
and one of the things that I would say

846
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:54,720
on that is it's becoming easier for

847
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:56,720
people to start companies. It's

848
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,320
requiring far less risk capital and what

849
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,519
that means is we will see more companies

850
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,919
emerging into the marketplace and

851
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:04,720
competing with each other. That I

852
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:06,159
believe is a good thing. Why? Because we

853
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,480
will have entrepreneurs who are able to

854
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:10,159
build products and services solutions to

855
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,240
each of our own personalized problems.

856
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:14,559
But I don't believe that we will each

857
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,399
build the complex solutions that we need

858
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,399
personally. Some of the things we might,

859
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:21,200
but there's so many things that are far

860
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:22,399
more uh uh complex that any one person's

861
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,240
going to sit down and build for

862
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:26,159
themselves. There's still going to be a

863
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,760
need to create value for others because

864
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:29,440
you could also look at it and say, well,

865
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,279
we could all still be like, you know,

866
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:34,080
growing our own um fruits and

867
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:36,240
vegetables, but that's not the case. Um,

868
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,760
and so I think we're going to have more

869
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,919
personalized solutions built and

870
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:41,919
delivered to us which will be wonderful

871
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:44,919
and improve like overall quality of

872
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,919
life.

873
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,519
>> Yeah. Hi Paul, my name is Dan. Um, I

874
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:52,159
work in the financial services industry

875
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:53,760
and like one of the immediate questions

876
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:56,799
that always comes up with any sort of

877
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:59,039
like proposed AI solution is essentially

878
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:00,720
customer data privacy and and then you

879
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:02,559
know immediately there's 20 barriers

880
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:05,360
thrown up to to whatever that solution

881
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:08,800
is. Um, how do you think that how do you

882
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:10,800
think this will be addressed uh in the

883
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,879
future or in the present?

884
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,720
>> A few things. First, I think there's

885
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:16,320
going to be a growing need for cyber

886
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,079
security professionals, which is why I'm

887
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,000
very excited about the investment that's

888
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:21,760
being made in the United States to

889
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,359
educate folks at the high school level

890
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,520
in cyber security. I think that's

891
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:26,720
phenomenal and we need more of that. Um,

892
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,919
one of the other things that I would say

893
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:32,000
is there's uh a need to have walled kind

894
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:33,440
of like a walled sandbox, right? where

895
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,119
companies can experiment especially in

896
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:38,240
the financial services sector. What I

897
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:40,960
always tell people who work in um you

898
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:43,359
know financial services, banks, uh all

899
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,520
those sorts of organizations is you

900
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:47,520
should go buy a little bank and use that

901
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,200
as your sandbox. Why? I think that's

902
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,480
really important so that you know you

903
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:53,040
can experiment. It's very hard to

904
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,800
experiment in a large organization. Um,

905
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:58,480
more tactically, one of the things that

906
00:34:54,800 --> 00:35:00,320
I would say is, uh, go use the tools

907
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,520
that are purpose-built for financial

908
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,359
services institutions. One of the

909
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,680
companies that I advise is called Lizer.

910
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:08,960
Lizer is an AI agent orchestration

911
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:10,400
platform that is purpose-built for

912
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,040
financial services and insurance

913
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,640
companies, knowing the unique risks that

914
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,480
are presented. And this comes back to

915
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,760
the last question. It's like all right

916
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,359
well if anybody can build products and

917
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,560
start companies we are going to have

918
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:22,720
more purpose-built products and

919
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:25,440
solutions for our organizations. I also

920
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:27,760
think um a lot of financial services

921
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:30,160
organizations those large organizations

922
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:32,640
will need to invest in in-house models

923
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:34,800
in or leveraging open source models on

924
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,320
in-house compute to make sure that that

925
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,720
data doesn't ever leave the

926
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:41,040
organization.

927
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:43,894
>> Thank you Paul and always thanks

928
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,894
