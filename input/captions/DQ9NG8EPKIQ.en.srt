1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:12,000
Okay, it is uh my pleasure to introduce

2
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:15,920
our next speaker. It is Sarab Amin. He

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,680
is a professor of civil engineering,

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,279
civil and environmental engine or the

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,039
department of civil and environmental

6
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:24,320
engineering.

7
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:26,480
And uh take it away sir.

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,279
>> Um thank you everyone. Uh thank you Jim

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,199
for inviting me. So the title here is

10
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,280
not mine. It's given to me by Jim.

11
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,280
Designing for resilience, scaling

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,559
infrastructure for environmental and

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,040
system uncertainty. So my background is

14
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:43,120
in analytics uh data science

15
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,280
optimization and machine learning. And

16
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,520
I'm going to try to address some of the

17
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,480
resiliency challenges in the age of data

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:54,320
center through a set of case studies and

19
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:57,199
uh papers that we recently completed. So

20
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm going to pose this big kind of

21
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:03,120
number at you which is AI data centers

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,720
is projected uh 945 terowatt hours by

23
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:09,200
2030 is equivalent to the demand of a

24
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,360
whole economy such as Japan right so

25
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,159
when we look at these numbers in the

26
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,720
face of three global risks identified by

27
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,520
the world economic forum extreme weather

28
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:22,479
events natural resource shortages and

29
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,479
adverse effects of AI as a technology

30
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,479
what jumps out at us is the

31
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,119
interdependent environmental,

32
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:32,079
technological and economic risks that we

33
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:35,200
face and that we fear might get

34
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:37,920
compounded or at least changed in their

35
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,560
nature with the advent of this huge

36
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,119
demand that we are facing of data center

37
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,399
resulting from AI compute growth. So

38
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:50,640
here the whole presentation I want to

39
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:54,159
phrase as a dual use of AI. On one hand,

40
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,159
AI is helpful to us tremendously in

41
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,560
trying to leverage heterogeneous data

42
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,280
for better forecasting for better

43
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,119
scalable uh solution of our large scale

44
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,840
optimization problems and disaster

45
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:08,479
response and crisis management. But on

46
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,840
the other hand, it also exposes us to

47
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,760
these new risks because we want to we

48
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,080
are faced with exponential consumption

49
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,080
of resources and critical

50
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,080
interdependencies that we may have

51
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,720
overlooked and creating new failure

52
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:26,000
vectors. So the first kind of starting

53
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:28,000
point I want to say is that AI offers us

54
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,319
good tools to manage these kind of

55
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,720
complex interdependencies and risks on

56
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:35,120
one hand thanks to the advances in data

57
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,480
science and optimization but it also

58
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,640
creates this unprecedented

59
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,000
vulnerabilities that we need to address.

60
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,840
Right? So taking a step back now we know

61
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,040
that there is going to be a sustained

62
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,200
growth in the AI data center demand

63
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,599
which will impose new risks and new

64
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,160
demands to our energy infrastructure.

65
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:57,280
Right? So in the past years uh the uh

66
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,840
energy demand has increased by six uh 6%

67
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,959
but we are rapidly seeing between 2019

68
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:06,000
to 2026 there is more than 2x increase

69
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,800
in the energy demand. And what we can

70
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,959
say very safely is that the classical

71
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,040
improvements resulting from computer

72
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,040
architecture from how the data centers

73
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,879
are managed and operated they are all

74
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,360
very good but they are going to reach a

75
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:21,040
plateau unless we sort of take a systems

76
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,040
approach a broader approach in

77
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,599
particular we ought to think about the

78
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,000
multi-dimensional nature of the stresses

79
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:30,239
that these particular integration of AI

80
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,799
with the energy system creates in

81
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,360
particular strain on our energy system

82
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:38,080
our grid uh strain stain on our water

83
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,239
resources, strain on critical supply

84
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,200
chains of semiconductor devices and

85
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,040
semiconductor materials and also land

86
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,000
resources which includes sighting

87
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:51,519
conflicts. So already we are seeing

88
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,920
these kind of uh collocation of data

89
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,879
center demand which creates new stresses

90
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,560
in water stress regions and increased

91
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,640
projection of regional demand of

92
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,959
electricity by the independent system

93
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,360
operators. So what we need is a

94
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:08,159
fundamentally new way to think about

95
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,640
improving the resiliency of our coupled

96
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:12,879
AI infrastructure and energy systems.

97
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,640
Okay. So what I'm going to try to do

98
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,880
before we proceed is to try to tell you

99
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,639
three motivating aspects on why we need

100
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,880
to think about how we think about

101
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,280
resiliency and integrate in our planning

102
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,040
and operations. Right? So the first is

103
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,199
that we ought to look at past failures.

104
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,120
So past disasters including for example

105
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,759
the Texas freeze which happened in two

106
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,400
consecutive years. Right? So on one hand

107
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:37,040
we had a mis projection on the sudden

108
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,199
increase of demand because of the winter

109
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,160
freeze but on the other hand we also

110
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:44,240
failed to foresee the failures of

111
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,759
thermal generators. Right? So this

112
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:50,080
created and exposed the new ways in

113
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,080
which our natural gas vulnerability

114
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,199
infrastructure vulnerability can impact

115
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,759
our energy system the bulk power system

116
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,560
and uh resulting in cascading blackouts.

117
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,400
Right? So the point here is that we

118
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,120
cannot forget these kind of risks and

119
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:08,000
these events that we witnessed. Um and

120
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,160
we also need to appreciate that while AI

121
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,400
can help us better forecast the nature

122
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,320
of these risks. What is also important

123
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,440
is that we plan and operate under

124
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:20,000
uncertainty and the implications of AI

125
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,759
for AI infrastructure is that point

126
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
predictions are no longer useful. we

127
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,919
need to think about uh uncertainty and

128
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,680
we also need to think about the

129
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,600
interdependencies between various

130
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,000
infrastructures. That's my first kind of

131
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,080
uh starting point. The second starting

132
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,759
point here is that currently there are

133
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,680
thousands of gaw of u new generation

134
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,759
that is stuck in cues which is called as

135
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,320
interconnection cues and the decision

136
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,560
makers and the generators have huge

137
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,600
difficulty in integrating these new

138
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,360
assets into the uh grid because they are

139
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,440
facing a lots and lots of delay up to

140
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,440
six years of delay and they are

141
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,520
ultimately withdrawing. So the grid

142
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,360
operators have to account for these

143
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,680
different types of load patterns and

144
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,520
contingencies and and have to look at

145
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,840
various types of scenarios that they

146
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,160
need to plan for in order to integrate

147
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,720
these renewables and new types of loads

148
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,280
that are coming into the grid.

149
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,360
So what I want to say here is that we

150
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,639
need to think about new approaches to

151
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,880
try to try to sort of combine these kind

152
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,800
of integration requests right and

153
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,840
evaluate all these scenarios in a much

154
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,840
faster manner right and in doing that we

155
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,720
need to think about what I call as cross

156
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:33,039
center cross- sector competition between

157
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,520
for example the EV generated demand and

158
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:38,000
the AI data center generated demand for

159
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,680
example okay so that's the second point

160
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,680
the third point here and I'm going to

161
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,319
Again stress is this multi-dimensional

162
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,800
nature of the resources. So water stress

163
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,319
I already mentioned uh in particular we

164
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,880
see that twothird of the new data

165
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,560
centers are expected or are being

166
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,240
deployed in already water stress

167
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,280
regions. We are seeing land use

168
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,560
conflicts and we are also saying um and

169
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,479
this is something that we are also

170
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,319
working on is the supply chain

171
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,840
vulnerabilities because these data

172
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,400
centers require new kinds of

173
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,319
semiconductor devices for which the US

174
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,840
is not prepared to manufacture uh

175
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,240
inhouse and there are critical

176
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,560
interdependencies between Taiwan, China,

177
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,120
US and the EU that also needs to be

178
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,880
accounted for. So basically what I'm

179
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,000
trying to say here is that we need to

180
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:24,319
think about optimizing simultaneously

181
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,880
multiple resources across water,

182
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,560
minerals and land not just the energy

183
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,919
infrastructure. So that's my third

184
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:34,240
starting point. With that I want to say

185
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,080
uh that the classical way in which we

186
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,319
look at the operations and planning and

187
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,240
planning and operations is no longer

188
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:43,199
sufficient because of the reasons we

189
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,840
just discussed which means the classical

190
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,759
ways of predicting planning building and

191
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,560
connecting to the grid is something that

192
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:53,440
we are finding faults with already

193
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:56,240
because we these kind of modeling

194
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:58,240
approaches fail under uncertainty. uh we

195
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,680
need these these typically do not

196
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,240
account for multiple types of

197
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,479
interdependencies. They assume static

198
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,879
assumptions while we need to be more

199
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,960
adaptive and they typically look at

200
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,199
local optimization and don't look at the

201
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,199
systematic or system oriented approaches

202
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:16,639
that we need to look at in an integrated

203
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:19,759
manner. So what we need is uncertainty

204
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:23,120
aware planning and operations adaptation

205
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:25,360
as our new uncertainties reveal and

206
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,080
system level optimization which account

207
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:31,199
for cross- sector coupling across a

208
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,440
range of infrastructures. Okay. So with

209
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,839
that I'm going to present to you a new

210
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,159
way of thinking uh which should be

211
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,919
obvious for people who are in are are

212
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,080
aware of how to integrate uncertainty

213
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,839
and risks into decision problems. But

214
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,160
I'm going to discuss some specific

215
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,080
insights uh given that this is a data

216
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,160
center day that we are here. Right? So

217
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,720
I'm going to say that we need to be more

218
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,040
adaptive in our planning uh uh uh

219
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,399
planning approach. We need to sense uh

220
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,399
respond learn and optimize

221
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,560
simultaneously. But we also need to

222
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,839
account for the uncertainties, multiple

223
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,360
objectives and build in the

224
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,680
adaptability.

225
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,399
And through this I'm going to reveal a

226
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,720
set of resiliency principles that would

227
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:14,399
be of interest hopefully to a number of

228
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:17,760
us in the face of uh the AIdriven uh

229
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:19,360
energy systems energy growth right okay

230
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,440
so what I'm going to try to do in the

231
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,240
time that we have together is I'm going

232
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,720
to give four examples four concrete

233
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,200
examples from the research that we have

234
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,360
completed uh which exposes the

235
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:35,040
importance of system level thinking to

236
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:38,640
account for um uh interdependencies to

237
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:41,040
look at multiple objectives together uh

238
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,200
uh in the face of uncertainties and then

239
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:46,480
I'm going to think uh tell you a little

240
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:49,360
bit about how we are using generative AI

241
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,959
uh for the purpose of trying to um uh

242
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:55,040
look at uh scenarios which which which

243
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:58,080
are important for us in order to account

244
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:01,360
manage the risks and lastly the use of

245
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:03,200
LLMs um uh and how they can help us in

246
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,600
accelerating and managing this risk. So

247
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,519
these are the four kind of messages that

248
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,240
I will walk you through in the time that

249
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:13,279
we have together. Okay. So the first

250
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,519
case study is a paper uh with multiple

251
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,880
colleagues that we completed uh which

252
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,040
got published in cell report

253
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,760
sustainability which basically asks the

254
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,920
question that if we have a future kind

255
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,320
of electrification deep electrification

256
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:29,120
scenarios on the residential heating

257
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,360
side right how much of my

258
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,200
interdependencies between the natural

259
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,160
gas and energy infrastru electricity

260
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,079
infrastructure shift because the natural

261
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,320
gas is going to be now shifted from the

262
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:42,959
residential use of natural gas to

263
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,519
supplying bulk energy, right? And what

264
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:48,959
is the role of future climate change

265
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,800
uncertainties in demand and supply in

266
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,399
making this kind of shift happen? What

267
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,600
are the implications, right? And how do

268
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:57,279
we plan for uh for decarbonization

269
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,440
goals, right? In these kind of

270
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:02,640
technological shifts and under these

271
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,800
multiple types of uncertainties. So what

272
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,440
we considered here is that we considered

273
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:10,079
multiple weather variations coming from

274
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:13,040
climate models. We try to also account

275
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:14,720
for technological uncertainties uh with

276
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,120
electrification that we are going to

277
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,440
face and this fuel switching behavior

278
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,399
between natural gas and electric uh

279
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,480
infrastructure. And what we found is

280
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:28,240
that for the New England regional energy

281
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:30,959
system, the uh demand shifts to a winter

282
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,279
peaking system. And what we also see is

283
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:35,279
that because of the uncertainty in the

284
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,440
future climate scenarios, the

285
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:40,079
weatherdriven peak uncertainty becomes

286
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,920
much larger. Right? So this creates a

287
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,760
trade-off that on one hand

288
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,000
electrification uh heating

289
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,160
electrification creates lower energy and

290
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,320
natural gas use on the demand side but

291
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,399
it generates higher electricity demand.

292
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,040
Right? And why is it useful for data

293
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,880
center planning? Because when the data

294
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:00,240
center loads are integrated into the

295
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:02,640
grid, it can compound and exacerbate the

296
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,320
winter peaking demand, right? And

297
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,720
clearly in the face of future

298
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,360
uncertainties in the data center growth

299
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,360
and also the climate uncertainties, the

300
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,760
huge volatility that we may be facing

301
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,680
with needs to be planned for in terms of

302
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,839
citing new generation assets and

303
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,720
operating them. Right? So that is the

304
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:23,200
takeaway. Um and through this kind of a

305
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:26,079
cross- sector integrated analysis, we

306
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,320
are able to try to understand what kind

307
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:30,560
of natural gas investments that we may

308
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,600
be needing while maintaining strong

309
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,760
decarbonization goals, right? Um what

310
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,760
kind of flexible response capabilities

311
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,480
need to be exercised in order to deal

312
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,399
with the weather uh uncertainties and

313
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,120
what might be the changes in the

314
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,720
transmission lines and also pipeline

315
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,320
infrastructure natural gas pipeline

316
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,320
infrastructure that we may need to make

317
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,800
or that we would need to make in order

318
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,720
to account for these uncertainties. So

319
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,279
one of the insights that we have is that

320
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,000
we do need to have flexible peaking

321
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:02,480
capacities right and when we are trying

322
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,800
to look at data center demand growth

323
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,519
coupled with weatherdriven uncertainties

324
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:11,279
these kind of flexible asset deployment

325
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:14,959
and operation becomes more important.

326
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:17,360
Um overall what we find is that there

327
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:19,200
there could be some surprising takeaways

328
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,720
in particular when we have deep

329
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,600
electrification

330
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,920
uh coupled with u uh improvement in

331
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,560
building envelopes right it can result

332
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,440
in total system costs and also total

333
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:33,200
savings in terms of the joint demand uh

334
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,399
between energy and natural gas

335
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,240
resources. So one takeaway here that I

336
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:41,040
want us to keep in mind is that data

337
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,519
centers uh when they are need to be

338
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:46,079
planned the planning of this demand

339
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,079
needs to be accounted for while also

340
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:50,639
considering the uncertainties in the

341
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:52,720
weatherdriven uncertainties and how the

342
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,480
shifts in the total demand across

343
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,160
multiple infrastructure will occur. So

344
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,639
that's that's my main message for this

345
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,480
case study. Okay.

346
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,959
All right. Okay. So let's move to the

347
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:06,800
second part. Uh the second part is about

348
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:09,680
the uh renewables and uh clearly there

349
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:12,399
is a lot of interest in sighting of

350
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:15,120
renewables both solar and wind near to

351
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:17,680
the data centers in order to ensure that

352
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,720
the data center demand is met in a as

353
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:23,680
decarbonized way as possible. Right? And

354
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:26,560
here again what we looked at is multiple

355
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:29,600
types of resource complmentarities

356
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:31,680
across wind and solar. And one of the

357
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,560
key limitations that we seek to address

358
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,480
here is that when we talk about citing

359
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,320
decisions between wind and solar, they

360
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,639
are typically made using very coarse

361
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,079
resolution models. course resolution

362
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,399
models in the sense that we're not

363
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:47,440
really exploiting fine scale

364
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:50,320
correlations at kilometer scale between

365
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,560
wind and solar and integrating it with

366
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,800
our energy system models in order to

367
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:58,000
generate the best sighting decisions at

368
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:00,720
a micro level which will enable us to

369
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,199
extract the majority of gains through

370
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:07,040
spatial and temporal complimentarity

371
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:08,639
between wind and solar. Okay. So in this

372
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,639
paper that we completed jointly with

373
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:14,560
professor Mike Howland my colleague uh

374
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:16,959
we we uh proved that four resolution

375
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:19,600
sighting 4 kilometer resolution sighting

376
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:23,279
is possible using detailed fine grain

377
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:25,760
data as well as uh fine grained models

378
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:28,240
of energy systems and doing the joint

379
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:31,199
solar and wind optimization across

380
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,839
multiple weather years. And what it

381
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:37,040
essentially gives us is a significant up

382
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:39,839
to 40% cost reduction in comparison to

383
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:42,160
course resolution models. Okay. And the

384
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:45,440
key kind of insight is that through this

385
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:47,120
kind of fine grained modeling of data

386
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,920
integration and energy systems

387
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:52,560
optimization we are able to exploit the

388
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,800
resource complmentarities between wind

389
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,440
and solar both spatially and

390
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:00,639
temporarily. Okay. So in the sense that

391
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:03,279
we want to ensure that the wind wind

392
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:05,279
turbines are located at sites which will

393
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:07,680
be maximally compet complementing

394
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:09,920
spatial temporarily with the solar

395
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,320
energy resources that we have at our

396
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,399
disposal and this kind of spatial

397
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,800
temporal complimentarity can give us a

398
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:19,680
huge gains in terms of requiring lesser

399
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:22,320
total storage right when for example we

400
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,399
are planning for data center demand. So

401
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,920
the applications of data to data center

402
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:29,199
infrastructure for this kind of a

403
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:32,880
thinking is that we need to have a cost

404
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:35,360
effective matching of supply and demand.

405
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,519
Exploiting the complimentarities between

406
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:41,279
the different type of resources

407
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:43,759
renewable resources and here uh the high

408
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:46,480
resolution sighting can be enabled by

409
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:49,600
this deep integration of data fine

410
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:52,320
resolution data and co-optimizing across

411
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,959
both these resources. And what we expect

412
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:58,560
here is that this type of approach will

413
00:16:54,959 --> 00:17:01,199
reduce the risks that we are facing by

414
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,680
creating enough geographical diversity

415
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:06,720
and making sure that multiple types of

416
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,160
resources are properly integrated to

417
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,319
meet the data center demand

418
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,720
fluctuations, variations and also

419
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:15,199
growth. Okay,

420
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,199
that's my second case study. Okay. So

421
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,839
the last two case studies I want to sort

422
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:22,799
of uh give a positive spin on the use of

423
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:24,319
AI and how it can help us to sort of

424
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:27,280
meet this challenge that we are talking

425
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:30,080
about. So the starting point here is

426
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,919
that for data center infrastructure we

427
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,440
need new assets right power plants,

428
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:36,480
transmission infrastructure, cooling

429
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:39,039
devices etc etc and these infrastructure

430
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:42,320
needs to operate over a multiple time

431
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:44,640
horizon 20 or 30 20 to 30 years right

432
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,480
and so what we need to make sure is that

433
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,559
we have a right amount of investment

434
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,960
right now while facing future

435
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:53,120
uncertainties right so if I were to plan

436
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,200
for worst case right if I were to plan

437
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,919
for worst case or scenar scenarios which

438
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,160
are not statistically and feasible

439
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,720
physically plausible then I may

440
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,280
overinvest in my capacity right you

441
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:08,240
agree I may overinvest so what can

442
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:10,720
generative AI do right so the idea here

443
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:13,360
is that if I'm able to sort of simulate

444
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:16,240
the supply and demand simultaneously

445
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,799
under future weather scenarios and I

446
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:21,600
build a generative model for the supply

447
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:25,039
demand variations that I'm encountering

448
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:27,360
or expected to encounter I sample from

449
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:30,160
this generative AI model in order to

450
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,840
create scenarios which are risks

451
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,000
sensitive which means that they are

452
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:37,679
statistically possible and physically

453
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,679
realistic and then plan my system

454
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,400
in the face of these scenarios that I

455
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:45,039
will generate. Okay, so that is the use

456
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:47,200
of generative AI and what I want to

457
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:49,360
emphasize here is that the classical

458
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,600
methods of trying to generate the

459
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:54,000
scenarios do not really capture this

460
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,960
kind of requirement of statistical and

461
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,919
physible physical plausibility.

462
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:02,240
Okay. And this may result in even if

463
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,320
it's a datadriven approach physically

464
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:07,039
unrealistic scenarios which might be

465
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,960
very costly leading to unnecessary or

466
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,960
overinvestments in the resources or

467
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,760
underinvestments in in the situations

468
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,840
where I need the most investments. Okay.

469
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,880
So what we find here just at a high

470
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,880
level is that we try to sort of train

471
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,559
what we call as the generative model

472
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,440
which is in this case a variational

473
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:28,400
autoenccoder details are not important

474
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,400
through uh 20 year of hourly data. So

475
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,799
it's a huge amount of highdimensional

476
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:35,200
data and what we see is that we are able

477
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:37,760
to learn lower dimensional

478
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,160
representations of these uncertainties

479
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,720
that we are expected and what we then do

480
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:45,120
is to sample as I mentioned in this

481
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,280
lower dimensional space to create new

482
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,960
scenarios which are risk relevant right

483
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,919
which are statistically and physically

484
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:54,400
plausible and what we then also do is to

485
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:58,320
emp uh is to leverage uh efficient

486
00:19:54,400 --> 00:20:00,080
optimization tools in order to plan and

487
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,160
solve these large scale optimization

488
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,240
models under the uncertainty that we

489
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:07,360
just characterized.

490
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:09,520
Okay, so what this gives us here is that

491
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,600
it gives us a decrease in the runtime

492
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,200
for this large uh scale optimization

493
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,360
problems but more importantly a

494
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,200
reduction in the cost while maintaining

495
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,559
the robustness guarantees under future

496
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,559
uncertainties. So that's very important

497
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,880
to ensure the same level of robustness

498
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:26,559
under future uncertainties with lower

499
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:28,880
cost is a huge cane right and again this

500
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,720
approach avoids the over robustification

501
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,640
by so that because we don't have to then

502
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:36,320
consider implausible or impossible

503
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:38,640
scenarios uh this is an example try to

504
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:41,360
focus on the lower panel uh this is a

505
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:44,400
scenario example that I can actually now

506
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:47,280
generate a plausible as I said load

507
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,760
pattern solar capacity factor and

508
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:52,080
offshore wind pattern as well as onshore

509
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:54,320
wind pattern which I will not see in my

510
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,840
historical data at all. Okay, this type

511
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,400
of scenario will not be there in the

512
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,799
historical data at all but it is

513
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,720
statistically possible plausible and

514
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,720
physically realistic and it's a

515
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,480
high-risk scenario which means that this

516
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,640
scenario happens to have the highest

517
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,799
impact on my operations cost and that's

518
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:14,400
why I need to plan and invest for these

519
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:15,760
kind of scenarios. All right. Okay. So

520
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,679
what I want to express is that

521
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,679
generative models enable the robust

522
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,360
planning without building in the

523
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:24,000
overconservatism.

524
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:26,960
Okay. So that's my third case study.

525
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,360
Okay. Uh the final case study is the use

526
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,960
of large language models. So remember

527
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,840
that I first presented you this

528
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:36,320
challenge of interconnection cues where

529
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,320
various generation assets and loads are

530
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,240
facing this huge delays in connecting to

531
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,720
the grid because the grid operators need

532
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,840
to consider this number of scenarios and

533
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,840
run this complicated study reports.

534
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:50,320
Okay. So what happens is that these big

535
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:52,320
ISOs and market operators like ISO or

536
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,000
other other other uh independent system

537
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,679
operators they generate these study

538
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,880
reports and these are massive study

539
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:00,400
reports 200 300 pages they are you know

540
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,960
they are they are conducted by very

541
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:05,840
expert engineers at these uh at these uh

542
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:08,400
markets. Um so what we're doing is to

543
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:11,919
try to use large language models to

544
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:14,880
automatically extract data relevant data

545
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:17,600
uh from these uh from these uh reports

546
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:20,080
right um and then try to understand what

547
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,919
kind of decision-m rules these system

548
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:24,960
operators employ and which might be

549
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:27,039
revised under fork revisions right um

550
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,640
you know in in in more complex and you

551
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:31,120
know different ISOs interpret and

552
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,679
implement these rules differently so

553
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:36,799
what we want to do is to try to sort of

554
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:39,280
leverage um the LLM and optimization

555
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:42,240
framework in order to automatically

556
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:44,000
extract relevant parameters and data and

557
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,000
more importantly decision making

558
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,039
constraints from these textual

559
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,960
descriptions. Okay. And then integrate

560
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:53,360
it with our large scale optimization

561
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,280
models so that we can run these

562
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,720
optimization models under various

563
00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:00,080
uncertainty scenarios in a

564
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:03,679
parallelizable manner for rapid scenario

565
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:06,159
analysis and decision-m support.

566
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:08,080
Okay.

567
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:10,400
So what we want to understand is how can

568
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:13,440
we leverage these messy documents which

569
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:16,400
are out there and try to conduct or try

570
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,080
to give very validated optimization

571
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,640
solvers which can be used by these

572
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:23,280
decision makers. Okay both the

573
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:25,200
generators the loads as well as the uh

574
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,520
system operators. Okay. So I'm going to

575
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,919
briefly discuss this process with you.

576
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:32,159
Uh so the first step is quite simple. It

577
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:34,799
is uh trying to understand how we can

578
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,880
leverage the uh spreadsheets, the

579
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:38,799
complex study reports and then parse and

580
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,960
chunk and embed and retrieve using

581
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:43,200
retrieval augmented generation and

582
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,760
create these structured data sources

583
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,600
right where which has the data on the

584
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,360
upgrade cost for various types of

585
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,919
upgrades you know reconductoring

586
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,760
transmission line upgrades etc etc delay

587
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:56,080
patterns for various types of loads and

588
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:58,320
generator request withdrawal region

589
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,799
reasons so when for example generators

590
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,159
withdraw from the interconnection cues

591
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:04,559
and other types of technical

592
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:06,080
requirements. So what we want and we're

593
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:08,159
already seeing some progress here in our

594
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:10,480
work is this kind of structured approach

595
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:14,159
to extract information that is useful

596
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:15,919
from these complex documents. Okay.

597
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:18,640
The second here is to create

598
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:20,559
mathematical constraints right from

599
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:23,360
these documents. So what we have is the

600
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:25,039
plain text data and the data or the

601
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:28,159
numerical data which is there in this

602
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:30,720
document and then try to extract what if

603
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:33,039
scenarios and then automatically

604
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,640
construct mathematical constraints that

605
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:36,880
we can embed in our optimization

606
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,240
problems. So for example you can have a

607
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,000
natural language description that

608
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,840
voltage stability requires a reactive

609
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,600
power reserves proportional to the

610
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,760
distance from the substation. It's a

611
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,360
it's a randomly generated constraint

612
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:50,080
which I pulled out but then it can be

613
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,919
mathematically already coded by the LLM

614
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:55,039
so that we can create an optimization

615
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:57,679
model and then solve it. Okay. So that's

616
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:59,200
the second kind of uh uh step and the

617
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:01,520
third step I think is the most important

618
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,600
and this we have a working paper called

619
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:06,320
Opihive which is available online if you

620
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:09,200
are interested. It basically says that

621
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:12,480
we can use also LLMs to generate

622
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,640
optimization for critical grid planning.

623
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,240
Okay. So what I want to say to you is

624
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,600
that there is a lot of approaches that

625
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,600
people have pursued in order to

626
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,120
integrate optimization and LLMs and

627
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,360
these are like some kind of sequential

628
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:26,159
interaction between LLM agents and

629
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:29,520
optimization right but what we are doing

630
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:32,559
here is that suppose so suppose I'm able

631
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:35,039
to create an ensemble of optimization

632
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:36,640
models right which are all consistent

633
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:39,360
with the requirements of the decision

634
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,679
makers and are are calibrated to the

635
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:44,240
data that I extracted from those reports

636
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:47,600
Right. And what I can do now here is

637
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:50,080
that I can now run right these multiple

638
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,320
optimization models and verify them for

639
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:56,000
correctness in a parallelizable manner

640
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:58,320
in order to do rapid scenario testing.

641
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,880
Okay. So so that's the kind of an

642
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,720
approach that I we have. We have uh LLM

643
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,760
based queries. We create solvers

644
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,840
instances test in parallel. We try to

645
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,840
sort of filter out uh you know the ones

646
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:12,080
which are mathematically incorrect and

647
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,919
semantically incorrect and then we build

648
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:17,200
this kind of a statistical inference

649
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:19,919
model which basically reliably tells me

650
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:22,480
what kind of model and solver are best

651
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:24,799
suited to give me the kind of results

652
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:27,679
that the decision makers would want.

653
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:30,080
Okay. Uh so basically what we already

654
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:32,159
have seen in this uh work of ours is

655
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,240
that we are substantively able to

656
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:37,200
improve the ability of this LLM

657
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:39,039
optimization pipeline uh to solve very

658
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,120
complex vehicle routing problems with

659
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:43,520
obstacles and complex combinatorial

660
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:45,760
optimization problems. And as we speak,

661
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:48,799
we are trying to extend this approach

662
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:50,240
already to develop solvers for

663
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:52,080
transmission expansion planning

664
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:55,840
decisions, right? to automatically

665
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:57,919
extract um from the ISO reports uh to

666
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,559
model the various tariff requirements

667
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:02,400
and then extract the model mathematical

668
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:05,039
constraint translations in an automatic

669
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:07,200
way and so that we can try to under

670
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:09,679
various policy reforms which are put out

671
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,360
by FIRK and other agencies conduct these

672
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:14,559
kind of scenario testing and stress

673
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:17,279
testing to provide decision support.

674
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:19,600
Okay. And the key message here is that

675
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:22,480
this aspect of statistically validated

676
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:25,039
solvers can substantively increase our

677
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,880
ability to leverage and integrate LLMs

678
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:29,919
into our optimization pipeline. So I'm

679
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:32,559
going to conclude in just a couple of uh

680
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:35,440
uh slides. So through this case study I

681
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:38,240
hope or case studies I hope that we

682
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:41,360
learned one the importance of having

683
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:43,120
coordinated planning right siting and

684
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,039
decision-m of renewables in a

685
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,799
complimentary spatial temporary compl

686
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:49,360
complimentary way under the

687
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:51,679
uncertainties of weather and climate

688
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:54,799
related scenarios the importance of

689
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:56,559
finding realistic worst case scenarios

690
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:58,960
through the possibly the use of

691
00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:01,520
generative AI tools and the promise that

692
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:04,159
the integration of LLMs and optimization

693
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:06,159
show in accelerating these decision-m

694
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:07,919
processes. So the key message here is

695
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:10,080
that we should these tools and these

696
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,480
ways of thinking allow us to think about

697
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,880
uncertainties and interdependencies in a

698
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,039
in a systematic manner and in terms of

699
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,600
the path forward this has implications

700
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:21,360
for industry for policy and for research

701
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:24,240
but basically what I'm trying to suggest

702
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:26,000
here is that adaptation uh uncertainty

703
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,320
aware and cross- sector planning and

704
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,480
coordination is super important as we

705
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,880
think about planning and operating in

706
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:35,120
the age of data centerdriven energy

707
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:38,120
demand growth. All right. Okay. Thank

708
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,120
you.
