1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,319
Erica Hodes I'm the associate director

2
00:00:01,959 --> 00:00:06,759
of Corporations uh what that means to

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:09,120
you is that I am the main person

4
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:11,360
responsible for making sure that we have

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,360
a really exciting slate of Capstone

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,280
projects every year um that you can

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,600
partner with companies on um and I'd

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,880
also like to introduce my colleague

9
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,039
Jordan LaVine who is a lecturer in

10
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,840
operations research and statistics and

11
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,560
partners with me on Capstone by Leading

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,000
you through the entire project uh

13
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,279
through our Capstone Force um we will

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,640
both be kind of contributing to we talk

15
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:34,320
about in terms of hstone process and

16
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,960
projects um but for now I'm going to

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,000
turn it over to Jordan to give you a

18
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:44,239
quick overview thanks Katherine or Erica

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,239
and um Katherine uh you want to go

20
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:52,760
ahead okay so um we're going to discuss

21
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:55,120
uh sorry the Capstone over Capstone is a

22
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:58,840
critical part of the curriculum um the

23
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,480
fall semester is focused in academics

24
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:04,159
and you will have a

25
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,680
uh robust slate of analytics classes in

26
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,759
the spring the uh along with the number

27
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:13,240
of electives one of the core components

28
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:16,360
is our Capstone um you will be given a

29
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:19,840
real world business and uh business

30
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:22,720
analytics and data science problem so

31
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:26,200
specifically what that means is Erica

32
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:30,439
and I right now uh for our next class

33
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:33,920
um or for 2025 are in active dialog

34
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:36,520
with our partner host companies and we

35
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,920
are making sure that what they bring

36
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:41,119
forth in terms of both data but also the

37
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:44,000
problem set is useful to their their

38
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,680
leadership their executive leadership so

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,600
um in this CL in this program I think we

40
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,600
did do a great job of just uh not being

41
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,600
too theoretical ensuring that what you

42
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,119
work on will actually impact the real

43
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:59,520
world our construct is teams of two with

44
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,520
a faculty advisor so you will meet with

45
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:06,000
me weekly you'll have a partner and

46
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:08,000
you'll also have a faculty adviser to be

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,039
uh prepared to provide you technical

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,800
advice so this is not a um this is not a

49
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:19,720
solo Evolution you are well supported

50
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:22,680
and um part of a team and um timing wise

51
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:25,920
we match in January which is during

52
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,800
something called IAP at MIT and you are

53
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,400
part-time from February to May at

54
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:32,120
approximately 10 hours a week so you can

55
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:36,560
balance your academic electives and then

56
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:38,599
full-time in the summer and we um we

57
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,680
make sure that you do something what we

58
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:43,720
call uh Advanced analytics so doing

59
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,360
descriptive analytics is not enough you

60
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:48,640
we will make sure that in the scope

61
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:51,080
there is some aspect that is predictive

62
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,640
uh machine learning or there's an

63
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:57,080
optimization aspect of it or lately

64
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,800
we've been picking up generative AI um

65
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:01,800
Elements which has been pretty

66
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,800
interesting

67
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,879
and Katherine if you got if you want to

68
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,879
go to the next

69
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:14,720
slide so here you see uh some example of

70
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:19,040
our partners we hope you recognize um

71
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:23,080
some of these brand names so

72
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:25,720
um Coca-Cola probably you recognize um

73
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:29,920
if you uh and Nike are probably the two

74
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:32,680
Global brands that stick out um if uh

75
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,400
United States based uh firm so Comcast

76
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:37,519
is is one of a handful of of major

77
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:42,239
providers of media cable TV in the

78
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:45,080
United States um and then we have a

79
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,439
number of startups included so we will R

80
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:50,480
we will majority work with large Fortune

81
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:53,120
500s but we also engage uh smaller

82
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,680
companies and we are mostly industry

83
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,760
agnostics so here in front of you you

84
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,760
will see uh you'll see projects ranging

85
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:04,040
from

86
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,319
retail uh consumer packaged Goods

87
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,239
technology and

88
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:10,319
media

89
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:14,159
Insurance um but you also will see

90
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:18,199
nonprofits so like the city of Boston um

91
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:20,000
or the United Nations and uh what I love

92
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:21,600
about these projects is you can

93
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,800
potentially work on a project and

94
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,919
actually see the um

95
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,479
implementation uh just as an examples as

96
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,240
I'm looking at this page on the right

97
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:30,680
hand side you see CVS in the middle

98
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:34,000
that's um

99
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,759
it's one of two or three uh retail

100
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,520
Health Care firms in the United States

101
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,440
and we had students and they'll they'll

102
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,800
teex they'll send text messages to their

103
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,240
customers and we had students work on

104
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:47,600
that the texting and so you know as a as

105
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:50,280
a patient or consumer of CVS I um I saw

106
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,560
the text messages that essentially was

107
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:56,160
um derived from students work Erica any

108
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:58,600
um you know over the past four years do

109
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,080
do you have any favorites on this list

110
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:04,160
oh I don't think that's fair

111
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:06,199
um I will say you know the the okay I'll

112
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,960
answer that the favorites are the ones

113
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:10,800
that come back year after year and build

114
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:12,639
on their work um so I think you know

115
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,039
when I'm when I'm looking at this list

116
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:18,240
Comcast Accenture fizer um a lot of

117
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:20,319
these companies have started off with us

118
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,240
when we were a really small program and

119
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:24,080
have continued to iterate various

120
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,600
problems that they have knowing that our

121
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,080
students are capable of giving them the

122
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,039
solutions that they need um so we have a

123
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,120
really high retention rate as I think

124
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:34,720
Jordan already mentioned but there's a

125
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,319
lot of value in building long-term

126
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,600
relationships here and they also tend to

127
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:39,960
hire our students um and so I think that

128
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:43,199
that's a really exciting way to think

129
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:45,199
about partnership so I um I I call it

130
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:48,120
the Congo line I I don't have a better

131
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:51,039
explanation it's kind of you know maybe

132
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:54,199
I'm showing my age I I don't know but uh

133
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:57,000
the metaphor works so Eric I mentioned a

134
00:05:54,199 --> 00:06:00,400
few but also like CAC CGM thermofisher

135
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,440
scientific that they'll sponsor and then

136
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,759
they'll hire and then the individual

137
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,280
that they hired will then be the manager

138
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:08,680
or the program leader for the next

139
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:12,840
Capstone um and we see that as highly

140
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:14,400
synergistic as um I mentioned you this

141
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,680
isn't you don't do this alone you do

142
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,919
this as part of a team and it's pretty

143
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,280
it's pretty cool when you then work with

144
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:24,280
a company and you're working with former

145
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:27,639
um Mand students or Alum of the program

146
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:29,560
who who are best uh able to assess your

147
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:30,759
your calibration and skill set and and

148
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,720
position you for

149
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:35,840
Success um Katherine wanted we go ahead

150
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:39,880
and move

151
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:42,479
forward so timing um we have this down

152
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,919
to a science we feel very good about it

153
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,599
uh Eric and I have been doing this for

154
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:50,120
four years programs done it for maybe

155
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:52,560
seven or eight um I'm estimating maybe

156
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:54,680
200 plus projects so we feel very very

157
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:59,000
good about how this process plays

158
00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:01,520
out um as I mentioned in the fall so um

159
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,000
September to December and you'll if you

160
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:08,720
enroll um orientation is actually in

161
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,599
August but the the core fall semester is

162
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:15,319
uh is analytics

163
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:17,400
coursework um you will do some prep but

164
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:18,400
really we try to keep you focused on

165
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,400
your

166
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,240
academics in January uh which is a

167
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:26,319
special session as I mentioned I AP at

168
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:28,000
MIT you will uh you and your partner and

169
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,240
and you choose your partner by the way

170
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,599
um we stay out of the partner choosing

171
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,800
process uh by December we'll ask you to

172
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,120
pair up we'll help kind of guide it but

173
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:41,199
as I said for the most part we stay out

174
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:44,319
of it um January you will will kick off

175
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:46,560
cap Zone you will work on your uh

176
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,240
messaging to the companies we'll conduct

177
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,159
something called pitch day where the

178
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,159
companies come to MIT campus it's it's a

179
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:56,520
lot of fun it's my favorite event for

180
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:58,280
the process um you will hear the

181
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,000
companies and their plans you will then

182
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:02,599
have the opportunity to interview

183
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,400
with uh a number of companies we'll

184
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:07,800
organize that and you'll also get

185
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,840
coaching from uh one of our colleagues

186
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,039
um in career development on how to best

187
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,479
present yourself we'll then release a

188
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:16,400
match um usually in the beginning of

189
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:19,120
February uh there's absolutely an

190
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,919
algorithm that we use because this is

191
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,280
the MIT applied business analytics

192
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:25,720
program um Eric and I actually conduct a

193
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:28,120
class in January where we show you uh

194
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:30,360
underneath the hood of the algorithm and

195
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,640
then Springtime you are at 10 to 12

196
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:36,399
hours per

197
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:38,519
week um you will be taking electives and

198
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,919
um you will you'll have a Capstone

199
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:44,480
course so that's about 60 to 90 minutes

200
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:46,480
with me once a week and the goal in the

201
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,880
spring is to get you oriented to the

202
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,480
company to the problem statement to

203
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,920
their lexicon to their line of work and

204
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,560
ensure that you have data so that you

205
00:08:52,920 --> 00:09:00,200
are positioned to join the company in

206
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:02,399
June at 40 hours a week um your

207
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:05,200
geographical location is is dependent on

208
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:10,959
the company so preco we were very rigid

209
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:13,120
on um being on site and co uh presented

210
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,279
us with the opportunity to learn and

211
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,200
understand

212
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:20,760
um uh remote

213
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,800
um support and now essentially it's a

214
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:25,040
company by company thing during the

215
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,519
pitch the company will will will tell

216
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,040
you where they want you to be and then

217
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,640
as we're working through the Capstone

218
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,160
class in Spring I'm going to ask you for

219
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,120
a series of Milestones that I think

220
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,160
we'll see in a second and and one of

221
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,760
them is to be very clear by the month of

222
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:41,880
March on where you're going to be in the

223
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:43,560
summer so um as I said we've done a lot

224
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:46,640
of these projects at this point we're

225
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:48,120
pretty good at making sure that we

226
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,920
enable you to have a constructive

227
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,320
dialogue and discussion with your

228
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,800
companies um so your best position to

229
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,399
support them that might be full-time on

230
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,519
site at the company that might be fully

231
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,320
remote uh we will position you to have

232
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:01,320
that discussion

233
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,519
um and of

234
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,399
course mid August the end of August you

235
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,160
will come back to campus and present

236
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:13,680
your work as part of the capson Showcase

237
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:16,320
and um what's pretty interesting is it

238
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,760
overlaps with orientation so the

239
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:22,720
incoming students get to see what the

240
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:25,560
final product looks like um and so you

241
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:28,519
get a sense of what uh where this where

242
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:30,680
this effort leads to um respect to

243
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:33,640
process Erica am I missing

244
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:35,880
anything no um but there did come in our

245
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:38,240
most popular question uh which is how

246
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:40,200
does the matching process work uh

247
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,839
everyone asks this multiple times

248
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,399
throughout throughout the admissions

249
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,000
process and once you're on campus so

250
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:47,360
happy to give a quick overview of that

251
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,279
um as Jordan mentioned we have an

252
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,480
algorithm um but that's not the whole

253
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:53,880
answer right so the thing that is

254
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:56,480
important for you to understand is that

255
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:59,320
it is mutually ranked uh and equally

256
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,680
weighted so when you meet all of the

257
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,800
companies and see all of the projects

258
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:05,639
you and your teammate will rank all of

259
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:09,440
them from one to presumably 40 depending

260
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:12,200
on how big our classes you will then get

261
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,959
match of 10 to 12 interviews from that

262
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,639
initial ranking so you will only

263
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:17,600
interview with 10 to 12 of those

264
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:19,800
projects after you complete those

265
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,240
interviews you will rank them again

266
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:24,560
right for your top 12 uh or for from 1

267
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,000
to 12 and then those companies that you

268
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:30,320
interviewed with will also rank you and

269
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,440
we then use those two data set that's um

270
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,240
to run a matching algorithm so the

271
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,920
companies do not have greater preference

272
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,760
you do not have greater preference

273
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,040
there's some Nuance in there that we

274
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:43,279
talk about in January once this process

275
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:45,440
is kind of in ongoing um but that's the

276
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:48,480
that's the C of it is that there you you

277
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,480
have a say and so does the

278
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:56,240
company and um and yes we're Al we're

279
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:59,639
often asked this question um I think the

280
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:02,440
key point on top of all this is Eric and

281
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:06,120
I our objective is

282
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:09,320
um is is synergy and

283
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:13,279
sustainability and thus we work very

284
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:15,320
hard to establish a transparent process

285
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:17,199
and one that gets the students excited

286
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,839
gets the companies excited ensures the

287
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:22,440
companies keep sponsoring into the

288
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:24,880
future and and and and hopefully guides

289
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,720
the companies to hire um and then

290
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,800
ultimately we want the alumni to come

291
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:32,079
back and sponsor so uh we recognize the

292
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:34,760
gravity of the match and we take it very

293
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:36,440
seriously um and we will spend a good

294
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:40,399
amount of time helping you understand

295
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:42,079
that this is a multifaceted um Evolution

296
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,240
with a lot of different

297
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:47,279
stakeholders absolutely uh we also have

298
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,920
another question here um if a company

299
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,639
requires students to be on site will

300
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:53,800
there be funding to help with temporary

301
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:55,440
location uh yes so the company pays a

302
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:58,240
fee in order to participate in the

303
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,399
Capstone projects um and that fee

304
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,320
largely comes back to you in various

305
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,040
ways one of those is with your summer

306
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,560
tuition but the other is through a

307
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:08,600
travel reimbursement um so every student

308
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,040
will get a baseline level of support

309
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:14,160
throughout the summer um but there's

310
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:16,760
also travel specific reimbursements that

311
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,839
we provide we have companies in the west

312
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:21,440
coast we have companies in Germany and

313
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:23,560
other places in Europe um so we do

314
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,000
understand that that is that is a factor

315
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:28,279
in terms of how we match and how excited

316
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,800
you are about the company itself um so

317
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:31,800
there is financial support

318
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:40,519
there and next page

319
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:43,199
Catherine thank you okay um topics uh

320
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:45,760
I'll briefly touch on these um I'm not

321
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:49,240
going to go into too much depth uh we

322
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:51,040
just published a article in MIT SL ideas

323
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,079
at matter Katherine if you would uh

324
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,680
please drop that on the

325
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:58,800
chat um I'm going to work through these

326
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,600
uh Accenture so this one was fascinating

327
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,040
um

328
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,600
we were still working on it actually but

329
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:06,839
the concept

330
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,880
was can the students and they did this

331
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:10,320
can they

332
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:12,880
enumerate which jobs in the global

333
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:16,720
Workforce will be impacted by generative

334
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:18,360
Ai and that product is the the the data

335
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,040
product they built is being used by

336
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:23,839
centure a global management consulting

337
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:25,399
firm to advise and guide their

338
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,680
clients

339
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:30,120
um the sigma case this was pretty

340
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:33,720
interesting

341
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:35,240
um we were able to identify prescription

342
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,920
routines of

343
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:41,480
physicians in treating depression and

344
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:45,320
the students were able to essentially

345
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:47,880
enumerate or quantify the an observation

346
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:52,480
that Physicians tended to

347
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:54,600
use the prescription option that was

348
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,240
best for the general population but was

349
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,160
suboptimal for the

350
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,639
individual and so they did a a great job

351
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:03,440
getting the data in place presenting the

352
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:05,120
the problem statement in a way that

353
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,480
clinicians could understand it and then

354
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,399
creating an algorithm that would uh lead

355
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,480
to a personalized recommendation as

356
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:14,440
opposed to a generalized population

357
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:16,800
level recommendation dig Sporting Goods

358
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:19,360
um this is one of my favorites of the

359
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,040
year um just because but whereas the

360
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,639
signal signal use case that I just

361
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:26,600
talked about with um uh prescription of

362
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:29,040
of depression products it requires a

363
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:31,880
very high level of um accuracy for for

364
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:34,000
obvious reason Dick Sporting Goods uh

365
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:36,560
sought to use generative AI to send

366
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,079
custom emails where the stakes are a lot

367
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,079
lower and so you can have a higher error

368
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:42,079
rate Dick Sporting Goods they refer to

369
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,959
their customers as athletes and they

370
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:47,519
want to generate um uh you know the

371
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:51,480
specific email to the athlete

372
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:53,440
so uh Erica is a runner um and so

373
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:56,360
ideally you would send a promotional

374
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,319
email to Eric on running I I don't run I

375
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:01,880
I'm allergic to it um I do other things

376
00:15:58,319 --> 00:16:04,519
like watch sports and so I um I want to

377
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:07,480
get the emails about uh about being a

378
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:10,759
college football fan

379
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:12,839
um thermal Fisher Scientific uh was

380
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:14,120
pretty interesting uh the students were

381
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:15,920
supporting something called the sales

382
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:19,240
and operation planning

383
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:21,880
process um which is pretty routine

384
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:24,600
however the students were able to apply

385
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:26,560
uh novel analytics methods in the

386
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:29,319
thermofisher scientific environment so

387
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,959
they actually got like a a 2x4 for

388
00:16:29,319 --> 00:16:33,639
improvement on their on their

389
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:37,639
predictions from six month forward and

390
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:40,199
then um UNICEF is a United Nations

391
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:42,519
entity and their focuses on how to

392
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:45,040
allocate scarce resources specifically

393
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:47,800
vaccines in the in West and central

394
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,279
Africa and the students um problem

395
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,560
statement was pretty fascinating and

396
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:53,560
that they were operating with very

397
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:55,639
sparse data um and so they to get very

398
00:16:53,560 --> 00:17:00,120
clever in their their techniques and

399
00:16:55,639 --> 00:17:01,680
methods to help guide um well it's

400
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:04,400
ultimately a political process the

401
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,480
allocation of vaccines um in in a

402
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:10,360
limited environment a date

403
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,360
environment uh Katherine go ahead

404
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:20,439
please so um every year uh we

405
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:22,039
select around 10 projects to present at

406
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:23,319
our Capstone showcase so the Capstone

407
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:26,520
showcase as I mentioned the end of

408
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:28,240
August you'll do a poster session and

409
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:31,240
we'll have about 10 teams actually

410
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:33,120
present um we have a global feed so your

411
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:36,760
parents can dial in or your friends

412
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:39,880
which is always a lot of fun um and this

413
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:43,200
year we elected to have two winners one

414
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:46,799
was from a startup called cognit and one

415
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:49,799
um is a product in support of wiser

416
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:54,840
fizer at fizer the pharmaceutical

417
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:57,280
company cognit um is in the business of

418
00:17:54,840 --> 00:18:00,000
simplifying business operations and

419
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:03,080
processes for insurance companies

420
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,440
and the team leveraged generative AI

421
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:08,159
to uh

422
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:13,640
read PDFs free form

423
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:15,919
PDFs um thus uh just enabling cognit

424
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,880
startup to be a lot more efficient and

425
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,919
faster in their support of their

426
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:23,960
insurance company

427
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:25,720
clients and then fizer um is one of

428
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:29,360
these companies where we have the Congo

429
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:31,600
line going so uh we f has been hiring

430
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:36,919
for years and the student

431
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:42,640
team um were able to uh leverage

432
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:45,960
generative AI to um analyze uh how

433
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:48,799
scientists within fiser do their analyze

434
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:51,200
what scientists are doing at fiser and

435
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:54,840
support them to communicate better to

436
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,799
get their drugs to Market faster um so

437
00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:02,760
both these projects were selected

438
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:05,720
because uh one they are using or did use

439
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:08,480
fairly novel and new methods but both

440
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:11,240
had almost immedate impact in in their

441
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,679
um company environments which we thought

442
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,679
was pretty

443
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:17,520
impressive Katherine if you want to go

444
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:23,760
ahead um so we have a couple frequently

445
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:27,120
asked questions how to cstone teams get

446
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,360
chosen I I briefly mentioned that um

447
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,559
you're going to choose your partner in

448
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,200
December

449
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:35,679
and by then you will you will know the

450
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,760
cohort um and then we in January as as

451
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:40,720
we said there's

452
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:43,159
a uh fun process that starts with pitch

453
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,799
starts with your preparation has a pitch

454
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:47,559
day has you H we'll have you doing a

455
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:50,280
number of interviews and then we'll have

456
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:52,080
the match um Erica touched on the

457
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:54,760
matching process we can come back to it

458
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,880
if there are following questions um to

459
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:58,919
Capone companies hire us uh our numbers

460
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,440
are about 25 to 30% of our stud students

461
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:02,760
go to Capstone

462
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:05,200
companies um that

463
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:07,280
number uh we'll see how it fluctuates

464
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:11,559
but it it's a number that we We Stand By

465
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:14,000
and are pretty proud of um and then can

466
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:16,480
we suggest a company for capson

467
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,520
absolutely if you know anybody who would

468
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:22,480
consider sponsoring uh by all

469
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:25,440
means send Erica or I an email and we

470
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,000
will take it from there um Erica do we

471
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,600
have any other questions in the in the

472
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,240
chat you um so here's one that's asks

473
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,440
what are the most used tools when

474
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:37,400
working with the companies for the

475
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:40,559
project uh python Excel Etc um the

476
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:43,440
answer is yes all of them uh and when I

477
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:45,159
say that I'm I'm mostly saying that you

478
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,240
will you will know how to use what the

479
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:49,919
company wants you to use um so they may

480
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,240
be working in R they may be working in

481
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,919
Python um certainly you will be using

482
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:57,120
Excel in some capacity um there will be

483
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:59,200
some data visualization you will be

484
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,480
working in various forms of class

485
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,919
because they are largely not going to

486
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:06,720
let you download their data uh straight

487
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:08,600
to your laptop so you will adapt to

488
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,159
whatever they are using you will be

489
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:14,360
equipped to do that by the time January

490
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:18,600
rolls around um and Jordan feel free to

491
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:22,000
add anything yeah um so it's a great

492
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:24,600
question um my my top level answer is

493
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,039
that uh you know to Echo ER you're going

494
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,159
to do what the company needs you to do

495
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:29,080
and you're going to be in the tool set

496
00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:30,440
they want you to that's said you're

497
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:34,679
going to have plenty of time to get

498
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:36,159
ramped up and so like first order thing

499
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:37,360
for me is always the problem statement

500
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,640
what are you working on why are you

501
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,520
working on it um Eric and I'll make sure

502
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,960
you have that preliminary answer but

503
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,159
once you get match it's going to be on

504
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,360
you to really spend time on the problem

505
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:49,200
statement that's baked into the

506
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,360
curriculum then you're going to need

507
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,960
credentials so the companies might send

508
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:57,880
you a laptop or they might give you

509
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:59,080
Cloud access um and we'll there's time

510
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,600
for that

511
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:03,360
and then you're going to start

512
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:05,440
visualizing their data and in our first

513
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,960
our second milestone I just I just want

514
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,400
to hear or understand that you can

515
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:12,679
interpret their data appropriately and

516
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:16,679
so I don't really need use of tools

517
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:18,760
until like April or May uh because we

518
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:21,720
have a lot of time up front and it it's

519
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:23,679
I I love the process I I didn't I did

520
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:26,600
not create it I inherited it and I think

521
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:29,080
it's wonderful nice long slow Runway

522
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:32,600
before you really have to take off

523
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:36,080
um and that said I track where each team

524
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:38,120
is every week and if your credentials or

525
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,720
access doesn't come through I I'm there

526
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:41,279
to work through that with you and your

527
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,880
company to make sure you get back up to

528
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:46,480
speed so um things are deliberate and

529
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:47,760
slow up front and then once you actually

530
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,640
will have a requirement to start

531
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:52,279
leveraging a tool set which you will um

532
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,080
you will know that and you will have the

533
00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:58,279
time to uh to learn it and be

534
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:59,919
ready great thank you uh next question

535
00:22:58,279 --> 00:23:01,480
is do we have access to mock or sample

536
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:03,799
interviews between student companies

537
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:06,360
during the matching period um you will

538
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:09,320
have a lot of practice interviewing uh

539
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:11,200
there will not be specific examples of

540
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:13,279
what the companies ask you because all

541
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,240
companies conduct these in their own

542
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:19,320
sort of unique ways um but our Career

543
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:22,039
Team uh through the career office does a

544
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:24,120
really thorough job of preparing you to

545
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:26,760
answer the types of questions that most

546
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:29,360
of the companies are asking and we spend

547
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:31,640
a great deal of time in January but even

548
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,200
prior um making sure that you have

549
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,600
plenty of practice and plenty of

550
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,120
practice interviewing as a team because

551
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:39,520
that's a a unique experience for for

552
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,520
most of the

553
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:45,760
student uh the next question and you're

554
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,520
gonna probably do 10 interviews and so

555
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:50,799
the first one is going to be

556
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:53,320
stressful and the 10th one is going to

557
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:56,120
be less stressful every interview in

558
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:58,200
between uh you start to learn so this is

559
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:00,240
one of the features of the program uh

560
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:03,320
that I also think is just excellent in

561
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:06,000
that this is a uh I don't want to say

562
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:08,799
Force but it it's it's a milestone in

563
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,600
which you execute the process of

564
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:14,039
interviewing it you do it with a partner

565
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,559
you get feedback and it's it's not in

566
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:17,480
the live environment that you're going

567
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:20,720
to face in the summertime when it's time

568
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,720
to go get a real job

569
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:27,000
postgraduation uh next question is what

570
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,880
kind of deliverables will be asked of us

571
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,240
to submit internally for the sake of the

572
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,000
class or is material primarily going to

573
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:35,600
be shared through continuous update

574
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:39,240
meetings with faculty and you

575
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:41,480
Jordan so we have five great question um

576
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:45,360
we'll cover it in depth but we have five

577
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:47,120
Milestones that are standard um the the

578
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,919
first Milestone is Administrative nature

579
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:52,039
it's a project Charter just to make sure

580
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,640
that you and the company have a very

581
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:56,000
clear understanding what it is you'll be

582
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:59,559
doing uh it's not set in stone but it's

583
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:03,000
a good marker second m is exploratory

584
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:05,120
data analysis the third Milestone is um

585
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,320
is before you go off for the summer

586
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:09,360
where it's my ability to make sure that

587
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:11,320
you have a good plan the fourth

588
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:14,960
Milestone is a

589
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:16,399
um uh kind of dry run of your mil your

590
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,520
Capstone showcase and then your fifth

591
00:25:16,399 --> 00:25:19,880
Milestone is the Capstone showcase there

592
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,919
are a couple deliverables with the

593
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:24,200
Capstone

594
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:25,880
showcase uh one is company specific and

595
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:28,399
that's like a 30-page report due to the

596
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:30,520
company we'll have company confident

597
00:25:28,399 --> 00:25:33,120
confidential data nobody sees that

598
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:34,520
except for me and a faculty member and

599
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,840
then you'll have a

600
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:39,760
poster um and a presentation that will

601
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:43,240
have to be reviewed by your company will

602
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:45,679
be released into the public domain um so

603
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:47,600
I I try to be as hands off as possible

604
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:50,080
and let you do your thing with your

605
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,520
companies um but I do need I do need to

606
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,240
build a track progress so I have these

607
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,600
five milestones in place so I can make

608
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,279
sure that everybody's moving at the

609
00:25:54,600 --> 00:26:00,240
right

610
00:25:56,279 --> 00:26:00,240
pace thank you Jordan

611
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,720
uh let's see so do students come up with

612
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:06,520
the Capstone project topics if we do

613
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,480
does it go through an approval process

614
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:11,919
um so no you don't um the companies

615
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:13,880
themselves will bring us a use case um

616
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:16,080
and in some cases you know will work

617
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:18,240
with us pretty closely to come up with

618
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:21,159
their use case uh particularly if

619
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,360
they're new to the process um they will

620
00:26:21,159 --> 00:26:25,840
kind of work extensively with us upfront

621
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,720
to make sure that their project proposal

622
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:30,440
makes sense for the type of analytics we

623
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:32,799
want the students to be doing um as well

624
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:34,480
as things that are attainable for a

625
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,720
student cohort within the seven-month

626
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,880
engagement of the project um so no you

627
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:42,919
never are the one coming up with the

628
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:45,000
Capstone topic itself um that said

629
00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:48,120
projects will be influenced by you

630
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,640
throughout the course of it so what the

631
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:52,799
company comes to us in January and

632
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,080
proposes may end up looking very

633
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:57,919
different by the time you present it in

634
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:59,919
August uh and that's normal and we like

635
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:02,000
that and that is an expected part of

636
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,720
doing business and so there was a sort

637
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,480
of secondary question that's related

638
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:07,159
which is have there been any cases where

639
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:09,880
a student or company switches projects

640
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:11,960
Midway through um we're never going to

641
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:15,000
switch teams Midway through but you

642
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:17,440
might find that the project has pivoted

643
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,919
based on the availability of the data

644
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,120
Maybe the question you thought you were

645
00:27:18,919 --> 00:27:23,520
going to be able to answer turns into a

646
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:25,159
different question um maybe the

647
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,960
priorities of the company have changed

648
00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:30,399
and they are pivoting to a slightly

649
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:33,640
different topic all of those things are

650
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:35,039
stressful potentially but perfectly okay

651
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:37,440
um and that is one of the reasons Jordan

652
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:39,840
and I are here to make sure that those

653
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:42,559
projects still end up being

654
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,519
successful um so that's that's kind of

655
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:46,919
the the large answer to that obviously

656
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:48,440
there are you know different things that

657
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:51,600
happen every year that we deal with as

658
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:53,320
they come um but we do expect that that

659
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,200
the question that a company comes with

660
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:58,600
may not be the answer that they end up

661
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,600
with at the end

662
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:06,279
um let's see here oh there's a lot of

663
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,840
questions coming through okay what

664
00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:10,360
programming language do we need to

665
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:12,000
master in the mband um most of our

666
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:14,720
students are coming in with some

667
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,559
experience in coding um regardless of

668
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,519
language we're actually fairly agnostic

669
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:21,279
to it you will learn Julia while you are

670
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:23,600
here um you are going to be expected to

671
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:26,880
be able to be competent in SQL and

672
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,880
python andr

673
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:35,440
uh right couple questions left um is the

674
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:36,799
interview conducted as a team or alone

675
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,200
and is the ranking selection for the

676
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:40,159
companies done done as a team or

677
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:42,480
individually everything is done as a

678
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:44,880
team um for the purposes of the Capstone

679
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:48,159
project so you will you will get to know

680
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,760
your cohort really well um in the fall

681
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,080
and you will do some Project based work

682
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,519
with them so you should have a good

683
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:55,880
sense of who you work well with and that

684
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:58,159
will influence who you decide to team up

685
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:00,240
with um your interviews are conducted as

686
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:02,440
a team your matching is done as a team

687
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:05,039
so you are a package deal as far as the

688
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,039
companies are

689
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,440
concerned uh and then our final question

690
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,919
in the chat right now is when companies

691
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:16,399
propose Capstone topics how many topics

692
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:19,080
does each company typically provide this

693
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:21,440
varies um the vast majority of them

694
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:24,360
simply propose a single project and and

695
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,919
host a single project um we have some

696
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:28,600
relationships with companies that are

697
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:30,919
hosting more than one project and we

698
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:33,519
have some very select companies that we

699
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:35,480
trust really because of a long-standing

700
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:37,919
relationship that will propose any

701
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:40,519
number of topics and either let Jordan

702
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:42,320
and I choose the best one or propose a

703
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:44,320
couple of topics to the students and let

704
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:47,080
them choose the best one or or the one

705
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:49,399
that they're most interested in so it it

706
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:51,640
varies but the vast majority of

707
00:29:49,399 --> 00:29:53,480
companies are proposing a single topic

708
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:57,720
that we then refine with them to make

709
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:57,720
sure it's appropriate for our student

710
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:02,440
uh just to confirm on the language

711
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,640
question is this a prerequisite for the

712
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:07,159
program or can it be learned during the

713
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:09,840
fall period um to be perfectly Frank if

714
00:30:07,159 --> 00:30:12,360
you don't have a any coding experience

715
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:15,519
you may not be a competitive candidate

716
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:19,279
we have about 1,800 applications every

717
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:21,159
year and we seed a class of 80 um every

718
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:23,760
single one of those 80 students had at

719
00:30:21,159 --> 00:30:25,760
least some programming experience before

720
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,760
they came here um that doesn't mean you

721
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:31,279
have to be fluent in any of them we care

722
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,840
a lot more about your hard math so your

723
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:36,080
linear algebra your

724
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:39,039
statistics um but we would expect you to

725
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:41,679
have at least dabbled uh in in learning

726
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:43,880
at least one coding language before you

727
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,880
get

728
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:50,000
here and those are the open questions

729
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:50,000
that I

730
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:57,000
have and I will just add on for folks we

731
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:59,039
will have a application overview and

732
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,600
tips for the business analytics program

733
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:03,480
on November 25th that also will be

734
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:06,480
recorded for those who can attend live

735
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:08,279
so um we'll go into more in depth those

736
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,240
questions are on coding and letters of

737
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:13,360
recommendation at that time but

738
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:15,279
definitely um we have a few more minutes

739
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:17,080
about 10 more minutes so take advantage

740
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:21,519
of having Jordan and Erica here please

741
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:21,519
do uh put your questions in the chat or

742
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:29,080
Q&A I can I can talk

743
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:34,519
um

744
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:37,320
so chat GPT um unveiled itself to the

745
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:41,679
world in what December of

746
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:44,240
202 um so for the 23 cycle we had two

747
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:45,919
companies do generative AI use cases

748
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,320
which was which is pretty interesting

749
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:49,000
because you know they turn around quick

750
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,799
if that gives you a sense of speed so

751
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,080
right December of

752
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:57,440
22 um am I am I thinking properly or

753
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:59,240
maybe maybe was end of fall of 22 but in

754
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,919
a couple months we had two companies

755
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:03,880
that said okay let's do generative AI

756
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:06,279
use cases they did they were

757
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:10,840
successful last December then we were

758
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:14,600
looking at the slate and we had 10 of 40

759
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:18,519
um and that felt high but those tended

760
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:21,039
quite well um which uh Captain dropped

761
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:24,159
that article and you can see a quick

762
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:26,760
synthesis um so we'll see we'll see how

763
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:29,519
fast the technology is changing I still

764
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:32,600
I think that the majority of Scopes next

765
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:35,159
year um that so January so in a couple

766
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:37,320
months January of 25 I still think are

767
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:40,279
going to be the traditional data science

768
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:42,360
pipeline use cases I would imagine for

769
00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:46,799
your class we're going to be majority

770
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:48,480
generative AI um but it's all TVD um and

771
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:51,240
I say this one to just give you a kind

772
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:53,679
of pulse check of how the world's moving

773
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:57,399
um but also to emphasize the point that

774
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:59,440
we will we will stay agile and adaptable

775
00:32:57,399 --> 00:33:02,039
to the need needs of our host companies

776
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:04,639
and if they have a desire to experiment

777
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:07,480
with generative AI we'll do it on the

778
00:33:04,639 --> 00:33:09,679
condition we understand the influence to

779
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:12,880
the business and the the profit and loss

780
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:12,880
statements and their in their key

781
00:33:17,639 --> 00:33:22,760
financials right we have a couple let's

782
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:28,360
see all right how does matching work um

783
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:30,840
so we talked on this a little bit it's

784
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:33,320
mutual uh so the companies rank the

785
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:35,919
teams the teams rank the companies there

786
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:37,000
are two rounds of that one pre-interview

787
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:40,440
one post

788
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:43,000
interview um and both sides are equally

789
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:45,600
weighted so we run an algorithm to match

790
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,799
you that does not give you preference

791
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,519
but also does not give the company

792
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:50,559
preference so it's it's pretty evenly

793
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:52,799
weighted we've had good luck with it um

794
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:54,799
generally speaking both companies and

795
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:57,320
student teams are overall happy with

796
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:59,679
their match um we don't guarantee

797
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:01,600
anything to either you or the companies

798
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:03,559
so anyone you interview with is fair

799
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:06,200
game you might get matched with them we

800
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:07,519
expect that you'll be fine with it um

801
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:10,000
and we expect that even if you're not

802
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:11,280
fine with it you will adapt and become

803
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,599
fine with it because some of those

804
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,119
projects end up being the best

805
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:20,040
projects

806
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:21,919
um so that's how that works let's see uh

807
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:25,520
what were markers that have shown up in

808
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:29,520
very successful Capstone projects

809
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,520
Jordan um

810
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:35,879
yeah um good question it's it's whether

811
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:37,760
an executive like really cares usually

812
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:40,599
that that's my answer it's it's whether

813
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:43,359
or not we'll get the business unit

814
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:46,359
president focus on on what's going to

815
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:48,960
happen um it takes a lot to get there

816
00:34:46,359 --> 00:34:51,200
and that's usually with our repeat uh

817
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,839
caps on house

818
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:55,399
um

819
00:34:52,839 --> 00:34:57,079
alternatively robust and available data

820
00:34:55,399 --> 00:34:59,880
is also prerequisite to a very

821
00:34:57,079 --> 00:35:01,280
successful Pro and that's something we

822
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:03,800
work on to make sure that's the type of

823
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,800
data you

824
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:09,560
get thank you uh what has been the most

825
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:10,839
exciting memorable project you've seen

826
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:13,640
so

827
00:35:10,839 --> 00:35:16,520
far there's a lot

828
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:18,800
um I think the ones for me it's the ones

829
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:20,800
that get implemented really quickly

830
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:24,960
right so that fiser project we did this

831
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:27,040
year the BMW project um about defect

832
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,839
detection they that where they're

833
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,839
transferring the code and it's getting

834
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:32,560
implemented right away as part of the

835
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:35,440
business strategy for me those are

836
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:37,240
always the most exciting um there's

837
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,880
always really interesting analytical

838
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:42,480
work to do um but because we're an

839
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:44,160
applied program I think for me it's the

840
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,520
ones where the compan is so excited

841
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,599
about the work that the students did

842
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:51,319
that they're like going back to to their

843
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:52,960
decision makers and and getting it done

844
00:35:51,319 --> 00:35:54,319
um and there's there's there's honestly

845
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:57,560
no shortage of those which I think is

846
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:57,560
really cool

847
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:04,520
uh roadblocks that students run into um

848
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,200
so Jordan mentioned that some of the

849
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:08,720
best projects are the ones with readily

850
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:11,400
available data uh roadblocks would be

851
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:13,440
something where getting data is

852
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:15,359
challenging for one reason or another

853
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,000
right either that's jumping through

854
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:19,920
administrative Hoops to get it and you

855
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
get it really late or the data that the

856
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,280
company thought was going to be

857
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:27,079
available simply isn't uh there was a

858
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:28,920
memorable project where the company was

859
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:31,119
prepared to get give data to the

860
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:33,000
students they had a different data

861
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:34,920
breach and got very skittish about

862
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,520
sharing anything and so the whole

863
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,599
project had to Pivot and it still ended

864
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,920
up being successful but that was

865
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:42,480
certainly a road

866
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:45,040
blook um others I think would be you

867
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:47,520
know a Mis mismatch set of

868
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:49,839
expectations uh of what the students

869
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:53,079
deliver at various points um but those

870
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:54,440
are things that are very common and we

871
00:36:53,079 --> 00:36:57,079
work through fairly

872
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:59,480
quickly um I think data availability is

873
00:36:57,079 --> 00:37:01,680
probably the biggest frustration for

874
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:03,359
students um particularly early on when

875
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:05,839
they kind of expect to just kind of be

876
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:07,560
handed data sets as they've been in the

877
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:08,960
fall right in the fall you're doing a

878
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:11,839
lot of cour work you're getting handed

879
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:15,000
very clean data sets um and that's not

880
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:15,000
going to be the case in the

881
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:22,440
spring

882
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:25,480
roadblocks um you know we've had some

883
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:27,119
kind of regulatory problem statements so

884
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:29,839
uh we're try to analyze like the effect

885
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:33,079
of third party cookies going away that

886
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:35,040
one got a little complex um but

887
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:36,800
generally speaking these projects we

888
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:39,640
have a good process and we have a good

889
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:41,240
flow and sometimes in the spring we'll

890
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:43,200
have a couple teams that aren't moving

891
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:46,119
as fast as the rest of the cohort

892
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:49,000
because of uh administrative issues and

893
00:37:46,119 --> 00:37:50,560
the students can get very concerned uh I

894
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,920
try to make sure I spend time with those

895
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,480
teams and help them understand we'll

896
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,920
work through it um but sometimes

897
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:59,880
administrative things hold up the

898
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:01,800
project and part of that's part of life

899
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:05,480
uh and thus you know learning how to

900
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:08,000
adapt and kind of go the flow um and not

901
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:10,079
getting not emotionally reacting so you

902
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,760
know being so concerned is part of it

903
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,920
but that that's that's why that's why

904
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:16,240
we're here that's why Eric and I are

905
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:18,640
here to support you through this

906
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,960
yeah uh can we share any information

907
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:23,680
about the list of companies for the

908
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:26,560
class of 25 or 26 uh no but thank you

909
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:28,240
for asking uh do we see any difficulties

910
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,400
in securing spons because of the

911
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:32,119
academic downturns in recent years uh

912
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:35,079
we've already we've already kind of gone

913
00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:38,400
through this in the sense of Co really

914
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:40,440
did a number on companies abilities to

915
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:43,480
engage in the type of way that they

916
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:46,920
engage with us um so we've weathered a

917
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:49,040
number of economic downturns already um

918
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:51,200
and we have strategies for making sure

919
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:54,680
that we still come to you with a slate

920
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:57,280
of really excellent projects um so yes

921
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:58,839
it's it's part of our job to anticipate

922
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,960
those those difficulties and to figure

923
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:02,280
out how to Pivot around them um but

924
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,839
certainly there's always there are

925
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:06,800
always challenges some of it's not

926
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:10,359
economic some of it has has to do with

927
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:12,640
with other things um but we have never

928
00:39:10,359 --> 00:39:14,560
failed to deliver a really great set of

929
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,720
Capstone projects uh and there's no

930
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:19,160
reason for us to think that 25 or 26

931
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,160
will be any

932
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:25,680
different um we have maybe a minute or

933
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:29,359
two Katherine is there a way to identify

934
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,359
like the last question

935
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,720
yeah I can start typing some answers to

936
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,079
some of these yes I know we are now

937
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:39,200
getting a bunch in here

938
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:41,480
um from experience maybe this is a good

939
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:46,000
one to end us with what teams were able

940
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:46,000
to Excel and overperform in their

941
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:55,160
projects

942
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:57,880
the the the ones who know how to walk

943
00:39:55,160 --> 00:40:00,119
and chew gum at the same time um we are

944
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:02,520
we are the applied business analytics

945
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:04,160
program uh there's got to be focus on

946
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:06,560
the business and stakeholder management

947
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:09,119
and understanding what the purpose is

948
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:13,640
and the why and then we're searching for

949
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:15,880
a distinctive analysis of data sets um

950
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:18,359
it's easy to go to business and kind of

951
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:19,839
keep things basic it's easy to go super

952
00:40:18,359 --> 00:40:22,280
technical and forget about the business

953
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:23,800
so the uh the ability to walk the line

954
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:26,200
is what uh what we're all about on this

955
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,200
program
