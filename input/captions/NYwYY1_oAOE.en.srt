1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:06,560
so now let's talk about autoimmune

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,960
disease in our gut so inflammatory bowel

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,240
disease is an autoimmune disease and the

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,040
most common type of inflammatory bowel

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:16,600
disease or IBD is ulcerative colitis

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,439
ulcerative colitis occurs in the colon

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,000
which is part of your large intestine

8
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:21,920
the Colon's the longest part of the

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,640
large intestine and it's important for

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,800
absorbing water uh certain nutrients and

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,080
electrolytes and it's also where most of

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,759
the bacteria in our bodies live

13
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,879
so during ulcerative colitis there's

14
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,559
inflammation in the colon and the

15
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:40,000
symptoms of this would be things like

16
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:42,640
abdominal pain diarrhea and weight loss

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
on the lower right here we're seeing a

18
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,879
colonoscopy where a doctor can take a

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,680
tube with a camera and put it into the

20
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,360
colon and on the left we're seeing

21
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,680
healthy colon and on the right we're

22
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:55,320
seeing inflamed it looks red and kind of

23
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,920
unhappy and so ulcer of colitis is

24
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,280
really characterized by chronic

25
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,840
inflammation in combination uh withy of

26
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,040
flareups where there's more acute

27
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:08,320
inflammation and very noticeably bad

28
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,360
symptoms so uh how is aler of cly is

29
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,320
currently treated well uh certain

30
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,439
treatments are steroids which generally

31
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,119
suppress your immune system there are

32
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:19,040
also biologics which are molecules that

33
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,640
can Target specific parts of the

34
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,439
inflammatory Pathways and finally in

35
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,840
really bad situations there's the

36
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,680
colectomy where either part or the

37
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,640
entire colon is removed from the

38
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,880
ulcerative colitis patient so before we

39
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,040
had these treatments uh the mortality

40
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,479
rate for ulcer of cidus was very high it

41
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,880
was up to 60% so this is a really

42
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:42,960
terrible chronic

43
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:45,439
disease so how does ulcerative colitis

44
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,320
arise so here we're looking at a cartoon

45
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:50,320
of your colon and the colon at its uh

46
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,600
innermost part has a single cell

47
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,680
epithelial cell barrier and this

48
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:58,119
separates microbes that live in our

49
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:00,560
colon from us and when this barrier

50
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:02,520
breaks down due to damage the microbes

51
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,399
can start to get into the epithelial

52
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,680
layer and penetrate in there and when

53
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,840
these microbes get into the epithelial

54
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,840
layer uh this triggers an immune

55
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,080
response so some of the first immune

56
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,239
cells to arrive are neutrophils which

57
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,959
are trying to essentially remove the

58
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,000
bacteria and kill them and when the

59
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:22,200
neutrophils arrive they bring along a

60
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,720
lot of other friends other immune cells

61
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,680
and this triggers a lot of inflammation

62
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,400
and as you're trying to get rid of these

63
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,160
microbes or these bacteria that have

64
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,280
gone into the colon uh this is also

65
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,000
leading to damage of the colon tissue

66
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,360
itself and that's where you start to get

67
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,599
these symptoms like diarrhea and pain

68
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:43,120
and so forth and this uh inflammation is

69
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:45,200
chronic so it can continue for years and

70
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:49,400
even decades and it requires careful

71
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,400
treatment by a gastroenterologist
