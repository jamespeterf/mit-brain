[Music]

2
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:06,029
being part of the MIT Space Systems

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,830
laboratory provides incredible

4
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:09,570
opportunities I don't think there's very

5
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,639
many places that you can actually work

6
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,650
to send your algorithms and control

7
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:15,000
schemes to space to test to be able to

8
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:17,570
interact with International Space

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,090
Station it's a remarkable opportunities

10
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:22,650
Space Systems it encompasses any field

11
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,199
of science or engineering that you can

12
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:27,539
think of we work with computers with

13
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,390
mechanics with thermal engineering

14
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:32,820
propulsion we specialize but we can't

15
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,160
ignore or leave out any of the

16
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,200
subsystems you always have something new

17
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,610
you didn't challenging to work on even

18
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,840
if you've done something once but the

19
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,670
next time you do it it's a it's a little

20
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,649
bit different and the environment in

21
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:46,410
space is not one that's really I mean

22
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:48,059
easy to work with so there's always new

23
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,140
problems to solve and I think that's

24
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:51,180
what you know I love about it the most

25
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,920
the Department of aeronautics and

26
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,170
Astronautics at MIT is in the School of

27
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,109
Engineering and here we really cover two

28
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:01,620
bases one is airplanes Aeronautics as

29
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:03,629
well as spacecraft so what I like to

30
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:06,570
think of is we're engineering but we

31
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:08,040
defy gravity you can work with the

32
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,689
International Space Station you can

33
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,939
build and fly your own UAVs you work

34
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:13,740
with astronauts they really come out of

35
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:15,930
their education now with a full

36
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,689
experience of impacting the aerospace

37
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:19,619
field the MIT space laboratory is in the

38
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:21,810
Department of aeronautics and

39
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:25,530
Astronautics and we really focus on the

40
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:27,869
space side we are the expert laboratory

41
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:30,299
in systems engineering putting all these

42
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:32,130
complex systems together and teaching

43
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:35,040
students what that means and how to make

44
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:37,259
them work ultimately in space we give

45
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,000
students here the opportunity to be

46
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:40,140
hands-on in the hardware to the

47
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,180
breakfast project where they're gonna

48
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,340
send out hardware to an asteroid through

49
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,570
space for two-and-a-half years to Speers

50
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,970
where they're gonna send their hardware

51
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:49,920
up on station these students are getting

52
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:52,380
to work with the leaders in the

53
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,750
aerospace industry on real hardware say

54
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,640
the art technology with education is

55
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,590
something we really need to marry and we

56
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,560
do that to our capstone class where

57
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:03,600
students get to design new technology

58
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,530
that surprisingly actually we've been

59
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,229
able to fly in orbit on station and

60
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:12,230
to interplanetary missions we started

61
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:13,819
this concept at a time truly innovative

62
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:18,200
the first ones to ever do it

63
00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:21,530
cdio conceived design implement operate

64
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:23,660
we began that in 1999 since then we've

65
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:25,670
done the class about ten times and at

66
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:27,890
least four of them have gone to space

67
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:30,920
you get to experience what it's really

68
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:32,120
like on a real high profile NASA mission

69
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,580
you have to meet all those requirements

70
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,920
that the other instruments have to meet

71
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:38,480
and so that whole experience is really

72
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,670
invaluable in teaching you what real

73
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,950
aerospace engineering is like my

74
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:44,780
involvement with the projects that we

75
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:47,239
have here at the SSL goes all the way

76
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:49,850
from hard work level actually crimping

77
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:52,250
cables screwing on satellite parts all

78
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:53,840
the way up to writing code for it

79
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:56,780
from the start I've been working with

80
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,120
developing algorithms that we can test

81
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:00,860
our architecture in space we interact

82
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,110
with the astronauts live over video feed

83
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:05,630
and they unpackage our software load

84
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:06,860
into the system and run our tests being

85
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:08,180
able to be a part of what is the whole

86
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,470
picture gonna look like how are we going

87
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,120
to develop the architecture meet

88
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:13,070
requirements and I think these are

89
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,600
really important skills I need to be

90
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:19,489
developed and I think I can take into my

91
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:22,220
future career we as a lab have three

92
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:24,530
main focus areas on the one side we work

93
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:27,140
with computer models of how to develop

94
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:29,030
space mission then we do a lot of ground

95
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:31,790
test best we build things in the ground

96
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:34,010
that we test in the laboratory a proof

97
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:36,019
of concept can they work the third step

98
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:38,090
is things that go to space for example

99
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:40,190
our sphere satellites that are aboard

100
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:43,549
International Space Station what spheres

101
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:45,410
is is it is a testament MIT decided to

102
00:03:43,549 --> 00:03:48,230
use the space station not to test a

103
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:50,030
complete mission but to create a testing

104
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:52,180
environment to do microgravity research

105
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:55,390
in space

106
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:58,299
mit has operated over ninety test

107
00:03:55,390 --> 00:04:00,819
sessions doing research that goes from

108
00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:02,230
what we call formation flight having

109
00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:04,150
satellites moved together in a

110
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:05,500
coordinated fashion making two

111
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:07,959
satellites talk to each other

112
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:10,150
autonomously doing things like tether

113
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:11,890
formation when there's a string between

114
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:15,970
a satellites and they're flying together

115
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:18,430
keeping that tether under tension the

116
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:21,549
streets program began at the MIT

117
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:24,539
statistics laboratory as a class in 1999

118
00:04:21,549 --> 00:04:29,440
in 2006 it got up to the space station

119
00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:32,770
in 2010 NASA and the DoD made the

120
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:35,800
spheres part of the ISS National

121
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:40,150
Laboratory making it truly a facility

122
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:41,289
for everybody began MIT access is an

123
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:44,020
x-ray instrument that's on the

124
00:04:41,289 --> 00:04:46,240
osiris-rex spacecraft the Cyrus Rex

125
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:49,180
spacecraft is going to explore this

126
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,770
asteroid Bennu nASA has put a little bit

127
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,599
of money aside and said let's see if

128
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:54,699
universities can come up with a good

129
00:04:52,599 --> 00:04:56,260
instrument idea and we started

130
00:04:54,699 --> 00:05:00,639
developing the rexes instrument back in

131
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:03,280
2012 breakfast is going to look at the

132
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,349
asteroid in the x-ray regime and tell us

133
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,080
what the asteroid is made out of so does

134
00:05:05,349 --> 00:05:09,970
it have iron sulfur or magnesium in the

135
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,310
regolith which is the dirt that's on the

136
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:13,720
outside of the asteroid I start on a

137
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:16,210
rexis when rexis was part of the

138
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,520
undergrad capstone class and really the

139
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:20,199
experience that I got in that class was

140
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:23,770
so exciting that I decided to continue

141
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:26,199
on on rexis Rothman masters and now my

142
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:28,180
PhD work on the rexes project students

143
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:29,919
did everything we designed rexis we

144
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:31,840
designed a test program we implemented a

145
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,940
test program we physically built the

146
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,949
hardware as well as contributing to the

147
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:37,510
scientific analysis of our data as an

148
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:39,849
x-ray spectrometer it will be the first

149
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:41,590
instrument to get a look at the x-ray

150
00:05:39,849 --> 00:05:43,210
spectra that comes off the asteroid

151
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:44,480
which gives us a unique insight into the

152
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,920
elemental composition

153
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,350
asteroid and so we're getting data that

154
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:51,110
no one's ever gotten before the spheres

155
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:53,150
program is educated several thousand

156
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:54,260
students from all the way as young as

157
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:57,590
eleven years old

158
00:05:54,260 --> 00:06:01,280
we made a competition that is based on

159
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:04,160
the students programming a player for an

160
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,590
autonomous satellite the best players in

161
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,800
simulation get to send their code up to

162
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:11,630
the space station students can say I can

163
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,810
send things to space I can send my

164
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:17,480
software to space Space Systems lab in

165
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:19,400
star lab or in a nice sweet spot we work

166
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:22,520
on missions that are small enough where

167
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:24,530
where we can hold them all in our in our

168
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:28,340
hands and in our heads but they're

169
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:30,470
impactful and they fly it's constantly

170
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:32,390
humbling to be around faculty members

171
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:33,620
that are really excellent what they do

172
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:35,990
whether they're NASA Chief Technologist

173
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:37,430
or former secretaries of the Air Force

174
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:39,950
just be able to learn from these people

175
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:42,770
day to day make aero-astro at MIT what

176
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:44,720
it is all my life when I was a kid or

177
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:47,510
throughout undergrad I was thought of

178
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,340
MIT as being like this super cool place

179
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:52,250
and which cutting-edge research was done

180
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:54,350
now that I'm here I can actually feel

181
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:56,650
that your research can have a tremendous

182
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,650
impact

183
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:07,090
you
