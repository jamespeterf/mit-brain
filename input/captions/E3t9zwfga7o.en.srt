00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,560
With automation, AI and the global drive

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:08,400
for carbon reduction transforming

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:11,679
manufacturing, Hyram Saml sees capital

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:14,639
markets allocation remaining misaligned

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,480
with the sector's evolving needs. He

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,119
notes that the tension between

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:22,160
institutional investors preferences for

8
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:24,000
efficient asset light models and the

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,119
significant capital expenditures

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,480
required for transformative

11
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:32,160
manufacturing presents a substantial

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,559
challenge. He believes that engaging

13
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,960
capital markets early supported by

14
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:40,079
innovative business models, refined

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,399
narratives and industrial policy is

16
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,360
essential to mob mobilizing large

17
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:47,239
funding pools of capital that advanced

18
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,430
strategic priorities

19
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:55,689
require. Please welcome Hyram Samuel.

20
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:55,689
[Applause]

21
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:06,549
[Music]

22
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,159
Good

23
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,640
afternoon. So today I you know I'm

24
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,159
always I every time I come to an MIT

25
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,000
event I'm always impressed by my

26
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,439
colleagues because I learn so much and I

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,960
can't say I understand all of it. So,

28
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:28,880
um I thank you. I'm glad to hear that.

29
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,479
It makes me feel a whole lot better. Um

30
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,040
but I can say to you that I'm going to

31
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,920
talk to you today about money. Um and I

32
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,520
think money is something that we we all

33
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:41,360
understand. And and I have to say that I

34
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,960
came by this um honestly. And so I'm

35
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,640
looking out into the audience and I see

36
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,360
a bunch of you and and you know a lot of

37
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,159
you look to me to be mid-career. And so

38
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,399
actually actually I'm a second career

39
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:56,320
academic. I didn't go back to MIT to get

40
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:59,119
my PhD until I was 48. Um, and I I came

41
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,560
back for a variety of reasons, but a lot

42
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,840
of it was rooted in my own experience

43
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,360
and a lot of it was rooted in my

44
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,399
experience as an entrepreneur. And so,

45
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,399
uh, when I was young, I consolidated uh,

46
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,479
uh, industrial tool distributors,

47
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,040
considerably durable distributors, built

48
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,440
it up to a 200 billion, a $200 million

49
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,760
business. I I went broke doing that. I

50
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,920
spent five years paying the bank back.

51
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,680
Uh, I gave the bank my house, so I kind

52
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,560
of know the American entrepreneurship

53
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,239
story. Um, unfortunately, unlike some

54
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,920
folks in Europe, in the United States,

55
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,160
this is not a big deal. You can go and

56
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,480
do it again. Uh, I started a textile

57
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,640
manufacturing company. Uh, grew that to

58
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:38,319
what I would call mediumsiz, probably

59
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,160
uh, 200 people. Um, made that uh,

60
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,680
reasonably successful. Along the way,

61
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,959
owned a Dutch company, made hardwood

62
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,720
floors. um and came back at MIT and and

63
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,519
we have mid-career programs which I

64
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,879
encourage all of you to to look at. Um

65
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,800
and I participated in one called the

66
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,879
Sloan Fellows. It was part-time. I met a

67
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,760
lot of people in their 40s that were

68
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,440
doing interesting stuff and um I became

69
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,519
fascinated by the startup world and I

70
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,840
became a angel investor investing in

71
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,280
seed rounds. I've invested in about 12

72
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,760
companies. I can't say I've done great

73
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,760
but I have not done poorly. Uh I'm still

74
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,519
waiting for the home run. Um um but you

75
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,560
know there's always tomorrow. So that's

76
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:19,040
the way to think about that. But um this

77
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,239
sort of got me interested in in sort of

78
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,319
manufacturing because I love

79
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,599
manufacturing also in kind of American

80
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,280
manufacturing because I had seen the

81
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:28,080
decline of this as someone that supplied

82
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,799
many many companies. I we hear the

83
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,640
perennial Kodak punching bag story but

84
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,040
um I used to supply Kodak with all their

85
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,599
industrial and cutting tools. Um and so

86
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,959
when I came back to MIT um I found the

87
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,560
opportunity to work on a program

88
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,760
actually under Suzanne Burgerer that's

89
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,280
going to speak to you a little bit later

90
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,840
that's about production what's called

91
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,760
production in the innovation economy um

92
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,040
and I found this a fascinating topic for

93
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,879
me um because it dealt with how do young

94
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,400
companies scale up those that are

95
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,040
production based so if you think about a

96
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,959
productionbased company uh they have to

97
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,720
raise a lot of capital upfront this is

98
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,560
not like a digital model where you don't

99
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,400
have to raise so much money up front you

100
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,799
have to raise a lot of money up front.

101
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,599
And so we looked at this um and I did

102
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,840
this research as part of my my my uh

103
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,920
dissertation. Uh and we look and I

104
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,120
looked at this with Liz Reynolds uh was

105
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,400
my was was my co-author. Um Liz at the

106
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,560
time ran the Industrial Performance

107
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,320
Center which is what Ben does that Ben

108
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,560
does now. And Liz went on and actually

109
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,160
was in the Biden White House uh working

110
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,320
with the National Economic Council on

111
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:32,000
Advanced Manufacturing. Um and what we

112
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,520
found was of 250 manufacturing startups

113
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,520
and manufacturing based startups, the

114
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,040
majority of them went overseas. In other

115
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,280
words, they had gotten only to a certain

116
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,040
point. Um and then they kind of couldn't

117
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,759
raise enough capital, but there was

118
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,680
plenty of capital primarily in East Asia

119
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,120
where they went to build a pilot plant

120
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,560
and quite frankly that's where the

121
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,040
capabilities went. That's where the

122
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,880
learning went and so this sort of raised

123
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:58,320
a kind of red flag to us. I then went to

124
00:04:53,880 --> 00:05:00,000
Oxford for my first academic job and um

125
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,759
found a similar problem and convinced

126
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,520
some colleagues that were in the finance

127
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,040
department to take a look at it and they

128
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,280
also teamed up with some people at

129
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,360
Cambridge uh and Barclays actually

130
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,039
financed this. Not only did they find

131
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,800
this was a problem for British

132
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,199
manufacturing production based startups

133
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,520
but quite frankly for all British

134
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,600
startups. Uh there just wasn't a whole

135
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,560
lot of risk capital. The pools were

136
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,720
really full of of of state capital. sort

137
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,160
of government money uh and they needed

138
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,280
that. Um and so I went to Oxford. I

139
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,560
ended up working on a whole bunch of

140
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,639
other stuff at Oxford. I came back to

141
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,400
MIT worked on a variety of stuff. I

142
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,520
generally do uh global strategy for

143
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,280
example. Um and then I sort of read this

144
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,199
uh you know sort of you might have seen

145
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,360
this report last year sort of again the

146
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:46,560
scaleup gap just never seems to go away.

147
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,600
It's always a a chronic problem. And so

148
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,639
uh when we were talking about this

149
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,919
conference I said this gives me an

150
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,919
opportunity to kind of go and do some

151
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,000
preliminary research how to think about

152
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:55,440
this and this comes up to raise this

153
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,800
problem. What is the missing middle?

154
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,080
Everyone's talking about the missing

155
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,479
middle when it comes to scaleup

156
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,800
financing for what we'll call deep tech

157
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:05,680
or manufacturing of basically capital

158
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,440
intensive companies. Um but what does it

159
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:11,199
actually mean? So let me just try to

160
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:13,120
explain it to you quickly. Um and so I

161
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,680
put three curves up at once but you can

162
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,600
imagine this. you develop a technology

163
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,199
um and if you just look in the y- axis

164
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,600
that's the investment that you've got to

165
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,520
make um and you start to do a little bit

166
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,199
of research and then you kind of get

167
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,479
excited you go okay we actually got to

168
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,759
produce this and then you kind of say

169
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,759
okay where am I going to get money to do

170
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,840
this oftentimes you've spun it out of a

171
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,560
university and then you kind of get you

172
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,400
need to raise more money um and then

173
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,759
slowly you'll start to commercially

174
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,680
expand this is in a perfect world now if

175
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,520
you look at the blue curve you have two

176
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,880
other things you need to do in One thing

177
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,680
that we haven't really talked a lot

178
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:50,240
about yet today is customers. What is

179
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,479
the demand for this product going to be

180
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,039
um and that's a very very important

181
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:57,120
aspect to understanding business as it's

182
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,560
conducted today. So you have a market

183
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,400
point curve and that's basically you

184
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,560
need to get the cost of your technology

185
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,639
down to where a customer is willing to

186
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,880
pay for it. Right? This is always the

187
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,880
battle between a new startup and a

188
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,039
company is getting willingness to pay.

189
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,080
Um, as all of you know, because I'm sure

190
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,400
all of you participate in this

191
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,720
environment, um, oftentimes companies

192
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,639
give this stuff away for free, right? Or

193
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,759
your $ five dollar Uber ride to the

194
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,120
airport in the United States is now

195
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:25,840
$57. Um, because they got to pay back

196
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,840
the $30 billion that they raised uh, and

197
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,680
have a better market position. And so

198
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,599
what happens here is as you get to a

199
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,039
point where people people were willing

200
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,599
to pay for it, you start to get an

201
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:38,080
adoption curve. And then at some point

202
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:40,240
you get to scale and you pay back your

203
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,720
investors. And so what we found happens

204
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:46,000
with scale up is oftentimes that period

205
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,520
of time is just too long. The venture

206
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,039
fund is closed. They run a five to

207
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,720
sevenyear cycle or even if they run a

208
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:53,120
seven or eight year cycle, they're only

209
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,759
in it for about five years. Um and they

210
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,120
close. And so this creates this problem.

211
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,160
Uh and this is kind of the missing

212
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,720
middle. So, this happens to be an

213
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,000
example for an energy technology where

214
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,280
essentially, if you think about this,

215
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,440
you've done the research, you've done

216
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,879
the innovation, um you've gone, you've

217
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,560
got your angel investors, you've got

218
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,240
your venture capital, and then you need

219
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,599
to go and raise another hundred million

220
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,360
dollars because you got to build a pilot

221
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:17,280
plant. And that becomes a challenge. Um,

222
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,800
and oftentimes people that have done

223
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,560
this, okay, you've derisked the

224
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,039
technology, but you've not d-risked it

225
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,720
enough to go to what we'll call capital

226
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,560
markets and particularly to if you want

227
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,080
to then do some sort of special special

228
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,560
purpose vehicle to finance this thing,

229
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,080
if you're doing a power generation, for

230
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,440
example. And so this is the missing

231
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,320
middle. And so we're going to talk about

232
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,560
this a little bit. Um, and the way that

233
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,919
you want to think about this often is is

234
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,519
there's different types of capital. And

235
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,839
I know this is sort of colorful, but

236
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,839
hopefully you can match them up. Um but

237
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,240
essentially if you're investing capital

238
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,480
you have have a high risk and you have

239
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,920
low risk and my assumption is everyone

240
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,399
in Austria you guys are all high-risisk

241
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:57,680
investors right and when I think of

242
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:59,839
Austria I think of high risk so um so

243
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,160
you know low risk is is you know you can

244
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,640
think of Norway's sovereign capital fund

245
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,360
uh relatively low risk but you can also

246
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,640
think of Abu Dhabi's sovereign small

247
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,200
fund and that's high risk right

248
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,519
investing in AI investing in a variety

249
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,800
of things and so Um, we're not going to

250
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,839
spend too much time on this, but

251
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,519
different countries have different

252
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,040
growth models, and those growth models

253
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,640
determine oftentimes investor

254
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,760
preferences, whether you realize it or

255
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,839
not, whether they're conscious or

256
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,680
unconscious. Um, this is very much true

257
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,519
in Europe. And then you have kind of

258
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,959
institutional money. This might be uh

259
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,040
passive money, money you put into

260
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:33,200
exchange traded funds, for example,

261
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,560
pension funds. Um, and then you have

262
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,920
kind of capital markets. That's

263
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,760
institutional. Could be retail

264
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,519
investors. I'm sure all of you are

265
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,399
follow following Wall Street Bets on

266
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,080
Reddit now. Um, and then policy driven

267
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,880
capital where the state then inserts

268
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,080
money and it's oftentimes median risk.

269
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,519
And then you might say, what is

270
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,360
production capital? Production capital

271
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,519
is where a company risks its own

272
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,600
capital. I have retained earnings. I'm

273
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,839
going to put my capital into it. Um,

274
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,279
that's often cyclical in manufacturing.

275
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,519
So, it's a kind of a higher risk

276
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:03,279
capital. Um, and then we have venture

277
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,040
capital or hedge funds that are sort of

278
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,480
speculative capital. And then we're not

279
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,480
going to talk too much about debt today,

280
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,519
but tomorrow in my workshop, we'll talk

281
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,360
a little bit more about hybrid

282
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,040
instruments. And so these give these are

283
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,079
stylized what I'm going to call stylized

284
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:18,240
capital stacks if you look at them. Um,

285
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:20,000
and I've got one for the US and I've got

286
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,000
one for the EU. But essentially what

287
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,279
happens is is is there's government

288
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,440
funded research that will go to

289
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:27,120
institutes like MIT for example.

290
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,079
Needless to say that's now changing in

291
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,560
the Trump era. Um, but that's very very

292
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,480
important to develop to to develop new

293
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,640
startups. I'm not sure the government

294
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,880
understands that. Um and then

295
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,560
essentially essentially uh venture

296
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,240
capital will come in oftentimes at

297
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,000
places like MIT venture capitalists walk

298
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,760
around labs looking for very young

299
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
inventors looking for things to do and

300
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,839
trying to find them early um and they'll

301
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,279
go and fund stuff and then what will

302
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,440
happen is oftentimes if they have

303
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:55,040
something promising um financial capital

304
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,680
will come in this might be mutual fund

305
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,440
companies things that are going to go

306
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:00,959
preIPO will come in and and do something

307
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,240
and then you're off and you're running

308
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,920
and you've got more you've got

309
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,600
institutional money you've got passive

310
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,160
money uh and you've got your own

311
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:11,440
production capital invested uh in the

312
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:13,279
EU. Uh if we look at the difference, one

313
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,079
thing that I want you to notice now is

314
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:18,160
the big basically the big red. That's

315
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:20,720
the important factor is the state never

316
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,079
leaves the capital stack in Europe. And

317
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,320
I'm going to show you a little bit later

318
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:26,320
about their European Investment Bank and

319
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,839
the European Investment B. You guys

320
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,839
just, you know, look, I'm wearing a

321
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,360
sweater. Take your jackets off, loosen

322
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,959
up. I'm going to try and convince you to

323
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,720
invest some money in manufacturing by

324
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:37,360
the time I'm done. So, it's important,

325
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,399
but because basically the problem in

326
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,360
Europe is is you just you're just too

327
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:43,440
riskaverse, right? There's not enough

328
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,040
money flowing into the sector. And what

329
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,360
I'm going to try to convince you is that

330
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:50,399
oftentimes people look to the state for

331
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:53,120
this problem, but the state can't offer

332
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,720
all the de-risking solution. You need

333
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,800
the competition that the marketplace

334
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,760
provides. You need the governance that

335
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,760
the marketplace provides. Um, and really

336
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,440
what manufacturing suffers from is part

337
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,320
of it's its own problem. It's actually

338
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,519
much more capital efficient than people

339
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:09,600
realize. It's an incredibly profitable.

340
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:12,760
I'm going to show that to you now. Um,

341
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,200
and that this kind of public investor

342
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,959
undervaluation drives capital market

343
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,839
behavior. It drives the capital market

344
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:21,760
behavior of manufacturers. Um, and takes

345
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,160
them away and out of the innovation

346
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,480
space. And and Ben talked a little bit

347
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,399
about Anderil. Um, and so you if you

348
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,399
have to understand the Silicon Valley

349
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,680
speak of today. So we we used to talk

350
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,519
about capital structure, now it's

351
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,120
capital stack. If you were vertically

352
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:38,240
integrated, now you're a full stack

353
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,399
company. But essentially essentially if

354
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,160
you get the language of Silicon Valley,

355
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,760
you can actually drive the multiples on

356
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,200
your company higher. You you need to

357
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,519
have a narrative. You need to have a

358
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,800
business model. Um and basically the

359
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,320
state can't be that. So I'm going to do

360
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,760
that very simply is I'm going to ask you

361
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,920
guys to make one investment decision.

362
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,560
I'm going to give you limited

363
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,720
information because that's what

364
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,160
investors face is limited information.

365
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,680
Uh, I'm going to talk to you a little

366
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,480
bit about the irony of capitalism

367
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,079
without capital. Um, and then I'm going

368
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,839
to try to argue close up by just

369
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,839
suggesting that productive speculation

370
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,920
is is necessary. I'm going to show you

371
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,440
that there is a lot of capital in just a

372
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,600
very few companies that I'm showing you.

373
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,920
And so much more than governments are

374
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,600
much more willing to play into this.

375
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,079
Okay. So, we're going to play the game

376
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,839
cash and control. You guys, it's your

377
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,800
lucky day. You've had lunch. You're

378
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,639
tired. But your wealthy aunt Edna who

379
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,839
passed away 10 years ago unbeknownst to

380
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:32,880
you was a very very good investor and

381
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:36,480
aunt Edna owned two companies. She owned

382
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:40,480
company A and company B. Now company A

383
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:42,880
has returned to her estate right now um

384
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,279
$ 32 billion. She was pretty wealthy on

385
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:48,720
Adenova, isn't she? It's returned $ 32

386
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:50,959
billion. Company B returned nothing for

387
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,480
the first seven years and then returned

388
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:58,000
15.7 billion dollars in the last two

389
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:59,920
years. Okay. Company A was very diligent

390
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,680
about their shares. They didn't issue

391
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,160
any new shares or if they issued new

392
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:08,240
shares, they bought them back. Um and on

393
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:10,399
and still owns 100% of it. Uh company B

394
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,639
um diluted their shares to the tune of

395
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:15,440
48%. So you actually still control. you

396
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:18,480
own about 67% of it, but uh it diluted

397
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,000
their shares about about 48%. Okay, I'm

398
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,639
going to sum it up for you on this slide

399
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,040
before I ask you to vote. Okay, company

400
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:28,160
A, 32 billion in return. Pretty nice.

401
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:30,519
Company B, not so bad. 15.7 billion.

402
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:33,360
Company A, you still own 100%

403
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:35,279
of Company B 48%. Now, I want you to

404
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,360
view this as if you're well actually 67%

405
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,040
but 48% diluted. So, if you I want you

406
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,199
to think about this as your own private

407
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,600
investment. Now, which one would you

408
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:46,440
rather have? Company A. All those would

409
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,519
rather have company A, raise your

410
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:52,399
hand. One

411
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:55,760
hand. Really? You gota you got to vote.

412
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:57,040
Okay. So, company A 32 million. Thank

413
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,399
you very much, Bruce, because you got

414
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:02,000
everyone behind you. Okay. And company

415
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:05,440
B. So, actually more people voting

416
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,760
company B. So, what why would you vote

417
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,760
company B?

418
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,800
slope is the slope looks a little bit

419
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,279
steeper, right? But you've waited 10

420
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,720
years to get that, right? So, I mean,

421
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,800
you didn't you missed all that return

422
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,480
beforehand. So, what's interesting is,

423
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,880
you know, you're correct if you voted

424
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:26,959
for company B. Company B has a market

425
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:30,240
cap of $285 billion. Uh, company A has a

426
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:31,839
market cap of $131 billion. Company B

427
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,959
trades at a price to earnings multiple

428
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:38,320
of 47. Company A trades at a price to

429
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:41,279
earnings multiple of of 21. Um, company

430
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:43,279
B is a company you may know, Salesforce.

431
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:46,800
Uh, company A is a company you may also

432
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:48,320
know, John Deere, right? Two very, very

433
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,079
good companies. Salesforce is a very

434
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,920
good company and John Deere is a very

435
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:55,839
good company. Let's take a closer look

436
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:58,160
at them, though. Okay, so the riskreward

437
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,560
ratio and the willingness of of of

438
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:03,440
investors to invest in companies on the

439
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:05,199
as kind of uh our colleague pointed out

440
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,680
is is that the steeper curve comes at

441
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,959
the tail end. um has got people

442
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,880
investing in this. I'm going to explain

443
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:14,240
this a little bit further to you, but it

444
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:16,160
gives companies more financing tools.

445
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,600
And so if you look at Salesforce,

446
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,440
Salesforce trades at a much higher

447
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,480
multiple than almost any manufacturing

448
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,480
companies. There are companies like

449
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,680
Danner Herur and and Haiko that trade at

450
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,399
high multiples. I'll talk about that

451
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:29,040
more tomorrow. It gives them capital

452
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,399
tools that you do not have as a

453
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,240
manufacturer. At least capital tools

454
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:35,040
that you don't use, you're afraid to use

455
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,240
as a manufacturer. So if you were to

456
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,639
look at this chart over here, I want you

457
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,040
to look at the bottom chart. So it says

458
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:43,600
additional paid in capital. Um that's

459
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:47,040
called we call that APEC. Um it has a

460
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:49,320
APE of 53 billion. That means that you

461
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:52,959
during those 10 years of

462
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:55,120
time received 53 billion of additional

463
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:57,440
paid capital just in those 10 years time

464
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,720
you got 53 billion investors said I

465
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,399
believe in you. I believe in you. I'm

466
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,120
going to get my return someday. Here's

467
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:05,760
another 53 billion.

468
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:09,000
Now during that whole period of time you

469
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:13,039
reported a free cash flow of about $ 37

470
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,079
billion but by the way 21 billion of

471
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:16,959
that is we're going to call stockbased

472
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:19,760
compensation. So that's essentially

473
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,760
where I go I'm going to pay you guys but

474
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,000
you know what I want to keep the cash.

475
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,640
So I'm going to come over here and sell

476
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,079
it to you. You guys willing to buy you

477
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,440
going to fund my employees because I

478
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:32,080
don't want to lose my employees. They're

479
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:35,679
very high value. I need to do this. And

480
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:37,840
so every year Salesforce goes and issues

481
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:40,160
stock to usually restricted stock units.

482
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:43,039
They vest. Employees go and sell that

483
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,880
stock into the capital market. Um and

484
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,799
Salesforce gets to keep the cash. So

485
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,120
basically Salesforce keeps this cash,

486
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,960
reports it as free cash flow. It has a

487
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,360
high multiple. It then goes and buys

488
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,840
companies for stock. Uh you can think of

489
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:58,160
Slack, Tableau, for example, Muleoft

490
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,720
companies that that that that Salesforce

491
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,799
bought. And Salesforce said, "I'm

492
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,240
getting a little nervous because no

493
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,600
one's got any money back until the last

494
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,080
two years. I better start returning some

495
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:10,559
money." They returned $15 billion. So,

496
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:13,840
you've given them $55 billion and you've

497
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:15,840
gotten back $15 billion. Um, and you've

498
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:19,200
paid their employees effectively $22

499
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:21,039
billion. Let's take a look at Deer. John

500
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,240
Deere is a much more typical what I

501
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:25,760
would call manufacturer. Um, it

502
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,440
generates a lot of cash, a whole lot

503
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:31,600
more than Salesforce, $51 billion. Um,

504
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,200
it made some small acquisitions, maybe

505
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,679
it made some acquisitions. It made $6

506
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,640
billion worth of acquisitions in in in

507
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,919
uh cash. Uh, issued no additional stock

508
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,080
or maybe some small additional stock,

509
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,880
which it then purchased. Um, but then

510
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:50,160
returned $10 billion in dividends and

511
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:52,160
$21 billion in in uh um stock buybacks.

512
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,559
So here you have two completely

513
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:57,760
different models. John Deere is paying

514
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:59,600
you back and Salesforce is taking your

515
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,080
money. So if we were to kind of think

516
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:04,559
about this and look at

517
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:06,240
this, John Deere, which trades at a much

518
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:08,640
lower multiple, almost half of what

519
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,200
Salesforce does, actually has grown its

520
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,799
business nicely, reasonably nicely, uh,

521
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,480
of all the last year. It is a cyclical

522
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:16,640
business. So you can see that in the top

523
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,000
line, that's the top solid line. The

524
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,240
dotted line is their equity. They've

525
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,520
grown their equity, too. um but not

526
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,600
quite to the same level as their

527
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:26,480
revenue. Salesforce on the other hand

528
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,320
has grown their revenue relatively well

529
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,160
um but has really bumped up their

530
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,480
equity. So this is a company now that

531
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,600
you think of as being capital light

532
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,200
because that's what you're trained to

533
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,360
think of when you think of software as a

534
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,679
service. It's actually capital intense.

535
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:42,880
It has Salesforce has over $60 billion

536
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:45,919
in stockholders equity. Um so it's used

537
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,679
a whole lot of money to do this. So I

538
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,520
got curious by this and I said, "Wow, is

539
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,679
this just these companies or is this

540
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,919
kind of an industry thing? How do you

541
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,919
how do you think about this?" So I went

542
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:59,360
and I looked at software as a service. I

543
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:01,440
just took 10 companies. Um HubSpot,

544
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,520
Brian Howigan and Dharmash were two of

545
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,919
my classmates when I was at MIT have

546
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,760
built a tremendous tremendous business.

547
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:10,160
Um and these are probably some brands

548
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,799
that you may indeed use. Palunteer that

549
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:14,320
uh Ben had talked about earlier um that

550
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,919
you would use. And I said, "Okay, let's

551
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,640
see how these companies have performed

552
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:21,520
over the last 10 years." Um, what do we

553
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,799
find? Okay, so basically, uh, their

554
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,000
additional paid in capital was

555
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:27,679
equivalent to Salesforce about $55

556
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,880
billion. Uh, their retained earnings is

557
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:32,400
really, uh, negative, $15 billion. Um,

558
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,880
so that's kind of almost the difference

559
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,840
between the capital increase and the and

560
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,360
the negative retained earnings. Um, the

561
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,720
revenue is pretty impressive, $40

562
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:46,280
billion.

563
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:49,600
um uh the cumulative net loss $10

564
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:51,440
billion. Um and it's free cash flow $35

565
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,679
billion. And this is what you'll see if

566
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,240
you're pitched on a SAS company as an

567
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:58,960
investment is the free cash flow of $35

568
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:02,400
billion. But by the way, all of that $35

569
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:05,600
billion plus more only shows up because

570
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:07,120
they paid it to their to their employees

571
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,360
and the capital markets brought that

572
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,679
back. So in other words, all $ 35

573
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,760
billion of capital that has flowed into

574
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,760
cash, I'm not going to say capital, cash

575
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,960
in capital that has flowed into SAS

576
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,080
companies has come through stockbased

577
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:22,720
compensation. This is a pretty nifty

578
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,960
tool. I'm not going to say that they're

579
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,200
fleecing your pocket um because these

580
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,960
companies are indeed very valuable. What

581
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,559
I want to show you is there's a lot of

582
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,320
tricks that you can do if you do this.

583
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,520
These are pretty good companies. Now

584
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,280
let's look at some manufacturing

585
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,679
companies. I took 10 manufacturing

586
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,520
companies. You may you may indeed uh

587
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:42,799
know them. I'm going to talk about Haiko

588
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:44,559
tomorrow. Um not surprisingly, the

589
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:47,600
market cap of these is almost twice as

590
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:49,440
high. Not quite. It's about 60%. Um the

591
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:53,120
revenue of the manufacturing companies

592
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:54,799
is is obviously higher than SAS. Um wow.

593
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:57,240
Those manufacturing companies between

594
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:59,760
the 10 of them have had a net income of

595
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:02,400
$122 billion.

596
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:04,919
Um the manufacturing company, the SAS

597
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,960
companies cumulative net loss of $10

598
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:08,880
billion. That seems kind of odd. They've

599
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:12,159
made 122 billion, but they have kind of

600
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,679
almost half the market cap. Um retained

601
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:15,200
earnings, the same thing. That was what

602
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:18,159
you would expect would follow from that.

603
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,880
Less redemptions. Um the total

604
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:25,760
stockbased compensation $35 billion in

605
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:27,520
in uh uh for uh SAS for manufacturers

606
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:30,159
six mill six billion. So quite a bit

607
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:32,000
lower. they are using it as a tool. Um

608
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:35,360
the cash that came back to shareholders

609
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:38,159
for manufacturers $85 billion. They

610
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:40,400
returned almost 60 69% of their cash

611
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:43,600
back to shareholders. And so now you

612
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,280
start to see two diverging capital

613
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,840
schemes. And this is where my argument

614
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,360
is about capital allocation.

615
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,640
Essentially, if you look at this, I'll

616
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,640
give it I'll sum it up for you on the

617
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,919
next slide, too. Essentially is is

618
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:57,600
manufacturers feel obligated, I guess,

619
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,640
to maintain their stock price. I'm not

620
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:02,799
quite 100% sure to return $85 billion to

621
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,320
shareholders. SAS companies because they

622
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:07,440
traded higher multiples are happy to

623
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:09,760
just take another $55 billion from

624
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,760
capital investors to put it in. This is

625
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,120
a huge amount of money and as you'll see

626
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,280
compared to what was invested in

627
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,919
manufacturing advanced manufacturing

628
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,880
small amount and so if you look at this

629
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:21,760
okay so they did raise some capital

630
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:24,080
manufacturers but you can see the

631
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:26,919
capital c cash return to cash return to

632
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:30,120
shareholders was quite low right $85

633
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:32,480
billion okay how do we think about this

634
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,760
so some of you might have seen this book

635
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,360
it's a well-known book I encourage you

636
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:38,799
to read it was written about 10 years

637
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,760
ago um by two British economists um but

638
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:43,280
essentially

639
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:44,799
SAS's model in con in concept is

640
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:47,120
capitalism of all capital. In other

641
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:50,000
words, you as a company can put your IT

642
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:51,760
in a crowd. You keep your assets light.

643
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,320
We can keep our assets light. We can

644
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,919
outsource we can outsource uh uh data

645
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,600
centers. We can outsource a variety of

646
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:00,320
things. We're just going to invest money

647
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:02,080
in in in our software. Turns out they

648
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,400
invest a lot of money in maintaining

649
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,880
their customer base, right? They spend a

650
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,480
ton of money on sales and marketing. um

651
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,000
their their argument at least from a

652
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,279
business school person would be is

653
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,480
they're renting their competitive

654
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:14,000
advantages. They're not really

655
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,760
leveraging. They have no pricing power.

656
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,279
At least the pricing power to me is not

657
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,840
that evident that they're able to

658
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:22,880
extract rent from the market. And this

659
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:25,679
is even after 10 years. Manufacturers

660
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,840
much more capital efficient. Stockbased

661
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,679
compensation is a great tool. It's also

662
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:32,000
a hidden capital. It's a way for you to

663
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,360
raise money. It also raises questions

664
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,520
though about how much you actually use

665
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,440
as of your revenue. Um, and there's a

666
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:40,320
big time horizon mismatch. Why is it

667
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,880
that manufacturers get penalized um, for

668
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:45,360
not returning cash to them when when in

669
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:48,000
essence SAS companies get 10 years of a

670
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,360
free ride to do that in the hopes that

671
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,200
you're going to make some of your money

672
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,799
back. I'm not going to say that. I'm not

673
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,320
trying to say that SAS is a bad

674
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:56,400
investment. What I'm trying to say to

675
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,240
you is there's a lot of money out there

676
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,559
that can be reallocated and that the

677
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,640
capital intensity of SAS, not only does

678
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:04,960
it approach manufacturing, it exceeds

679
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,279
it. Right? these companies have very

680
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,200
very capital intents. It's just that

681
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:12,159
they raise that capital in means that

682
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,880
are not so transparent um to an ordinary

683
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:17,039
investor to look at. Um and all of this

684
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,480
is reinforced by passive institutional

685
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:21,520
money at least in the United States

686
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:23,039
where you have cap weighted ETFs that

687
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,440
support the price of these because as

688
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:27,039
they go up in value they have a larger

689
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,760
share of the ETF and so they're

690
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:32,240
constantly buying stock. Now that may

691
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:35,360
also suffer on the way down. Um so how

692
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,440
can we explain this? So in the United

693
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,279
States the way that we had expansion was

694
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,279
not only through not only through

695
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:42,799
government surplus government stimulus

696
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:44,640
but primarily through quantitative

697
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:46,159
easing. This is a federal reserve that

698
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:49,120
increased their balance sheet from about

699
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:51,039
4 trillion to 9 trillion uh during COVID

700
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,520
and afterwards. And you can see that's

701
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:55,520
the NASDAQ 100 that sort of mirrors that

702
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,120
growth. Uh we haven't quite seen the lag

703
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,600
yet. We started to see a little bit of

704
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:02,640
that. I'm not telling you to short the

705
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,799
NASDAQ 100, but um we we haven't seen

706
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,919
that come back down again yet, but that

707
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,200
sort of really this quantitative

708
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,480
tightening on the Fed. They got to

709
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,080
figure out what they're going to do.

710
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,640
This has given rise to this. You might

711
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,640
have seen this graphic from the FT. Um

712
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,000
the US capital markets now account for

713
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,919
the majority of the world. As a matter

714
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,480
of fact, information technology sector

715
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:22,799
in the US markets is now larger than

716
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,520
pretty much the Asian and European

717
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:27,039
capital markets in total. Um the

718
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,760
industrial sector is not small though,

719
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:31,679
but it's uh it's small by US standards.

720
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,840
And so when people say there's not

721
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:36,240
enough money out there, and there's

722
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:38,159
definitely money, the trick is to get

723
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,080
the money where we'd like to see it go.

724
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:42,720
That's that's really the trick. And so

725
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,480
why is this not happening? So venture

726
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,159
capital is actually quite significant in

727
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,720
in the United States. It's also quite

728
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:50,559
significant in Europe. Uh venture

729
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,720
capital in in Europe is now for got

730
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:55,360
about $426 billion in assets is

731
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:58,080
invested. uh the US it's over a trillion

732
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,520
a trillion two um but when it comes to

733
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,799
manufacturing and I'm not going to say I

734
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,440
have everyone in here these are

735
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:05,039
pitchbook numbers um there's not a whole

736
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,240
lot of money that's going into it if you

737
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:08,640
look at this in the United States

738
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,000
advanced manufacturing um and this is

739
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,960
venture growth so this will be the

740
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,960
equivalent of scale up um last year

741
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,520
total in 2023 the last year I have

742
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,919
numbers is about $6 billion the total of

743
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:22,640
all these six years here is about $ 31

744
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:24,159
billion um lots of companies are getting

745
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:27,120
invested A lot of companies are getting

746
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:29,559
seated over 400 for example. But where

747
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:32,480
the problems start to come is with the

748
00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:34,400
exits. And so when you have when you

749
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,640
sell a company into a public market

750
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:38,400
where multiples are low, there's not a

751
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,559
lot of appetite for investors to invest

752
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:42,720
in these. The only exception in the US

753
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:44,159
are defense stocks, right? Just as we

754
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,159
might see Rin Metal and we've seen

755
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:48,400
German defense stocks increase quite a

756
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:51,120
bit in value over the last three or four

757
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:54,000
weeks. um you need this kind of

758
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:56,320
speculation to drive to pull capital

759
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,960
into the market. Um and this hasn't

760
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:00,720
happened. There was one exception in

761
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:03,279
2021. Um and even that's relatively

762
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:05,039
small by standard. And so you now have

763
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:07,520
venture capital kind of looking for an

764
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:08,760
exit, can't find the exit. The exits are

765
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,520
pretty much through

766
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:13,360
acquisitions. Um and then you have the

767
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,720
large role that private equity plays.

768
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,640
And I know private equity is playing a

769
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,080
bigger role in European middle

770
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,039
companies, companies, families want to

771
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:23,679
sell a business. Um, and so their their

772
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:25,600
their investment activity in industrials

773
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:27,360
has gone down at least in the United

774
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,120
States. But the most important thing for

775
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,559
you to look at is and this sort of

776
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,039
speaks to the a little bit the

777
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:35,840
pathologies of private equity um is

778
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:37,919
close to 50% of the exits are to another

779
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:40,320
private equity company. In other words,

780
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,520
they can't sell them. they can't sell

781
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,480
them because they're not performing or

782
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,760
they can't sell them because they need

783
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,679
to create they they want to raise

784
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,120
liquidity for their own investors. Uh

785
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:49,039
they're now doing what are called de

786
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,640
dividend recapitalizations. Dividend

787
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:52,799
recapitalizations are when I go and

788
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,120
borrow money and use that money to pay

789
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:57,600
back my investors and I load the I load

790
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:59,200
the company with more debt. Uh very few

791
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,200
public listings as you can see and the

792
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,600
rest of them are corporate acquisitions.

793
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:06,080
And this creates a path. This creates a

794
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,440
a problem because if you if you if you

795
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,960
have this kind of behavior where you

796
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,159
start to add debt to your balance sheet,

797
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,679
how much you going to invest in research

798
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:13,200
and development? How much are you going

799
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:15,919
to invest in robotics? How much are you

800
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,600
going to invest in automation? And so we

801
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:19,440
have this sort of perverse problem where

802
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,840
venture capital is one place, private

803
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,559
equity is another, capital markets are

804
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,399
kind of left out of the game completely.

805
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:29,279
Um, and so then what you have is the

806
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:31,279
dialogue then turns to this, which is we

807
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:32,960
need the government to basically come in

808
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:34,559
and fund us. We need the government to

809
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,159
do this. The Biden administration did

810
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:38,640
this in a big way with the chips and

811
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:41,440
Iraq. Um, I don't think Trump is going

812
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,279
to do this again. Uh, certainly he's if

813
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,039
anything tried to claw back some of it.

814
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:47,039
Um, for those of you that don't know

815
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:48,080
venture capital, and my guess is there

816
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:50,399
probably people here that know it better

817
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:52,320
than I do. Um, you know, it's a game.

818
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:55,440
It's a portfolio game and you really do

819
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,880
need the you need the 50 to 100x return

820
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,240
to basically make the rest of your

821
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,480
portfolio. You don't have a lot of

822
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,080
information. Um and so companies

823
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,320
oftentimes will look for that and the

824
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:06,000
only way you get that big return is by

825
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,559
going public. You don't get that by

826
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,480
staying private. Um, and so when you

827
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:12,720
start to look at newer technologies, you

828
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,960
can see that I know the the the the font

829
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,799
is quite small here, but you know, you

830
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,720
start to see fusion hypersonic aircraft

831
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:20,720
coming all the way down to kind of as

832
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,679
we're doing now, generative AI, new

833
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:27,360
chips, whatever. Um, this is a just sort

834
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:28,880
of a a US belief that government has to

835
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,120
kind of fund this research. It needs to

836
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:33,520
fund the research. It needs to guarantee

837
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,919
loans. It needs to it needs to provide

838
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:39,200
government contracts. Um this is no

839
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:41,279
different than the uh EU. Uh this is

840
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:44,080
from that document I showed you before

841
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:46,159
at the beginning. Um interesting enough

842
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,840
is that even as you get to a mature fund

843
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:49,600
then European investment bank is staying

844
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:52,960
invested. They stay invested throughout

845
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:54,640
the whole process. Look if I had a

846
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,799
business I would take don't don't get me

847
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,720
wrong I would take that money. Uh but my

848
00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:00,640
point to you is is that there's plenty

849
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,799
of private capital out there. We just

850
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:05,200
have to unleash it. We need to we need

851
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:06,960
to invest that. And so one thing I want

852
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,480
to show you before I end is I want to

853
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,679
just sort of take you show take you

854
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:13,440
through what Tesla um did and whatever

855
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:16,320
you may think of Elon Musk or anything

856
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,600
else. Um I will say that the way that

857
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,919
they financed the business was

858
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,440
incredibly interesting. And so one of

859
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,120
the things I want you to notice is is

860
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,960
that the blue is what I call a

861
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:27,760
traditional funding. So that's equity

862
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,760
and debt. And really until 2020 Tesla

863
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,919
didn't really have a big public equity

864
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:34,799
raise. uh they raised small amounts

865
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:36,720
periodically in the markets but 44% of

866
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:38,799
their of their funding was what I'm

867
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,480
going to call non-traditional so they

868
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:41,760
took advantage of government programs

869
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,360
but that were those government programs

870
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:45,440
were available to everybody else but

871
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,960
they were tradable zero emission vehicle

872
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,720
credits from the state of California

873
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,720
generated about $4 billion in revenue

874
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,399
for Tesla when they needed it I'm going

875
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,960
to show you a heat map for that

876
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:58,640
strategic investors Tesla I mean uh

877
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:00,240
Toyota Dler came in very early to to to

878
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,240
Tesla to give them a little bit money

879
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,320
when they needed it. Um, and then

880
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,399
government programs came in to help

881
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:08,480
round that out. And then as they they

882
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:10,159
started to have some traction with with

883
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:12,720
public stock prices, they ended up using

884
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:14,480
stockbased compensation. And so if you

885
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,320
to look at heat mapap, I'm not going to

886
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,799
say that you can read this. I know it's

887
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:21,120
very small, but I find it interesting if

888
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:22,559
you go back to its early years, you see

889
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:25,440
the money is all coming from venture

890
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:28,000
capital here. Uh, they they go public in

891
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:30,399
2010. Um, and then all of a sudden they

892
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,240
get a grant for $465 million. They start

893
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:34,159
to get they start to get some ZEV

894
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,760
credits as you kind of move through that

895
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:38,799
period when they couldn't raise a lot of

896
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:41,039
capital. And so companies that do this,

897
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:43,840
they need to piece this together. So in

898
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:46,640
many ways, governments need to work not

899
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:48,320
necessarily at odds with this, but with

900
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,000
companies. And one thing that people

901
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,840
need to realize is that when you get

902
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,080
venture capital, venture capital are

903
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,840
your best friend until they're not. um

904
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:57,120
because their goals are different than

905
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,960
yours as a company that as an

906
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,960
entrepreneur that starts a company. You

907
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,720
want to keep the company going. Venture

908
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,080
capital is going to exit as soon as they

909
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,519
can get a price that makes sense for

910
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,080
them to do that. That's what their job

911
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:10,000
is. Um I want to just put this up. I

912
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,840
thought this was kind of funny is only

913
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,919
the United States gets politicized about

914
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,840
everything. The reason Tesla doesn't pay

915
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:17,440
income taxes is because Elon Musk

916
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,279
company profits from green energy tax

917
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,559
breaks passed by the Democrats.

918
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,840
Actually, that's not true at all. As a

919
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:23,360
matter of fact, those green energy tax

920
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:26,000
breaks are the ones that generated the

921
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:28,399
capital for Tesla to actually keep

922
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,760
going. Um Tesla doesn't pay tax because

923
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:31,120
it has a net operating loss carry

924
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,840
forward. It just hasn't made enough

925
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:35,360
money to offset its losses that it has.

926
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:37,360
But only in the Wall Street Journal can

927
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:39,679
you get the political take on that on

928
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:41,679
that kind of uh on that kind of picture.

929
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:43,679
Um and then just to leave you, this was

930
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:45,760
just Stuart Kirk that wrote in the FT a

931
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:47,679
couple I don't know maybe a week ago or

932
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,679
two weeks ago and I'm going to talk to

933
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:51,760
you my European colleagues. It's been a

934
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:53,120
valuation game so far. This is the way

935
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:55,039
manufacturing companies have behaved.

936
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,559
It's time for companies to invest big.

937
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:57,919
Um, and I'll give you a statistic of

938
00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:00,080
that in a second. And then to our

939
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:01,919
American colleagues, what one thing I

940
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,279
does concern me is a lot of the capital

941
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:04,960
going into the defense sector. There's

942
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:07,039
nothing wrong with that. Uh, it's good

943
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:09,440
that it's doing that. Uh, but we need to

944
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:11,480
get more money into more broad-based uh,

945
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,280
uh, uh, manufacturing like Chris's

946
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,879
biommanufacturing. Uh, and we need more

947
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,040
talent going in there. And so we need

948
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:19,200
more capital. that's actually all within

949
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:22,000
us and sort of just in a very simple

950
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:24,240
mind exercise rather than in if

951
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:28,240
institutions didn't invest $35 billion

952
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:30,639
in SAS out of their 770 market cap and

953
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:32,879
uh manufacturing companies didn't return

954
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:34,960
35 billion out of the 102 billion they

955
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:37,919
returned to shareholders but rather

956
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:40,159
invested it in startups we got $70

957
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:41,520
billion of capital that's already two

958
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:43,599
and a half almost two and a half times

959
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,760
what VCs invested in manufacturing over

960
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:48,240
a six-year period this is just 20

961
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,919
companies. There is a lot of capital out

962
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:52,079
there. We just need to find a way to get

963
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:53,679
it reallocated. A lot of that might be

964
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:56,399
education. A lot of it might be people

965
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:58,800
understanding that um and that public

966
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:00,480
investors need to move to reallocate

967
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,839
capital driven by political shifts.

968
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,000
These are strategic sectors. Now,

969
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:05,440
manufacturing, we'll start to see some

970
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,599
we'll start to see some rotation of

971
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,839
capital into that. Uh and then tomorrow

972
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:11,839
in my workshop I'll talk about uh sort

973
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:13,440
of business models, ways that you can

974
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:15,200
get multiple we call multiples

975
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,680
expansion, ways that you can improve the

976
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:19,520
way your business is. Um the state can

977
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:22,079
step in but it needs to act as a

978
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:24,400
partner. It can't crowd out competition.

979
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:25,760
Um and then the incumbent publics need

980
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,079
to believe in themselves. This is not

981
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,760
only in the United States but the EU.

982
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:32,240
They need to invest more money in

983
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,760
growth. They need to be return worry

984
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,920
less about returning stock to

985
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,640
shareholders and more about about

986
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:40,079
growing. Uh and in the EU, I see no one

987
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,359
took your jacket off. You guys just got

988
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:43,920
to take on some more risk. I don't know

989
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:45,920
how else to say it. Um I learned this in

990
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,760
the UK. Investors are very very

991
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,760
riskaverse here. And while the state can

992
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:53,599
act as your partner, you need to step

993
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:56,000
up. Um and that the stock 600 is is very

994
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:58,480
successful, but it returned 60% of its

995
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
of of its earnings to shareholders. And

996
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,400
it shouldn't have to do that. They need

997
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,720
to invest in growth. Okay. Thank you

998
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,720
very much.

999
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,920
All

1000
00:36:10,359 --> 00:36:16,400
right. Well, we have I think uh an

1001
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:19,359
opportunity for some questions. Here we

1002
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:21,920
go. Is the flow of talent into defense

1003
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:24,720
startups not also a reflection of a lack

1004
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:27,359
of risk appetite as ultimately the

1005
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:29,680
customer is the state? Yeah, absolutely.

1006
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:32,400
I mean that's 100% correct. I mean is is

1007
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:34,000
a I mean the state you're assuming the

1008
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,839
government's going to derisk all of that

1009
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,079
capital by being the customer. I mean

1010
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:40,000
that's the premise that I mean DARPA

1011
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:41,119
which is that great US innovation thing

1012
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,240
that was part of the department of

1013
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:46,560
defense uh was very much about a a way

1014
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:48,240
not only did it kind of seed a lot of

1015
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:50,240
startups but it often would bring an

1016
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:52,800
implicit customer that is a government

1017
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:54,880
to you. Um the problem is you don't want

1018
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,079
you don't want Anderil and Palunteer and

1019
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,079
all these companies that have very high

1020
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:00,400
private market value. challenges public

1021
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:03,760
but private market valuations to suck up

1022
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:06,079
all the talent uh to do that.

1023
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:08,240
So I'm going to say thank you because

1024
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:11,440
we're I think we have a chance for just

1025
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:13,599
one more question. Uh what role should

1026
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:16,400
industrial policy play in de-risisking

1027
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:18,079
investments and incentivizing long-term

1028
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,760
commitment from private capital? Uh

1029
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:21,200
that's a great question and uh I'm not

1030
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:24,240
sure I can give you a 100% answer for

1031
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:26,240
that but I would say that um I mean in

1032
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:28,240
the United States we see this now with

1033
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:31,200
with the change in indirect funding for

1034
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:33,520
NIH grants. Um the government needs to

1035
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:35,359
fund basic research. It is it is

1036
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:38,000
absolutely vital to certainly the United

1037
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:41,440
States and I would argue to to Europe.

1038
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,760
Um and I think that for for for sort of

1039
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:46,320
further along scale up uh government

1040
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:49,040
needs to to offer credits for example to

1041
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:52,000
get private investors to stay to to stay

1042
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:53,760
in there. And and I don't you know it's

1043
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,440
kind of like you know the old the old

1044
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,440
saw is is that markets will stay

1045
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:59,599
irrational longer than I can stay in

1046
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,960
solvent. So I mean I think that that's

1047
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:02,880
probably a truth. I can't necessarily

1048
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,720
talk down markets but I think Scott Bent

1049
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,920
is trying to talk down markets quite

1050
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:08,400
frankly. I think he's made that

1051
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:10,079
statement a few times. Um, and I think

1052
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,160
that the government can act a very

1053
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:14,480
strong way to at least if anything as a

1054
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:17,359
orchestrator of this and needless to say

1055
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:19,200
some tax policies or even some uh even

1056
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:20,880
some governmentbacked loans would become

1057
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,640
very helpful. I know a colleague Andy

1058
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,560
Low is working on tranched investments

1059
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,920
that would solve that part of that

1060
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:28,160
problem but we just need to get more

1061
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:31,160
money into it. Well, thank you Hyram

1062
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,160
Samo.
