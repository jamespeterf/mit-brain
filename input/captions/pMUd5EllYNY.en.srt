1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Charlesson Ricle. I'm the CEO

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,200
and one of the co-founders of Amplified

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,840
Industries. Um, so obviously AI is all

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,679
the rage pretty much in every uh

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,280
vertical right now. But one of the thing

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,080
which is interesting is traditionally it

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,800
has less success in heavy industrial use

8
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,480
cases. And one of the main one of the

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,560
big reasons for that is it's been

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,800
difficult uh it's been difficult to

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,119
collect high resolution good quality

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,480
data for those kind of applications. And

13
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,439
especially if you start looking at

14
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,680
remote operation, the legacy status quo

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,120
has typically been relying on scala link

16
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,880
which effectively means that you have

17
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,079
hundreds of pieces of equipments that

18
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:42,239
have to share um one effectively dialed

19
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,920
connection. What's exciting is there's a

20
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,079
big revolution happening in the field of

21
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:50,239
remote connectivity where through both

22
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:52,480
5G rollout and satellite alternatives

23
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:55,120
high resol high speeded uh internet

24
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,840
connection is becoming ubiquitous if not

25
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,320
today in the next couple years and so

26
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,800
our job at amplified is to take

27
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,799
advantage of this fact to build the

28
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,200
backend infrastructure of the future for

29
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,479
industrial application so that goes from

30
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,880
build developing our own IoT solutions

31
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,080
that are able to record, compress data,

32
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,000
send it through those different

33
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,000
modalities to our cloud system. They're

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,280
dual kind of AI processing and then

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,280
makes both like uh insights available to

36
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,840
our customers for our system and also

37
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,520
connect back to legacy historian systems

38
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,439
to provide them with the type of data

39
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,079
they can ingest and so what's

40
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:34,720
interesting is we can do that at about a

41
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:36,960
million time more data higher resolution

42
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,439
that legacy system for onetenth of the

43
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,880
cost. Our primary application today is

44
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,200
in oil and gas. So we've built

45
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,680
effectively an ecosystem of IoT devices

46
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,000
that have to be extremely rugged. So

47
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,119
talking about 10 year plus battery life

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,320
uh like deployed in harsh outdoors uh

49
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,759
climates have to be very simple to be to

50
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,920
be installed and use so that field

51
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,560
technician can deal with them and at the

52
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,600
same time being able to do do this uh

53
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,399
recording of data across a wide variety

54
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,879
of signals uh and send this at very high

55
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,479
resolution. And once this hits our

56
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,080
cloud, this is where interesting things

57
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,560
starts happening where we take in this

58
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,760
very high resolution data and we distill

59
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:21,200
it uh into both looking for operational

60
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,560
issues and we we leverage it to control

61
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,480
the equipment to make sure that it's

62
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,239
always operating in an optimal fashion.

63
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,400
So in the context of an oil and gas

64
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,959
operator, the benefits look like an

65
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,720
increased production, reduce drastic

66
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,200
reduction in operating cost through

67
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:38,000
minimized equipment failures, reduced

68
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,480
electricity consumption and also

69
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,239
virtually elimination of spills which

70
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,120
obviously is a major environmental

71
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,680
concern in this industry. So this is a

72
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,080
little video of an installation of one

73
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,400
of our systems by one of our technician

74
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,920
to give you uh to give you a sense uh

75
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:58,319
with using legacy equipment. Uh go

76
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,879
retrofitting a unit would take probably

77
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:03,760
a day worth of work for a crew and cost

78
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:06,239
between 15 and $20,000. We're able to

79
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:09,760
get it done in under 15 minutes for

80
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:12,159
120th of this cost. And so we are we are

81
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:15,200
growing pretty fast. We went commercial

82
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:18,319
uh in late 2021. Uh today we have more

83
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,080
than 2,000 devices uh installed in the

84
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,319
2,000 assets for other instruments in

85
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,040
the US. And a typical customer journey

86
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,599
would be what what I've put in here with

87
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,840
this private equity back operator that

88
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,760
started a pilot on three wells with us a

89
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,319
year ago and is now rolling out to his

90
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:38,159
entire production with already 200 wells

91
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:40,400
uh under our management. And in terms of

92
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,920
ask so there are primarily of two kinds.

93
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,280
Uh on the one end we're always

94
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,040
interesting starting new pilots

95
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,879
obviously in the oil and gas industry

96
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,760
but they're also interesting to look at

97
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:52,799
other verticals with remote uh

98
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,239
industrial assets. So think mining uh

99
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,879
industrial waters this type of

100
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,400
applications and on the other hand uh

101
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,799
very interested in having conversation

102
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,519
with people designing both industrial

103
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:07,040
equipment uh oil field service companies

104
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:09,040
and industrial software. I appreciate uh

105
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:12,319
appreciate your time and I'm very happy

106
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,319
to take any question.
