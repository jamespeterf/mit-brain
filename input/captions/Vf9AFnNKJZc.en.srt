1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,560
good evening everybody my name is Tom

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,120
olich I'm the associate director for

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,720
science Communications here at the Bro

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,519
Institute and it's my pleasure to

5
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:12,040
welcome you all to this evening's broad

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:14,280
Discovery series talk if you're joining

7
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,119
us for the first time uh the broad

8
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,119
Discovery series explores the genetic

9
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:20,519
and biological roots of human health and

10
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:23,080
disease the mechanisms that govern how

11
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:24,960
our cells and our bodies function new

12
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,160
technologies that are redefining what's

13
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,960
possible in science and the progress

14
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,519
that is being made to translate new

15
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,840
discoveries into treatment

16
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:36,440
for common and rare diseases I'm excited

17
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,800
tonight to bring to the stage Lloyd bod

18
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,239
Lloyd is a cancer immunologist an

19
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,640
associate member here at the broad

20
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:45,000
Institute in the claran cell

21
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,039
Observatory a principal investigator in

22
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,520
the CR Family Center for Cancer Research

23
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,879
at Massachusetts General Hospital and an

24
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,480
assistant professor of medicine at

25
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,199
Harvard Medical School through his

26
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,800
research Lloyd and his colleagues are

27
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,320
asking how we might better harness the

28
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,399
cancer fighting prowess of the immune

29
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,160
system and tonight he's going to take us

30
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:04,640
on a tour of the immune system and also

31
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:07,040
give us a sneak peek into what it is

32
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,439
that his lab is been working on it's a

33
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,680
couple of housekeeping notes before I

34
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:12,479
bring them on stage uh if you have any

35
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,280
questions for Lloyd I encourage you to

36
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,159
raise your hand and flag down one of our

37
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,240
mic Runners doing the Q&A portion of

38
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,360
this evening if you're watching us

39
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,560
online I'll be keeping an eye on YouTube

40
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,439
chat so if you type your questions in

41
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,119
there I'll do my best to try to work you

42
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:28,840
into the discussion during the

43
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:30,400
Q&A if you're a Brody or a scientist

44
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,920
with a deep technical question about

45
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,200
Lloyd's research I'm going to encourage

46
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,960
you to please talk to him during the uh

47
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,520
the reception so that members of the

48
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:40,040
community have an opportunity to ask

49
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,520
their questions uh during the Q&A and

50
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,240
lastly there is a reception I invite you

51
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,600
all in the room to join us in the broad

52
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,159
Discovery Center right outside of the

53
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,880
auditorium right after tonight's talk

54
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,719
and I encourage you to explore the

55
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:56,160
Museum's exhibits and interactive

56
00:01:51,719 --> 00:02:00,759
elements Lloyd over to you

57
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:02,520
[Applause]

58
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:04,520
hi everyone can you hear me

59
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,439
well thank you Tom for the kind

60
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,399
introductions it's a really pleasure for

61
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:12,319
me to be here to actually kick off the

62
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:14,400
broad Discovery series um you know I'm

63
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,519
an immunologist as as Tom mention

64
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,920
actually and I I find this initiative

65
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:20,800
actually critical to diffuse a bit about

66
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,440
the science because there is always this

67
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,160
disconnect between what we do in the

68
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,400
labs and actually how we diffuse the

69
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,560
science to the to the broad audience and

70
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,720
I will bring you to a tour about um

71
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,920
Immunology which has been my passion for

72
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,080
more than than 10 years now actually

73
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,920
that not that I

74
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,519
realize and

75
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:42,480
so first what is in the name Immunology

76
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:46,159
stand for the science of the of the

77
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:49,319
immune system or the science of immunity

78
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:50,879
immunity comes from the Latin immunitas

79
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:54,720
which actually comes from the freedom

80
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:57,400
from OB obligations or privilege so you

81
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,840
can see it as a sort of exemption from

82
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,800
diseases or protection from diseases

83
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,480
disase everything is in the

84
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:07,640
terminology so

85
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,480
today I start to ask you a questions why

86
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:12,480
should we care about immunology and I

87
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,640
will involve you actually in the room so

88
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,840
and you can raise your hand to answer me

89
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:20,120
how many of you know someone with an

90
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,480
with an allergy any

91
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:25,319
allergy almost everyone in the room

92
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,840
right how many of you know someone with

93
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:30,920
that got the flu or got any infection

94
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,920
infectious disease almost all the room

95
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:35,360
and I could go on if I ask you about

96
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,480
autoimmunity there might be less hands

97
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,720
but there are still many I can do the

98
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:42,080
same and it's unfortunate about cancer

99
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,879
unfortunately many of us know someone

100
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,760
that had cancer the link between all of

101
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,000
these diseases is actually that all of

102
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:51,680
them involve the immune system either in

103
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,360
a good way or in a bad way and why

104
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,920
should we care about Immunology because

105
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,319
we need to understand how the immune

106
00:03:54,920 --> 00:04:01,040
system works to face these diseases and

107
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:03,079
to tackle them better why because most

108
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,000
of these diseases actually are

109
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:06,480
exponentially increasing over the past

110
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,280
years and I will keep it will keep

111
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:12,079
increase actually in the future you can

112
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,760
see in Orange the allergies are

113
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:17,199
increasing the autoimmune diseases the

114
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,199
cancer but you can note here actually

115
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,919
that the green line here shows the

116
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:24,639
infectious diseases and we do a pretty

117
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:27,160
good job about that because of our way

118
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,840
of living we have a pretty hygienic way

119
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:32,960
of life we are pretty protected against

120
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:35,160
bacterial infections or viral infections

121
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,560
but if you look at this timeline it

122
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:40,080
stops at 2020 and we know what happened

123
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:43,560
in 2020 right so we are not entirely

124
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:47,400
protected against infectious diseases so

125
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:49,960
today my talk will be a five course menu

126
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:52,280
about how the immune system is uh

127
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:54,400
composed of and how the immune system is

128
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,919
actually playing a role in diseases but

129
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,960
also in normal functions of our body so

130
00:04:56,919 --> 00:05:01,400
I will briefly have an historical

131
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,280
perspective about the immune system then

132
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,919
we will go together through the basics

133
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,880
of the immune system I will show you I

134
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,199
will highlight how it's not only related

135
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:12,520
to diseases that the immune system have

136
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:15,840
also Ro in normal functions in our daily

137
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:19,160
life and we will focus of course on how

138
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,960
the immune reactions uh to cancer occurs

139
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,440
and is is taking

140
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,160
place and then I will give you briefly

141
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,800
some insights about what our lab is

142
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:30,600
doing and the angle that we are taking

143
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:33,560
to tackle cancer so first is to

144
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:36,759
perspectives Immunology has been studied

145
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:38,680
for centuries there are so many

146
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:41,319
discoveries related to Immunology many

147
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,800
Nobel prices and instead of going

148
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:46,919
through each one of the discoveries I

149
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,400
want to guide you through main concepts

150
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:51,240
related to

151
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,560
Immunology the first concept is related

152
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,880
to immune

153
00:05:52,560 --> 00:06:00,160
defense and from the ancient

154
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:03,759
Greece to the vaccines against MPX to

155
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:06,560
Pastor's gy germ Theory there is this

156
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:09,240
concept of the immune system is our

157
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,240
natural defense against bacterial or

158
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,160
viral threats and that's there to

159
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:16,520
protect us against these

160
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:19,520
threats then this pretty good actually

161
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:23,120
uh defense defense system

162
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:25,880
could also backfire and attack our own

163
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,360
body that the emergence of the this type

164
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:30,599
of disease that we called autoimmune

165
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,479
diseases and

166
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:34,280
another concept that actually took place

167
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,680
back then is the concept of immune

168
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:39,639
tolerance how the immune system is

169
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,440
actually educated to not attack our own

170
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:45,800
body our own

171
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:47,759
self then more recently over the past 50

172
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,720
years I would say and that and this is

173
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,280
still

174
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:54,440
ongoing we go more into a concept of

175
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,759
immune networks actually the immune

176
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,960
system is interconnected with our other

177
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:01,400
systems the nervous system the endocrine

178
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,680
system the metabolic systems and the

179
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:06,000
immune system actually can perceive

180
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,840
receive signals from the environment and

181
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,720
respond to these signals one of the key

182
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:13,800
example here is the checkpoint molecules

183
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,560
the immune checkpoints where the immune

184
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,080
system can receive signals from the

185
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,720
environment and that can completely

186
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:21,879
change the function of the immune system

187
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:23,800
and I will talk about a little bit about

188
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:26,599
the checkpoints later on because that

189
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,919
change Cancer Care uh

190
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:32,440
nowadays so the basics of the immune

191
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:34,400
systems and the immune system is quite

192
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:37,720
quite

193
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:40,759
complex it is um it is it could be a

194
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:42,800
mess because it's a it's a I would say a

195
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:44,960
network a node of multiple different

196
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,599
Pathways different cell types different

197
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:52,199
intricacies that are uh melting together

198
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:55,840
but we could break it down in three main

199
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:59,599
aspects the first aspect which is what I

200
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:02,800
call behavioral immunity this is kind of

201
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:05,000
of our consciousness of avoiding danger

202
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,919
you know when we see a fire we avoid the

203
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,680
fire and this is kind of our immune

204
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:12,599
response to to protect ourself when it's

205
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:15,000
cold right like today we accumulate

206
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:16,960
layers actually to not get flu or to not

207
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,800
get a cold or something like this and

208
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,479
also when we have a bad smell we also

209
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,840
have a reaction towards the bad smell

210
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:25,039
that also protective effect this is kind

211
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:27,120
of the the first layer of immunity which

212
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:30,039
is just the behavioral

213
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,680
immunity the other aspect the second

214
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:35,000
aspect is more anatomical or

215
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:37,479
physiological which is really an example

216
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,360
is that is our skin actually represent a

217
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:43,120
physical barrier that protect Invaders

218
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:44,959
that goes into through our body another

219
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,200
example also that is on this slide is

220
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,839
the stomach that is highly acidic that

221
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,959
can destroy everything everything that

222
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:54,360
goes through it most of the

223
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:57,320
time so beyond the behavior beyond the

224
00:08:54,360 --> 00:09:00,079
physical barrier the immune system is

225
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:02,839
then composed of cells

226
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:04,880
and of produ product of the cells the

227
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:07,399
soluble molecules that the cells can can

228
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:10,200
produce and here again it could be

229
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:14,040
divided into two main kingdoms as the

230
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:16,279
imun immunologist like to say the innate

231
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,800
versus the adaptive immunity the

232
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:22,720
Adaptive is more the acquired one the

233
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:25,160
Adaptive One is actually seen in the

234
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,600
Jord vertebrates and this is something

235
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,360
that we have in similar uh to the Sharks

236
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,600
for

237
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:34,360
instance so the innate immune system is

238
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:37,519
supposed to be our first line of defense

239
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:40,200
that is fast but

240
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:42,320
non-specific the Adaptive immune system

241
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,800
is supposed to be is composed of te-

242
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,240
cells which contain the kiler t- cells

243
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,079
that we will see return that are the

244
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:52,040
ones that kill cancer cells and also of

245
00:09:49,079 --> 00:09:54,519
B cells another lineage of this of this

246
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:57,920
Kingdom the adaptive

247
00:09:54,519 --> 00:10:00,320
immunity takes longer to kick in but can

248
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,640
recognize specifically the Target and

249
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,839
destroy it and remember it later on so

250
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,640
that confer us a a stronger response in

251
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,680
the

252
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,760
future and you can see that there are

253
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:14,519
two layers the cellular layer on the top

254
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:17,279
of the slid where we have the cells

255
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:19,519
involved in the innate immunity and the

256
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:22,200
cells involved in the adaptive

257
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:25,079
immunity but then these cells produce

258
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:27,800
also factors small molecules in the

259
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:30,760
innate compartment some of and and we

260
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:34,200
call this this I would say non cellular

261
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:36,920
immune system as humoral the innate

262
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:40,079
humoral response contain factors such as

263
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:42,360
antimicrobial peptides which are our own

264
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,680
antibiotics basically and we can

265
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:47,639
directly eliminate bacteria by producing

266
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:50,079
this antimicrob peptides on the other

267
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:51,839
hands we have also antibodies which are

268
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:54,360
produced by B cells that you will see

269
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,279
later on in a few slides which are

270
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,200
highly specific and if you have to

271
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:59,920
remember something from this slide is

272
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:03,399
really that the innate

273
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:06,480
is nonspecific but quite fast within 0

274
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:10,440
to four hours and the adaptive

275
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:12,639
immunity is highly specific you have the

276
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:15,360
concept of memory when you can remember

277
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:19,079
the the threat later on but it's slower

278
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:21,959
it takes four to 14 days to kick to kick

279
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:25,720
in now let's do a little bit of

280
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:29,720
philosophy the root of of immunity in

281
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:31,480
general is about one simple question how

282
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:34,200
do you see

283
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:36,839
yourself because the basic role of the

284
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:39,560
immune system is to recognize what is

285
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:42,240
supposed to be there the self or what's

286
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:44,880
not supposed to be there the nonself and

287
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,240
this distinction is kind of essential to

288
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,720
understand the immune system basically

289
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,079
how it works to really make this

290
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,920
distinction how the immune system does

291
00:11:51,079 --> 00:11:54,839
that I will give you one examples I

292
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,920
mentioned the antibodies in in the

293
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:59,040
previous

294
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:03,279
slides the antibodies have been have

295
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:06,519
this extreme ability to precisely

296
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:09,680
recognize the self versus the

297
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:11,639
nonself they are small proteins which

298
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,560
have two different portions a

299
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:17,199
recognition arm that is depicted here

300
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,240
and effector function the effector

301
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:20,800
function is basically when they

302
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,720
recognize something that is not supposed

303
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,519
to be there it needs to be discarded and

304
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,639
the effector portion of the antibody

305
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,880
will allow the ability of other cells to

306
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:32,360
pick them up and discard what is not

307
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:34,320
supposed to be there and I will

308
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:36,519
highlight one of the study that shows

309
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,320
how specific they

310
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:43,440
are this is an example of a paper that

311
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:47,160
was published in 1987 so quite old um

312
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:49,120
not too old and they were the the the

313
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:51,639
researchers were looking at calcitonin

314
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,399
so calcitonin is a normon that controls

315
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:56,399
your calcium level in your blood stream

316
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,360
and what they found and this is the

317
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,120
chemical structure of calcitonin that is

318
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,199
depicted here

319
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,560
what they identified they found an

320
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:07,600
antibody that can recognize

321
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:10,199
calcitonin and they predicted that this

322
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:13,680
antibody that they called

323
00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:16,720
C7 could recognize this portion of

324
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:19,639
calcitonin but to really test if it was

325
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:23,040
that much specific what they

326
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:26,880
did they changed the molecule they

327
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:30,680
remove this portion here nh2 which is an

328
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:32,399
amine domain they swap it for an hydroxy

329
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:35,560
domain

330
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,079
o they tested again this antibody

331
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:39,399
against this molecule but it was not

332
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:42,639
able to bind at all so this is really

333
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:45,959
showing how precise and specific are

334
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:48,760
antibodies this notion of precis and

335
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:52,199
specificity made something that we call

336
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:54,360
nowadays monoclonal antibodies so it's

337
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:58,000
basically an antibody that Target a a

338
00:13:54,360 --> 00:14:00,040
unique specific molecule the discovery

339
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,240
and all the studies around monoclonal

340
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,120
antibodies obtained the Nobel Prize in

341
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,279
in

342
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:09,399
1984 by Jan ker and and

343
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:11,279
milstein and it opened a whole world it

344
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:13,800
completely changed the face of biom

345
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:17,079
medicine we use antibodies nowadays in

346
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:20,199
90% of the lab of the research lab and

347
00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:23,079
90% of the clinical labs to either see

348
00:14:20,199 --> 00:14:25,639
ourselves to treat our patients we use

349
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:28,519
antibodies every day in our daily life

350
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:31,480
as a researcher at least so antibodies

351
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:33,880
really uh change the face of biom

352
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:36,519
medicine so I mentioned a lot about

353
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:38,880
diseases and it's a defense mechanism

354
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:41,519
the immune system is really our our our

355
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,800
defense but then more and more that we

356
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:46,160
could understand the immune system the

357
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:48,120
components of the immune system we could

358
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:52,079
also realize that the immune system

359
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:54,519
could play other roles Beyond just

360
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:57,320
diseases here I don't know if you can

361
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:59,480
see um this is a review that is that was

362
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:02,120
published in 2018

363
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,680
where the ARs basically summarize what

364
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,800
are the non- disease function of the

365
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:09,199
immune system here depicted in

366
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:11,519
blue and we could find in the literature

367
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,959
that the immune system can regulate

368
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:16,199
basic functions such as how we burn fat

369
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:19,040
for example they regulate thermogenesis

370
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:21,680
in the white adipose tissues or the

371
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:24,440
brown tissues as well they regulate

372
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,839
the heart functionality they regulate

373
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:29,759
how we generate our muscles how we

374
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:34,040
regenerate our muscles the system also

375
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:36,399
controls how the motility of our gut and

376
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:39,399
these are functions basic functions that

377
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:42,560
are routinely in involving the immune

378
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:44,839
system in their actions and for me one

379
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,399
of the mindblowing example and I will I

380
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:50,360
will show you one of the the paper after

381
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:53,600
the slides is the recognition that the

382
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:57,319
immune system can even control our own

383
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:59,399
behavior and our social behavior you you

384
00:15:57,319 --> 00:16:01,440
remember the beginning of few slides I

385
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:03,360
mentioned that our Consciousness

386
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,040
provides a behavioral

387
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:09,199
immunity but now it's more the

388
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:11,079
retroaction of the immune system on our

389
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:14,199
behavior and this is a growing

390
00:16:11,079 --> 00:16:16,600
literature where they actually recognize

391
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:19,079
that this is happening uh uh most of the

392
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:22,720
times so one example is this paper

393
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:26,040
published in 2016 in the journal Nature

394
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:29,040
where the ARs interrogated the role of

395
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:30,800
interon gamma interon gamma is a the

396
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:34,040
small molecule produced by the immune

397
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:36,959
system mostly T cells or the kiler T

398
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:40,399
cells that regulate viral infections or

399
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:42,360
that plays a huge role in cancer as well

400
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:45,639
and to test the role of interfering

401
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:47,720
gamma on the social behavior they use a

402
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:50,800
pretty interesting model it's called the

403
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:54,000
three chamber sociability

404
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:56,519
assay in this assay they have a box they

405
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,600
put a mouse into the box the box has

406
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:00,759
three chambers that are interconnected

407
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:03,759
with these openings that you see

408
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:06,160
here on the left chamber and the right

409
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:08,280
chamber you have separate

410
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:11,120
cages within the

411
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:14,000
box and at the beginning they let the

412
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:16,240
mouse go and discover the Box itself and

413
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,679
move between the right and the left

414
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:22,039
Chambers after a while they would

415
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:24,319
introduce either another mouse in the

416
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:27,160
left chamber or an object in the right

417
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,960
chamber for instance and you you can

418
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:31,320
directly understand the system it's

419
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,760
pretty simple if the mouse is pretty

420
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:37,080
social it should spend more time with

421
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,799
the other Mouse right and if there is no

422
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:41,039
social aspect if the mouse doesn't

423
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:44,559
really care the mouse would spend as

424
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:48,039
much time in any chamber right and M are

425
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:52,240
like humans they are quite social

426
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:55,400
actually they spend twice much time with

427
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,960
the Other M compared to the object in a

428
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,440
normal

429
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,760
situation however

430
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,760
without interfering gamma that the

431
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:07,200
molecule that they

432
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:10,080
investigated then these mice lost

433
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,360
completely their social behavior which

434
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,120
shows that one single molecule produced

435
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:16,679
by the immune system can control the

436
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:19,880
whole social behavior of of these

437
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:22,200
animals so beyond just diseases we have

438
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:24,240
also this interconnection between this

439
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,720
these two different systems and the

440
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,840
immune systems will I'm I'm pretty sure

441
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,880
will teach us many more about our social

442
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:33,240
child behaviors and more about our

443
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:36,760
Consciousness as

444
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:39,559
well so now let's dive into the role of

445
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:41,360
the immune reactions to

446
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:45,320
cancer

447
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:47,200
so I put the title here is about the

448
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:50,120
cancer immunity cycle that has been

449
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:53,120
recognized for the past 50 years I have

450
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:56,280
to say that these mechanisms is actually

451
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:59,799
true which is for in um for infectious

452
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:02,240
diseases for allergy uh for autoimmunity

453
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:04,919
this will be the same kind of

454
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,840
cycle and the cycle is composed of four

455
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:09,880
different

456
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:12,120
steps the first steps is the fact that

457
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:14,840
the immune system is there patrolling

458
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:18,159
throughout our body to find what is not

459
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:21,799
supposed to be there right so the first

460
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:24,760
step is really to identify cancer cells

461
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:26,520
that would not look quite right right

462
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:28,280
there would be subtle differences that

463
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:30,840
would make the cancer cells becoming

464
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:33,600
different than than the normal cells and

465
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:36,280
these immune cells would then recognize

466
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:39,159
the ID card of the of the tumor cells of

467
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:41,240
the cancer cells this is the greatest

468
00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:44,440
prettiest picture of of tumor

469
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:46,840
cells then once these immune cells would

470
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:49,799
recognize the would get the ID card of

471
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:52,120
these cancer cells they would then

472
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:53,799
migrate to an immune organ such as a

473
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:57,120
lymph nod or the

474
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:59,200
spleen and they would present this ID

475
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,919
card to the immune cells resid there

476
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,679
either the T cells or the B cells in

477
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,320
that case in the case of cancer they

478
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:09,120
really want to show this ID card to the

479
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:11,080
killer T cells right this step the

480
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:14,760
second step of this of the cycle is

481
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:17,120
called the immune priming we called a a

482
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:19,039
a primed immune cells when the immune

483
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,360
cells is conscious that there is a

484
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:23,000
threat to

485
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:24,720
attack once the cells are primed then

486
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,960
they can migrate within the two more

487
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,640
tissue and and do their job of D showing

488
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,799
cancer cells right

489
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:35,039
and I give you one example so this is a

490
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:38,280
microscopy picture of immune cells that

491
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:39,400
are heing green surrounding two more

492
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,000
cells that I don't know if you can see

493
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,760
the color is supposed to be purple and

494
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,520
that are doing their job of destroying

495
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:49,240
the cancer cells and this is how in

496
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:51,240
theory it should happen and you will

497
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:55,360
tell me so Lloyd if the immune system

498
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:59,520
was so great why cancer is still a thing

499
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:02,039
right and you're right

500
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:05,480
there is a mechanism that is a sort of

501
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:07,679
double edge sword where by being so

502
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:10,279
effective of recognizing and destroying

503
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:13,400
cancer cells the immune system also

504
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:15,840
provokes something called immunological

505
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:19,520
sculpting this

506
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:22,279
concept has three phases the first one

507
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:24,600
is the job is done quite well the first

508
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:27,120
part the first phase is the elimination

509
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:30,080
phase the immune system recognize and

510
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:34,600
Destroy most of the cancer cell

511
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:35,840
however in the subsequent stage

512
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:38,480
sometimes they can be

513
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,440
outnumbered and then they could they

514
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,320
could actually maximize their effect

515
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,960
they destroy most of the cancer cells

516
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,159
but there are still some that are

517
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:50,240
remaining this is called the equilibrium

518
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:52,760
phase and in that phase it's really kind

519
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,880
of keeping a wild animal into a cage so

520
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:57,200
you can control the growth you can

521
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,559
contain the wild animal but it's still

522
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,320
there right

523
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:04,000
and what is happening during this phase

524
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:06,559
the imation phase is that some cancer

525
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,799
cells can actually learn how to overcome

526
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:12,000
the immune attacks and out grow and

527
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:14,840
develop into real tumors that are on the

528
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,960
right of of of the slides which which is

529
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:20,799
called The Escape phase or the evasion

530
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:23,840
phase of the immune system and you can

531
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:26,840
you can relate it to a sort of Darin

532
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,960
Evolution uh concept where the cancer

533
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:32,039
cells would evolve to adap adapt to the

534
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,640
immune attacks to actually survive and

535
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:34,960
this is really similar mechanism that

536
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:40,360
are occurring

537
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:42,320
here then in that case here why then the

538
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,960
immune system wouldn't be able to still

539
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,360
attack these cells what are the

540
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:50,159
mechanism of evasion that makes the the

541
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:52,200
the tumor so resistant to the attacks

542
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,039
and there are different strategies that

543
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,120
the cancer cells have actually to evade

544
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:59,400
the immune system I will highlight two

545
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:02,640
of them uh uh uh here today

546
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:05,039
one is that the cancer cells can become

547
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:07,440
invisible completely invisible they can

548
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,880
hide from the immune system how do they

549
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,200
do that I don't know if there are some

550
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,799
Game of Thrones fans in the room they

551
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:17,039
can actually build a wall surrounding

552
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:19,840
them they can corrupt the cells around

553
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:22,840
around them to make them build the wall

554
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:25,120
surrounding the tumor tissue and this is

555
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:29,039
not fantasy I can show you an actual

556
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:30,760
microscopy example this is a l tumor in

557
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:34,120
blue in the middle you can see the

558
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:36,480
cancer cells in red here you have the

559
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:39,440
fibers of fibronectin that are really

560
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:42,240
building this wall around the cancer

561
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:44,200
cells and the immune cells in green here

562
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,640
you can see them they're stuck within

563
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:49,880
outside of the tumor tissue it just

564
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:52,000
cannot get there in that case the tumors

565
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:54,279
is completely invisible and the immune

566
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,200
system cannot do anything so that's one

567
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:58,919
of the evasion mechanism that is quite

568
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:01,279
striking on this image here another

569
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:03,919
strategy is even though the immune cells

570
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:05,120
can get there cancer cells can become

571
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:07,640
highly

572
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:10,240
resistant and I we that there are many

573
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:12,840
resistance mechanism but one of the key

574
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:16,960
resistance mechanisms is depicted in

575
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:18,880
this cartoon here remember this uh this

576
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,360
this slide when I showed this cancer

577
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:24,520
cell surrounded by immune cells that

578
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:28,039
tried to to to destroy it what could

579
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:30,520
happen is cancer cells can also hijack

580
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:31,480
one of the normal uh functions of the

581
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:34,760
immune

582
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:38,240
systems called hijacking the checkpoint

583
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:41,120
molecules so in the first panel of the

584
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,880
cartoon the t- cells in blue here which

585
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:46,200
I don't know why there are archers in

586
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:48,880
that case um have the ID card of the

587
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:52,480
cancer cells in their hands and they're

588
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:55,159
supposed to attack them however the

589
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:57,960
cancer cells can fight back by using

590
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:58,919
pdl1 which is the baseball B baseball

591
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,240
bat

592
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:03,640
and Target pd1 on the surface on the

593
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:05,799
head of the t- cells this would

594
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:07,880
completely dysmantle t- cells it would

595
00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:10,679
be dysfunctional and then the tumor can

596
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:12,760
then evade the immune system again here

597
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:15,399
instead of a Caron I wanted to show you

598
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:19,640
what is actually when we look at it in

599
00:25:15,399 --> 00:25:22,720
situ when we look at at a human tumor by

600
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:27,039
giving an example of colcy

601
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:28,480
cancer in pink here are the cancer cells

602
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:30,640
and in the light blue you can see see

603
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:33,320
the immune cells the first thing that

604
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,799
you see in this microscopy image is that

605
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:38,559
again you can have a sense of the wall

606
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:41,919
that the immune cells right seems to be

607
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:44,679
stuck outside of the tumor tissue right

608
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:46,559
so you have also this so none of them

609
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:50,840
are actually separated they can all

610
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:53,840
converge and be in play in the same time

611
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:55,919
if we zoom on one of the region for

612
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,399
example here in this region when we can

613
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:59,840
see that there are some immune cells

614
00:25:57,399 --> 00:26:02,600
that could get there

615
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:05,960
right what we see I don't know if you

616
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:10,039
can actually see that nicely here it's

617
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:13,760
all of these cells in orange or red as

618
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:15,760
you can see Express pdl1 so the bat is

619
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:18,240
there even though they made it there

620
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:20,440
they could get through the tumor tissue

621
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,360
they still are completely dysfunctional

622
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:24,039
because the PDL one is expressed highly

623
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:26,640
on the surface of the cancer cells and

624
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:29,279
that dismantled their function so this

625
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:32,760
is an active mechanism of resistance by

626
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:33,919
the cancer cells that really can avoid

627
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:37,399
the immune

628
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:39,360
destruction but what can we do if there

629
00:26:37,399 --> 00:26:42,159
are so many different strategies of

630
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:43,919
invisibility of resistance how can we

631
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:45,960
actually boost the immune response to

632
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:48,520
the context of cancer and what are the

633
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:53,080
strategies that we can do in clinic

634
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:55,520
nowadays there are three main therapies

635
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:57,520
so therapies that affect the immune

636
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,440
system are called immunotherapies so I

637
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:03,039
we use this terminology for the rest of

638
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:06,000
my talk so cancer immunotherapies have

639
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:08,679
have three kinds one is modulating this

640
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,200
checkpoint the signals that actually

641
00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:14,640
inhibit the immune system one strategy

642
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:17,799
is if the the immune cells are

643
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:20,279
outnumbered then let's just put more so

644
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:22,679
it's a strategy of actually overcoming

645
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:25,279
the the the low amount of immune cells

646
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:27,000
in the tumor tissue and the last

647
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:29,159
strategy is something that has been

648
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,760
around from the beginning of the world

649
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:34,880
of Immunology is making cancer vaccines

650
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:36,960
so actually preparing the immune system

651
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,559
to recognize better cancer cells to

652
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,919
destroy them even before they would

653
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:44,840
outgrow and become a real tumor it's

654
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:46,960
really trying to stop a fire before it

655
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:49,519
spreads a small fire before it

656
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:52,080
spreads I will give you one example of

657
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:54,000
each strategies the first one is uh

658
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:57,640
immune checkpoint blockade

659
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:00,760
therapy where in this cartoon again here

660
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:03,519
you can see pretty simply that the

661
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:05,559
strategy is just if the cancer cells can

662
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:08,320
use the bat against the t- cells the

663
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:10,519
killer T cells let's just put a helmet

664
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:14,039
on these cells and then they will be

665
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:18,120
protected and you know what that

666
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:21,120
works that actually works by adding this

667
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:23,080
helmet the pd1 checkpoint blockade we

668
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,840
would actually protect the T cells from

669
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:27,399
being uh uh inhibited by cancer cells

670
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:31,039
and allow them to work better and then

671
00:28:27,399 --> 00:28:35,200
they can they can again fight

672
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:38,000
cancer this strategy got the most recent

673
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:41,559
Immunology Nobel price in 2018 by G

674
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,200
Madison and tasuku honjo but I also want

675
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:44,799
to highlight people that were also

676
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,799
involved in the discoveries leaping

677
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:49,240
chain in Yale but also two broes that

678
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:52,480
are also part of the

679
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:54,600
community Gordon Freeman and Arin Shar

680
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,720
because these type of therapies were

681
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,320
really GameChanger in Cancer Care some

682
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,360
cancers that were completely and

683
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:03,760
treatable with chemotherapy the standard

684
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:05,120
of care when now actually had some hope

685
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,399
because of this immun checkpoint

686
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:09,200
blockade

687
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:11,600
therapies the second aspect is also

688
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,440
quite simple in in the reasoning right

689
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:16,519
it's just there is not enough immune

690
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:19,919
cells let's just put more one of the

691
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:23,279
strategy actually is uh uh is highly

692
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:25,120
clever is using the best of both world

693
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:26,799
we know there are these killer T cells

694
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,519
that are highly efficient of of

695
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:31,279
recognizing

696
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:34,240
remembering and killing cancer cells but

697
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:36,399
we know also that antibodies have this

698
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,279
highly precise and specific way of

699
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:41,200
recognizing what is not supposed to be

700
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:43,039
there right so let's just combine them

701
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,880
let's just put an antibody on the

702
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:48,960
surface of te- cells this is called car

703
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:51,240
te cell therapies and the principle is

704
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:54,799
that we would take tea cells from

705
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:56,799
patients we would genetically add the

706
00:29:54,799 --> 00:30:00,559
recognition portion of the antibody on

707
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:03,159
the surface of this t says the car we

708
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:05,480
would multiply them in vitro and then

709
00:30:03,159 --> 00:30:08,159
put them back to the patient and that

710
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:10,279
would actually enhance the recognition

711
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:14,320
of cancer cells and also enhance the

712
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:17,039
killing aspects this C cell therapy

713
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:20,640
completely cured some cancers some

714
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:22,960
lymphoma were completely cured than to

715
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:26,159
the carticel therapies for

716
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:28,480
example the other strategies is still

717
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:30,679
controversial nowadays I have to say it

718
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:33,720
has been around for decades and decades

719
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:35,440
and decades but they were not pretty

720
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:38,880
effective 50 years

721
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:41,279
ago the cancer vaccines I took this

722
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:44,360
Magazine review that was published in

723
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:46,159
2004 so 20 years ago and back then they

724
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:49,600
were already questioning if it if it is

725
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:52,640
a hype or a hope

726
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:55,720
and I have to say for the past 20 years

727
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:59,679
the results were not quite right however

728
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:02,919
since 5 years since 20 everything

729
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:05,080
changed and you will understand why

730
00:31:02,919 --> 00:31:07,440
there are so many different literatures

731
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:11,120
that are like Reviving The Field of

732
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:14,480
cancer vaccines because of specific new

733
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:17,760
uh strategies new uh I would say tools

734
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:20,399
to improve cancer vaccines highlight I

735
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:23,760
highlighted in in in green or in in

736
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:26,720
yellow some names which are basically

737
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:28,960
the names of uh the researchers behind

738
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:32,840
biotechn and mod

739
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:36,960
we all know that uh with covid vaccines

740
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:39,399
uh the the way the the new methodology

741
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,919
behind vaccines could actually bring

742
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:45,240
more hope into cancer

743
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:47,000
vaccines right now and there are some

744
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:49,159
recent clinical trials that show that

745
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,720
some cancer vaccine are highly effective

746
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:54,399
in cancers that were completely

747
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:59,039
Refractories to any therapies such as

748
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:59,039
pancreatic cancer for example here

749
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:03,279
because of all of these years of

750
00:32:01,399 --> 00:32:05,080
strategies understanding better how the

751
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:07,480
immune system works understanding the

752
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:09,159
cancer immunity cycle understanding the

753
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:12,399
different components of the immune

754
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:14,799
system it finally got to place as a one

755
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:17,799
of the five pillars of cancer treatment

756
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:20,919
and Cancer Care originally there was

757
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:23,200
only surgery that was feasible for those

758
00:32:20,919 --> 00:32:25,440
patients then there was the emergence of

759
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:28,639
radiotherapy or chemotherapy that is

760
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:31,639
still heavily used these two then became

761
00:32:28,639 --> 00:32:34,919
the world of targeted therapies and

762
00:32:31,639 --> 00:32:37,000
immunotherapies despite the fact that

763
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:38,320
that immunotherapies could change Cancer

764
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,720
Care

765
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,919
nowadays uh is still quite limited I

766
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,519
have to say we are still at the

767
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:46,360
beginning of the Revolution regarding

768
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:48,000
immunotherapies and I will give one

769
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:51,159
example

770
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,880
here this is a Klan Meer curve so this

771
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:55,279
is a survival curve for the one the the

772
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:58,039
the people that are not really used to

773
00:32:55,279 --> 00:33:01,039
these curves this is basically showing

774
00:32:58,039 --> 00:33:04,279
the survival of the patients over

775
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:06,960
time between three different groups I is

776
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:10,080
a patient that got two different types

777
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:11,960
of immunotherapy neolab or epab which

778
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:14,760
are just different types of helmets

779
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:16,919
basically the green and the blue and the

780
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:18,279
red is basically adding the two helmets

781
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:20,639
on top of each

782
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:22,600
others because the rational again here

783
00:33:20,639 --> 00:33:25,559
was maybe we can improve the protection

784
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:28,240
by having two helmets at the same time

785
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:32,559
and you can see that it works actually

786
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:35,039
by adding only epil mumab we got 27 so

787
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:36,919
31 patient out of three actually

788
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:39,760
responded pretty well and survived well

789
00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:41,919
to the therapist by adding this helmet

790
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:44,840
in blue it's actually more effective one

791
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:47,480
patient out of two but combining both

792
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:49,679
gave rise to almost 60% of the patient

793
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:51,639
that would respond well and and had

794
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:53,720
survival benefit with

795
00:33:51,639 --> 00:33:57,200
immunotherapies but these numbers also

796
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:58,440
mean that 40% in that case would fail to

797
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,480
respond to

798
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:02,519
immunotherapies and we have to

799
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:05,919
understand also that immunotherapies the

800
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:08,879
principle is quite simple it's boosting

801
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:12,280
our own our own immune defense right our

802
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:15,399
own defense so why 40% of the patient

803
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:18,839
will not respond well and this is by the

804
00:34:15,399 --> 00:34:21,879
combination therapy but here half of the

805
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:24,720
patient do not respond at all and here

806
00:34:21,879 --> 00:34:26,520
70% of the patient do not respond at all

807
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:28,599
it's always nice to look at the numbers

808
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:32,839
the other way around

809
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:34,960
and the goal is really to understand why

810
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:37,520
immunotherapies are not applicable to

811
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:40,119
everybody and also what can we do to

812
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:42,879
improve therapeutic

813
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:45,280
efficacy and right now most of the field

814
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:48,960
has been focusing on the helmets so

815
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:51,399
basically trying to make fancier helmets

816
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:54,159
heavier helmets combining different

817
00:34:51,399 --> 00:34:56,440
helmets but the numbers are not

818
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:59,920
improving just by trying to put more

819
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:01,760
helmets on the surface of the cells and

820
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:05,000
the field is more recognizing that the

821
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:08,400
immune system is more complex of course

822
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:11,800
that we have seen earlier but is is not

823
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:14,240
only composed of killer T cells and

824
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,880
cancer cells the Killer and the target

825
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:18,400
there is more complexities and more

826
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:20,960
different flavors of immune cells can we

827
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:24,760
harness these other immune cells

828
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:27,240
actually here I switch gears I showed

829
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:29,640
you lung cancer then coloral cancer here

830
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:32,359
it's an image of melanoma skin cancer a

831
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:35,720
type of skin cancer the cancer cells are

832
00:35:32,359 --> 00:35:40,480
depicted here in green and blue and in

833
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:44,720
Gray are all the other cells in the

834
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:46,800
environment and here on this the same

835
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:49,640
image then I highlighted these other

836
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,720
cells and to show you what they are you

837
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:53,680
can see that the kiler T cells are the

838
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,960
cells in light blue you have one here

839
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:58,079
you have one

840
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:01,319
here but you can see also Bur bunch of

841
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:03,040
other cells right B cells in red

842
00:36:01,319 --> 00:36:05,839
depicted here the one producing

843
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:08,079
antibodies helper T cells and another

844
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:10,480
type of the cells in Orange here here

845
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:12,640
and here and also microf fages microf

846
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:15,800
fages are the immune cells that are from

847
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:18,400
the innate uh part of immunity that just

848
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:22,040
eats everything so they are they are

849
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:24,280
super efficient there when you have uh

850
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:26,760
destroyed cancer cell to actually clear

851
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:29,359
the place and discard the the the

852
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:32,440
actually the dead canc cells so it's

853
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:36,520
more complex and the question around

854
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:39,160
that is can we try to change the

855
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:41,960
environment to provide the kiler T cells

856
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:44,720
a more supportive environment and not

857
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:48,079
trying to make them work harder faster

858
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:50,400
better it's also a philosophical concept

859
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:53,560
about how we would treat our trainers

860
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,560
nowadays at the same

861
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:57,680
time so I will give you now some

862
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:59,680
insights about the lab because this is

863
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:02,240
kind of the core of our research is

864
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:06,119
trying to find to find a new angle to

865
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:08,800
tackle cancer the angle we chose is to

866
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:11,480
leverage B cells the other immune cells

867
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:13,520
from the Adaptive uh Kingdom that are

868
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:15,599
producing these

869
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,119
antibodies and these are the cells at

870
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:20,400
the beginning they look like these cute

871
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:22,119
cells that could be useless and then

872
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,400
when they get angry they produce all of

873
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:25,839
these different antibodies that are

874
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,200
highly

875
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:30,920
specific why should we care about B

876
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:34,359
cells it because they are everywhere and

877
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:37,760
in all the cancers as possible on this

878
00:37:34,359 --> 00:37:39,760
plot um this figure you have each colon

879
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:42,880
represent one different cancer types so

880
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:46,359
you have 29 different cancer types in

881
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:49,720
Gray each tack are different immune

882
00:37:46,359 --> 00:37:51,079
cells in purple I highlighted the B

883
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:53,040
cells and you can see that they are

884
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:55,720
present everywhere in each one of

885
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,720
different cancer

886
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:01,000
cells however the way we look at this is

887
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:03,920
this is nice this is correlative they

888
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:06,640
are there but how can we predict their

889
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:10,640
function in these different cancers a

890
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:13,599
simple way is to look to relate the

891
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:16,400
abundance of the cells and the outcome

892
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:18,000
of the patient to look into the more a

893
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,640
patient have B cells how does that

894
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,359
change the survival of the

895
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:24,160
patient and this is a summary here

896
00:38:22,359 --> 00:38:27,079
because this is quite controversial in

897
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,520
the context of B cells in some cancer

898
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:31,520
types

899
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:33,720
such as breast lung or skin cancer the

900
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,640
more a patient has Bell the better it is

901
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:38,400
for the Survivor they survive much

902
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:40,599
better in some cancers there is just no

903
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,560
effect that's the case of brain colon or

904
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:44,720
kidney cancer you can have like more or

905
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:46,920
less B cells that doesn't change at all

906
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,920
the survival of the patients and in some

907
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:50,440
other cancers such as adenoid or

908
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:53,119
pancreatic it's actually the other way

909
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:54,800
around the more you have bells the worse

910
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:58,200
it is for your

911
00:38:54,800 --> 00:39:00,880
prognosis so this controvers could be

912
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:03,599
explained by the different flavors of B

913
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:05,720
cells that are found in these cancers

914
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:08,040
maybe that's not the same type of B

915
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:10,280
cells in that tumor then that tumor then

916
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:12,480
that tumor and that might explain why

917
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:15,599
you have these discrepancies there might

918
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:18,079
be bad versus good B cells and that's

919
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:20,480
kind of the core of the lab to identify

920
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:21,680
these different flavors of B cells and

921
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,079
then test

922
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:27,760
them another philosophical question for

923
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:29,960
you to be or not to be this this is the

924
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:32,400
core question of the lab and I hope we

925
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:36,359
are

926
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:38,680
B the lab is really trying to understand

927
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:40,680
the Mosaic of the flavors of B cells

928
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:42,839
within cancers in all the different

929
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:46,359
cancers that can help us to identify

930
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:48,960
actually the the good bells and the bad

931
00:39:46,359 --> 00:39:51,160
Bells the goal would be really to find

932
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:54,000
the one that can promote two more

933
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:56,680
control to keep the tumor in check and

934
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,160
the one that can promote tum more growth

935
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:02,079
again the good versus bad bells and how

936
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:03,800
can we actually Define them what do we

937
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:06,680
do with this information when we have

938
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:09,000
identified by bad or good B cells the

939
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:11,319
goal would be to then Target them to

940
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:14,839
find checkpoints like have been found

941
00:40:11,319 --> 00:40:17,720
for T cells in B cells and that's the

942
00:40:14,839 --> 00:40:22,440
second big aim of the lab big goal of

943
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:25,040
the lab and we were fortunate to have

944
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:27,079
dive into B cells that much in melanoma

945
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,480
coloral cancer lung cancer or breast

946
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:31,640
cancer

947
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:34,480
that we could find some molecules that

948
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:37,240
could promote good B cells and could

949
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:38,520
inhibit bad B cells and we are

950
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:40,200
continuously working about these

951
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:42,839
molecules nowadays I will give you one

952
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:45,920
example of one of them that we recently

953
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:48,200
discovered that is called team one that

954
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:51,040
is a molecule that is spef it's it's

955
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:53,720
it's an equivalent of the pd1 on T cells

956
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:56,440
that I've shown earlier where when this

957
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:58,520
molecule is blocked on B cells then the

958
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:01,240
tum more can be

959
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:03,760
grow this could offer an

960
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:06,599
opportunity to tackle this other angle

961
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:08,400
of the immune system by harnessing and

962
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:11,119
exploiting B cell

963
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:13,800
functionality so this could lead to more

964
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:16,160
promises in in in cancer because instead

965
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:18,240
of adding helmets we would add one

966
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:21,079
helmet and maybe also boosting another

967
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:23,680
immune cells to combat cancer

968
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:26,480
better beyond all of

969
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:28,760
this what we find when we analyze so

970
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,440
many different flavor of bers would be

971
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:32,400
also uh

972
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:34,440
biomarkers and this is really something

973
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:37,920
also that we are investigating in the

974
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:42,440
lab one of the key goal of these types

975
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:45,839
of analysis is to identify cancer

976
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:48,200
fingerprints imagine if we can predict

977
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:51,599
if an individual will develop cancer

978
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:54,480
imagine if we can uh actually predict if

979
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:56,560
a patient will respond or not to

980
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:59,119
immunotherapy that would be key

981
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:01,760
component to help for the diagnosis or

982
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:05,680
actually for the management of these

983
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:09,040
patients and to do this we study

984
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:11,480
antibodies that are produced by B cells

985
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:13,560
and we recently collaborated with a team

986
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:16,599
in San Francisco at

987
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:20,880
UCSF where what we did is we profiled

988
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:23,920
antibody in over 700

989
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:27,359
individuals these individuals were

990
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:30,119
either lung cancer patients

991
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:33,480
at risk of developing lung cancer but

992
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:37,520
asymptomatic so far and healthy

993
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:41,319
individuals then we developed an AI

994
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:46,119
model that could accurately distinguish

995
00:42:41,319 --> 00:42:48,920
if a patient had cancer or was healthy

996
00:42:46,119 --> 00:42:52,079
and we could with this tool efficiently

997
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:54,440
be able to improve potentially the

998
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:56,920
diagnosis of this patient with lung

999
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:59,400
cancer and we hope to expand this type

1000
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:02,200
of analysis to any kind of cancer the

1001
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:04,680
first stage was identifying cancer

1002
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:06,440
versus not cancer so what's supposed to

1003
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:08,960
be there or was not supposed to be there

1004
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:10,839
the self and the nonself but later on

1005
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,680
the goal will be really to identify the

1006
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:15,160
ones that would respond or not respond

1007
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:17,480
to imuno theapy to chemotherapy to

1008
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:21,200
radiotherapy and so on that could really

1009
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:23,760
help the management of of of of cancer

1010
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:27,800
patients so this is the core of the

1011
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:31,119
lab I'm good I'm not too late and as

1012
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:33,720
conclusive notes I would say that the

1013
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:37,079
immune system are like ants this is how

1014
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:39,520
I see the immune system to me I see as a

1015
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:43,359
highly highly

1016
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:45,920
organized Melting Pot of different ants

1017
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:47,920
that serve the same goal that works

1018
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:50,839
together that could be

1019
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:53,440
dangerous sometimes right but at the

1020
00:43:50,839 --> 00:43:56,359
same times that would uh have these

1021
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:58,240
intricacies that makes them to to

1022
00:43:56,359 --> 00:44:00,040
overcome many different

1023
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,960
challenges and there are still

1024
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:04,599
challenges in cancer immunotherapies I

1025
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:06,800
mentioned some of them earlier that

1026
00:44:04,599 --> 00:44:08,160
there are not every patient is actually

1027
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,319
responding to

1028
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:15,720
immunotherapies and I wanted to finish

1029
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:15,720
on the key future challenges for cancer

1030
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:21,000
immunotherapies obviously we need to

1031
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:22,760
improve the response we need to find why

1032
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,599
the patient do not respond and improve

1033
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,880
the

1034
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:27,640
response this also implicate that we

1035
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:30,040
need to understand the resist resistance

1036
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:31,960
mechanisms I give you two example the

1037
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:34,280
invisibility or just the basic

1038
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:35,920
resistance with checkpoints but how can

1039
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:37,480
we alleviate this resistance that's

1040
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,800
something that we really need to

1041
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:41,280
understand

1042
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:43,720
better most of the field right now is

1043
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:47,480
focusing on the resistance they are

1044
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:50,839
trying to add elmets to make the cells

1045
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:52,920
work better faster and be more

1046
00:44:50,839 --> 00:44:56,400
aggressive but you know the immune

1047
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:57,800
system is also dangerous as I mentioned

1048
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,520
like the ants

1049
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:02,920
because if you boost it too much it

1050
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:06,359
could go Rogue and provoke toxicities

1051
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:08,599
and even autoimmune reactions right so

1052
00:45:06,359 --> 00:45:11,000
at the same time that we try to improve

1053
00:45:08,599 --> 00:45:12,559
response to alleviate resistance we also

1054
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,680
need to avoid

1055
00:45:12,559 --> 00:45:19,240
toxicity as an example is in

1056
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:22,720
numbers man's General Hospital and and

1057
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:25,440
and Bram and Women's Hospital treat over

1058
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:29,040
4,000 patients per year with

1059
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:31,160
immunotherapy out of the 4,000 patients

1060
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:35,000
if they were treated with a single

1061
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:37,520
agent only one single helmet for example

1062
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,200
seven out of 10 patient would develop

1063
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:42,559
toxicity but fortunately only one out of

1064
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:44,720
10 would develop severe

1065
00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:46,720
toxicity however if you combine

1066
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:48,839
immunotherapies the two helmet that

1067
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:51,800
provide the most response the 60%

1068
00:45:48,839 --> 00:45:53,880
response then nine out of 10 patients

1069
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:55,880
would develop toxicities which is a huge

1070
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:58,079
number and half of them would would

1071
00:45:55,880 --> 00:46:00,280
develop severe toxicity

1072
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:02,760
so really the the the goal would not be

1073
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:05,280
to add helmets on these cells would be

1074
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:08,040
many to find other angles to to improve

1075
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:10,800
the response right avoiding

1076
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:13,119
toxicities so we recently joined the

1077
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:15,160
forces of a Pioneer in the field of

1078
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:18,200
toxicities Chloe villani that is

1079
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:20,960
depicted here with Will and and David

1080
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:22,800
Ting and we formed this new project

1081
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:25,599
called protect which stands for

1082
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:28,680
promoting response to oo immunologic

1083
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:31,640
therapies while erad ating toxicities

1084
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:33,680
the goal of this project now we we we

1085
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:35,880
actually bridged our forces to

1086
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:37,960
understand the components of the

1087
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:40,359
resistance the components of the

1088
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:43,720
response but also the components of what

1089
00:46:40,359 --> 00:46:46,720
makes makes it toxic to alleviate this

1090
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:48,680
toxicity these immune reactions so wish

1091
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:52,000
us luck for

1092
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:55,359
that so overall these are my my last

1093
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:58,800
slides to learn more about Immunology

1094
00:46:55,359 --> 00:47:01,480
which is really uh uh an amazing field

1095
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:03,920
to learn more about you can go onto the

1096
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:05,720
different soci societies so the American

1097
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:08,280
societies of immunologist or the

1098
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:10,599
international Society of immunologist

1099
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:13,119
some of the cartoons that I have shown I

1100
00:47:10,599 --> 00:47:15,200
took them from uir which is a great

1101
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:18,640
resource to explain immunotherapies to

1102
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:21,520
the Le audience and every April 29th is

1103
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:24,079
the uh International Immunology day and

1104
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:26,400
there are many events across town and in

1105
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:29,280
the world so please look out for that

1106
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:32,559
and then if you have kids or teenagers I

1107
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:35,640
highly s recommend this book that exist

1108
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:38,079
in many languages about the immune

1109
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:40,000
system and that's kind of a fantastic

1110
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:43,359
resource and you have the QR code here

1111
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:45,960
to to download it with this I really

1112
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:48,480
want to thank you for your attention um

1113
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:51,119
here is my lab that is between the broad

1114
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:55,680
and and my general hospital and then we

1115
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:58,760
recently won uh the lab Olympics last

1116
00:47:55,680 --> 00:48:01,520
summer and what we we won because of

1117
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:04,480
what because we had the best slogan

1118
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:04,480
which was let it

1119
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:14,760
be one last slide um about some recent

1120
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:16,559
events you know in research or In Clinic

1121
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:19,000
Cancer Care and all of these therapies

1122
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:21,160
and all of these studies wouldn't exist

1123
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,599
wouldn't actually be happening without

1124
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:25,800
the infrastructure and especially the

1125
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:27,839
administrative infrastructure so I want

1126
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:32,319
to take the opportunity today also to

1127
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:34,920
acknowledge them both at MGB Harvard or

1128
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:37,400
also at the broad that without them I

1129
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:39,119
wouldn't be standing here today and the

1130
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:41,319
advancement in the field wouldn't have

1131
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:42,599
happened at the same time thank you for

1132
00:48:41,319 --> 00:48:44,880
your attention that was a pleasure to be

1133
00:48:42,599 --> 00:48:44,880
with you

1134
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:53,480
tonight thank you so much Lloyd now if

1135
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:55,720
you had told me ahead of time that April

1136
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:58,119
29th was International Immunology day we

1137
00:48:55,720 --> 00:49:01,119
would have scheduled the talk for then

1138
00:48:58,119 --> 00:49:03,160
mhm true if you have any questions the

1139
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:06,200
mics are yours uh we have a couple of

1140
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:08,480
mic Runners here who are um here to hand

1141
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:10,119
things up but before we actually dive

1142
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:11,720
into the the audience questions I would

1143
00:49:10,119 --> 00:49:13,440
just want to ask you a question really

1144
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:16,240
quickly Lloyd can you just describe real

1145
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:19,240
quickly your your career path um how did

1146
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:20,599
you get interested in Immunology in

1147
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:26,240
cancer and how did you come to be at the

1148
00:49:20,599 --> 00:49:30,040
bir and at MGH yeah um so it's it's it's

1149
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:32,720
a it's it's a interesting pass I when I

1150
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:34,599
was a teenager I grew up in martinic

1151
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:36,160
that's a small French island in car you

1152
00:49:34,599 --> 00:49:37,920
can you could tell from the my first

1153
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:41,079
sentence that I was French right my

1154
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:42,880
accent I cannot hide it that well um and

1155
00:49:41,079 --> 00:49:45,839
I grew up in in in Martin and I was

1156
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:49,079
always interested by surgery actually I

1157
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:51,920
went into a mdphd program in Paris and I

1158
00:49:49,079 --> 00:49:53,880
did many many surgeries then I remember

1159
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:56,079
that class when they were teaching

1160
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:57,760
immunology and that completely snapped

1161
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:59,839
my brain

1162
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:01,559
I was so fascinated about all the

1163
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:03,480
different possibilities and complicities

1164
00:50:01,559 --> 00:50:05,640
of Immunology so I decided to move on

1165
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:09,760
and do a PhD in immunology and so on and

1166
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:12,040
so on and then uh my uncle uh developed

1167
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:17,040
melanoma Advanced metastatic

1168
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:20,000
melanoma and he got in 2012 he got uh

1169
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:23,680
actually in a complete remission uh with

1170
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:25,640
anti C4 on tpd1 so the the two helmets

1171
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:28,240
that I've shown earlier and that

1172
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:32,280
actually prolong is is life for 10 more

1173
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:35,000
years and that also is why I decided to

1174
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:37,720
focus on on cancerology and moved here

1175
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:40,079
to develop my program and to make better

1176
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:42,319
helmets yeah

1177
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:44,920
exactly uh I think we had a question

1178
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:47,400
right down the front here yeah so so my

1179
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:50,119
question is um about the immune system

1180
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:53,559
and what happens to it during pregnancy

1181
00:50:50,119 --> 00:50:58,440
oh great question so remember about the

1182
00:50:53,559 --> 00:51:02,760
the concepts the defense the tolerance

1183
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:06,799
the the pregnancy is a is a such an

1184
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:11,359
example because the fetus is actually

1185
00:51:06,799 --> 00:51:14,559
quite not exactly self it should be

1186
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:17,119
the mother self right but it's half of

1187
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:18,960
the father self so the immune system is

1188
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:20,440
actually trying to attack it because it

1189
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,960
recognize it as something that is not

1190
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:26,079
supposed to be there which is not self

1191
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:28,760
so again here the immune system learns

1192
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:32,160
how to tolerate the fetus and allow the

1193
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:34,839
fetus to grow and that that mechanism is

1194
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:37,599
really about I use a lot of terms that

1195
00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:40,760
are used in the society like education

1196
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:42,839
the immune system then get educated to

1197
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:45,000
tolerate the fetus and let them grow

1198
00:51:42,839 --> 00:51:47,599
that's a great

1199
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,960
question question over here yes uh can

1200
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:53,839
you hear me yeah yes so you you talked

1201
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:56,160
about hygiene and innate immunity right

1202
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:59,280
so I have a two-part question one is is

1203
00:51:56,160 --> 00:52:04,599
too much hygiene a bad thing and number

1204
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:06,680
two isn't cancer a last 50e

1205
00:52:04,599 --> 00:52:08,440
environmental you know thingy that's

1206
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:10,480
come up now and we're all trying to work

1207
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:12,640
on it and figure out what's going on

1208
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:14,680
yeah and it wasn't there many years ago

1209
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:17,400
yeah so for the first part of your

1210
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:20,680
question it's actually a good point um

1211
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:24,160
there is in there was in the 1970 the

1212
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:26,760
hygiene theory meaning that the more we

1213
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:29,480
are protected against infections the

1214
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:31,640
more we are weakened and the more we the

1215
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:33,720
immune system doesn't know what to

1216
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:35,319
protect ourselves from so it start to

1217
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:37,880
attacking ourselves and this is the

1218
00:52:35,319 --> 00:52:41,440
hygiene Theory which could be the case

1219
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:43,799
in in some cases and there are studies

1220
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:46,760
unfortunately in the statistics that do

1221
00:52:43,799 --> 00:52:48,799
not show that the hene theor is tense

1222
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:51,880
but this is theories that are out there

1223
00:52:48,799 --> 00:52:54,799
in the case of cancer you know with the

1224
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:58,880
numbers increasing over the past years

1225
00:52:54,799 --> 00:53:00,720
and so on since the 198 to now so it's

1226
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:03,480
not entirely fair to say that they

1227
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:05,839
increase it's also that we diagnose them

1228
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:08,119
much better we have the Technologies

1229
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:10,040
nowadays to diagnose so efficiently

1230
00:53:08,119 --> 00:53:13,000
cancer at the Single Cell of cancer that

1231
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:15,920
a patient has or to diagnose allergy

1232
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:18,079
very quickly so the tools change so we

1233
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:20,880
see more of them maybe also because we

1234
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:24,040
have the tools to see them uh more often

1235
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:26,680
but what you said is also right that the

1236
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:30,079
way of life the new environmental change

1237
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:33,319
es the the pollution the diets and so on

1238
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:36,760
are also factors that provoke cancer

1239
00:53:33,319 --> 00:53:39,480
more efficiently one of the saddest part

1240
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:42,240
of it is that usually cancer is seen is

1241
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:45,000
elderly populations but nowadays we see

1242
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:47,359
more into uh young people and these

1243
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:50,480
young un set cancers are now a question

1244
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:52,160
about why do they rise so fast and

1245
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:54,359
actually they also more aggressive in

1246
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:56,760
the young populations so you're totally

1247
00:53:54,359 --> 00:53:59,200
right these also are questions about the

1248
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:59,200
way of

1249
00:54:01,319 --> 00:54:06,839
life actually while the mic is making

1250
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:10,040
its way so you mentioned t- cells a lot

1251
00:54:06,839 --> 00:54:12,040
Yeah you mentioned B cells a lot yeah

1252
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:16,000
are there other cells within the immune

1253
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:18,640
system um that also play a role in in

1254
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:22,000
cancer surveillance in in in attacking

1255
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:24,680
cancers yeah totally so I mention a lot

1256
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:27,079
T cells and B cells because at the end

1257
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:29,960
these are the only cells that can carry

1258
00:54:27,079 --> 00:54:32,200
this memory and you know this feature of

1259
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:34,359
the immune system to remember the threat

1260
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:36,480
is kind of what we really need to go to

1261
00:54:34,359 --> 00:54:38,520
go after to prevent the occurrence of

1262
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:40,160
cancer later on but you're totally right

1263
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:42,040
there are other cells in the innate

1264
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:44,240
Kingdom of the immune system that are

1265
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:46,079
highly affected to I mentioned the

1266
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:48,040
microf fages that's really helpful to

1267
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:50,040
actually clear out cancer cells but you

1268
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:53,599
have also a cell type that has a name

1269
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:56,920
prol which is natural killer cells and

1270
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:58,440
their function is to kill the basic

1271
00:54:56,920 --> 00:55:00,559
function they will not check the

1272
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:03,359
specificities they will not have the

1273
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:05,839
memory aspects they will just have a on

1274
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:08,440
and off R of killing and not killing and

1275
00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:11,960
this has play also an important role in

1276
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:15,200
cancer Yeah question over here hello it

1277
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:17,240
was really interesed talk and I want to

1278
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:20,119
ask about what technologies are

1279
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:22,960
currently uh Innovative to understand

1280
00:55:20,119 --> 00:55:25,079
better the relationship between uh all

1281
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:28,440
the types of immune cells and also if

1282
00:55:25,079 --> 00:55:31,119
you think like because you lab like

1283
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:34,680
trans omic that you also do like uh

1284
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:38,400
research on on that like uh how do you

1285
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:40,039
approach approach yeah so uh thank you

1286
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:42,319
for that question some of the key

1287
00:55:40,039 --> 00:55:45,760
Technologies were actually from the

1288
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:48,400
broad and they Revolution the world of

1289
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:50,280
research nowadays again monoclonal

1290
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:53,039
antibodies were the first phase of

1291
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:55,720
Revolution and the genomics field were

1292
00:55:53,039 --> 00:56:00,559
also the second phase of Revolution now

1293
00:55:55,720 --> 00:56:02,760
we can understand at a high depth each

1294
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:04,760
single genes each single proteins that

1295
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:08,400
are produced by each single cells of the

1296
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:11,039
body which is too many data but with

1297
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:13,039
this if we have a focus question then we

1298
00:56:11,039 --> 00:56:14,720
can actually leverage these Technologies

1299
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:17,480
to understand better the relationship

1300
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:20,319
between cells and also there are

1301
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:23,319
different flavors there are continuity

1302
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:25,319
so the dynamic over time before therapy

1303
00:56:23,319 --> 00:56:27,520
after therapy and this is something that

1304
00:56:25,319 --> 00:56:30,920
we leverage here the genomics aspect a

1305
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:34,319
lot in the lab at the broad and at

1306
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:35,440
MGH thank you thank you I could just

1307
00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:37,799
repeat the questions of the people

1308
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:41,079
watching online yeah the questions is

1309
00:56:37,799 --> 00:56:43,559
related to how T cells and what what T

1310
00:56:41,079 --> 00:56:45,400
cells recognize if all T cells recognize

1311
00:56:43,559 --> 00:56:47,280
the same thing or you have different

1312
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:49,720
divers T cells that recognize different

1313
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:52,599
things and then how they grow and then

1314
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:54,799
you touch on on on also unique feature

1315
00:56:52,599 --> 00:56:56,400
of T cells and B cells which is that

1316
00:56:54,799 --> 00:56:58,440
when they know what they should should

1317
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:59,720
recognize and they can recognize many

1318
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:02,240
different

1319
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:04,319
things when each one recog has a

1320
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:05,200
specific Target in mind they can

1321
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:07,799
actually

1322
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:11,799
multiply so we call that clonal

1323
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:14,400
expansion so they they expand towards a

1324
00:57:11,799 --> 00:57:17,319
specific targeting a specific unique

1325
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:18,920
molecule and you can have multiple

1326
00:57:17,319 --> 00:57:21,520
different clones so they recognize

1327
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:23,599
multiple different antigens that we call

1328
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:27,559
which are the different targets and that

1329
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:29,480
is happening for T cells and B cells yes

1330
00:57:27,559 --> 00:57:30,760
I'm trying to remember how many like I

1331
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:32,720
know there's a number out there like a

1332
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:34,559
theoretical number of how many different

1333
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:38,000
targets your immune system is able to

1334
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:40,720
handle it's like 10 to the to the power

1335
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,599
of 18 it's it's really trillions and

1336
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:45,440
trillions and trillions of Target the

1337
00:57:42,599 --> 00:57:49,119
diversity we call it the repertoire of

1338
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:51,200
the immune system is so diverse and that

1339
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:53,440
evolved actually across the normal

1340
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:55,720
evolution of the human being to be able

1341
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:58,720
to recognize so many different threats

1342
00:57:55,720 --> 00:58:01,799
so the diversity is also a a function of

1343
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:05,720
our protection to recognize any any

1344
00:58:01,799 --> 00:58:08,920
flavors of B bacteries viruses cancers

1345
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:10,839
that we can encounter yeah good question

1346
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:13,119
question up there thank you I have a

1347
00:58:10,839 --> 00:58:15,280
slightly specific question for the CT

1348
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:17,359
therapy how do you design the chimeric

1349
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:19,480
antigen receptor like how what's the

1350
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:22,319
inventory strategy to make sure it's

1351
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:24,839
specific to the tumor yeah so first you

1352
00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:26,720
have we have to have in mind a Target we

1353
00:58:24,839 --> 00:58:30,280
have to have a sense of what what the

1354
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:32,440
the cancer looks like right so C cell

1355
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:33,839
therapy were the proof of concept was

1356
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:36,880
established with

1357
00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:39,559
lymphoma so lymphoma is actually a

1358
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:42,119
cancer of our own immune cells in the B

1359
00:58:39,559 --> 00:58:46,119
cell lloma that's our own B cells that

1360
00:58:42,119 --> 00:58:48,280
would expand in an anarchic way and

1361
00:58:46,119 --> 00:58:49,799
would would really become their own

1362
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:52,119
tumor

1363
00:58:49,799 --> 00:58:54,039
right but there is something in common

1364
00:58:52,119 --> 00:58:57,119
is that they are B cells all of them are

1365
00:58:54,039 --> 00:58:58,920
B cells so they have proteins of B cells

1366
00:58:57,119 --> 00:59:02,960
on their surface even if they became

1367
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:04,079
cancer cells right so we could arm

1368
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:07,559
that's how that's how we call it

1369
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:09,680
actually the car the the t- cells with

1370
00:59:07,559 --> 00:59:12,760
only the recognition function of the

1371
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:15,200
antibody that we took from a monoclonal

1372
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:17,920
antibody mount it on the surface of the

1373
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:20,440
t- cells against one of the B cell

1374
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:22,280
proteins and then they would kill every

1375
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:24,640
B cells not only the cancer cells

1376
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:26,359
actually so that's a great point because

1377
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:29,520
now it's really difficult to make the

1378
00:59:26,359 --> 00:59:32,760
distinction between what is the ID of an

1379
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:35,359
exact cancer cells or the ID of just a

1380
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:38,160
normal cells can we make the distinction

1381
00:59:35,359 --> 00:59:40,880
between normal pancreatic cells or

1382
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:43,760
pancreatic cancer cells this is really

1383
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:45,359
tricky questions uh now with car T cells

1384
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:47,799
it's still limited to make this

1385
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:50,119
distinction but the field is moving

1386
00:59:47,799 --> 00:59:53,480
pretty fast toward identifying the

1387
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:55,039
subtleties between the two thank you

1388
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:57,760
great question one more question over

1389
00:59:55,039 --> 01:00:00,680
here yes when you're when you're

1390
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:03,839
developing uh IM immunotherapies have

1391
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:06,920
you found much commonality across

1392
01:00:03,839 --> 01:00:11,079
patients in the antigens you're trying

1393
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:13,880
to develop uh antibodies against yeah or

1394
01:00:11,079 --> 01:00:16,359
is it just very individualized and even

1395
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:19,400
within a single patient do you find

1396
01:00:16,359 --> 01:00:22,240
different clones that have different

1397
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:24,240
antigens that you have H how how much

1398
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:26,960
customization do you have to do or there

1399
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:29,039
patterns that you that you that you yeah

1400
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:31,280
now that's a great question the dream

1401
01:00:29,039 --> 01:00:33,039
would be to have an off offthe shelf

1402
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:36,839
therapy that could work for every

1403
01:00:33,039 --> 01:00:39,079
patient right the helmet is kind of this

1404
01:00:36,839 --> 01:00:42,319
of the shell therapy then we would be

1405
01:00:39,079 --> 01:00:44,319
agnostic of the antigens of the type of

1406
01:00:42,319 --> 01:00:47,000
cancers and so on we would just give a

1407
01:00:44,319 --> 01:00:49,079
helmet to the T cells and they would

1408
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:52,079
recognize whatever they recognize and

1409
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:55,119
then kill better right however it's

1410
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:58,839
still failing a lot so now the field is

1411
01:00:55,119 --> 01:01:00,880
more looking more into distinguishing at

1412
01:00:58,839 --> 01:01:04,920
an individual

1413
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:07,359
level what are specif personalized to

1414
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:10,119
that patient to that cancer types and

1415
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:11,960
that's more related to the C therapy for

1416
01:01:10,119 --> 01:01:15,119
example that will evolve or also the

1417
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:16,880
cancer vaccines and more and more that's

1418
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:18,799
more related to the cancer vaccine phe

1419
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:20,440
for immunotherapy globally it's mostly

1420
01:01:18,799 --> 01:01:23,079
trying just to boost the response

1421
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:25,640
without having every specificity Patient

1422
01:01:23,079 --> 01:01:27,280
to Patient actually thank you for the

1423
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:31,640
question

1424
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:34,319
so last question yeah five 10 years from

1425
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:36,920
now like how do you see this story of

1426
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:40,160
cancer in the immune system

1427
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:44,799
unfolding I think more and

1428
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:46,599
more we will hopefully have the strategy

1429
01:01:44,799 --> 01:01:49,880
of

1430
01:01:46,599 --> 01:01:52,760
promoting the othero immune cells

1431
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:55,359
involving the network the

1432
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:57,839
interconnection between the system not

1433
01:01:55,359 --> 01:02:00,440
only trying try to put a helmet stronger

1434
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:03,799
but really trying to understand better

1435
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:07,440
when when when the tumor evaded the

1436
01:02:03,799 --> 01:02:11,240
immune system which cells were involved

1437
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:13,799
in The Invasion where does that happen

1438
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:15,279
what is happening and by understanding

1439
01:02:13,799 --> 01:02:17,400
unfolding all of this with the new

1440
01:02:15,279 --> 01:02:19,079
technologies I believe that in 5 10

1441
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:21,319
years from now there will be more

1442
01:02:19,079 --> 01:02:23,200
combination therapies but instead of

1443
01:02:21,319 --> 01:02:25,039
combining on the same cell type would be

1444
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:26,760
combining across different cell types

1445
01:02:25,039 --> 01:02:29,200
and different context

1446
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:31,799
and hopefully there are many promises

1447
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:35,079
but the cancer vaccines might be also

1448
01:02:31,799 --> 01:02:36,960
effective in 5 to 10 years fingers Quest

1449
01:02:35,079 --> 01:02:38,440
so Immunology day five years from now

1450
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:40,839
we're getting you back on stage we're

1451
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:42,799
going to see if you're right okay sounds

1452
01:02:40,839 --> 01:02:45,559
good thank you so much Lloyd thank you

1453
01:02:42,799 --> 01:02:47,319
thank you so much thank you and thank

1454
01:02:45,559 --> 01:02:49,720
you also to all of you in the room and

1455
01:02:47,319 --> 01:02:51,920
online who have been watching us tonight

1456
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:53,440
uh we will let you know when our next uh

1457
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:54,440
broad Discovery series will be it's

1458
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:56,359
probably going to be sometime this

1459
01:02:54,440 --> 01:03:01,760
spring I hope you all join Jo us then

1460
01:02:56,359 --> 01:03:01,760
again and with that have a great night
