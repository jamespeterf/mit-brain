00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,879
John Lou asks, "How do we understand the

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,320
roles that can best support advanced

3
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:10,639
manufacturing? A new program from MIT

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,519
aims to give shopf flooror workers a

5
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,599
ladder to become shopf flooror leaders,

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,240
technologists who bridge the gap between

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:22,119
technicians and engineers. Please

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,119
welcome John Lou.

00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:36,369
[Music]

10
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:45,200
[Applause]

11
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,960
Good afternoon everyone. Again, my name

12
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,120
is John Leu and it's such a pleasure to

13
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,480
be here in Vienna, Austria. It's my

14
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,239
first time in Austria and I have to say

15
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,879
I've never been offered chocolates more

16
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,960
frequently in the past 20 12 hours in my

17
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,879
life. So, it's a a beautiful place to

18
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,680
be. I teach in the mechanical

19
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:04,159
engineering department at MIT and uh I'm

20
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,479
really fascinated by how we learn or

21
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,560
should learn STEM skills uh to prepare

22
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,240
for the future of industries. And I

23
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,159
think about that on the level of systems

24
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,960
all the way down to individual

25
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,880
experiences for the learner. Today, what

26
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,280
I'd like to do is I'd like to spend the

27
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,920
next 20 or so minutes challenging uh

28
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,680
perhaps conventional or current

29
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:25,360
perspectives towards worker training and

30
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,080
worker roles. And I'd like to do that by

31
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,159
proposing a new worker class called the

32
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,240
technologist, a technician and engineer

33
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,400
hybrid that really bridges the gap

34
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,799
between these traditional worker roles.

35
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,119
So let's start from the top here. Uh

36
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,280
this is US- ccentric data, but perhaps

37
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,840
you might see kind of data very similar

38
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,720
to this in Europe as well. uh the these

39
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,759
are quarterly surveys uh across uh the

40
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,840
nation uh that are basically asking uh

41
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,119
US manufacturing firms what is the

42
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,799
largest pain point that you're

43
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:57,600
experiencing in that particular quarter

44
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:00,719
and so you'll see uh normal challenges

45
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,119
like business conditions or domestic uh

46
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:06,240
economy and scales what you're seeing in

47
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:08,800
the gray however you'll see in the past

48
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,000
15 years the gray has been climbing and

49
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:15,280
climbing and climbing and the gray uh

50
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,200
save for a small gap uh around COVID has

51
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,840
really been the prevailing challenge uh

52
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,080
that companies in the US anyway are

53
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,720
reporting what what is the gray

54
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,720
attracting and retaining a quality

55
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,720
workforce and so that's a that's a

56
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,800
challenge that I think really excites or

57
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,680
concerns uh many folks at MIT and

58
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,840
certainly myself now it's easy to focus

59
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,680
on the numbers of course the the

60
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,840
millions of people that we have to be

61
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,840
able to obtain what I'm really

62
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,800
interested in is let's not forget about

63
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,040
that quality issue that uh is part of

64
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,680
the survey itself. A key challenge is

65
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,400
quality. How do we retain? How do we

66
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,720
attract a quality workforce? And so it

67
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,440
turns out in surveys, many interviews,

68
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:00,000
employers often say, "Yeah, I wish I had

69
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,400
more skilled technicians or more quality

70
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,720
workers." And and yet they're offering

71
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,680
wages that perhaps are lower than the

72
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,840
local Costco. Uh and uh why can't they

73
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,120
offer more wages? Well, many of these

74
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,120
especially small to medium-sized

75
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,080
enterprises are stuck in what we might

76
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,800
call at MIT a low wage, low technology,

77
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,360
low productivity equilibrium. Uh on the

78
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,959
other hand, we have uh companies also

79
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,280
complaining that you know what the

80
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,040
community college uh really is not a

81
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,800
very relevant solution for us anymore.

82
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,040
When I need a new worker, I really don't

83
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,640
go there. Uh I have to kind of go out

84
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,440
and maybe I'm working with talent firms

85
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,840
and I'm spending $40,000 $50,000 per

86
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,840
hire. And so, and then on the community

87
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,159
college side, they're complaining that

88
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,239
we can't even fill our cohorts or our

89
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,920
seats. Uh, you know, young people don't

90
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,640
want to come to our community colleges

91
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,200
anymore. And so, there's really a gap, I

92
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,120
think, between the current demand and

93
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,560
industry perspectives on workforce and

94
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,439
then the current workforce development

95
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,599
system itself. Uh, and then this really

96
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,120
matches with uh kind of historical

97
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:03,680
trends. In the past two, three decades,

98
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,680
we're seeing a decrease in general of

99
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,360
middle-skilled roles. This is true for

100
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,080
manufacturing but also broadly in other

101
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,840
industries as well. And then finally uh

102
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,720
I think our labor economists will also

103
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,920
remind us that uh just because there's a

104
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,799
demand for something it doesn't

105
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:21,120
automatically generate uh the supply for

106
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,960
it. So what does this mean for the

107
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,120
average small to medium-sized enterprise

108
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,160
or even a large company? What it really

109
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,800
means is firms, what they do is they

110
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:34,320
will hire really anyone who will show up

111
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,720
at 8 am and continue to stick at a job

112
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,479
for, you know, three months, six months,

113
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,080
hopefully three years or five years. And

114
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,800
we might call that, we might use a

115
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,759
phrase calling that hire for will and

116
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,400
train for skills. Now, that's a deeply

117
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,759
uh problematic

118
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,680
approach. And there's something that

119
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,840
makes it more complex uh which is

120
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,800
advanced manufacturing. When we're

121
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:59,040
talking about technologies that all of

122
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,280
our firms, many of you in the room want

123
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,080
to be able to adopt and deploy onto the

124
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:07,440
factory floor, AI, robotics, digital

125
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,960
production, many what is a central theme

126
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,479
that connects many of these technologies

127
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,880
is that these technologies are

128
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:15,759
connected. So no longer is it a single

129
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,759
process acting on its own. It needs to

130
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,680
be able to to to be able to successfully

131
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,160
integrate. You have to understand how

132
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,639
this technology impacts downstream flow

133
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,880
or upstream flow or how it connects the

134
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,639
entire system. And then what that means

135
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,639
is it certainly raises the question well

136
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,639
who then should be integrating and

137
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:37,039
optimizing uh these shop floor

138
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:39,039
technologies. Now uh if you in in many

139
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,280
of my conversations with companies this

140
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:43,199
is leading to almost a recurring mantra.

141
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,720
Ah we wish engineers had hands-on

142
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,880
skills. Oh we wish technicians had

143
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,360
analytical skills. And there seems to be

144
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:52,400
a gap in roles and competencies between

145
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,800
these traditional uh worker roles. And

146
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,240
so really I started a few years ago to

147
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,080
start to ask the question well you know

148
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,560
are we actually asking perhaps the the

149
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,880
wrong question. Perhaps there could be

150
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,639
another type of worker role not just to

151
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,400
run the machine on the shop floor but to

152
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,520
think about how do we integrate the

153
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:12,240
systems and adopt new technologies. And

154
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,319
so that brings me uh to this concept of

155
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,720
this potential, this technician engineer

156
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,720
hybrid who could be able to bridge the

157
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,960
gap between these two traditional roles

158
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,919
and to be able to address many of the

159
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,759
challenges that I just posed

160
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:28,720
earlier. So we sought to uh test this uh

161
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,639
question. We interviewed scores of

162
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,080
manufacturing firms in New England and

163
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,400
we asked them, hey, do you see this gap?

164
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,000
And if so, you know, imagine a worker

165
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,000
who could plug in this gap. You know,

166
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,520
what would you imagine this person do?

167
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,520
And to do that, we we we sourced from

168
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,759
task descriptions from our Bureau of

169
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,520
Labor Statistics. We called this BLS.

170
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,120
And we asked them, hey, what kinds of

171
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,039
engineering tasks might you want to

172
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,039
delegate to this kind of hypothetical

173
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:55,759
technologist role? And what you're

174
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:57,280
seeing here on the right uh on the on

175
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,759
the left of this graph, analyze

176
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,000
performance of systems or equipment. Uh

177
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,400
on the third one here, not carrying out

178
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,720
SOPs, uh but determining operational

179
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,720
methods or procedures. And then the

180
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,520
second one here coordinating right with

181
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:14,080
others to resolve problems. Uh perhaps

182
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,319
you know to summarize this I might say

183
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,319
strong analytical skills identifying

184
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,319
areas to increase efficiency and

185
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,599
communicating both vertically up down

186
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,520
and and laterally. Now these descriptors

187
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,759
uh might not seem surprising to us

188
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,680
because we often work with engineers but

189
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:32,319
remember this is what manufacturing

190
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,800
firms are saying they need as a delta on

191
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:37,120
the shop floor worker where maintaining

192
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:41,120
or running equipment uh has been

193
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:43,440
critical so far. And so a a conclusion

194
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,960
that we've made and that I would suggest

195
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,000
to you today is that advanced

196
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:50,400
manufacturing it really requires workers

197
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,560
with both that technician's practical

198
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,840
knowhow that they understand the process

199
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,160
or the understanding of particular

200
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:59,120
equipment and combining it with an

201
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,280
engineers's understanding of processes

202
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,720
and

203
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:04,319
systems. Well, that sounds all fine and

204
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,080
dandy. Uh but the question is, you know,

205
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,720
can we actually develop this kind of

206
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,720
workforce? And if you want to be uh

207
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,240
practical or realistic about developing

208
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,440
this workforce, I think you actually

209
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,520
have to be also think about the

210
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,840
implications of developing workers in

211
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,000
advanced manufacturing and namely that

212
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,759
uh if you really are in the space, these

213
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,840
technologies will also do is they'll

214
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,720
also reduce the shelf life of your

215
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,000
technical skills. And so this is where I

216
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,720
uh want to make a comment about

217
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,760
conventional manufacturing training. I

218
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:36,000
think this is a good uh pa capture or

219
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,839
representation of how we think about

220
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
current manufacturing training. I could

221
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,479
use the old adage, give a man a fish,

222
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,480
feed him for a day, teach a man to fish,

223
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,760
feed him for a lifetime. I'm sure we've

224
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,600
all heard that adage before. But in a

225
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,000
situation like advanced manufacturing,

226
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,519
if we were to extend that analogy, it

227
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,080
might be like this person has to fish

228
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,399
this year, hunt deer in two, trap

229
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,080
lobster in five years. And the question

230
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,839
is if we knew that a priority for the

231
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,240
firms who actually want to adopt

232
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:07,360
advanced technologies that are evolving

233
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,040
at a more and more rapid pace do we

234
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,120
really want to stick to the left-hand

235
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,360
side the conventional paradigm of

236
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,920
manufacturing training now in the left

237
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,080
hand side if we know that someone has a

238
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,800
skill set in welding he can carry that

239
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,399
for 50 years I think it makes sense

240
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,839
let's give them that skill set let's

241
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,680
teach them how to fish but in the

242
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,120
right-hand case when you know that the

243
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,959
game is changing. You might not exactly

244
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,560
know what the game will be in five, 10

245
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,800
years, 15 years, but you know it will

246
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:38,959
change. Perhaps it makes sense to take a

247
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:41,120
step back and think about why the why of

248
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,959
the game in this case. In this case, for

249
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,480
animals, maybe we're taking a step back

250
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,959
and we're thinking about the animal

251
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,800
senses. How do I my understanding of

252
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,240
animal senses enable me to bait

253
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,519
effectively or to hide from the game

254
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,920
effectively? And it turns out in

255
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,920
manufacturing there is an analog. In

256
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,000
fact, in the past two decades, we've

257
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,839
distilled what we believe are the

258
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,839
principles of manufacturing that do not

259
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,320
change uh no matter how the game

260
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:09,600
changes. And that is no matter if you

261
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:13,600
are 1800's printing press uh to 2025

262
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,440
so-called industry 5.0 or 4.0 to 5.0 uh

263
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,800
you always have to understand flow and

264
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,040
variation along four levels. The

265
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,800
manufacturing process, the manufacturing

266
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:25,120
system, the supply and the people. And

267
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,959
in fact, this is how we teach our

268
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,600
master's students in advanced

269
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:32,000
manufacturing and design. We give them a

270
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,040
core set of understanding of the

271
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,399
principles that make manufacturing

272
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:38,160
manufacturing. It's not necessarily

273
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,399
additive manu additive manufacturing is

274
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,399
going to be different in five years. Was

275
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,240
it still manufacturing? Yes. These

276
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,680
technologies that we're so concerned

277
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,640
about and we spend so much time

278
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:51,200
discussing, they will change. But these

279
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:53,120
principles, these activities, they do

280
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,959
not change.

281
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,800
And so what we uh do at MIT for a master

282
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:01,760
student and what we'd like to do uh in

283
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:04,000
this project is really uh uh this kind

284
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,320
of curriculum model shall we say we have

285
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
in the hub of a hub and spoke model all

286
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,959
of these principles in manufacturing

287
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,720
that don't change no matter uh again

288
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,959
they're timeless and if timeless they're

289
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,440
also equally applicable uh to a mom and

290
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:20,480
pop machine shop uh to a semiconductor

291
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,959
fab and then what we do is we surround

292
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,040
them uh with what I call the spokes,

293
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:27,480
right? These technologies that are

294
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,760
industry specific or are specific to

295
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,600
2025. And so what do we do? We try to

296
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,519
empower the workforce by educating on

297
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,519
the critical thinking why and then

298
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:39,680
linking that to the cutting edge

299
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:41,760
how. Okay. And my claim here is that if

300
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,000
you have a workforce, again, not just

301
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,839
the engineers, those without university

302
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,519
degrees, if they truly understand the

303
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:51,680
why of manufacturing, here's my claim

304
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,839
that workers will be nimble. If they're

305
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,920
not tied to a piece of technology or

306
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,959
equipment, when something comes in next

307
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,160
and they understand the why, they can

308
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:02,240
pivot. If they understand the why,

309
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,240
they're not tied to one way of doing

310
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,839
things. They might be able to question,

311
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,519
they might be able to propose a

312
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,079
different an alternative approach and

313
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:12,160
think about trade-offs. And if you have

314
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,000
a workforce that understands the why,

315
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,079
you're not just tied to doing what

316
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,519
someone tells you to do. uh you might be

317
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,600
able to think through and add

318
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:23,200
recommendations or suggest make

319
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,720
suggestions and so you know of course

320
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,000
there's a there's a very large list of

321
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,920
what we think a technologist could do

322
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,959
but I'll just highlight a few you know

323
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,720
perhaps one could apply uh process

324
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:35,360
control techniques to be able to analyze

325
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,760
and optimize processes or work with

326
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,079
engineers to employ efficient design of

327
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:43,360
experiments and so on and so forth along

328
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:45,360
the levels of systems and operations and

329
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,160
processes

330
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,839
Now I showed uh industry mapping before

331
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,760
and now I've shown the hub and spoke

332
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,920
curriculum model and it turns out that

333
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,320
many of the ways that industry is saying

334
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,160
hey we really need more skills we need a

335
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,000
more quality workforce it really maps

336
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:03,440
very well uh to our hub and spoke

337
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,959
model okay so I've spent some time

338
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,560
talking about the gap of roles

339
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:10,880
skills and turns out there's a few other

340
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,360
gaps I think I'm very interested in one

341
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,040
other gap uh on our end is the educ

342
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,480
education gap. And so if you have an

343
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,639
associates degree from a community

344
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,440
college and somehow you end up wanting

345
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,480
to earn a four-year engineering degree,

346
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,760
essentially you have to start over

347
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,000
unless you have an articulation

348
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,480
agreement. And so we have to be able to

349
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,959
handle the education gap as well. Why?

350
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,720
Because what what is a really promising

351
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,240
or really exciting possibility is

352
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,320
perhaps you have someone who starts as

353
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,680
an assembler or an operator, right? and

354
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,760
they take a program, they become a

355
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,760
technologist and then in that role they

356
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,760
see, hey, there's a junior engineer that

357
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,440
I'd love to be in five years. And so

358
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,440
then they go and get more education and

359
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,680
they become an engineer. And I would

360
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,160
love for this program to be a connector

361
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:54,800
of education and also career pathways.

362
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:57,279
Imagine what that could do uh both to

363
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,360
excite young people, entry- level

364
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:01,440
workers about starting an assembler or

365
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,720
operator positions. Also imagine what

366
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,040
that might do to the engineering

367
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,920
workforce if you have folks coming in

368
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,880
with years or decades of experience as

369
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:13,920
an operator or as a

370
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:16,240
machinist. And so this is uh as you

371
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,480
might imagine a very broad effort. It's

372
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:21,279
actually not something that one group uh

373
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,120
in MIT or even MIT can pull off. What

374
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:25,440
we're doing here is we're broadly

375
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,760
collaborating uh with education sites

376
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,000
across New England, two in Rhode Island,

377
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,680
three in Massachusetts, uh three uh two

378
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,760
in Connecticut. So these are our

379
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,519
education sites. Uh we work with

380
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:38,000
industry. I'm sure you recognize many of

381
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,680
these logos like Seammens or Autodesk.

382
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,760
And then finally, we work with a number

383
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,240
of different education institutions uh

384
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:47,360
to develop simulations and develop

385
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:49,720
assessments and develop labs as well.

386
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,320
Uh now this of course it's too small to

387
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:55,199
see. We are just starting to pilot

388
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,959
actually this fall and the cohorts that

389
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,800
we're after are small. There may be

390
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:01,440
cohorts of 15 across six education

391
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,279
sites. That's you know not even 200 uh

392
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,240
technologists uh that we could produce

393
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:09,279
in the next two years. So not very large

394
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:12,720
uh numbers as a pilot. And yet these

395
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:14,880
letters here there are letters of five

396
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,199
US senators and seven US house

397
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,519
representatives. The reason why is not

398
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:21,760
because we're claiming uh that we will

399
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,279
produce you know 1 million workers but I

400
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:26,920
think there is an understanding of the

401
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:29,440
potential impact on firms and economic

402
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:31,199
development. Uh there's always ways to

403
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,360
uh continue uh learning about this

404
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:35,760
project and you know our perspective on

405
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:39,040
how we believe workforce development uh

406
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:40,959
can improve or evolve. Uh next uh

407
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,320
tomorrow's kind of workshop I'll

408
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:45,279
probably spend more time less on the

409
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:47,040
systems level uh work that we do. I'll

410
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:49,199
probably dig more into the experience

411
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,680
level or on the learner side of things.

412
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:53,920
But again, happy to share more. Here are

413
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,519
a couple papers. One in a a policy

414
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,040
facing one that we published in the

415
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,800
National Academyy's journal. And then on

416
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,800
the right hand side, it's the MIT News

417
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,040
Press on the project itself. Thank you

418
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,040
so

419
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:12,839
much. Hey, I think we have time for a

420
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,839
few questions.

421
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:19,040
Okay. What are the benefits of

422
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,880
introducing the new role technologists

423
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,839
instead of upskilling and raising

424
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:26,720
requirements for today's technicians?

425
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,720
Great question. So, one thing I I want

426
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,399
to highlight is I was very careful to

427
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,320
call this a worker role, not necessarily

428
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,759
a new worker. We're not necessarily

429
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,440
bringing in a new person into the

430
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,720
company. In fact, this program that

431
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:40,880
we're working with, companies are are

432
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,120
committing to sending their star

433
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:45,600
incumbent workers. So, if there's a

434
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,759
technician or a machinist that has been

435
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,440
at the job for 5 years, 10 years, it's a

436
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,120
star. You know, you you as a company,

437
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,720
you believe in that person and that

438
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,680
person has an appetite for more

439
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,680
development. Send that person to us and

440
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:01,600
we will use the technologist program to

441
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:04,559
make him or her a leader.

442
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,959
Okay. What cultural shifts need to

443
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:09,439
happen on the shop floor to support the

444
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,439
emergence of this hybrid technologist

445
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:13,839
role? This is a great question. Uh

446
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:16,160
culture is definitely both an

447
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:18,160
opportunity and a challenge. We have a

448
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,520
number of even our partners who are

449
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,520
working with us on developing the

450
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,199
content. Some of them will often you

451
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,400
know say offhand like oh why do we even

452
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,160
need to develop this content? They're

453
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,520
never going to have the you know they're

454
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,720
not going to have a leadership role or

455
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,919
they won't have an opportunity to

456
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:34,160
influence uh decision- making. And so it

457
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:36,240
will be I think a tussle I would say

458
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,720
with uh small to medium-sized even

459
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,400
larger companies um on what kinds of

460
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,799
opportunities can we actually give these

461
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,880
technologists in order to succeed. But

462
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:47,039
what I think uh this program can do is

463
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,960
perhaps be a Trojan horse. You know we

464
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,960
send someone who is empowered and

465
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,440
enlightened and then all of a sudden

466
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,960
employers their boss and other folks see

467
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,799
uh the kind of value that they can bring

468
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,919
onto the shop floor and now we're in a

469
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:01,919
larger conversation with MIT.

470
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:04,400
Okay. And I think we have time for maybe

471
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,400
one more

472
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:10,880
question. Let's see. How do uh how to

473
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,640
persuade manufacturing engineering

474
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,840
technologist

475
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,679
uh to apply for the new cu apply new

476
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,080
culture?

477
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,600
So this one I think was partially uh I

478
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,840
partially addressed in the my my

479
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,799
previous response. Um I would also say

480
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,640
that as we have more use cases, as this

481
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,919
program starts to deploy, uh there will

482
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,240
be I think a number of different

483
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:34,400
successful uh stories. And in fact,

484
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,160
turns out as we did industry mapping, we

485
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,679
already see what I might call quasi

486
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,919
technologists or technologists in the

487
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,840
wild. uh companies who are deeply

488
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,160
invested in their workforce wanted to

489
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:47,200
empower them and over the course of five

490
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:49,360
ten 15 years somehow managed to bring

491
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,039
someone from an entry level uh to some

492
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,400
technical leadership on the floor

493
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:55,120
eventually perhaps even to an

494
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:58,000
engineering uh role. And so one example

495
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:00,160
is again a probably a 30 person company

496
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,160
in electropolishing in northeast

497
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,720
Massachusetts. you know, he took someone

498
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,480
who was a young lady who was an entry-

499
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:10,000
level technician, I think earning about

500
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:12,080
$18 per hour and in about 10 years, uh,

501
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,679
at the end of it was the head of quality

502
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,440
and and to do so, we had a number of

503
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,280
conversations. Uh, what did you have to

504
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,120
do in the past 10 years? Obviously, a

505
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,720
lot of investment from engineers and the

506
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,880
owner, but also sending them kind of

507
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,200
jerryrigging different trainings across

508
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,200
the state. Now if companies who are so

509
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,600
committed take 10 years to do so

510
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,840
couldn't we formalize that uh and be

511
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,919
able to produce kind of formal pathways

512
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,000
to that kind of role in leadership.

513
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,320
Another anecdote actually one of my one

514
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,799
of the stories that inspired me uh was

515
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,559
the story of Niha Dave. She's a a

516
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:43,919
graduate or alumni from the MENGEN

517
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:46,320
program, the masters of engineering

518
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,840
program. And she told me essentially two

519
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,160
years after she graduated from the

520
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:52,320
master's program, she was uh the the

521
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,840
plant manager. Uh and there are a number

522
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,720
of different processes that were out of

523
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:59,520
control. And to succeed at her job, she

524
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:01,440
needed to uh basically release a

525
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,840
plantwide pretty complex design of

526
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,520
experiment. And she could not get her

527
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,679
shop floor workers to really have buyin

528
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:10,640
or understand what was the DOE that she

529
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:12,559
wanted to And what did she do? She took

530
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,360
coffee breaks. She entered the coffee

531
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:16,960
room and took coffee breaks to introduce

532
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:21,760
these concepts that I've been talking

533
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:23,440
about run charts and SPC and CP CPK. And

534
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:26,000
then she said as a result of that over

535
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:28,080
the next six months she was able uh then

536
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,760
to launch a plantwide design of

537
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,520
experiments because she had the buyin

538
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,600
and the understanding of her shopf

539
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,440
flooror workers. And so that keyed me in

540
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,520
early on as we were trying to develop

541
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,679
this understanding that hey if this is

542
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,520
what our MIT graduates are already doing

543
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,919
and they're doing in an ad hoc way like

544
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,760
obviously I cannot expect every MIT

545
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,480
alumni to be able to win over the entire

546
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:50,880
plant uh to get control you know to to

547
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,880
bring the factory back into control then
