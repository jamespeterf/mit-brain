1
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:12,080
Um Dr. Rafoski began imaging live cells

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,160
and visually uh and visualizing

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,039
intracellular dynamics in 3D when she

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,279
was only 17 and hasn't stopped since. So

5
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,840
her longstanding scientific mission is

6
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,920
to uncover the underlying patterns and

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,600
principles and organize the complexity

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,519
window cells into functioning units of

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,599
life. To that end, she takes an

10
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,679
quantitative interdisciplinary approach

11
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,920
that integrates lives imaging, molecular

12
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,440
genetics, and computational analysis to

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,680
study the spatial and temporal

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,079
organization of center structures. So,

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,840
please join me to welcome Dr. Suzanne

16
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,840
Rafoski. Thank you.

17
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,840
Okay. Thank you for that beautiful

18
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,039
introduction. Wow, I sound really loud.

19
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,199
Hopefully, it's not too loud. And thank

20
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,039
you for inviting me um to talk. Um I

21
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,199
want to start by thanking our team. We

22
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,879
work um in a team science way. We're

23
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,039
about 80 people. We've been around for

24
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,399
now about 10 years. Um and we do

25
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,920
everything in an open science manner as

26
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,840
well. So everything that I tell you

27
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,520
about today is done by all these various

28
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,080
people at various times in those 10

29
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,640
years. So um I'm going to tell you guys

30
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,840
a talk in a couple of parts. First I'm

31
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,520
going to talk about establishing a

32
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,119
conceptual framework for holistic cell

33
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,720
states and state transitions which is

34
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,799
based on a perspective that Julie Tero

35
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,159
and I wrote and published last year. Um,

36
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,439
and then the second part I'm going to

37
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,640
talk about how we're actually testing

38
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,040
some of the ideas that are in that

39
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,920
perspective by summarizing the new work

40
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,360
that we're going to be doing at the

41
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,960
institute and telling you about one

42
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,560
proof of concept project that gets at

43
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,240
some of these points uh related to

44
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,799
endothelial cells that are derived from

45
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,960
our stem cells um and their response to

46
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,320
sheer stress. So so much about what we

47
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,680
know about life of course comes from

48
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,960
understanding the interplay between the

49
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,720
genotype, the phenotype and the

50
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,399
environment. And that is also true for

51
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,840
our cells. And in this talk I'm going to

52
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,280
take a very self-centered point of view

53
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,040
with the cells as the basic unit of

54
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,280
life. the agents that we're focusing on.

55
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,040
Nothing larger than a cell is any more

56
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,799
alive than cell and nothing small

57
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,680
nothing smaller is alive and so cells

58
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,759
are an ideal level of organization to

59
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,040
try to bridge all of the scales that go

60
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,880
from the molecular to the cellular and

61
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,960
the extracellular to look at these

62
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,080
observables. So what do we need then to

63
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,319
know a cell? So um if we focus on cells

64
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,640
in one particular organism so we can

65
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,560
just keep the genome fixed and not worry

66
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,480
about the genotype. Then we can start

67
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,920
defining the cellular phenotype. So now

68
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,440
again focusing in on the cell, this is

69
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,959
not the the phenotype of the tissue.

70
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,879
It's not the phenype of the organism,

71
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,400
but um all observables, everything we

72
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,599
measure and see about a cell that is

73
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,440
intrinsic to the cell, we'll call the

74
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,959
cellular phenotype. And everything that

75
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,000
is extrinsic to the cell, including the

76
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,680
interactions with other cells, we'll

77
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,239
call the cellular environment. So again,

78
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,319
if we're in an organism um that has uh

79
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,680
you know, many cells um there are many

80
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:43,040
different cellular phenotypes that come

81
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,560
from one genotype. And we as humans like

82
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,000
to classify those in some way so that we

83
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,519
can wrap our minds around them. So we

84
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,879
have epithelial cells or muscle cells.

85
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,920
We can define that into something that's

86
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,920
about cell states whether they're

87
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,319
proliferative, quiscent, epotic and so

88
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,840
on. But defining cell states is

89
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,519
challenging because of the continuous

90
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,200
nature of the cell state landscape and

91
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,440
the hogenity between cells in a

92
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,800
population. When is the cell in one

93
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,080
category that we have defined

94
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,080
arbitrarily versus another. So um

95
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,920
traditionally cell states were entirely

96
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,400
defined by what cells look like where

97
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,840
they were and what they do. And for

98
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,760
example that would be for example

99
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,760
squamas indothelial cells or columner

100
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,840
you know epithelial cells. Then in the

101
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,159
molecular era we identified molecular

102
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,640
markers that allowed us to associate

103
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,480
molecules with what these uh definitions

104
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,360
of cell state were before. So for

105
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,720
examples isopforms of masin heavy chain

106
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,120
that distinguish different types of

107
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,200
muscle fiber cells. Then in the genomic

108
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,760
and now postgenomic era, we of course

109
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,959
have the advent of a lot of large scale

110
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,640
gene expression profiles and gene

111
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,159
laboratory networks and all of the

112
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,599
beautiful sort of atlas style clustering

113
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,920
that we get that gives us a very

114
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,200
molecular view of that. But as we are

115
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,799
now facing this next step in the

116
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,720
postgenomic era where our single cell

117
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,400
imaging and analysis and all of the huge

118
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,560
and beautiful types of data science and

119
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,000
AI that we can do is what's facing us,

120
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,920
we have an opportunity to both circle

121
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,439
back to that traditional concept as well

122
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,879
as move forward and really work on

123
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,159
updating the concept of what a cell

124
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,920
state is to what we like to call a

125
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,680
holistic cell state where we take

126
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,959
spatial quantitative observables and

127
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,959
molecular observables and bring them

128
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,239
together. This is a perfect talk to go

129
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,519
right after the previous talk because

130
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,599
everything was already set up for me. We

131
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,959
have wonderful examples. Um, so this is

132
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,680
going to be sort of taking an

133
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,040
abstraction of a lot of what you saw and

134
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,359
then bringing it back to a particular

135
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,800
spot. So where uh Julie and I started

136
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:24,479
saying, okay, let's just use categories

137
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,639
of observables that sort of match the

138
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,759
ways that people tend to study cells. So

139
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,360
what cells look like, we're going to

140
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,440
call cell organization, that's the

141
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,800
spatial temporal arrangement, all of the

142
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,560
molecules inside cell, also the

143
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,000
structures inside the cell. Where cells

144
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,120
are located, that's the environment,

145
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,360
including other cells. uh what cells do

146
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,880
very important to biology and evolution

147
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,320
the actions and behaviors of the cell

148
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,520
and then of course what the molecules

149
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,120
are. We're going to term that the

150
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,680
molecular census because we're going to

151
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,280
think about this as a list that also

152
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,800
includes the number not just which

153
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,240
molecules there are. So if you take the

154
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,840
podium for example you can have a list

155
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,600
of individual proteins from one cell to

156
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,800
another. That's very straightforward but

157
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,479
we're going to say observables that

158
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,320
relate to postellational modifications

159
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,560
foration acetilation may fall into that

160
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,080
category too. If you take cell

161
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,680
organization, you can think about the

162
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,840
location of all of the proteins just by

163
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,440
themselves. Um, you can think about them

164
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,360
as locations of structures that have

165
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,280
functional sort of purpose to them. You

166
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,800
can think about the genome organization.

167
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,639
I love the fact that I come right now

168
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,240
after the previous talk all the way up

169
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,440
to cell shape. And importantly in all of

170
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,639
these observables, we really want to

171
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,639
think about these in the context of

172
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,320
dynamic observables and how they change.

173
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,840
So for cell organization of a structure,

174
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,360
you can do you know size, shape,

175
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,639
location, etc. You can take two

176
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,240
different cells, you can get the average

177
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,600
volume of GG as an example of a

178
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,160
measurable observable that you might

179
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,680
want to use in this sort of datadriven

180
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,120
framework. A note about categories

181
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,880
before you spend all your time as many

182
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,960
of us did at the institutes telling

183
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,880
Julie and me where this all breaks down.

184
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,960
Um any discretization of a continuum is

185
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,400
imperfect. Whether putting complexes,

186
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,600
molecular senses or cell organization or

187
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,680
both is not actually the thing that

188
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,759
matters. Um the cutoffs are intended to

189
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,880
create categories for us to talk to know

190
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,560
that we've thought about these different

191
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,000
aspects of biology. Biology does not

192
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,520
separate what it does, you know, by

193
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,080
these categories. They're just for us as

194
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,440
humans to work through. So if we tell

195
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,880
take cell function, what would

196
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,479
measurements of that be? You could have

197
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,400
cell type specific functions or you

198
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,080
could have more general cell functions.

199
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,440
So for example, for the migration of a

200
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,639
neutrfil, you could start doing

201
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,720
centroidid based, you know,

202
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,120
quantification of the speed at which

203
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,479
these cells move or how they turn. For

204
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,000
environment, you can think about the

205
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,280
chemical composition, how that changes.

206
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,039
You can think very importantly about the

207
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,160
mechanics as we just heard as well as

208
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,680
the other cells and how they're

209
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,680
arranged. So for example, you could

210
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,039
imagine measuring and having numbers for

211
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,319
the extrinsic push and pull of

212
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:33,680
neighboring cells on a cell or how that

213
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,199
affects cell shape. Great. So how do we

214
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,560
define holistic cell state? We would say

215
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,919
well if you imagine that each of these

216
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,520
categories of observables represents

217
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,960
sort of a type of state. Everybody here

218
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,240
who works on cell states and if you ask

219
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,680
someone what is the definition of cell

220
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,440
state they'll sort of gravitate to

221
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,199
usually one or a few of these. So

222
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,720
there's the organizational state perhaps

223
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,840
the molecular state which we spend a lot

224
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,360
of time thinking about the functional

225
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,360
state and we say we put all these

226
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,720
together it's a holistic cell state. So

227
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,360
what do we then need to know? know this

228
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,360
and what do we I am stumbling over

229
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,039
myself. What do we then need to know the

230
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,639
cell? We need to understand the nature

231
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,319
of the interactions between all of these

232
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,160
observables and we need to understand

233
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,560
them in time. That's how we're going to

234
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,759
get to understanding the cells. So for

235
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,840
example, if you take something like

236
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,400
directive migration wave, it is a direct

237
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,759
output of uh cytokeleletal polarization,

238
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,400
the phosphorilation state of singling

239
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:20,880
proteins and substrate mechanics. But

240
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,319
it's also feeding back on the extent to

241
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,160
which you have polarization of cells in

242
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,000
a dynamic way. which other proteins make

243
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,440
it phosphorolated and even you know the

244
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,120
subsid mechanics because if the cell

245
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,960
moves faster or slower it secretes its

246
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,160
CCM more or less and that's going to

247
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:36,800
affect the the environment. So these

248
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,240
birectional um the birectional interplay

249
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,599
is a limited framework to think through

250
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,759
this. What you really need is all of the

251
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,000
interactions and and how they correspond

252
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,360
to each other at this holistic idea and

253
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,039
the nature of the feedback that is set

254
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,800
up for any particular set of observables

255
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,240
for any particular question is mutually

256
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,919
reinforcing to generate those healthy

257
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,680
cells and understanding that is how you

258
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:57,360
can understand when things go wrong. So

259
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,720
we created a conceptual visualization um

260
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,000
depending on the audience people like

261
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,759
this one or the one on the next page

262
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,039
more or less. Um, if you just take those

263
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,440
four categories, you make them vertices

264
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:07,039
of a tetrahedrin, you can think of the

265
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,400
springs symbolically as birectional

266
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,759
feedback for these categories. And so

267
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,039
then they can have a push and pull. And

268
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,960
we even have a little animation of that

269
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,639
in a moment. That is of the values of

270
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,720
the observables and how they interact

271
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,840
with each other. Again, for lots of

272
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,960
people, they say, well, what in the

273
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,800
world are you talking about? There's a

274
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,240
lot more than four categories. Yes,

275
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,080
there are lots and lots of measurements.

276
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,280
You can imagine the observable space

277
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,360
we're talking about is any observable

278
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,879
that you could have. Um and so then of

279
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,160
course you have all the interactions and

280
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,000
it is the nature of the combination of

281
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,599
these that gives you the dynamics and if

282
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,200
you study neuron dynamics or systems

283
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,599
biology you know this very well. It

284
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,120
tends to generally not be including all

285
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,640
of the types of observables of cells. So

286
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,919
really this is just saying we need to

287
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,680
take these approaches and we need to

288
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,120
think about how we can have numbers

289
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,519
beyond the numbers we generally have

290
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,800
when we do this sort of work. Usually

291
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,880
those numbers relate to things like gene

292
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,320
expression. So this is how we get to a

293
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,040
dynamical systems framework for holistic

294
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,640
cell states and their dynamics. And we

295
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,920
acknowledge and know and all of you know

296
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,680
that we will never have a complete set

297
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,440
of observables. So we also need to

298
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,800
figure out how to do this to identify

299
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,279
which observables matter most and to

300
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,120
work with sparse data. So therefore in a

301
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,200
stable hostic cell state this is our

302
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,720
little dancing tetrahedrin. The vertices

303
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,040
may fluctuate. The vertices represent

304
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,560
the measurements. So for example uh not

305
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,880
all levels of particular protein stay is

306
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,360
constant at time. Not all uh positions

307
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,640
of an organel or speed of a cell. Um but

308
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,680
altogether the nature of the

309
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,680
relationship between these and how

310
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,360
they're tuned in a particular for a

311
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,040
particular cell or particular situation

312
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:31,120
mutually reinforces them to maintain a

313
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:33,760
stable holistic cell state. Okay. So you

314
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,279
have all the observables for all cells.

315
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,040
Um but not all combinations of

316
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,720
observables exist. So you don't just

317
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,560
have one giant space. You actually have

318
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,760
a subset of that space. All right. Not

319
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,360
all combinations of all number of

320
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,560
proteins are achievable. Not all

321
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,080
combinations of cell shapes are

322
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,360
achievable. And sometimes there are

323
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,399
dependencies. You can't achieve a

324
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,560
certain function if you don't have a

325
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,720
certain organization. So this is our

326
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,360
very poor man 3D representation of a

327
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,519
very very highdimensional subspace or

328
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,839
manifold within the overall space. Um

329
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,200
and that is static. So a location on

330
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,880
that is going to represent the

331
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,399
combination of all of the measurements.

332
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,200
Um and you're going to have sort of an

333
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,399
attractor state. You can have

334
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,519
fluctuations around it. And you can

335
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,880
start analyzing this in a more

336
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,560
quantitative and even theoretical

337
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,680
manner. And so other locations on this

338
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,040
massive, you know, holistic cell

339
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,360
manifold are going to be other cell

340
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,519
states. and where you study and what you

341
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,120
do. You may spend all your time in one

342
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,560
state learning about the variations of

343
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,320
what causes something to be healthy or

344
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,760
move out. Or you may care about the

345
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,360
overall landscape of all the possible

346
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,120
states that might be in a human body or

347
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,959
that you might want to study in a dish.

348
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,200
That's you know we're we're not

349
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,480
describing any sort of judgment to where

350
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,160
or what you should be studying in this

351
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,000
context. Just a thinking about how how

352
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,760
do we all talk about this in the same

353
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,600
language. So if you have this the

354
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,880
question

355
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,480
becomes why would a cell be at a certain

356
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,480
location and how do you move around on

357
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,839
that location? what what helps the cell

358
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,160
what dictates what the cell's going to

359
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:50,320
do. So we have the manifold the entirety

360
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,160
of achievable states achievable states

361
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,640
that's static and now we're going to

362
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,920
have probabilities where more likely

363
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,519
more common cell states are equivalent

364
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,800
to high probabilities on the manifold

365
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,399
and we're going to call this for now a

366
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,399
probability landscape. If you want to

367
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,399
have a long conversation about issues of

368
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,760
that uh come find me which would

369
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,399
describe the probability of being in a

370
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,079
location and that is dynamic or we would

371
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,079
like to propose it may be dynamic

372
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,839
meaning that as a cell moves along the

373
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,440
manifold it may reshape the landscape

374
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,640
the cells being an active participant.

375
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,959
What what do we mean with that? That

376
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,240
sounds sort of funny. It just means it's

377
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,600
equivalent to saying there may be memory

378
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,200
in the system. We already saw and heard

379
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,640
there's memory in the system that a

380
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,079
cell's past history affects his future

381
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,160
behavior. That also needs to be

382
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,519
accounted for as we want to then say

383
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,800
let's say we're in some part of this

384
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,079
probability landscape. What's going to

385
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,519
happen? You can't just take that static

386
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:36,000
snapshot and say now we can predict what

387
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,839
cells do. So this is just a framework.

388
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,120
Its purpose is not to tell you how cell

389
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,120
states work. It's intended to be

390
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,200
datadriven and practical and a way for

391
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,880
all of us to talk together to enable

392
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,160
integrative computational analysis and

393
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,839
modeling across many different cell

394
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,680
types and to bring together the cell

395
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,079
science community to build the tools,

396
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,440
make the hypotheses, do the tests um and

397
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,519
build on the momentum on what we can

398
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,360
have right now in this current era as a

399
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,560
stepping stone to somebody else's future

400
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,440
definition of how one should deal with

401
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,440
cell states. So where does AI fit in?

402
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,240
Well, our obviously our holistic cell

403
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,200
state, you know, um, uh, manifold here

404
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,600
is going to be very very highly

405
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,880
dimensional and we can't as humans wrap

406
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,480
our minds around what that means if you

407
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,079
want to have sort of understanding uh,

408
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,600
interpretation of what's going on. But

409
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,519
of course, AI is a perfect beautiful

410
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,800
pattern detector and especially is very

411
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,519
good at doing that in highly complex

412
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,519
data. And so it can help create um, cell

413
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,320
representations which really are just

414
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,639
uh, appropriate reduced dimensional

415
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,800
representations of the location of where

416
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,519
you are on this um, manifold. and then

417
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,120
perhaps the movement that you would

418
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:37,200
have. We believe very much that the

419
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,639
generative component is so key because

420
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,800
we have to determine when those

421
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,639
representations are appropriate and if

422
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,800
we use generative approaches, we can

423
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:47,440
recreate those patterns that the machine

424
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,279
has told us exist towards interpretation

425
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,519
towards using all the biology knowledge

426
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:54,880
that we have, you know, ourselves, you

427
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,920
know, uh, collected over the years to

428
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,040
actually make sure that we're doing

429
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,440
something reasonable and something that

430
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,360
we can build upon and talk about. um

431
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,279
because our goal is not just predicting,

432
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,240
our goal is predictive understanding uh

433
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:08,399
and going beyond that. So what are we

434
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,320
doing at the institute to try to take

435
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,839
some of these very conceptual ideas, put

436
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,000
them into practice and do it in a way

437
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:17,560
that hopefully we we will inspire some

438
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,240
of you to build on these as well. So um

439
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:22,880
obviously the genomic era transformed

440
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,440
our access to molecular census data and

441
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,360
uh in part even though it's very hard to

442
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,360
actually do the work and to standardize

443
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,399
it and to do this analysis the data is

444
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,519
very straightforward to analyze. You

445
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,920
know what you need to analyze there's

446
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,920
ATCG there's cell one cell two there's

447
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,639
genes there's how much there is it's

448
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,079
great um and it gets streamlined so that

449
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,760
you know everybody and their friend can

450
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,600
can do this now and knows how to analyze

451
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,800
it. But of course we want to bring in

452
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,320
the spatial component and of course

453
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,160
spatial contoics is a great way to do

454
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,360
that as are other approaches that allow

455
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,040
us to even get measurements of

456
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,519
organization at the same time and that's

457
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,120
beautiful. Um, but there's still this

458
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,880
problem that that's one approach in one

459
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,120
context. And what we're really missing

460
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:02,240
and facing as a challenge is there's a

461
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,839
lot to sell organization in time of all

462
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,600
of these complex structures that all

463
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,199
interact that have all these shapes that

464
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,480
need to go where they need to go and we

465
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,240
need to figure out how to measure those

466
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,079
in some sort of comprehensible and

467
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,279
generalizable manner if we want to

468
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,800
integrate them with other categories.

469
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,639
Here I'm focusing on cell organization

470
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,240
because of the next slide or the next

471
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,000
two slides. But this is also true for

472
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,600
cell function and cell environment. We

473
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,279
are not going to be able to think about

474
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,959
cells in a holistic way if we don't have

475
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,639
the appropriate measurements to actually

476
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,160
then use those to identify which of

477
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,560
those matter in the context of these

478
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,160
dynamical stable states. And so if we

479
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,399
want to get that and get at the

480
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,560
mechanisms underlying cell states as

481
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,920
well as normal cells and disease then we

482
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,040
have to figure out how to do that. We're

483
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,480
really good now at molecular

484
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,839
representations like right bal single

485
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,680
cell genomics. There's all sorts of ways

486
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,440
to do that. We are not so good at

487
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,040
organizational representations. And yet

488
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,399
something like nuclear morphology is a

489
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,920
hallmark of the progression of prognosis

490
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,760
of cancer. And what about all of the

491
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,199
other organels in the cells? What about,

492
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,199
you know, all of the sort of details of

493
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,800
the ways that they change in time? So,

494
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,839
this is what we mean when we say we want

495
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,760
to push towards holistic cell

496
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,680
representations that are also dynamic

497
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,440
and again to invoke that we know we're

498
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,199
not going to have all the data. And so,

499
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,839
we need to explore whether it is enough

500
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:09,040
to have certain data and to show that

501
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:10,720
rigorously. So, at the institute in the

502
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,480
first uh 10 years of the institute, we

503
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,160
focus very much on trying to create

504
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,680
these measurements of cell organization.

505
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,440
And so, here are sort of two papers. one

506
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,680
that's sort of creating a a map of how

507
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,600
do you even measure organization in 3D

508
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,120
in cells. We started with our stem cells

509
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,560
as well as correlating measurements of

510
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,639
organization that are functionally

511
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,560
needed in cardiammyioytes to gene

512
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,839
expression showing that there is not the

513
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,519
correspondence that you would expect

514
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,440
between the very obvious genes that

515
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,800
control cardiammyioaside differentiation

516
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,120
and the actual organization that you

517
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,440
get. But we want to now move beyond that

518
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,279
um and focus on a new initiative where

519
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,360
we are going to be more formal about

520
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:45,199
invoking the ideas of this holistic cell

521
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,639
state framework bringing in dynamics

522
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,480
which we meant to do already 10 years

523
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,560
ago but it's hard to do that properly

524
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,480
and moving more into 3D so not 3D within

525
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,480
a cell but now 3D structure. So this is

526
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,839
a overview of our new initiative that

527
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,360
I'm going to walk you through. Our

528
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,480
mission statement is that we seek to

529
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,240
uncover and I do have to read this

530
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,839
because I'm still getting used to it. um

531
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,360
the principles that govern multisellular

532
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,120
systems by exploring cell states and the

533
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,959
metaphorical landscapes they traverse

534
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,320
across spatial and temporal scales. We

535
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,000
will leverage our stem cell models. So

536
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,440
the institute focuses entirely on human

537
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,440
induced flop potent stem cells because

538
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,360
they're a great system for this um and

539
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,199
imaging. So here for example are our

540
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,959
stem cells in the format that we tended

541
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:21,759
to study them in the first part of the

542
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:23,600
institute which is in 2D sheets and here

543
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,519
is what we can do with them to turn them

544
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,279
very 3D and ask questions about now 3

545
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,120
fleet morphagenesis where this is a

546
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:31,120
single layer these are the nuclei of a

547
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,880
single layer of cells um so we're going

548
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,639
to leverage stem cell models integrated

549
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,639
imaging modeling and then synthetic

550
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,720
biology to achieve this goal so if we

551
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,040
take these luminoids we call them we're

552
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,480
now going to also try to precisely

553
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,399
decide we've we've learned something

554
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,920
about cell states and engineer those in

555
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,519
to ask questions about whether we

556
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,000
actually have understood them via the

557
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:52,160
holistic state framework and then the

558
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,759
information that we learn we with others

559
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,000
in the community would port into tissues

560
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,800
or organoids. So at the center of this

561
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
is our holistic cell state

562
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,120
framework. Um and for that you need to

563
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,040
have state transitions you're going to

564
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,400
focus on. So we have a couple of state

565
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,760
transitions that are going to be our

566
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,079
focus. One is the formation of these

567
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,839
luminoids which as you can see is a very

568
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,439
very obvious state transition but these

569
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:14,319
cells are still undifferiated

570
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,919
epithelialike hips. there is no major

571
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,199
well there will be some I'm sure at the

572
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,640
protein level but you know gene

573
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,720
expression change that is driving this

574
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,079
this is a change that is also invoking

575
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,160
all of these other observables that

576
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,839
we're talking about the other is um you

577
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,839
take the luminoids and you do very very

578
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:31,440
first steps in differentiation you're

579
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:34,240
going to get an EMT an epi ep epithelial

580
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,919
transition and it's one uh that now does

581
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,000
have a very strong you know gene

582
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,440
expression diver across it and so we

583
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,120
have these two beautiful model systems

584
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,720
that allow us to explore with or without

585
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,559
having really major gene expression

586
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,880
networks driving the process. What what

587
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:49,440
is it that you you you do in order to

588
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,280
ask the questions about what is state A,

589
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,120
what is state B and how do you get from

590
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,039
one to the other? What is intrinsic in

591
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,320
the cell and what is not? What is needed

592
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,320
in the context of collective cell

593
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,440
behavior in tissues? But what we care

594
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,880
about is really getting to these

595
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,559
computational approaches. And the thing

596
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,240
that glues them together is figuring out

597
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:06,039
how to create these appropriate cell

598
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,960
representations so that we can

599
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:10,000
iterate. We create all sorts of data. We

600
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,120
have a second part to our mission

601
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,280
statement that is to work with the

602
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,480
community in order to to do all of this

603
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,160
and to bring things back to the

604
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,320
community. And so we will continue to

605
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,679
develop solutions and tools as we have

606
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,240
already done. Please check out our

607
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,559
website uh to to to do this with all of

608
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,200
you. Um we love people who want to use

609
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:28,640
our poaches. Um it's very easy. Uh get

610
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,880
in touch with us. We can't help everyone

611
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,160
but we love to get everyone started and

612
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,880
build a community of people helping each

613
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,799
other with some of this as well.

614
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,640
So an example proof of concept project

615
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,240
that I'm really excited about sharing is

616
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,480
actually not about the systems I just

617
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,640
showed those are being worked up now but

618
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,559
is actually to say how do we get at this

619
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,720
question of can we test and build the

620
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:51,360
dynamics of these state landscapes and

621
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,840
so we're going to use as a model system

622
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:56,480
for this proof of concept HIPC derived

623
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:58,160
endothelial cells which by their nature

624
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,400
we can actually reduce their

625
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,799
organization a little bit more to 2D and

626
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,039
focus less on sort of the left side and

627
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:07,760
more on how we get representations. Am I

628
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:09,480
messing this up now? Um to get to the

629
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:12,799
right side and do a proof of concept of

630
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:15,039
that. So um these endothelial cells are

631
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:16,559
differentiated from my HAPSC's. They are

632
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:19,440
akin to the cells that line your blood

633
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:21,120
vessels which undergo a lot of flow. So

634
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,799
we image these in flow chambers so that

635
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,320
they have that flow. And here you're

636
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:27,120
seeing cells that are expressing um

637
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:29,200
fluorescent veterinar which are um the

638
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,960
is the kadhirin that sort of labels also

639
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,919
the outlines of the cells. Here we've

640
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,360
blasted the um contrast just to use it

641
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,640
sort of as an outline of cells but there

642
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,480
is are actually also really cool

643
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,679
patterns of how the V kit here organizes

644
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,679
around the cells but I'm not talking

645
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:44,000
about that today. So this is low shear

646
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,919
stress the cells they move upstream they

647
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,200
align very parallel they have a very

648
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,559
stereotypical behavior a very

649
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,600
stereotypical organization and that's

650
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,240
actually what you would imagine that

651
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,760
they're doing also in your blood

652
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:56,000
vessels. We actually were had a hard

653
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,520
time getting to that because the the

654
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,200
value of sheer stress that is used in

655
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,960
other endothelial cell systems was

656
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,320
higher. So we started here and we kept

657
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,000
getting ourselves aligning parallel to

658
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,000
the flow which is something that is

659
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,520
known but it's just the value of sheer

660
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,760
stress that happens in our cells is much

661
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,280
much lower um than we expected and so we

662
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,640
actually took a long time to sort that

663
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,440
out. So we have these two really

664
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,360
beautiful um states for these cells one

665
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,039
that is absolutely moving upstream and

666
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,720
and very parallel and very stereotyped

667
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,640
and one is which is the opposite and so

668
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,799
now we have a really beautiful again

669
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,160
just endothelial cells all the same

670
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,520
cells doing something completely

671
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,280
different just in response to that one

672
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,720
difference in environment. So can we

673
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,320
understand that better? How where do we

674
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,919
start? Well, the traditional way that we

675
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,919
would start and that you know we did

676
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,360
start was let's take these movies, let's

677
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,880
do feature extraction, let's look at our

678
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,400
biology, let's look at our science,

679
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,240
let's take raw data, let's you know

680
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,080
there's all these beautiful for 2D image

681
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,559
analysis. This is why we went into 2D,

682
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,320
you know, we it's solved, right? So just

683
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,840
let's go through this. Turns out that

684
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,760
the success rate of the segmentations is

685
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,280
about 50%. Once you want to do it in

686
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,280
time and analyze dynamics, everything

687
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,400
can fall apart. And so we asked this

688
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,520
question, we could have refined this.

689
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,840
We're we're specialists at this. It's

690
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,200
like what I do, right? Um but we said,

691
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,799
can we instead learn the features that

692
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,000
are most important for the biology that

693
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:07,200
we're seeing, which is this one state

694
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,159
versus this other state. So, uh we said,

695
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,600
let's develop a framework um to extract

696
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:14,080
the features that we're going to care

697
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,919
about um in a segmentation and tracking

698
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,200
free uh way. This is the very first time

699
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:18,240
I'm presenting the slide, so let me

700
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,760
stumble through it with you a little

701
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,520
bit. I will get better at it every time

702
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:25,120
I do. We have two different types of

703
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:26,640
data. We have our vader uh GFP. The

704
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,480
reason these cell this looks so long is

705
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,400
because we actually take multiple um

706
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,400
fields of view and stitch them together.

707
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,400
Um and we also have the bite field. When

708
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,600
we do the the projections into 2D, it

709
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,600
makes a lot of sense to do a maximum

710
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,799
projection for the via adherent and a

711
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,640
standard deviation projection for the

712
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,760
bite field. And it keeps so much of the

713
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,679
information, the rich information that

714
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,400
is in the bitefield images and has been

715
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,600
just phenomenal. So then we said well

716
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,360
what we really want is to get these

717
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,880
features out and we want to do this in a

718
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,159
model that is generative and we tried

719
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,520
several different things including the

720
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,520
sort of sparsity model of how can you

721
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,799
fit this in um and we landed on the

722
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,559
diffusion autoenccoder that worked

723
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:00,159
really well for us. So we have one part

724
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,440
which learns to move gaussian noise from

725
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,280
an input image which happens to be the

726
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,360
via khiran input image and then we have

727
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,919
another part which is a semantic encoder

728
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,440
which is working to identify what exists

729
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:12,080
in the bitefield standard deviation

730
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,919
image that helps this process and

731
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,000
therefore generates a latent space.

732
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,080
These two are trained together and we

733
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,840
then get a um feature representation in

734
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,240
low dimensions that I will show you is

735
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:24,159
also interpretable that defines what it

736
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,200
is that's in the image that allows us to

737
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:28,960
actually uh do this process and once

738
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,400
we've trained this we can do this all

739
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,679
from the bite field itself which is very

740
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,960
powerful. So we have three conditions

741
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:37,360
that you're going to get used to in the

742
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,039
next few slides. no flow which is sort

743
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,000
of an intermediate you'll you'll see

744
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,280
that in intermediate sort of

745
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,039
organization uh high flow and low flu

746
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:46,799
flow um we have our encoder we get a

747
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:48,320
latent space it's eight dimensional we

748
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,440
can do another dimensionality reduction

749
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,600
just to make it even easier for

750
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,679
ourselves we are exploring the eight ad

751
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,200
space as well um and we're calling this

752
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:58,159
a threedimensional state space because

753
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,280
99% of the variance in the data for the

754
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,480
thing that we're looking at which is

755
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,480
what the pattern is when you have the

756
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,159
vader is taken care of in those three

757
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,440
dimensions and if you plot these you can

758
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,159
see that the three conditions can

759
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:10,400
separate out beautifully which is great.

760
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:12,480
So now we can interpret it. We can uh

761
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,320
use the generative ability of this model

762
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,080
and we can recreate what these patterns

763
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,919
of these images would be and we can see

764
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,840
that along PC1 which is good that the

765
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:21,280
primary axis of variation you get the

766
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,440
parallel to perpendicular sort of

767
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,240
aligned image. These are just snapshots

768
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,320
right now. We're going to get to

769
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,840
dynamics. Um the second one is still a

770
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,600
bit of a mystery. having a grand old

771
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,760
time learn figuring out what the model

772
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,039
has seen but it's very likely related to

773
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,320
how much the cells overlap with each

774
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,000
other and so in the different flow

775
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,200
conditions or in different moments cells

776
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,559
have a little bit more or less overlap

777
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,799
and we're going to sort that out. The

778
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:43,120
third one is very clearly density which

779
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:44,480
since cells continue to go over time and

780
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,760
they continue to move is something that

781
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,960
you always have to deal with. There is

782
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,679
no such thing as one steady state.

783
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,200
You're going to have to always think

784
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,679
about it in the context of where where

785
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,360
the cells are in their in the coding. Um

786
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:55,280
so this state space is only a static

787
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,960
view um of the system. How do we get to

788
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:59,360
dynamics? Well, we can take two time

789
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,880
points. Um, we can, uh, look at a

790
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,880
particular cop. You can see how it

791
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,880
changes in the state space. And then you

792
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,799
can populate that for the whole space.

793
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,159
And here, um, you can see that for each

794
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:09,919
of these three different conditions and

795
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,200
where they lie in there. Then you can

796
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,679
say, does it have any reality? Well,

797
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:16,159
this is a 3D space. So, let's have Matos

798
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:18,400
um, so our our director of image

799
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:19,600
analysis and machine learning. Um, he's

800
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,200
a long-term collaborative of mine. He's

801
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,799
also a great visualizer. So he of course

802
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,080
figured out how to make this something

803
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,760
that we can all sort of wrap our minds

804
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,720
around which is if we start with various

805
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,720
different cops and we look at the

806
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,880
trajectories over time um where do they

807
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,720
go and so if we look at where they go

808
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,360
they go exactly to what we would imagine

809
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:38,720
is an example image of the stable state

810
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:40,000
in um the first case uh which is the

811
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,840
noious stress you have a mixed

812
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,520
orientation rounder cells then you have

813
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,600
horizontal alignment elongated cells and

814
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,679
vertical alignment and less round cells.

815
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,440
Okay, these are just images of crops.

816
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,039
These are not cells yet, right? But you

817
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,799
can say, okay, what about a sample

818
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:55,279
trajectory? So, we're putting sample

819
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:56,880
trajectories here. You can sample them

820
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:59,919
um in different spots and you can see

821
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,760
sort of what a sample pattern change, a

822
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:03,200
dynamics of change would look like. And

823
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,720
it actually does exactly what you would

824
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,720
want. If you happen to be a cell that's

825
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,400
starting out not aligned this way, over

826
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,559
time you would get more aligned and vice

827
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,440
versa, over time you get more

828
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:13,120
perpendicular. Those are again just

829
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,640
cops. These are not cells. We have not

830
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,080
tracked cells. So is there any bearing

831
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,360
to reality? And the answer is yes. You

832
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,360
can pick whatever favorite cell you

833
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,520
would like. If it starts out a little

834
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,919
bit more looking like this, you will see

835
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:26,240
that those cells tend to get parallel

836
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:29,039
and elongated. And um if I play this

837
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,880
other movie, that is also true uh for

838
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:32,880
the other

839
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:34,640
state. So we will do more than just this

840
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,080
little example. We actually are tracking

841
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,440
individual cells and bringing this all

842
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,640
together. But at least that gives us

843
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,559
confidence that what we're finding for

844
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,159
these crops which are only five minute

845
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,760
minutes apart. And I I should have said

846
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,960
that early on. I need to label my

847
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,799
slides. This is what happens when you do

848
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,159
this for the first time. Um, every frame

849
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:51,200
is five minutes apart and this is about

850
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:52,720
24 hours of a movie. So, in summary, the

851
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,480
diffusion autoenccoder um learns

852
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,760
interpretable features from small cops.

853
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,880
The three different flow conditions are

854
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,400
well separated and the predicted

855
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,000
trajectories seem to be have some

856
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,840
bearing in reality. So, what are we

857
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,080
doing next? Um, well, we want to see

858
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,120
intermediate flows both as steady states

859
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,880
because it's actually really hard to

860
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:09,120
create landscapes without having sort of

861
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,360
points to to move from one to the other.

862
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:13,039
um but also the dynamics from one to the

863
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,400
other directly to ask the question of

864
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:16,960
what is this state transition really

865
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,799
look like and is it reversible. We get

866
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,080
to explore all of the variations and

867
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:22,080
trajectories to learn something about

868
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,000
the biology. We're very excited about

869
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,600
the fact that we can start asking what

870
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,279
aspects of these dynamics are due to the

871
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,880
non-equilibrium aspects of the system.

872
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:31,120
Those of you who like that, come find me

873
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,039
and talk to me. Um it's actually pretty

874
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,559
cool. And in order to know that we've

875
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:36,159
had an understanding, we're also doing

876
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,360
our usual good cell biology. We have

877
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,279
other structures we're looking at. we

878
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:42,000
know about endothelial biology and we're

879
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:43,600
building biohysical models to test this.

880
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,200
I'm going to leave you with what I think

881
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,720
is the coolest and funnest thing to look

882
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,640
at and you mull on this question as

883
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,799
you're watching. Is the state transition

884
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:57,039
reversible? So, first we're going to

885
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:58,640
have a one movie second which is um uh

886
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:59,840
going to be the low flow and then you're

887
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,679
going to see a switch in behavior and

888
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,840
that is when we change the flow in a

889
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:07,679
sudden way. So we moved all of the cells

890
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:09,919
from being on one sort of uh dynamical

891
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:12,559
uh flow field to another in a sudden

892
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:14,240
manner. And you can watch that behavior.

893
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:16,000
And this is a total of 20 hours. But

894
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,120
it's the first the first like sort of

895
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,320
second that you're watching. And and

896
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,760
you'll see that loop play again there.

897
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,840
And you can see that this is a temporal

898
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,679
process. And the cells do a set of

899
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,120
behaviors to make that transition

900
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,080
happen. And now the same thing in the

901
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,520
other direction. These are the cells

902
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,159
that are perpendicular. we reduce the

903
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:33,440
flow and they're going to realign over

904
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,600
time. And I'm going to play that one

905
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,799
more time as well. And so this um we I

906
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,559
can tell you I'm not showing you the

907
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:40,559
data, but we already know that this is

908
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:42,159
not a directly reversible process. And

909
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:44,400
so the question of you know, what is

910
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:45,919
this hysteresus due to? Is it just time

911
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,600
scale? Is it something organizational?

912
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:49,039
Um is going to be really fun to to think

913
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,960
about as well. So with that, I want to

914
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:52,620
thank you all um for your attention and

915
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:59,120
take questions.

916
00:27:52,620 --> 00:28:03,640
[Applause]

917
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:03,640
I think we have time for one question.

918
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Thank you so much. That was a fantastic

919
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:12,240
talk. I always wondered what is a cell

920
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,480
state. So regarding that you said there

921
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,320
can be so many ways to define cell state

922
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,640
and you are trying to incorporate all

923
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:21,120
different like cell environment and

924
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,279
morphological features and so I still

925
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,440
didn't understand how will you for for

926
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:27,679
if you have all the information are you

927
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,760
planning to just concatenate let's say

928
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,760
how do you plan to let's say there is

929
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,279
there are different ways so there are

930
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,880
morphological features there are RNA

931
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:36,480
seek features let's say let's say you

932
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,960
can measure all of them cell environment

933
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,679
cues how will we finally define a cell

934
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:44,000
state I'm still. Yeah. So, I think we're

935
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:45,520
saying uh because this is a continuum

936
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,799
and cells don't care about states. If

937
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,000
you take something very well separated

938
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:49,120
like completely different cell types

939
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,600
have completely functions, you're just

940
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:53,200
very very far apart in this manifold.

941
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,720
And so, it's very easy to draw a line

942
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,760
and make an arbitrary line. But if you

943
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,440
actually want to understand how you get

944
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,960
there and you care about the continuum,

945
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,120
you want to know where you do or don't

946
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,840
have uh whether it is in healthy cells

947
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:05,679
or in unhealthy situations filling in of

948
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,760
of these different spaces or of the

949
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:09,120
paths that you take. So our answer is

950
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,320
that we're not going to predetermine

951
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,520
what that is. We're going to say, can we

952
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,279
have a data-driven way to actually get

953
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,120
the continuum and then depending on your

954
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:16,960
question, decide where you're going to

955
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,880
focus and set up your question and use

956
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,480
the data to answer that question. If you

957
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,039
need a category in order to define it,

958
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,159
that's great. If you think back um one

959
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:26,320
of the things that you know the the

960
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:29,600
UMAPs give you is cell types, right?

961
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:31,440
Those are um completely validated and

962
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,559
then extrapolated from where is a cell,

963
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,679
what does it look like, what does it do

964
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:36,640
from all the traditional sort of

965
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:39,279
definitions, right? So there is there is

966
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,880
um a view of those that is then

967
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:42,799
molecular and then there's a view that

968
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,960
is being missed by those. If we add

969
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:47,279
those other dimensions in, depending on

970
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,880
your question and your system and what

971
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,240
you're asking, you may care entirely

972
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,440
about molecular, you may care entirely

973
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,799
about non-molelecular, right? Those

974
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,080
state transitions I showed you are

975
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:56,240
absolutely valid and important state

976
00:29:54,080 --> 00:30:00,720
transitions that may not have at least

977
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:01,919
on the say RNA level uh the molecular di

978
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,039
maybe all phosphorilation which is

979
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,320
actually hugely important and maybe

980
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:06,240
something else and may have nothing to

981
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,159
do with a change in what the molecules

982
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,720
are initially and only eventually builds

983
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:12,000
up. the time scale and the spatial scale

984
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,039
of your question is what's going to

985
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:18,460
determine how you define that state.

986
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:22,170
Okay. So, let's thank our speaker again.

987
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:22,170
[Applause]
