1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:06,240
so now is the time for lightning talks

2
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:08,400
all right so Bowen

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,280
first okay so uh good morning everyone

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,639
I'm Bowen I'm a PhD student in computer

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:15,240
science here at MIT and in this work we

6
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:17,080
explore the idea of learning a j of

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,039
model of molecular Dynamics trajectories

8
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,720
to further expand the value that can be

9
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:24,000
extracted from simulation data sets so

10
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,240
the main idea is here at the top left

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,960
molecular Dynamics or MD is a very

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,519
common technique used for studying

13
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,519
various molecular phenomenon and it

14
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,000
gives us the trajectories which are time

15
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,320
series of molecular confirmations now

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,040
these uh these confirmations are

17
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,879
generated sequentially by integrating

18
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,719
the equations of motion in this work we

19
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:44,680
explore the idea of learning a surrogate

20
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:46,320
model of MD trajectories um by learning

21
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,360
a a joint generative model over the

22
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,640
confirmation at each time step so

23
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,120
inspired by generative models of videos

24
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,559
for example that can create a one minute

25
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:57,160
video from scratch um we train a model

26
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:59,039
to go from a uh a trajectory of Pure

27
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,600
Noise and progressively remove this

28
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,440
noise um to give us a trajectory now you

29
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,920
may ask why do you want to do this joint

30
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,520
modeling we know that the underlying

31
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,000
equations of motion are Marian there

32
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,439
should be no need to learn a joint

33
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,200
generative model like I described now

34
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:14,360
typically people learn surrogate models

35
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,400
of MD to accelerate the simulation or

36
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,960
the sampling in our case however we

37
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,600
argue that it is interesting to learn

38
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,640
this joint generative model because of

39
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,159
the new capabilities The Wider range of

40
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:26,200
capabilities that it unlocks by uh

41
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,079
controlling how you condition the model

42
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,520
so for example if you condition the

43
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:31,159
model by providing just the first frame

44
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,280
and ask to fill in the rest then you get

45
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:34,759
a standard forward simulator if you

46
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,640
however provide the first and the last

47
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:38,200
frame the model will try to give you a

48
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,360
sequence of confirmational states that

49
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,520
Bridges these two frames that is a

50
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:45,399
transition path if you provide say for

51
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:47,079
example every 10 or 100 or 1,000 frames

52
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:49,320
um the model will try to upsample your

53
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:51,680
trajectory to perhaps resolve faster

54
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,600
motions that you missed when saving your

55
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,479
md trajectory at two course of a time

56
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,680
interval and most ambitiously if you

57
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,240
mask out part of the molecule and

58
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,799
describe what the rest of the mo should

59
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,079
be doing then the model will try to impt

60
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,640
or design the system to accommodate or

61
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:09,440
induce those motions now I want to be

62
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,920
clear that we are far from being able to

63
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,200
do what I've just described for large

64
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,879
molecular systems like proteins uh for

65
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,640
one thing the data to train such a model

66
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,959
doesn't exist right there's no YouTube

67
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,560
of MD simulations that we can train on

68
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,920
uh but what we have done is provided a

69
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,360
proof of concept based on training such

70
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:28,239
a model for tetrapeptide systems so very

71
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,959
small peptides of four amino acids we've

72
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,080
created an extensive data set of Tet

73
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:33,280
peptide simulations train a model on

74
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,239
those uh on a subset of those

75
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,560
simulations and Sample trajectories for

76
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,480
uh unseen peptides and we've validated

77
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,519
that our model can accomplish to varying

78
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,480
degrees each of the tasks that I've just

79
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:47,480
described so here at the on the right

80
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,319
hand side on the top left we see that

81
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,640
our model when used as a forward

82
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:53,159
simulator can provide uh quite

83
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,400
reasonable and accurate free energy

84
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:57,159
Landscapes of unseen peptides and this

85
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,800
can be seen by comparing the MD free

86
00:02:57,159 --> 00:03:00,280
energy Landscapes on the left and then

87
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,000
our models free energy land Landscapes

88
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,239
on the right our model can also resolve

89
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,519
to some extent the kinetics of the

90
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,080
system um by looking at the recovery of

91
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,599
the relaxation time of different

92
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,720
torsional Collective

93
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,560
variables uh in the middle here we have

94
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:16,000
an example of an interpolation path

95
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,000
between two macro States uh on the free

96
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,840
energy landscape of a particular

97
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,840
tetrapeptide uh we do have some more

98
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,280
quantitative assessments of this uh but

99
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,000
the explanation of those is a bit too

100
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,120
convoluted to put on one

101
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,840
slide uh and then on the bottom right

102
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,920
here we see that our model one used as

103
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,120
an upsampling model uh is able to

104
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:35,239
recover the autocorrelation function uh

105
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,000
of various Toral Collective variables

106
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:39,120
some of which have rather non-trivial

107
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,920
Behavior at these short time

108
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,879
scales as for the uh imp paintingdesign

109
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,599
uh we do have some results uh very

110
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:47,000
preliminary results there uh but not

111
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:50,040
quite exciting enough to put on a

112
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,640
highlight slide uh so in summary what we

113
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,599
want to do in this work is just to

114
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,959
introduce this idea and the promise of

115
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,200
this kind of framing of generative

116
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,400
modeling to the community um but also

117
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,000
motivate the development of

118
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,400
architectures that can accomplish kind

119
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,760
of modeling for larger systems such as

120
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:07,120
proteins and perhaps most uh importantly

121
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:10,040
help motivate the curation of such data

122
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,400
sets now one important caveat is that as

123
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,760
with any kind of generative modeling

124
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,000
there is the risk of

125
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,759
hallucinations however unlike people who

126
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,199
work on generative modeling in natural

127
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:21,120
language image or video we do actually

128
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,000
have access to the ground Truth uh

129
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,479
physical model of these systems in so

130
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,680
far as you trust the force field that

131
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,240
generated the simulations so one very

132
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,919
interesting line of work uh will be to

133
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,520
see how we can detect and steer away

134
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:34,720
from hallucinations by judiciously using

135
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,360
uh these physical stimulators in the

136
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,880
generative process uh so with that I I

137
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,199
thank you and happy to chat more at the

138
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,199
poster session
