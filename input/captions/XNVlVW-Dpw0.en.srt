Chemical engineering at
MIT and former Director

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:07,720
of the MIT Energy Initiative.

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:11,260
It's my pleasure to welcome you
to this webinar in which we're

5
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:15,400
going to present results of
a study on the role of fusion

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,680
in a decarbonized
electricity system.

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,100
The full report for the study
is being released today.

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,500
This study was done
by the MIT Energy

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,000
Initiative in collaboration with
MIT's Plasma Science and Fusion

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,940
Center, and involved the
research and analysis

11
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,050
of an interdisciplinary team
of more than 30 researchers,

12
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,770
with expertise ranging from
nuclear science and engineering,

13
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,920
to economics and policy.

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,500
Fusion has long
captured the imagination

15
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,225
of those interested in
emissions-free, abundant energy.

16
00:00:50,225 --> 00:00:53,390

17
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:57,230
With more than 40 fusion startup
companies and more than 100

18
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:00,000
government-supported
fusion projects,

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,780
there has never been more
momentum and enthusiasm

20
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:07,680
for the role of fusion
in the energy transition.

21
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,050
Two characteristics
make fusion particularly

22
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:12,480
important to the
energy transition.

23
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:17,130
First, that it can provide
zero carbon firm power.

24
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:20,870
This is not only essential to
the future electricity system,

25
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:24,800
there simply are not many
options for providing it.

26
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,770
Second, fusion can
also meet needs

27
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:31,990
for scalable energy-dense
generation capacity.

28
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:33,880
So the time is
right to understand

29
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,350
how fusion power could
transform electricity generation

30
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:41,056
in the decades ahead.

31
00:01:41,056 --> 00:01:43,430
Among the questions we
addressed in this study

32
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:46,610
are how fusion will
complement and coexist

33
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:50,450
with other low-carbon energy
technologies, deployment

34
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:55,760
scale and global distribution,
sensitivity to costs,

35
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,400
sensitivity to
emissions constraints,

36
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,340
sensitivity to
renewable resources,

37
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:04,880
and critical materials
and supply chains.

38
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,419
Not only can this understanding
be helpful to strategic planners

39
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,850
and policy-makers,
but it can also

40
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:14,720
be helpful to those involved
in fusion commercialization,

41
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,320
because it provides economic
targets for the use of fusion

42
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,420
in electricity markets.

43
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,390
This better quantifies the
technical design challenges

44
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,760
for fusion developers
with respect

45
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,940
to pricing, availability,
and load following.

46
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,730
To dive into the study, I'd
like to turn the program over

47
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,780
to Randy Field, who is Director
of Research at the MIT Energy

48
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,720
Initiative and was executive
director of the study.

49
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,690
Randy?

50
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:45,540
Thank you very much,
Professor Armstrong.

51
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,060
And thank you all for
attending the webinar today.

52
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:51,850
Before discussing
the fusion study,

53
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:55,110
I'm going to take a very
brief moment to give you

54
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,420
an overview of fusion.

55
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:14,630

56
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:19,100
When two nuclei
fuse together, they

57
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,360
release a tremendous
amount of energy,

58
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,280
more than a million times the
energy released per unit mass

59
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,560
from combusting of fossil fuels.

60
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,860
And this energy source does
not release greenhouse gases.

61
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:35,540
Thus, fusion has great
potential as a energy

62
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,980
source going forward.

63
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:42,150
However, to enable fusion
to occur at a useful scale,

64
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,660
we need very high
temperatures, and we

65
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,750
must bring the
fusion fuels together

66
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:51,420
via confinement to
enable them to fuse.

67
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:57,020
There are various categories
of confinement methods.

68
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,640
One method is
magnetic confinement,

69
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,940
where a very strong
magnetic field

70
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:06,920
is used to ensure the fuel ions
are kept close together and away

71
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,160
from the walls of the reactor.

72
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,050
Another method is
inertial confinement,

73
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:16,170
where lasers or
projectiles are used

74
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:22,350
to rapidly compress and
heat up the fuel capsule.

75
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:25,150
A third method is magneto
inertial confinement,

76
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:30,080
which uses a combination of the
prior two confinement methods.

77
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,200
These confinement methods have
been successfully demonstrated

78
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,980
in experiments, and
fusion has been achieved.

79
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:42,170
However, the challenge is in
the engineering and economics.

80
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:44,570
Commercial success
for fusion energy

81
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:47,990
requires that we build
economically-viable systems

82
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:51,260
to handle the high temperatures
and the high-energy particles

83
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,900
that are released,
and also, the ability

84
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:59,060
to convert the released
energy into electricity.

85
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:02,960
Each fuel type and
confinement method

86
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,450
has its own set of
engineering challenges

87
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:07,966
and its own
innovative solutions.

88
00:05:07,966 --> 00:05:14,150

89
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:17,390
As Professor Armstrong stated,
given the great potential

90
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:20,300
for fusion, it deserves
a close examination

91
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,510
to understand how fusion
power plants could

92
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:28,970
transform the energy generation
in the decades ahead.

93
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:33,530
We started this project
in fall of 2022,

94
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:38,550
and we organized the analysis
along four major work streams.

95
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:42,590
These were examine the global
deployment of fusion power

96
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:44,300
plants in all
regions of the world

97
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,670
out to the end of the century.

98
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:51,710
We also analyzed the
subregional grid at grid scale

99
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:56,480
to understand how fusion will
fit in with the generation mix

100
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:00,610
when you have different
resources available.

101
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,740
We also assessed
critical materials

102
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:06,130
and manufactured components
that are needed for fusion

103
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:08,230
to understand
potential bottlenecks

104
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:13,910
and to build out the fleet
of fusion power plants.

105
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:17,960
We also examined
key cost-drivers

106
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,950
for fusion power plants.

107
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:23,170
I also want to take
a moment to point out

108
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:26,530
that this study intentionally
does not make predictions

109
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:29,200
about when fusion will
be deployed commercially,

110
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,440
or which fusion technology will
come first, or which fusion--

111
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,990
or what will be the cost
of fusion in the future.

112
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:40,600
Instead, we have conducted
a scenario analysis

113
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,790
and sensitivity
analysis in order

114
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:46,930
to focus on the conditions
required for fusion

115
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,540
to be deployed at scale.

116
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:52,620

117
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:58,620
Now we will move on
to the main findings

118
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,560
from the study with a
series of presentations

119
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,780
by several members
of the project team.

120
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:07,650
And I will be starting
with Sergey Paltsev, who

121
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:11,290
led the global analysis
workstream for the study.

122
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:14,970
Sergey is an economist, and
he is the deputy director

123
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:17,970
for the MIT Center for
Sustainability, Science,

124
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:21,960
and Strategy, and he is also
a senior research scientist

125
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,170
for the MIT Energy Initiative.

126
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,840
Sergey?

127
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,760
Thank you, Randy.

128
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,640
Stressed in the
earlier remarks, there

129
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,330
are substantial uncertainties
about several aspects

130
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,150
on the technological
side of energy.

131
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:41,720
On the economic side, one
of the goals of this study

132
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,060
is to provide to
technology developers

133
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:48,800
the indicators of the goals
for the potential economic case

134
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,420
for fusion energy.

135
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:54,180
To better understand
these indicators,

136
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,720
we assess several scenarios.

137
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,280
Details of the scenarios
are provided in the report,

138
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,310
but let me very
briefly orient you

139
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:04,110
about the major settings
of these scenarios.

140
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:08,810
First, we assessed the
world, which is on its path

141
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:10,890
to decarbonization goals.

142
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:14,510
And in all scenarios, the
world reaches the goal

143
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:17,888
of stabilizing the global
temperature at 1.5 degrees

144
00:08:17,888 --> 00:08:18,980
Celcius.

145
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:23,700
In these scenarios, we do not
force any particular technology,

146
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:29,250
but rather, they compete based
on their relative economic

147
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,540
competitiveness.

148
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:34,020
Second, we evaluated
several cases

149
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:38,250
for the cost of zero carbon
dispatchable technology,

150
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:42,330
like fusion, and we
evaluate the full dynamics

151
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:44,590
of the costs over time.

152
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:47,430
And for simplicity,
we label the cases

153
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:52,610
for fusion in terms of their
overnight capital costs in 2050.

154
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:56,760
So it means that before
2050, the costs are higher,

155
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,120
and after 2050, the
costs are decreasing.

156
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,650
And the full curves are
provided in the report,

157
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:07,200
but for simplicity, you will
see these labels, $8,000,

158
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,300
$5,600 per kilowatt, and
these are the costs for 2050.

159
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,810
To assess the potential
societal value,

160
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:19,260
we compared the scenarios
where the fusion does not

161
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,950
exist with the
scenarios where fusion

162
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:25,320
exists at different costs.

163
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:32,220
So, for example, where fusion
exists at $8,000 per kilowatt,

164
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,850
you can see, represented
in the blue line,

165
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:39,910
the societal value
of the fusion.

166
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:44,070
And, of course, if fusion
developers are able to reduce

167
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:48,600
their costs, in this example,
to $5,600 per kilowatt,

168
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,240
the economic value
for society is higher.

169
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,600
And that example is given by
the yellow line on this graph.

170
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,680
We can also aggregate
those benefits

171
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,020
over time and over the century.

172
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,490
Compared to a scenario
without fusion,

173
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:10,080
the global cumulative GDP would
be 0.4% higher in our base case

174
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:19,020
of $8,000, and if the costs
are lower, to $5,600, well,

175
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,710
then the benefits are higher.

176
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:24,450
In that particular case,
it's about 1% increase

177
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:28,950
in the global GDP if fusion
energy enters the mix.

178
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:31,620
So these results
indicate that investment

179
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,380
in developing and
deployment of fusion energy

180
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:38,520
can create a large societal
value for the global economy

181
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:42,090
and support the efforts to
achieve decarbonization goals

182
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:43,813
over the course of the century.

183
00:10:43,813 --> 00:10:44,605
Next slide, please.

184
00:10:44,605 --> 00:10:48,600

185
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,190
We also ask the
question, how large

186
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:59,070
is the contribution of fusion
energy to the global power

187
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:00,540
generation mix?

188
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:03,730
And in this graph,
in these diagrams,

189
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:07,320
in these four diagrams, you see
different cases for different

190
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:12,300
costs of the fusion, where the
value of the cost from less than

191
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:17,390
$3,000 per kilowatt, to more
than $11,000 per kilowatt.

192
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:21,360
And you can see the results
in this magenta color

193
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,680
for fusion, that the share in
the global power generation mix

194
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,970
varies from less than
10% to about half.

195
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:34,530
And this show that the
contribution of fusion

196
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:39,030
can be quite large, but this
sizeable deployment of fusion

197
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:43,033
is going to be mostly in the
second half of the century.

198
00:11:43,033 --> 00:11:43,825
Next slide, please.

199
00:11:43,825 --> 00:11:47,570

200
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:51,060
To realize these sizable
contributions of fusion,

201
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:55,130
the technological, economic,
and regulatory challenges

202
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:58,050
of fusion energy
needs to be addressed,

203
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,530
and we need to start
addressing them now

204
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:04,070
to have the meaningful
deployment by mid-century.

205
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:06,330
As you can see from
these illustrations,

206
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:10,010
we found that initial deployment
is strongest in the United

207
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:11,650
States and Europe.

208
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:15,880
The largest increase in
fusion takes place in India

209
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,680
during the last three
decades of the century.

210
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,170
And Africa is a late
adopter of fusion,

211
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:25,190
but seeing very strong growth
in the late of the century.

212
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:29,720
We also stress that these
results depend on many factors,

213
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,440
and some of them are
listed on this slide.

214
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,590
Of course, many aspects
of fusion operations

215
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:38,990
are beyond the scope
of our global modeling,

216
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:41,320
and therefore, the
exact numerical values

217
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,800
should be treated with a
great degree of caution.

218
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,970
We provide some more granular
results in this next session

219
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,390
and in the report.

220
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:53,170
I want to finish my
part by emphasizing

221
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:55,780
that with all
inherent uncertainty

222
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,670
about the potential
cost reductions

223
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:02,050
in technological options,
one message is very clear,

224
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:05,410
the successful resolution
of technological challenges

225
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:08,500
and appropriate
regulatory incentives.

226
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,830
Fusion can provide a
substantial contribution

227
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:16,070
to the world that requires
the expanding electrification.

228
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:20,440
And it helps the global
society to reach and sustain

229
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,700
its decarbonization goals.

230
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,270
Thank you.

231
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,440
Randy, back to you.

232
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,430

233
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:30,680
Thank you very much, Sergey.

234
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,560
Next up is Amanda
Farnsworth, who

235
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:38,660
recently graduated from MIT with
a PhD in chemical engineering.

236
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:42,050
Amanda worked on the subregional
grid analysis workstream

237
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:43,700
for the study.

238
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,720
Over to you, Amanda.

239
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,630
Thanks, Randy.

240
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:50,420
So in this particular
section of the report,

241
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:54,220
we used a different model, ideal
grid, to zoom in a little bit,

242
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,230
looking specifically
at the United States

243
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:59,380
and comparing and contrasting
the adoption of fusion

244
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,720
within the different
regions that are highlighted

245
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,240
in the map on the right.

246
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,140
We looked at generator buildout
at a variety of different carbon

247
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:13,090
ceilings, ranging from 50
to 1 gram of CO2 equivalent

248
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:14,420
per kilowatt hour.

249
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:18,400
And just as a reference, grams
of CO2 equivalent per kilowatt

250
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:24,160
hour marks about an 85% decrease
from our 2023 national average,

251
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,300
and a 90% decrease
from our 2015 levels.

252
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:32,510
So with all this data on
optimized generator fleets,

253
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:36,220
we were able to
see which regions

254
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:40,820
saw different roles of fusion
given the same constraints.

255
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:44,440
We adopted two main metrics
to quantify fusion's role.

256
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:49,340
First, penetration, which just
measures what level of adoption

257
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,530
we're seeing in
general in comparison

258
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:54,140
to the national
average, and the second

259
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,480
is sensitivity,
which measures how

260
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:02,120
much fusion penetration changes
as we adjust our carbon ceiling.

261
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,270
We've grouped together the
regions with similar fusion

262
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:08,900
trends to better understand the
characteristics of those regions

263
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,550
which affect fusion.

264
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:13,610
I'll walk you through
this chart on the slide

265
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:16,970
here which summarizes our
findings really well, starting

266
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:19,220
on the left, with the
regions which saw the highest

267
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,890
need for fusion, and then
moving to the ones which

268
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:24,410
saw less need for fusion.

269
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:27,410
So first, the
Atlantic and Southeast

270
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:30,210
saw high penetration
and low sensitivity,

271
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:33,920
meaning that they saw a large
amount of fusion present

272
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,560
at all carbon caps
that we tested.

273
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,070
This is because these regions
have very limited and weak

274
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:43,100
onshore wind resources,
and also don't

275
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,740
have any alternative
dispatchable low-carbon

276
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:50,090
technologies, such as
hydro or geothermal.

277
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:52,700
Next, we have California,
the Northeast,

278
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:56,570
and the Southwest, which saw
moderate fusion adoption.

279
00:15:56,570 --> 00:16:01,200
We didn't see any fusion at 50
grams of CO2 per kilowatt hour,

280
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,550
but installations were
reaching up to 50% of demand

281
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:07,910
at the deepest
decarbonization levels.

282
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:11,240
These regions have moderate
onshore wind resources

283
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,890
and decent low-carbon-supporting
technologies.

284
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:19,520
The Northwest saw the
lowest penetration

285
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,620
and a low sensitivity
level, meaning

286
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:24,800
we didn't see a lot
of fusion until we

287
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,600
reached lower emissions caps.

288
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,200
And even at those low
caps, the penetration

289
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,360
did stay relatively low.

290
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:36,230
This is because the Northwest
has decent wind resources

291
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:39,320
and a large amount of
geothermal and hydro, which

292
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,800
fusion is competing with.

293
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,230
Lastly, we have the
Central, North Central,

294
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:47,740
and Texas regions, which saw
low penetration, but high

295
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,630
sensitivity.

296
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:52,750
There was no fusion adoption
until deep decarbonization

297
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:57,550
levels, but when fusion is
adopted, it reaches almost 50%

298
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:00,210
of demand in some regions.

299
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:02,670
These regions have the
strongest wind resources,

300
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:05,940
but don't have any alternative
low-carbon-supporting

301
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,980
technologies.

302
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:10,920
This analysis summarizes
the driving factors

303
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,500
behind fusion adoption.

304
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:16,599
First and foremost, you need
decarbonization targets.

305
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:20,220
Without carbon constraints, the
role of fusion is very limited.

306
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,530
But fusion plays
an important role

307
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:25,930
for all regions at deep
decarbonization targets,

308
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:30,060
with installations reaching
at least 25% of demand

309
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:33,370
in all regions at our deepest
decarbonization level,

310
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:35,970
1 gram of CO2 per kilowatt hour.

311
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:40,770
Secondly, fusion adoption
is dependent on your more

312
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:46,350
conventional renewable
energy resources, wind,

313
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:47,720
what are your capacity factors?

314
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,970
What are your buildout limits?

315
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,460
And then, also,
we know that it's

316
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:54,340
competing with alternative
firm low-carbon technologies,

317
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,290
your hydro and your geothermal.

318
00:17:56,290 --> 00:18:02,430

319
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:05,110
Thank you very much, Amanda.

320
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:08,410
I will now introduce
Ruaridh MacDonald, who

321
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:12,580
received his PhD in nuclear
science and engineering at MIT,

322
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:17,320
and he is a research scientist
at the MIT Energy Initiative.

323
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:21,940
Ruaridh worked on the
subregional grid workstream

324
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:22,990
for this project.

325
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:26,530
He actually zoomed in to
look at the New England area

326
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:30,160
and the potential role for
fusion in that context.

327
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,710
Over to you, Ruaridh.

328
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:33,210
Great.

329
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:34,483
Thanks very much, Randy.

330
00:18:34,483 --> 00:18:36,650
So we studied fusion control
in the New England grid

331
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:39,770
in greater detail using a GenX
model of the ISO New England

332
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:43,560
grid and reservoir hydro
resources in Quebec for 2050.

333
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,530
This grid has
relatively limited sites

334
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:47,490
to construct onshore
wind and solar,

335
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:50,430
so other low-emission resources
have an important role to play,

336
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,220
including fusion power.

337
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:55,010
These three plots show the
installed capacity, generation,

338
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:56,870
and capacity factors
of the fusion fleet

339
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:59,510
as a function of the fusion
power plant capital cost

340
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:02,420
and for three different
emission intensity limits.

341
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:05,150
The left plot shows how the
installed capacity of the fleet

342
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,340
increases as the
capital costs fall.

343
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,375
The changing gradients
in Patos correspond

344
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:11,750
to fusion plants substituting
for the different competing

345
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,688
resources.

346
00:19:12,688 --> 00:19:15,230
The peak load of the ISO New
England grid is approximately 60

347
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:19,100
gigawatts in this scenario, so
this 50% value is a 30-gigawatt

348
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,150
fleet.

349
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,980
The rightmost
point of each curve

350
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:24,920
is the fusion power plant cost
at which the first reactor

351
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,950
is added to the grid.

352
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:28,830
This is essentially a cost
target for fusion designers.

353
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:31,320
The cost targets
are 6 and 1/2, 8,

354
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,440
and $14,000 per
kilowatt at the 50, 12,

355
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,350
and 5 grams CO2 per kilowatt
hour emission intensity rates,

356
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,520
respectively.

357
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,160
These cost targets are slightly
lower than they might be today

358
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,380
because we're using 2050
costs for alternatives,

359
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,965
such as renewables, storage,
and natural gas for CCS units,

360
00:19:45,965 --> 00:19:47,340
but on the other
hand, we're also

361
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:50,230
assuming 2050 emission
limits, which, as we can see,

362
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:53,768
significantly determine the
cost targets for fusion power.

363
00:19:53,768 --> 00:19:55,810
The other two subplots
show how the fusion fleets

364
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:57,670
share of generation
and capacity factors

365
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,710
changed with the
fusion plant costs.

366
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:02,420
At 12 and 50 grams
CO2 per kilowatt hour,

367
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,750
we see the trends most
of us would expect.

368
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,030
A small, moderately
expensive fusion fleet

369
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:09,250
operates mostly as baseload.

370
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,680
If the fusion
plants cost more, it

371
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,200
begins to substitute for
more technologies as a larger

372
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,910
fraction of generation
and therefore also

373
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:18,640
has a slightly lower
capacity factor.

374
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,320
However, we were
surprised to see

375
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,430
that with the strictest
emission intensity limits,

376
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:25,330
very expensive fusion plants
are operated at low capacity

377
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:26,150
factors.

378
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:28,123
When we investigated
this, we found

379
00:20:28,123 --> 00:20:30,790
that it's because it's difficult
to meet this emission intensity

380
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:33,670
target with natural gas
and CCS units alone.

381
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:35,200
Natural gas units
can only operate

382
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,860
for a small fraction
of the year,

383
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:40,240
so you must construct additional
storage and renewable generation

384
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,790
in order to meet the demand.

385
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:46,280
And this is a very expensive
way of going about things.

386
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,160
And that creates an
opportunity for fusion

387
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,020
as a clean,
dispatchable resource

388
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,010
to operate in a variable manner.

389
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:53,760
And so even though
it's expensive,

390
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,930
it has an important role to play
in replacing those underutilized

391
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,550
alternative resources.

392
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,650
Operating with this low
of a capacity factor

393
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:03,230
also reduces the maintenance
costs of the fusion plant

394
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:06,170
by reducing the rate at which
radiation-facing components can

395
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:07,640
be replaced.

396
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,650
Next slide, please.

397
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:13,890
So these results clearly
hinge on the alternatives

398
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:17,190
that were in the market
against fusion power plants,

399
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:20,160
but in particular, natural
gas, their combined cycle

400
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,870
units with CCS.

401
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:24,300
So these plots show
the installed capacity

402
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:27,660
of the fusion fleet with and
without natural gas CCS units

403
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,740
being available.

404
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:32,370
Without CCS units, fusion
becomes the primary alternative

405
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:34,510
to excess renewables
and storage,

406
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:38,460
and it's able to cost roughly
$4,000 per kilowatt more than

407
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,840
in the base case.

408
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,930
While it's unlikely that New
England won't have any CCS

409
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:46,060
units, we wanted to understand
the impact of this change,

410
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:48,210
as there are plenty of
regions in the world where

411
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:51,780
natural gas is more expensive,
or CO2 sequestration

412
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,810
at large scale may be
expensive or impossible.

413
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:59,920
And lastly, we've assumed a 95%
capture rate for the CCS unit,

414
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,830
regardless of how the
natural gas unit operates,

415
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,550
whether as a base
load or as a peaker,

416
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:06,790
and that might not be
feasible in the future.

417
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:09,270
And so these are
the bookend cases

418
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:14,310
of how fusion costs can be
impacted by the presence

419
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,990
or absence of natural gas.

420
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:18,750
Thanks very much.

421
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:21,180
Thank you very much, Ruaridh.

422
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:26,650
At this point, we'll go
on to another work stream.

423
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:31,780
Professor Dennis Whyte and
postdoc Theodore Mouratidis

424
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:34,060
led the work stream
on supply chain

425
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:37,240
for materials and
manufactured parts.

426
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,600
Our assessment found that
different technologies

427
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,020
are at very different
stages of maturity.

428
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:45,760
In the report, we
identify issues

429
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,160
and potential bottlenecks.

430
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,560
A key point is
that additional R&D

431
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:54,190
is required to develop some
materials and manufacturing

432
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:57,070
technologies as
needed for fusion.

433
00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:00,430
This is more often the
case for technologies

434
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:04,370
that have little or no
markets outside of fusion.

435
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:09,100
An example is tungsten heavy,
which is a very dense alloy that

436
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:12,880
can handle the harsh
conditions in a fusion reactor,

437
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,000
whereas other technologies,
such as high-temperature

438
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,760
superconductors, have strong
commercial opportunities

439
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,170
in non-fusion applications.

440
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:27,000
Thus, those supply chains
are more developed.

441
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,890
Next, we also looked at
the techno economics.

442
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:36,330
Professor Koroush Shirvan
and graduate student Layla

443
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:40,720
Araiinejad led our
techno economic analysis.

444
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,890
In this cost analysis,
we examined prior studies

445
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:48,120
that assessed the costs or--

446
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:52,030
the costs for alternative
fusion configurations.

447
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:57,450
We also conducted a
bottoms-up analysis.

448
00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:01,590
One key observation is that
the fusion reactor equipment

449
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:05,430
is the leading cost
contributor across a wide range

450
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:08,190
of different fusion
plant configurations.

451
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:11,730
We also concluded that fusion--

452
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:15,180
that how fusion is regulated,
can have a large impact

453
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:17,040
on overall costs.

454
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,730
The logical upshot of that is
that fusion power plant designs

455
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:23,340
need to minimize
their risk footprint,

456
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:27,870
and governments need to adopt
appropriate and efficient

457
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:32,220
policies that ensure
safe use of fusion energy

458
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,860
while enabling
fusion to contribute

459
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:38,340
to our decarbonization goals.

460
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,560
We also observed that the
operating and maintenance

461
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:44,230
costs for fusion power
plants can be significant.

462
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:46,800

463
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:52,010
So from what you've
heard here today,

464
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:57,340
I just wanted to summarize
some of the key takeaways.

465
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:03,175
First of all, fusion has a very
large potential societal value

466
00:25:03,175 --> 00:25:06,020
in the trillions
of dollars range,

467
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:09,490
as was presented
by Sergey Paltsev.

468
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:12,610
We also saw from
several of the analysis

469
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:16,090
here today that the
deployment, as well as

470
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:18,050
the operation of
fusion power plants,

471
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:20,300
is highly dependent
upon, of course,

472
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:23,000
the cost of the fusion
technology itself,

473
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,410
as well as the
availability and the cost

474
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:30,370
of alternative
low-carbon technologies.

475
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:34,120
Furthermore, as Ruaridh
MacDonald showed,

476
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:37,570
the carbon emissions
constraint has a large impact

477
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:42,120
on what this
penetration will be.

478
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:49,710
And also, when we looked at the
global deployment of fusion,

479
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:53,920
there are many things that
shape the deployment of fusion,

480
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:57,130
and part of that is economic
and electricity demand growth.

481
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:59,770
And we saw growth in
different parts of the world,

482
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:05,030
including India, in the
later part of the century.

483
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:09,870
Furthermore, the study looked
at market design issues.

484
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:12,710
And this really affects all
types of power generation

485
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:18,390
investments, but certainly,
that includes fusion.

486
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:21,340
As discussed in the
supply chain topic,

487
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:24,420
the ability for fusion to
scale requires development

488
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:29,460
of materials and
manufacturing capacity,

489
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:32,310
particularly in the
niche component sector.

490
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:37,470
And lastly, the raw
materials were investigated,

491
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,750
quite a few different
raw materials considered

492
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:40,870
in the report.

493
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:44,920
And we do not see and do
not anticipate showstoppers,

494
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:48,120
but, in fact, the need
for these raw materials

495
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,540
will grow over time.

496
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:52,320
And so the capacity will
need to be built up,

497
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,570
and it will be an
area that will require

498
00:26:54,570 --> 00:27:01,280
attention and encouragement.

499
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:05,480
I'd like to also acknowledge
the large team of people

500
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:09,500
who contributed in various
ways to this important study.

501
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:13,450
I thank you all for that.

502
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:23,480
So at this point, we will
commence with the panel

503
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,070
discussion here today.

504
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:30,210
And for that, I will turn to
Professor Dennis Whyte, who will

505
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:33,210
moderate our panel discussion.

506
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:37,600
Dennis is the co-principal
investigator for this study.

507
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:42,840
And he is a professor of Nuclear
Science and Engineering at MIT.

508
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,790
Over to you, Dennis.

509
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,200
Thanks, Randy.

510
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:51,150
And you've met through
presentations or introductions

511
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:52,800
already the other panel members.

512
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,370
I'd also like to introduce
Dr. Sara Ferry, who

513
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:59,760
is a research scientist at the
Plasma Science and Fusion Center

514
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,950
who works on fusion
technologies,

515
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:04,260
and Professor John
Parsons, who's

516
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:07,650
the deputy director for
the Center for Energy

517
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:11,070
and Environmental
Policy Research at MIT.

518
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,970
So welcome, panelists.

519
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:16,140

520
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,420
I've got a few prepared
questions to start off,

521
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:21,270
and then we'll take-- and then
we'll tackle some questions

522
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:22,090
from the audience.

523
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:24,215
Thank you for the good
questions from the audience.

524
00:28:24,215 --> 00:28:25,810
Keep them coming.

525
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:30,130
So I'm going to start
with what I actually

526
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:33,880
considered a bit of a surprise,
actually, from the study, which

527
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:37,930
was typically, when we consider
fusion power plants, people

528
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:40,390
think of them as base
load units, namely,

529
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:44,120
to provide continuous
power as backing.

530
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,280
But what we found--

531
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,930
particularly, this is
to you, Ruaridh-- was,

532
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:51,760
can you explain your analysis?

533
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,270
Which was interesting is
that you could actually

534
00:28:55,270 --> 00:29:00,070
find places where the economics
optimized for lower capacity

535
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:03,190
factors, namely, running
them not all the time,

536
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:07,660
and sort of run it more like
a peaker that was doing that.

537
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:10,690
So could you just please comment
to some more of the details

538
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:13,820
of that surprise that we found.

539
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:14,320
Sure.

540
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,015
So I think, first off,
it's important to note

541
00:29:17,015 --> 00:29:19,640
that these are really just for
the very low-emission scenarios.

542
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,520
We didn't see this
at the 50 grams

543
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:25,250
CO2 per kilowatt, which is
at 12 and 4 grams per CO2.

544
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:28,000
And it had to do with the
relatively small handful

545
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,880
of hours where you
have very high net load

546
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,770
in the system, net
load meaning demand

547
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:34,940
minus your renewables
generation.

548
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,750
And we ran these optimizations,
GenX optimizations,

549
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,410
over 20 years.

550
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:43,120
So we got to see a pretty wide
variety of weather and demand

551
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,030
patterns.

552
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:48,910
And so I think we got to
see some of the edge cases.

553
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:51,010
Those edge cases do
go quite a long way

554
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:53,200
to determining the
optimal investment

555
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,670
decisions in the system.

556
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:56,385
But during those hours
of high net load,

557
00:29:56,385 --> 00:29:57,760
the cheapest option
would be just

558
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,090
to use flexible natural gas,
with or without CCS units

559
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:04,600
to cover the net demand, as well
as having some high utilization

560
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,010
storage resources.

561
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:08,270
But we have a strict
emission limit.

562
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:11,020
And so there's natural
gas CCS units are capped

563
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,790
at a certain number
of hours or generation

564
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:14,150
they can produce per year.

565
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:17,030
At the lowest emission rate, it
was something like 1,000 hours

566
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:18,300
or less per year.

567
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:22,050
And so there's still many
more hours you have to cover.

568
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:25,545
So the primary option you
have is to build more storage,

569
00:30:25,545 --> 00:30:27,170
but then, you also
need more renewables

570
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:29,640
in order to energize
or charge that storage.

571
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,640
So that's a very expensive
option over the long term.

572
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,040
And fusion plants, as a
zero-emission dispatchable

573
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,140
resource, are a
strong alternative.

574
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:42,843
And the prices are very
high during those hours

575
00:30:42,843 --> 00:30:45,260
because the alternative is all
these additional renewables

576
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,170
and storage.

577
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:50,030
And so the fusion plants
are paid very high revenues,

578
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:52,610
as long as the market is
designed properly, in order

579
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:55,650
to operate with these
relatively low-capacity factors,

580
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:57,560
but during the hours
that matter most

581
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:00,500
from the systems point of view.

582
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,160
There are two things to note.

583
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,760
One, there are plenty
of technologies,

584
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:07,250
advanced or upcoming
technologies, or clean fuels

585
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:08,730
that we didn't consider.

586
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:10,310
So there is a chance
that one of them

587
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:13,400
may have a significant drop
in price in the next 30 years

588
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,830
and be a competitor,
and that would

589
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:18,170
reduce some of this
impact, particularly

590
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:19,293
on the clean fuel side.

591
00:31:19,293 --> 00:31:20,960
And the other thing
to note is we're not

592
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,630
saying that cheap fusion plants
will have low-capacity factors.

593
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:26,340
If you look at the
plots in the report,

594
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:30,090
whenever the cost
of fusion falls,

595
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:31,665
the capacity factor
initially rises

596
00:31:31,665 --> 00:31:32,790
and it becomes a base load.

597
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:36,530
And then, once it starts
directly outcompeting renewables

598
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:38,960
at very low costs, then
the capacity factor

599
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,960
starts falling again.

600
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,860
So it's really just
about those small number

601
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:45,050
of very expensive
hours and having

602
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:46,490
something that
has zero emissions

603
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:48,590
to cover the net demand.

604
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:49,400
Thanks Ruaridh.

605
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,000
Nonetheless, an
interesting insight,

606
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,480
I would say, for
fusion designers who

607
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:57,290
are considering aspects of what
kind of variability in the power

608
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,750
output they could have.

609
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:03,650
Amanda, I'm going to turn
to you next, which is really

610
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:07,370
very interesting to see
the high variability just

611
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:09,480
among the regions in
the United States.

612
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,270
And if you then think
of the United States

613
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:13,050
relative to the
rest of the world,

614
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:16,370
we have relatively low
population density.

615
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:19,020
We have access to a variety
of renewable resources,

616
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,160
as you pointed out.

617
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,940
And it tends to
be more than just

618
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:27,710
for geographic reasons
or population density.

619
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:29,210
Could you just
share your thoughts

620
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:32,910
about how you think if we
took this and your analysis,

621
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:35,210
what this would tell
us about the importance

622
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:37,820
of firm low-carbon
electricity generation that

623
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:41,500
comes from fusion in regions
of the world that have,

624
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:45,590
in some sense, poor access to
renewable resources, or to,

625
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:49,540
clearly, less diversity
in renewable resources.

626
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,040
Yeah.

627
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:50,820
Thanks, Dennis.

628
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:53,250
That's a great question.

629
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:58,890
So we can take the trends and
the conclusions from my analysis

630
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:01,990
and extrapolate those to
international locations.

631
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:04,440
So the first thing
we learned is that we

632
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,180
know the country
in question needs

633
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:10,530
to have decarbonization targets
to incentivize a transition away

634
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:13,050
from fossil fuel technologies.

635
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:17,280
Next, we need to look
at their availability

636
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:20,700
and strength of traditional
renewable resources, solar

637
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:21,550
and wind.

638
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:24,700
And we also need to look
at their alternative firm

639
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:28,115
low-carbon technologies, their
geothermal and their hydro.

640
00:33:28,115 --> 00:33:30,705

641
00:33:30,705 --> 00:33:32,790
And this is going
to look different

642
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:33,880
in different countries.

643
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,720
So I'll give two
bookend examples

644
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:42,360
to wrap our heads around
these conclusions.

645
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,520
The first country
I'll bring up is

646
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:48,000
Iceland, which has very
strong geothermal resources.

647
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,960
Based on our
analysis, we learned

648
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:53,810
that fusion is going to struggle
competing with geothermal.

649
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:57,250
So we're going to
see a limited--

650
00:33:57,250 --> 00:34:00,820
fusion is going to have a
more difficult time being

651
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:03,250
adopted in a place like that.

652
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:07,880
On the other hand, we can look
at a location such as Singapore,

653
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:12,230
which has very large
demand, not a lot of land,

654
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:16,060
and essentially, very, very
limited wind and solar buildout

655
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:16,760
options.

656
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,670
No geothermal, no hydro.

657
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:23,830
To get to decarbonization levels
below fossil fuels with carbon

658
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:28,900
capture, you're going to need
energy-dense, low-carbon firm

659
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,179
technologies like fusion.

660
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:35,530
So it really just
depends on the resources

661
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:40,030
available to the country
that you're looking at.

662
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:40,530
Yeah.

663
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:41,370
Thanks, Amanda.

664
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:41,870
Yeah.

665
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:43,650
Very insightful.

666
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:46,560
So of course, I love the
next set, this next question,

667
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,860
because it's almost always
the first question that's

668
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:52,173
always asked, when.

669
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:54,219
What is the timing for fusion?

670
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:55,610
When is it going to happen?

671
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:56,110
It's OK.

672
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:58,020
It's a good question.

673
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:00,850
So I'll just point
out, in the study,

674
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:02,460
we essentially
made an assumption

675
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,900
about when commercial
fusion would start.

676
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:07,573
We aligned it--
and this actually

677
00:35:07,573 --> 00:35:09,240
goes to some questions
that have already

678
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,370
come in from the audience.

679
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:13,290
We aligned it with the
comments and the average

680
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:17,370
of where the commercial fusion
developers now are seeing that.

681
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:19,800
We started at 2035.

682
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:23,790
We took historic data
from other new energy

683
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:28,870
sources about the doubling
time in terms of capacity.

684
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:33,540
So we put that in because we
needed to make some assumption.

685
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:38,010
This goes to the question,
if you take that timeline

686
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,400
as a given one, is it too late?

687
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,560
Does fusion still
have an impact?

688
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,310
And so here, I'll turn
to Sergey and Randy

689
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:46,580
about your thoughts on this.

690
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,520
And in some sense,
people think of this

691
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:53,240
often from the impact on the
environmental consequences,

692
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:57,160
but I'd also like you to comment
on the economic consequences

693
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:00,610
of the deployment timing.

694
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:01,550
Yeah, I'll start.

695
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:07,120
And Randy, you may add
your comments as well.

696
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:12,070
Well, that was also one of the
questions which we were getting.

697
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:17,200
Well, by mid-century, the
decarbonization will be done,

698
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,570
and why do we need a
fusion if everything

699
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:21,260
is going to be decarbonized?

700
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:25,690
And this is very oversimplistic
view of the world,

701
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:29,390
simply because the
needs for electricity,

702
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:31,210
the needs for
electrification, the needs

703
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:35,200
to provide energy to the society
is growing quite substantially

704
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,200
over time.

705
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,500
And you see those projections
and increases in demand.

706
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,650
And also, as
previously mentioned,

707
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:44,560
and Ruaridh has illustrated
that very well, is

708
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:49,060
these last reductions,
those very tough targets

709
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:53,990
require quite substantial
solution, engineering solution,

710
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:59,560
how to deal with these
zero-emission provision

711
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,800
of the power generation.

712
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,270
And indeed, depending on
how different technology

713
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:08,880
may evolve over time, the answer
might be slightly different.

714
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,880
And that's exactly the point of
this study, we exploring that.

715
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:16,430
But what we're finding out,
that the increasing demand

716
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:21,140
for electricity in
the global area,

717
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:24,200
and especially in
the emerging markets,

718
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:29,870
and also, with the limited
resources for wind and solar,

719
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:34,700
and especially for increasing
cost of integrating them

720
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:37,950
and making the system running
fully on wind and solar,

721
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:41,810
we actually see very good
economic case for fusion

722
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:43,920
in the second half
of the century.

723
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,150
And we see that under reasonable
assumptions about the costs.

724
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:50,090
We see very
substantial deployment

725
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:53,450
of the fusion technology
in the decarbonized world.

726
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:57,200
Randy, I don't know if you
want to add anything or expand.

727
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,270
No, Sergey, your
comments were perfect,

728
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:02,370
so I will not ruin
it with my comments.

729
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:05,300
Thank you.

730
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,300
Very good.

731
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:12,470
And next topic is about
fusion's cousin, fission.

732
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:16,910
And as you heard,
many of us are members

733
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:18,890
of Nuclear Science and
Engineering Departments

734
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:20,300
as well, too.

735
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:23,150
John, could you make
a comment to this

736
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:26,930
about how we treated fission
in the study and the overall--

737
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:32,090
your overall comments
are regarding that?

738
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:32,900
Sure.

739
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:37,640
So in the executive
summary, we took this point

740
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,990
on pretty clearly.

741
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:41,930
The economic analysis
in this report

742
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:46,220
is focused on what we think is
a key feature of modern power

743
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:49,460
markets, which is the
increasing penetration

744
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:52,160
of low-cost renewable energy.

745
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:56,270
And the accessible capacity
of these renewable resources

746
00:38:56,270 --> 00:39:00,140
are variable across
hours and seasons, which

747
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:03,740
means there's a complementary
need for technologies that

748
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:08,270
provide firm, dispatchable,
low-carbon electricity

749
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:11,150
to guarantee you've got
electricity in all hours

750
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:13,710
when renewable
generation is low.

751
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:17,100
Both nuclear fusion
and nuclear fission

752
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:21,250
are firm, low-carbon electricity
generating technologies.

753
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:25,240
And they're also both
energy-dense technologies.

754
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,930
And so they're really
competing together

755
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:32,190
for the same sort of
competitive space in a country

756
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:36,390
or region's portfolio
of generating capacity.

757
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:41,480
However, they each differ from
one another in key respects.

758
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,830
The safety profiles
for each are unique,

759
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:49,170
and the two technologies may
face different regulations.

760
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:52,890
They rely on different
sets of materials

761
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:57,110
and evolving areas of
technological development.

762
00:39:57,110 --> 00:40:00,590
Fission has encountered highly
variable social acceptance

763
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:02,210
across countries.

764
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:06,980
Fusion's social acceptance
is entirely untested.

765
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:11,870
And so how those things develop
is going to be very complicated.

766
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:15,830
So the research is focused
on the economic opportunity

767
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:19,250
for fusion as a firm,
low-carbon-generating

768
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:23,570
technology, and how that
varies regionally and globally.

769
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:26,570
The competition
between them is going

770
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:29,840
to be very complicated
depending upon the evolution

771
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:33,210
of scientific, economic,
political, and social events,

772
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:37,460
which we don't put at
the heart of this report.

773
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:41,180
I do want to just mention, in
addition to fusion and fission,

774
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:45,510
there are other firm,
low-carbon technologies,

775
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:52,070
as Amanda mentioned, for
example, enhanced geothermal,

776
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:54,750
bioenergy with carbon
capture and storage.

777
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:58,570
And so they'll all be
competing for this same space.

778
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:00,540
But I think
identifying that space

779
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:05,500
and how it varies across
countries was the focus here.

780
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:08,710
Yes, it seems optionality
is always key in this.

781
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:11,530
And almost in some sense of
what Amanda was commenting

782
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:14,960
to, that you're seeing this
distribution of uses of hydro,

783
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,070
wind, electric, we
already consider

784
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:20,810
that we're going to have to have
a set of choices on the table.

785
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:22,840
So it seems natural
to extend that

786
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:26,410
to it shouldn't be
fusion versus fission.

787
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:28,620
They're going to be
adapted in different ways.

788
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:29,120
Yeah.

789
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,880
Thanks for that, John.

790
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,600
Actually, turning to a little
bit more technical one,

791
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,390
it was seen and it was
commented several times

792
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:44,002
that R&D is still
required for providing--

793
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:45,580
and you could see
this in the data,

794
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:48,810
actually, high-capacity factors
are a very wanted thing.

795
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:51,590
This means, from a
technical point of view,

796
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:55,900
we need components and systems
which have a high availability.

797
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:59,290
Sara, you work
directly in this field.

798
00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:01,600
Could you comment
as to what are some

799
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:06,680
of the challenges about
making that happen,

800
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:09,902
where we are relatively now, and
what are some of the efforts,

801
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:12,110
including some of the things
that are going on at MIT

802
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:14,430
right now about
addressing those issues?

803
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:14,930
Sure.

804
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:15,860
Thanks, Dennis.

805
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:19,130
So we work on a lot of different
aspects of fusion technology

806
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:22,790
here at the PSFC, and in the
US community more broadly.

807
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,800
One that you might
hear a lot about

808
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,260
is the technology associated
with fusion fueling.

809
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:31,760
So the fusion technologies
that we're primarily

810
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:36,080
focused on focus on burning
deuterium and tritium fuel.

811
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,040
We have very scarce
reserves of tritium,

812
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:41,250
so a fusion power plant
needs to breed its own.

813
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:43,820
And how you do this is
when the neutron comes off

814
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:46,290
of the fusing D and
T in the plasma,

815
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:49,010
you can capture that neutron in
a lithium-containing material

816
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:50,190
and breed tritium.

817
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:51,870
So it's straightforward
in principle,

818
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:53,810
but in practice, it's
quite challenging

819
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:56,060
to breed enough tritium.

820
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:58,640
That depends very much on
the operating parameters

821
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,730
and the design of your plant,
how much tritium you need

822
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:04,820
at any given point in
the plant's lifetime,

823
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:06,860
how to extract that
tritium efficiently

824
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:09,410
and get it ready and
prepared for fueling.

825
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:13,100
So this involves a lot of
different components in the fuel

826
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:13,860
cycle.

827
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:16,010
And a challenge of
fusion is that we

828
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,760
need to do this at a
very high throughput.

829
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,660
We have some experience with
this from the fission sector

830
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:22,020
at much lower throughputs.

831
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:23,478
So there's a lot
of work that needs

832
00:43:23,478 --> 00:43:25,470
to be done with regards
to scaling that up,

833
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:28,250
with understanding how to
breed the tritium using fusion

834
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:31,880
neutrons in the
lithium-containing materials.

835
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:34,010
We have a major
experimental campaign here

836
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:35,810
at the MIT Plasma
Science and Fusion

837
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:38,240
Center called LIBRA
that is focused

838
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,900
on testing tritium breeders
that are of direct interest

839
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:45,290
to advanced commercial entities,
like Commonwealth Fusion

840
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:46,080
Systems.

841
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,840
And so that's really exciting.

842
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:50,730
Another big challenge is,
of course, fusion materials.

843
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:53,090
Fusion power plants operate
at much higher temperatures

844
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:55,040
and neutron fluxes
than anything else

845
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,820
that we really have experience
with in human technical history.

846
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:01,075
So it's a much higher
rate of radiation damage

847
00:44:01,075 --> 00:44:03,200
that you're experiencing
than what we would be used

848
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,880
to from the fission sector.

849
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:08,060
So we have to do a lot of work
to develop advanced materials

850
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:09,890
and maintenance
strategies that are going

851
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:12,030
to be able to account for that.

852
00:44:12,030 --> 00:44:13,950
And these challenges
are quite enormous.

853
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:15,980
But a reason to be
optimistic is that we've

854
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:19,370
seen from other systems, such as
high-temperature superconducting

855
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:22,400
magnets, that even if something
is starting at a very, very

856
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,940
low technology readiness
level, when you

857
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:28,070
apply the right levers
and the right pressures

858
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:29,610
and get the right
teams on board,

859
00:44:29,610 --> 00:44:31,890
we can actually accelerate
that very, very quickly.

860
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:33,348
And that happened
with the magnets,

861
00:44:33,348 --> 00:44:36,950
as demonstrated by PSFC in the
CFS over the last five years

862
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:37,970
or so.

863
00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:44,030
We can take something from a
pretty low technical concept

864
00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:47,870
up to a full commercial scale in
a pretty rapid time as long as--

865
00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:50,060
when you just get the
right plan on board

866
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:51,480
and get everybody committed.

867
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:54,230
So there's a lot to do, but
we feel pretty optimistic.

868
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:58,450
And it's very exciting to
work on challenges like that.

869
00:44:58,450 --> 00:44:59,810
Yeah, well stated, Sara.

870
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:04,510
I mean, my own comment to
this is a study such as this

871
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:07,780
actually really
does help provide us

872
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:11,860
a quantification and
a better way of what

873
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:15,760
is the economic consequence
of such innovations,

874
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,210
or what the targets might be.

875
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:21,580
And so those things become
a little bit clearer for us.

876
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:24,020
So I'm going to move to
a few questions coming

877
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:24,770
from the audience.

878
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:26,450
Thank you for the
excellent questions.

879
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:28,780
I'm going to start
with one which

880
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:30,760
is about what the
study didn't cover,

881
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:35,680
because this was concentrating
on electricity, using fusion

882
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:36,790
for electricity.

883
00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:38,540
And one of the questions
was asking, well,

884
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:40,300
what about hydrogen production?

885
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:45,160
Or, for example, water
purification or desalination?

886
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,480
And so fusion being
applied to that,

887
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:52,600
if you could adapt fusion
to be able to bring it and--

888
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,730
technologies which would
adapt it into those

889
00:45:54,730 --> 00:45:58,280
uses, would that be a
significant business opportunity

890
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:01,820
for the expansion of
fusion as well, too?

891
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:05,420
Randy, you want to
give that one a swing?

892
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:06,630
Yes, absolutely.

893
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:10,100
So that's a great question.

894
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:13,710
And, yes, our current study
focused on electricity,

895
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:15,860
and, in many
respects, electricity

896
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:18,810
may be the first
application for fusion,

897
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:20,750
but there's
tremendous opportunity

898
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:24,630
to apply it for things such as
generation of low-carbon fuels.

899
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:27,110
The characteristics of
a production facility

900
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:32,480
for low-carbon fuels is that
you're investing in a facility,

901
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:36,770
whether it be electrolyzers for
making hydrogen by electrolysis,

902
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:42,480
or other techniques, you want
to operate that plant 24/7.

903
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,380
And so it actually creates
a beautiful marriage

904
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:47,060
between a fusion
power plant that

905
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:52,160
can be run with high
availability in combination

906
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:56,690
with a fuel production facility,
which also, you want to operate

907
00:46:56,690 --> 00:46:58,700
at a high availability.

908
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:00,740
And so that's a
beautiful marriage.

909
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:02,860
And the other
aspect is that many

910
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:06,220
of these facilities, whether
it be making hydrogen,

911
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:09,760
or low-carbon fuels,
or any other things

912
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:13,030
like that, you usually want
a combination of electricity

913
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:14,720
and process heat.

914
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:20,620
And so fusion can deliver
both of those to you.

915
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:23,050
Likewise, there are many
industrial processes

916
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:25,900
that we're trying to
decarbonize by removing

917
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:27,940
the use of fossil fuels in them.

918
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:32,650
Again, fusion can
play a role there.

919
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:35,390
The question asked
about desalinization.

920
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:37,550
It also works for
that application.

921
00:47:37,550 --> 00:47:41,060
Potentially, carbon
removal technologies.

922
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:45,910
Again, you can be running those
facilities 24/7 with the use

923
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:48,250
of fusion and not
having to worry about,

924
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:49,768
when is the sun shining?

925
00:47:49,768 --> 00:47:50,810
When is the wind blowing?

926
00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:52,850
So it's a beautiful marriage.

927
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:53,350
Yeah.

928
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:55,400
And in fact, there was
a follow-up question

929
00:47:55,400 --> 00:48:00,346
in this, which was, what
would be the impact,

930
00:48:00,346 --> 00:48:02,820
given fusion's
expected capital costs?

931
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:04,750
And this is one of the
outputs of the study,

932
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:08,560
that it showed the varying
penetration and impact

933
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:09,620
with pricing.

934
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:12,320
So our study did not do that.

935
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:15,200
And my own personal
hope is at some point,

936
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:20,980
we would expand, as we've done
in previous future of studies

937
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:23,080
run by the Energy
Initiative, where

938
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:25,990
we could take an even larger
look at something like fusion

939
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:28,310
for its impact in these areas.

940
00:48:28,310 --> 00:48:31,150
So anybody in the
audience who wants

941
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:33,200
to fund such a study,
please, come talk to us.

942
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,820
That would be fantastic.

943
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:39,140
There was several
questions, burning question

944
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:40,880
which was about the study.

945
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,720
And this probably
goes to Sergey.

946
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:47,200
What was the assumption
about carbon pricing?

947
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:51,030
What did we apply for the study.

948
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:54,070
Well, again, we
have different tools

949
00:48:54,070 --> 00:48:57,250
which we applied at the
different levels, global,

950
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:58,530
regional, US.

951
00:48:58,530 --> 00:49:02,550
So for the global
tool, the carbon price

952
00:49:02,550 --> 00:49:04,060
is the result of the model.

953
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:08,860
So in other words, we impose
the emission mitigation profiles

954
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:13,920
region by region globally,
and the carbon-- and the model

955
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,000
was providing carbon prices.

956
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,140
And the carbon prices obviously
depend on many assumptions

957
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:20,350
about different technologies.

958
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:23,400
But just to give you the
order of the magnitude, if we

959
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,720
are talking about the
advanced economies,

960
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:28,740
typically, by the
mid-century, we

961
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:32,670
are at the level of the
carbon pricing of about $700

962
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:34,000
per ton of CO2.

963
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,390
So that's what it
takes to decarbonize.

964
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:38,550
For emerging economies,
while the profiles

965
00:49:38,550 --> 00:49:41,530
are slightly different, and
also, the options are different.

966
00:49:41,530 --> 00:49:45,060
So for the emerging economies,
we are at about $500

967
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:46,530
per ton of CO2.

968
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:50,290
Just to get you oriented,
currently in the world,

969
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:52,850
we are not at those
level of the prices.

970
00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:57,010
And so there is the EU
emission trading scheme,

971
00:49:57,010 --> 00:50:00,920
where the prices at some point
were reaching almost 100,

972
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,830
but now, they are
back to the levels

973
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:07,810
of '60s, '70s or so, depending
on the time of the year.

974
00:50:07,810 --> 00:50:11,440
And the only two other
meaningful systems

975
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:13,730
which gives meaningful
carbon prices,

976
00:50:13,730 --> 00:50:17,000
I would say, in Canada,
and maybe in New Zealand.

977
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,580
While there are other
emission systems,

978
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:22,010
emission trading system
and carbon pricing schemes,

979
00:50:22,010 --> 00:50:25,640
but those have provided
much lower levels.

980
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:28,190
So in comparison
to where we are,

981
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:32,470
those are very substantial
increase in carbon prices.

982
00:50:32,470 --> 00:50:34,900
And not surprisingly so.

983
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:37,160
If you want to
decarbonize the system,

984
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:39,100
well, it means
that we would need

985
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:43,000
to do a very accelerated
action in order to incentivize

986
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,560
that decarbonization.

987
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:48,250
But to summarize this, in
some sense, there wasn't--

988
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:52,360
fusion itself wasn't gaining
a particular advantage

989
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:53,390
from carbon pricing.

990
00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:56,140
It was actually a
level playing field

991
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:59,120
about how you would achieve
those things as well, too.

992
00:50:59,120 --> 00:50:59,730
Yeah.

993
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:00,230
Exactly.

994
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:01,938
Any other comments to
the carbon pricing?

995
00:51:01,938 --> 00:51:05,040

996
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:05,540
OK.

997
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:09,577

998
00:51:09,577 --> 00:51:11,160
Let's see which one
we're going to go.

999
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:13,800
So here was a very
good question.

1000
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:16,010
How do we expect
these findings to have

1001
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:19,490
an impact on private and
public decision-making

1002
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:24,130
regarding R&D, supply
chain, and policy infusion?

1003
00:51:24,130 --> 00:51:26,780

1004
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:28,045
Anybody want to take that?

1005
00:51:28,045 --> 00:51:30,880

1006
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,110
Go ahead.

1007
00:51:32,110 --> 00:51:34,120
OK.

1008
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:36,130
Yeah.

1009
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:42,700
We've seen this large growth in
the private sector for fusion.

1010
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:46,960
Before, let's say, eight years
ago, most fusion activities

1011
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,790
was all government-driven.

1012
00:51:48,790 --> 00:51:53,890
In the past eight years, the
growth of the private fusion

1013
00:51:53,890 --> 00:51:56,620
sector has grown tremendously.

1014
00:51:56,620 --> 00:51:59,020
And there's been a lot of
investor funding coming

1015
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:00,850
into that.

1016
00:52:00,850 --> 00:52:02,660
Basically, in each
of those cases,

1017
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:05,360
those companies are working
to do risk mitigation.

1018
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:09,770
They're trying to address the
technical engineering aspects,

1019
00:52:09,770 --> 00:52:13,210
making sure they have the
different technologies they

1020
00:52:13,210 --> 00:52:15,610
need to build out their system.

1021
00:52:15,610 --> 00:52:21,400
So I think what this study
does is it helps people

1022
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:23,540
to continue to prioritize.

1023
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:26,530
And I guess one lesson, it
goes back to this question

1024
00:52:26,530 --> 00:52:29,050
that Sergey answered
about timing.

1025
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:34,080
Basically, regardless of
when fusion comes to market,

1026
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:35,250
we will need it.

1027
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:38,840
And so I guess my
guidance to the industry

1028
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:45,420
is, take all the right steps,
solve all the technical problems

1029
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:48,510
so that when you deploy
those first power plants,

1030
00:52:48,510 --> 00:52:52,670
you have a pathway to scale
it up and make it successful,

1031
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:59,630
as opposed to rushing through
and having to backtrack.

1032
00:52:59,630 --> 00:53:01,880
Dennis, I'm sure you have
some other thoughts to that.

1033
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:04,580
I do, actually, I
think, in particular,

1034
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:08,380
to the private sector.

1035
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:15,071
What I have been very
intrigued to see here is,

1036
00:53:15,071 --> 00:53:19,970
what is the economic return that
you make on what is essentially

1037
00:53:19,970 --> 00:53:23,090
an early stage investment
about addressing

1038
00:53:23,090 --> 00:53:27,980
particular technological
challenges in fusion?

1039
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:31,520
And because the technical
challenges vary a lot

1040
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:35,190
across the different concepts,
what this brings into play,

1041
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:36,060
in my opinion--

1042
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:39,710
and particularly, if I take
a look at Ruaridh's beautiful

1043
00:53:39,710 --> 00:53:43,010
plots of a particular-- if
you're considering deploying

1044
00:53:43,010 --> 00:53:45,900
a fusion power plant
in the New England ISO,

1045
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:47,940
what it shows you is
that, for example,

1046
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:49,980
for the cost point per watt--

1047
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:53,240
which is not just economic,
it's a technical set

1048
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:55,430
of decisions-- it
literally shows

1049
00:53:55,430 --> 00:53:58,910
you the economic return about
the change in the market

1050
00:53:58,910 --> 00:54:03,230
penetration for an investment
in making the technology reach

1051
00:54:03,230 --> 00:54:05,660
a particular point.

1052
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:09,110
That is extremely
necessary and worthwhile,

1053
00:54:09,110 --> 00:54:12,620
not just to fusion technologies,
but to the entire system

1054
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:16,470
that is investing in fusion
R&D around on those ones.

1055
00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:18,300
And that was just one
particular example.

1056
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:21,410
But I found that
particularly important.

1057
00:54:21,410 --> 00:54:26,750
In some sense, it sets
the goalposts for fusion.

1058
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:27,830
Let's see.

1059
00:54:27,830 --> 00:54:29,990
Just, Dennis, maybe
just to extend on that.

1060
00:54:29,990 --> 00:54:30,490
Please, go.

1061
00:54:30,490 --> 00:54:31,157
Please, Ruaridh.

1062
00:54:31,157 --> 00:54:33,620
We've seen, in the
fusion world, there's

1063
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:38,870
this push to reduce costs at any
price, or any cost, so to speak,

1064
00:54:38,870 --> 00:54:41,240
so sacrificing
technical capabilities

1065
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:43,050
in order to reduce
costs of your reactors.

1066
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:45,110
And I think fusion
plant designers now

1067
00:54:45,110 --> 00:54:46,190
have the same trade-offs.

1068
00:54:46,190 --> 00:54:49,200
And I think, as you said, these
models help set these goalposts,

1069
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:52,730
but also how those kind of
technical economic trade-offs

1070
00:54:52,730 --> 00:54:54,590
play out and whether
you can still--

1071
00:54:54,590 --> 00:54:57,080
whether it's worth to perhaps
use a slightly worse turbine

1072
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:59,000
because it's cheaper,
and do you care

1073
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,510
about the loss of efficiency.

1074
00:55:00,510 --> 00:55:03,510
But I think elsewhere
in the report,

1075
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:06,410
it shows we looked at these
20-year time series and there

1076
00:55:06,410 --> 00:55:09,230
was this big emphasis on being
available in the high-priced

1077
00:55:09,230 --> 00:55:09,960
hours.

1078
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:11,810
And so I think, as
an industry, it maybe

1079
00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:14,625
helps highlight that
fusion plants have

1080
00:55:14,625 --> 00:55:17,250
to make sure these markets are
designed properly so that people

1081
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:20,950
are compensated in a way that,
similar to storage today,

1082
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:25,320
you might not see those very
challenging high-priced hours

1083
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:27,660
for several years, and
then, on the fourth or fifth

1084
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:30,090
or sixth year, you're going
to earn an outsized share

1085
00:55:30,090 --> 00:55:31,050
of your revenue.

1086
00:55:31,050 --> 00:55:33,960
So making sure that it's
possible for businesses

1087
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:37,230
to operate like that,
where they're only useful--

1088
00:55:37,230 --> 00:55:39,370
they're somewhat
useful all the time,

1089
00:55:39,370 --> 00:55:44,050
but they're really essential
once a decade or twice a decade.

1090
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:45,315
Yep.

1091
00:55:45,315 --> 00:55:47,440
Another question that came
from the audience, which

1092
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,023
is a good one.

1093
00:55:48,023 --> 00:55:53,170
So flexible operation as
opposed to a base load

1094
00:55:53,170 --> 00:55:55,450
operation of fission
plants has been difficult.

1095
00:55:55,450 --> 00:55:58,346
Will fusion plants have the
same level of difficulty?

1096
00:55:58,346 --> 00:56:01,290

1097
00:56:01,290 --> 00:56:02,040
Anybody?

1098
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:02,640
Sara?

1099
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:03,200
Randy?

1100
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,655
I can also comment.

1101
00:56:04,655 --> 00:56:08,510

1102
00:56:08,510 --> 00:56:10,100
What is the question?

1103
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:12,590
Basically, what will
be the challenges

1104
00:56:12,590 --> 00:56:16,100
around fusion of delivering
variable power rather than just

1105
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:17,195
constant power levels?

1106
00:56:17,195 --> 00:56:20,810

1107
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:23,240
I can speak to that if it--

1108
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:24,650
I think it's not just--

1109
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:27,740
in fission, it
hasn't always really

1110
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:29,830
been a technical challenge.

1111
00:56:29,830 --> 00:56:35,630
There have been fission
reactors that operate flexibly.

1112
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:38,750
It is as much an
economic challenge

1113
00:56:38,750 --> 00:56:42,710
because you're investing a
significant amount of capital

1114
00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:45,740
in this physical
plant, and you want

1115
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:47,900
to earn money in as
many hours as you

1116
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:50,930
can to pay down that capital.

1117
00:56:50,930 --> 00:56:53,910
And so it's really an
economic challenge.

1118
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:56,780
But the markets are changing
with the penetration

1119
00:56:56,780 --> 00:57:01,220
of low-carbon electricity
renewable power.

1120
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:05,720
There is now a much
greater variability

1121
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:09,360
in the value of power
across different hours.

1122
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:12,780
And the systems are going
to have to learn to adapt.

1123
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:14,300
The electricity
markets are going

1124
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:18,260
to have to learn to adapt in
the way Ruaridh was describing

1125
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:21,560
to give incentives for
the owners of plants

1126
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:24,860
to operate them flexibly,
and also, to reward them

1127
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:29,450
enough money for the investment
of a plant that will be operated

1128
00:57:29,450 --> 00:57:30,560
flexibly.

1129
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:31,628
Yeah, great.

1130
00:57:31,628 --> 00:57:33,170
Sara, did you want
to comment quickly

1131
00:57:33,170 --> 00:57:35,870
to the technical
challenges there?

1132
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:37,050
Nothing specific.

1133
00:57:37,050 --> 00:57:39,140
Just I would say that, in
general, at this stage,

1134
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:42,980
we tend to assume that we
are designing to steady state

1135
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:44,070
operation.

1136
00:57:44,070 --> 00:57:46,130
So if we had to be
flexible, or you

1137
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:49,190
wanted to ramp the plant up
and down, it would just--

1138
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:53,480
it would require an
appropriately-directed research

1139
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:55,550
initiative to
understand how that

1140
00:57:55,550 --> 00:57:58,130
would affect the loading on
already sensitive materials

1141
00:57:58,130 --> 00:57:59,010
and components.

1142
00:57:59,010 --> 00:58:01,230
So it's certainly not to
say that it's impossible,

1143
00:58:01,230 --> 00:58:02,730
but there are
challenges, I think,

1144
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:05,720
associated with the
magnets and such

1145
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:09,080
that you wouldn't necessarily
want to shut the plant off

1146
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:10,170
and on in the same way.

1147
00:58:10,170 --> 00:58:12,950
So it would just
take directed effort

1148
00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:14,600
to understand how
to best be flexible.

1149
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:17,300
And I can just say, from
a physics point of view,

1150
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:19,890
fusion's physics actually
inherently allows

1151
00:58:19,890 --> 00:58:21,700
it to be quite
variable in its power,

1152
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:24,100
but that's probably
not the limit here.

1153
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:24,670
I agree.

1154
00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:27,330
It's probably the technical,
economic, and market limit,

1155
00:58:27,330 --> 00:58:28,700
actually, which comes from that.

1156
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:31,410
So, Kelly, I believe
we are approaching

1157
00:58:31,410 --> 00:58:33,912
the end of the timing of this.

1158
00:58:33,912 --> 00:58:35,370
There's a great
question, which is,

1159
00:58:35,370 --> 00:58:37,300
where is the report available?

1160
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:39,840
Randy?

1161
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:41,520
Yeah.

1162
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:47,910
So the report should be
available on your screen now.

1163
00:58:47,910 --> 00:58:49,660
It'll be posted
there in a moment,

1164
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:51,695
so you can grab a link to that.

1165
00:58:51,695 --> 00:58:54,470

1166
00:58:54,470 --> 00:58:55,225
Excellent.

1167
00:58:55,225 --> 00:58:57,960

1168
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:05,880
I also want to turn the
floor over to Bob Armstrong

1169
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:08,220
to close out our session.

1170
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:12,090
But as I mentioned a moment
ago, on our website, MIT Energy

1171
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:15,240
Initiative, you will be able
to find the report there.

1172
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:16,980
You should see the link to that.

1173
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:22,960
And with that, I'll turn
it over to Bob Armstrong.

1174
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:23,460
Great.

1175
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:24,870
Thank you very much, Randy.

1176
00:59:24,870 --> 00:59:29,480
So I have three points to make
as we're wrapping up here.

1177
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:33,680
First of all, want to
thank you for attending,

1178
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:35,300
all you in the audience online.

1179
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:39,350
And I want to thank Dennis,
and Randy, and the entire team

1180
00:59:39,350 --> 00:59:42,530
on this project for the really
interesting work they did

1181
00:59:42,530 --> 00:59:44,870
and for a great set
of presentations.

1182
00:59:44,870 --> 00:59:46,490
Thank you.

1183
00:59:46,490 --> 00:59:48,980
Second, wanted to
remind you very quickly

1184
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:53,750
of the key takeaways that
Randy discussed earlier.

1185
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:56,570
And those are here
on the screen.

1186
00:59:56,570 --> 01:00:00,080
Keep in mind the huge
potential there is for fusion

1187
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:01,610
to benefit society at large.

1188
01:00:01,610 --> 01:00:07,790
In the trillions of dollars, as
Sergey pointed out in his talk.

1189
01:00:07,790 --> 01:00:10,310
Deployment operation
of fusion plants

1190
01:00:10,310 --> 01:00:12,300
depends on a number
of key factors.

1191
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:13,410
Those are listed here.

1192
01:00:13,410 --> 01:00:20,010
Cost is foremost, but that
depends on other things as well,

1193
01:00:20,010 --> 01:00:24,720
including market design,
as we were just talking.

1194
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:27,030
Third, the ability
of fusion to scale

1195
01:00:27,030 --> 01:00:30,000
is going to require development
of the right materials

1196
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,380
and manufacturing capabilities
for those materials,

1197
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:36,000
for niche components.

1198
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,670
And then, lastly,
I want to point out

1199
01:00:38,670 --> 01:00:41,430
that for raw
materials, we don't see

1200
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:45,060
any showstoppers at this point.

1201
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:49,090
So the potential for
fusion is enormous,

1202
01:00:49,090 --> 01:00:54,120
and the future looks really,
really good for it, I think.

1203
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:56,280
And then, finally,
I wanted to invite

1204
01:00:56,280 --> 01:01:01,110
you to visit the MIT Energy
Initiative website so that you

1205
01:01:01,110 --> 01:01:03,720
can download the full report.

1206
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:07,680
The MIT Initiative
website is energy.mit.edu.

1207
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:10,410

1208
01:01:10,410 --> 01:01:12,300
Easy way to remember
and get there.

1209
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:15,670
And you'll be able to
find the full report.

1210
01:01:15,670 --> 01:01:17,280
So thank you all for attending.

1211
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:19,350
And thank the presenters.

1212
01:01:19,350 --> 01:01:21,780
