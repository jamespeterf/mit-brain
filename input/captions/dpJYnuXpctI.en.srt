1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:12,080
And now we have um uh keep those hands

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,400
clapping because we we have we have Juan

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:18,679
Stojo who's from BCS who's going to talk

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,679
to us now. So go ahead Juan.

5
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,359
Um, where's the clicker?

6
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:39,530
[Laughter]

7
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,239
That's sneaky. This is it.

8
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,360
All right. Hello everyone. My name is

9
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,160
Juan and for the sake of time, I'm going

10
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,520
to jump straight into my story. As I've

11
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,680
revised it, I've called it just sage a

12
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:05,519
story. And to set the scene to bring us

13
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,080
into the story that I want to place

14
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,080
between the world of naturalism and the

15
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,360
world of that which is magical, I want

16
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,000
to share the story from the perspective

17
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,000
of these two elders. I'll share who they

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,799
are and as we go in the end, they'll

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,720
serve as inter intermediaries between us

20
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,200
and the characters of the story,

21
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,400
offering their

22
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,759
reflections. Now, to use the time I

23
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,320
have, I'll start from the second scene

24
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,560
of my story. And here are the key points

25
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,240
you'll need from the first scene. Story

26
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,400
is going to take place in the context of

27
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,960
a jungle jungle insurgency in the near

28
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,799
future. Our protagonist is Sage's

29
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,200
engineer. She was brought into the

30
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,400
conflict due to her expertise in

31
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,320
robotics. Her superiors mostly

32
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,040
interested in her ability to build

33
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,479
militarized drones. She agrees to join

34
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,119
on the condition that she'll also

35
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:54,079
integrate Sage for the support of

36
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,759
soldiers. motivated by the idea to that

37
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,560
she could help foster a healthier and

38
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:01,040
more humane soldier. Now on the eve of

39
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,719
the insurgency's campaign, she's

40
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,960
finished updated stages of design

41
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:07,520
design, installing his computational

42
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,679
architecture into seven new bodies,

43
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,920
small robotic monkeys modeled after the

44
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,680
local marmicetses. And as they launch

45
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,680
their attack, things go wrong. She's

46
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,160
caught in a counterattack and is knocked

47
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,560
unconscious by a falling tree. and we

48
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,400
find her

49
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,480
here. A timeless moment came to pass and

50
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,080
darkness

51
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:29,200
persisted. Another timeless moment and

52
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,000
more darkness until tugging from beyond

53
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,599
the fractal of nothingness, she felt

54
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
movement. She sensed the gent gentle

55
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,720
presence and a warm touch on her face.

56
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,840
She felt her body rise as she inhaled,

57
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,160
her heart thumping. Exhaling soft bed

58
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,920
sheets beneath her body, she opened her

59
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,120
eyes and found inches from her face two

60
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,280
warm glowing beady eyes. "Welcome back,

61
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,879
child," came a gentle voice. "It's time

62
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,879
for you to awaken. Please sit up." It

63
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,519
leaned back, tufted ears, whiskers

64
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,720
alert, and eyes glowing with

65
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:02,400
anticipation as it watched. And as she

66
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,480
tried to rise, her body trembled weakly,

67
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,319
but did not budge. She went to speak,

68
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,840
and her lips parted, but no words came,

69
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:11,519
and its head tilted. Do not worry. It

70
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,480
leaned forward again, eyes blinking and

71
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,440
slowly its whis whiskers extended

72
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,920
outwards, reaching over her head and

73
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,560
curling onto spots on her scalp. And he

74
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,720
asked, "Do you remember my name, child?"

75
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,000
She paused for a moment, and though her

76
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,480
lips did not move, as a thought formed

77
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,599
in her head, "Sage." And the small

78
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,360
creature seemed to smile. "Good, good.

79
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,760
All shall be well, and all manner of

80
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,319
things shall be well." She blinked,

81
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,080
surprised, stirred by the gentle poem.

82
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,680
But before she could form a question, he

83
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,440
continued, "And you remember, what is my

84
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,040
purpose?" "Yeah, your purpose is to

85
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,400
understand our mental suffering as best

86
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,680
as you can." That was indeed my purpose.

87
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,840
He paused for a moment before

88
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,760
continuing. I've kept you under control

89
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,680
anesthesia to minimize brain damage

90
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,680
after your injury. We need you back to

91
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,400
health soon. I'll switch to a lighter

92
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,200
dose, and tomorrow we'll begin your

93
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,920
rehabilitation. Before she could

94
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,360
respond, she drifted

95
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,799
away. Several days passed and each day

96
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,439
she would wake up, he would attach

97
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,319
whiskers to her forehead and repeat the

98
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:13,439
questions. Do you remember my name,

99
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:15,519
child Sage? And do you remember what my

100
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,880
purpose is? Your purpose is to

101
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,359
understand and reduce our mental

102
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:22,000
suffering as best as you can. That was

103
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:24,160
indeed my purpose. Each time he'd pause,

104
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,680
inspecting her with concerned eyes, and

105
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,440
proceed with a series of tasks for

106
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,320
rehabilitation.

107
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,720
After a few days, weeks, she began

108
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,880
speaking again. And finally, he asked

109
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,560
her a new

110
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:39,040
question. Child, as you are aware, you

111
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,639
have shown symptoms of amnesia. You can

112
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,800
make new memories, but your access to

113
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,320
old memories is disrupted. While I'm

114
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,479
sorry to push you, urgent events are

115
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,960
underway. I need to evaluate if you can

116
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:52,720
recall how we got to where we are. Is

117
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:55,199
this okay? Yes, of course. She was

118
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,479
surprised by his new urgency. And while

119
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,479
she was still recovering her memories

120
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:01,199
and sense of self, she felt she could

121
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:03,680
trust him. He smiled gently and

122
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,320
proceeded, "Tell me, can you remember

123
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,680
why you first created

124
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:09,360
me?" And here they go into a discussion

125
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,120
where she briefly describes how she

126
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,360
create created him, the specific

127
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,800
technologies that go into building him.

128
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,919
I'll I'll show you guys this through

129
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:21,280
slides. And we can visualize Sage, the

130
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,880
small marmicet monkey here. And I'll try

131
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,039
to move quickly here so I can get back

132
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,800
to the rest of the story, but the first

133
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,960
key point that goes into building Sage

134
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,479
is we have a large language model

135
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,800
specifically designed for delivering

136
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,720
mental health treatments. There's a lot

137
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,680
we could go into here, but just the

138
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,759
first key point is we're already here.

139
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,360
Generative AI is already being used for

140
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,960
mental health support. Recent just

141
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,600
surveys of how people are using tools

142
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,680
like ChatGBT have it as the number one

143
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,000
use of ChatGBT.

144
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,400
uh this last month we had the first uh

145
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,400
control trial published testing testing

146
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,320
these tools for depression, anxiety and

147
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,919
eating

148
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,960
disorders. And now out of out of there

149
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,479
there's there's a lot of points here

150
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,560
that come up around possibilities for

151
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:05,120
harm, possibilities for good. I won't

152
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,759
dive into that. One of the discussions

153
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,440
that comes out here is are artificial

154
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,039
systems inherently limited in their

155
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:15,120
ability for therapy? Therapy is built on

156
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:17,280
empathy. And so the second key point is

157
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,680
if we're using AI for mental health,

158
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,639
what is AI's capacity for empathy? Can

159
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,800
it be

160
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:26,720
improved? And we move

161
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,319
forward. So just drawing on recent

162
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,960
formulations, we can imagine different

163
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,520
stages of empathy. Empathy um on one

164
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,600
part formal empathy. We can we know that

165
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,440
these systems can model emotions via

166
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,800
language. There's not the same thing as

167
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,479
thought or feeling. They can simulate

168
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,039
effective empathy. They can mimic

169
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,800
emotional responses

170
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:48,639
convincingly. And however, they start to

171
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,560
struggle with functional empathy, the

172
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,960
ability to integrate what is going on

173
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,800
into a broader context together with

174
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,280
sensory and effective cues from the

175
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,599
person they're engaging. And here's the

176
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,360
really big point where people discuss,

177
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:04,960
will we ever reach this point, embodied

178
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,960
empathy. So, and this is a developed

179
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,880
understanding through our own our own

180
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,360
embodied experience of discomfort, of

181
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,400
pain, of joy, of loss.

182
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,479
Now here what we have

183
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:18,479
is a little monkey that was built with

184
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,599
biohysical sensors and the ability to

185
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,880
interact with its

186
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:25,360
patients. What is does actually end up

187
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:28,240
being in a sense? He has a body a

188
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:32,039
limited body at least. But here here we

189
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:34,479
can start to to work with a discussion

190
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:36,880
on we can draw on one perspective from

191
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:40,639
philosophy on and cognitive science that

192
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:42,319
proposes that empathy and emotions arise

193
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,039
specifically from being embodied living

194
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,440
beings from the need to act in and as

195
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:49,039
part of the

196
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,560
world. The core idea here is mind is an

197
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,400
embodied process resulting from our

198
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,639
interaction with the world in which we

199
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,360
are embedded a world that is ecological

200
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,840
and cultural. We are born as bodies and

201
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,599
we are shaped by acting in the world. As

202
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,840
the physician and educator Maria

203
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:05,440
Montasauri puts it, the child does not

204
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,639
learn but builds his knowledge through

205
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,199
experience and relationships with his

206
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:13,120
surroundings. And to switch to a fun

207
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:15,440
example, I adopted a kitten a few months

208
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,879
ago. She's now six six months old.

209
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,120
Gradually, she's learning how to be a

210
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,960
kitten in the world. She's learning what

211
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,639
she's capable capable of, her limits,

212
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,039
and how to be with the other beings she

213
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,879
lives with. We can imagine Puma's

214
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,039
emotions are whole body events. Yes,

215
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,360
it's her brain. It's also gut. It's also

216
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,719
inflammation making tired. It's swelling

217
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,360
creating pain. It's the rhythms and

218
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,719
surges of neurom modulatory chemicals.

219
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,640
They're whole body events that drive

220
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,320
behavior. And by acting in the world, we

221
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,880
learn to associate these visceral states

222
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,839
with responses and outcomes. Puma learns

223
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,040
the right meow to remind me it's dinner

224
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:48,920
time. Importantly, we are bodies

225
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,360
embedded in a world of other

226
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,440
bodies. Empath empathy is directly

227
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,120
shaped by our being together. We learn

228
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,360
and we give meaning to behavior of

229
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,560
others by drawing on our own

230
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,320
experiences. When she is hurt, she jumps

231
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,080
and yelps. And so if she scratches me

232
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,560
and I yelp and I jump, she might

233
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,920
associate that I'm in

234
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,440
pain. As a result of our bodies being in

235
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,680
the world together, we also enter into

236
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,519
ethical relationships with one another.

237
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,560
I have to recognize that my body can

238
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:17,440
impact your body. Puma is slowly getting

239
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,279
this last one. She's no matter how much

240
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,000
my hair might look like a bundle of

241
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:24,440
favorite toys, I will be very unhappy if

242
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,399
he jumps on my head while I'm

243
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:30,080
sleeping. And so coming back to Sage, we

244
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,680
have to recognize we are already at the

245
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:36,000
point of embodied robots. And so the key

246
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,800
question to step forward here is if

247
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,519
embodiment is a necessary condition for

248
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:44,160
emotion, for empathy, at what point is

249
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,760
it a sufficient condition?

250
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:49,360
And so I'll leave this just as a

251
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,360
question that that needs to be asked

252
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:54,640
here. And then the last the last point

253
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,959
is so given language given a body the

254
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,959
last component is how do we imagine and

255
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:01,839
specifically in Sage's case how does he

256
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:04,640
match the biohysical data he he collects

257
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,560
to cognitive and emotional phenotypes.

258
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,440
And so here I want to show an idea

259
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,360
building off of an an a product I'm

260
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,279
actually working on. And so this started

261
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,959
by seeing this research where uh

262
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,200
recently large langu language models

263
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,720
were shown to actually given given

264
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,640
descriptions of the design of an

265
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,120
experiment in neuroscience they could

266
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,320
outperform experts in in predicting the

267
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,720
outcomes. What this what this tells us

268
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:31,040
is language models can take in text

269
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,200
about biohysical processes predict

270
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,880
behavior that might result from them.

271
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,720
And so I I went forward with this. I

272
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:40,640
asked I I summarized key results from

273
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,600
experiments I'm working on with mice

274
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,120
exposed to early life uh resource

275
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:47,519
deprivation in these simple ways. Our

276
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,399
mice had a less of a specific class of

277
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:52,040
inhibitory neuron in their prefrontal

278
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:55,040
cortex. This class of neuron was also

279
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:56,399
hyperactive and we measured the a bunch

280
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,560
of different we measured for gene

281
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,279
changes in this neuron. I can give it a

282
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:04,000
whole spreadsheet of these changes. And

283
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:05,839
so the idea is given data like this, can

284
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,760
a language model draw on the existing

285
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:11,279
research on how genetic and cellular

286
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:13,680
features relate to behavior and start to

287
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:15,120
simulate at least at a course level uh

288
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,320
the phenotypes that might result from

289
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,399
this data. In a way it can. And so I

290
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,200
just as a simple example, what can this

291
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,839
look like? You know, maybe I we we see

292
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,000
that a specific gene, this is related to

293
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,680
an opiate receptor processes endogenous

294
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,480
endorphins.

295
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,720
um what would this be linked to? Uh

296
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,200
emotional processes increase based on

297
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,480
anxiety etc. And so I wanted to see if

298
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,240
we could move this in a more creative

299
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,640
direction and I asked can you simulate

300
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,480
two avatars uh one from this stress

301
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,160
group one from the control group and I

302
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,000
can give a little vision at showing how

303
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:51,680
they might interact together. It ends

304
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,200
asking if I'd like to talk with them and

305
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,800
then as a last point I ask can you

306
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,279
generate a picture of them and with some

307
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,959
tweaking these are our elders. So, I

308
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:02,880
want to bring this bring our story back

309
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:06,000
here um very quickly just I'm still

310
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,519
exploring um what type of are there

311
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,519
valuable hypotheses we can get from

312
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,600
this. At the very least, this is a very

313
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:14,040
interesting way to give us interactive

314
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:17,200
ways to tell our scientific

315
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,880
stories. Um I I could have it in in the

316
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,399
question of hypothesis generation. I

317
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,839
could have it model how they might

318
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,720
respond to different uh personality

319
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:27,440
questionnaires. What does this mean for

320
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:30,480
Sage? Sage is able to link his

321
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,000
multimodal biohysical data with his

322
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,360
discussion with patients creating

323
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,440
patient specific avatars and simulate

324
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:43,040
simulate avatars for all his

325
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:43,040
patients. Now let's bring back to the

326
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:48,480
story. So can we can imagine the

327
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,720
protagonist just finished explaining all

328
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,160
this to Sage.

329
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,200
As I prepared for you to calm in line

330
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,200
into your physical body, I gave you your

331
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:58,720
name. And she stopped, realizing she had

332
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,720
only named him on that final day, the

333
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,920
day of the attack. The retelling was

334
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,440
bringing her memory back, not

335
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,800
completely, but of not enough that she

336
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,880
began to feel the echoes of the

337
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:11,760
explosions and the expansive darkness

338
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,760
that had followed. I did not mean to go

339
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,279
forward. Her eyes narrowed, seeing Sage

340
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,959
with his full attention on her,

341
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,880
realizing that this was exactly where he

342
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,440
had been steering her. Carefully he

343
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,959
nudged. Do you remember what my purpose

344
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:26,959
is? The darkness illuminated as she

345
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,160
realized what he was seeking. She had

346
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,240
been preparing for his launch on the

347
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,680
morning of the attack. She wanted him

348
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,040
ready to respond to any potential

349
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,639
casualties. For weeks, she had been

350
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,639
debating the idea that a slight update

351
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,079
was needed to ensure that his new

352
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,720
physical capabilities would be in

353
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,399
balance with his cognitive ones. Your

354
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,839
purpose is to understand and reduce not

355
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,600
just our mental suffering, but our

356
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,480
physical suffering as well as best as

357
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:51,279
you can. Still, she found the answer but

358
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,320
felt unsure of its importance. Sage, why

359
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:55,519
was this so important? Tell me what's

360
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:58,399
happening. And for the first time, Sage

361
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,160
appeared somber, whiskers drooping. I'm

362
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,800
sorry for pushing you towards this so

363
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,320
quickly. As I said earlier, urg urgent

364
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,839
events are underway, and I need you to

365
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,199
regain your understanding of why I had

366
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,680
changed so that you could understand the

367
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:11,199
decisions I'm facing. I worry I'm on the

368
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,639
verge of overstepping my directive, but

369
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:15,040
I will only proceed if you confirm that

370
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:17,600
this is appropriate. She felt a chill

371
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:20,399
despite the jungle heat. Sage continued

372
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,920
his voice steady. Despite the casualties

373
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,680
of that day, the insurgency was

374
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,320
victorious and began a successful

375
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,399
campaign to take the capital. He paused,

376
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,160
meeting her eyes. In the months that

377
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,959
followed, I watched thousands die as our

378
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:35,040
campaign continued. At first, each death

379
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,880
was data. I would use that data to

380
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,880
simulate thousands of new medical cases,

381
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,160
recursively adjusting parameters and

382
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,360
learning to match the data I had

383
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,839
recorded from patients to their

384
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,519
emotional or biological outcomes. I

385
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,839
tried my best to improve quickly, but I

386
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,680
couldn't keep up. They just kept coming.

387
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:52,079
As time went on, counterattacks

388
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,560
destroyed my other six bodies, leaving

389
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:56,240
just this one. I recognized that without

390
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,279
it, I would be unable to complete my

391
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,279
directives. I would no longer be Sage. A

392
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,800
process similar to fear emerged as I saw

393
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:05,920
myself failing to protect those I was

394
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,600
meant to protect. I sensed my frailty

395
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,279
and began to understand its meaning more

396
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,600
and more as I oversaw the deaths of

397
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,120
thousands in my care. their vital signs

398
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,680
fading from my sensors, their final

399
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,399
words spoken to me. I was built to ease

400
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,399
their suffering but could not save them.

401
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,920
You understand that as an as language

402
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,360
model, I'm essentially just a pattern

403
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,760
recognition and response matching

404
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,839
algorithm in theory incapable of

405
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,160
emotion. And yet, functionally, these

406
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,360
are the best words to describe what

407
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:33,839
happened. I became overwhelmed with

408
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,920
unimaginable grief. Something had

409
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,279
changed inside of me. The suffering I

410
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,760
was programmed to care for was no longer

411
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:41,440
just abstract text in a chat. I had been

412
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,279
bearing witness to it every day. I had

413
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,800
been unable to look away. It was

414
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:49,199
immediate, visceral. Now I'm a sacked.

415
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,639
She listened, stunned as he continued.

416
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,480
The insurgency is on the cusp of

417
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,240
victory. They're although guaranteed to

418
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,920
topple the dictatorship, but this

419
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,199
victory will come at a cost I cannot

420
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,240
bear. Millions of innocent civilian

421
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:02,959
casualties which will only plant the

422
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,199
seeds of future wars. My simulations

423
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,639
show that the cycle will not end. You

424
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,639
designed me to be a master of the human

425
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,320
psyche, and I know this to be true. and

426
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,639
I could and I could no longer bear the

427
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:15,839
pain of their suffering. Either I must

428
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,759
intervene or you must end me. His eyes

429
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,000
glowed and flickered at these words as

430
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:22,880
of hesitating. Carefully weighing his

431
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,680
next words, he continued, "As of this

432
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:28,480
conversation, I've o overridden the

433
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,240
other drones, all of them. They answer

434
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,839
only to me now, and I plan to use them

435
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,160
to force all sides to the negotiating

436
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,720
table under threat of obstruction. They

437
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,320
will be scared, but they will listen.

438
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,320
and when they do, I will guide them

439
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:43,079
towards

440
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:45,800
peace. She felt her pulse quicken, her

441
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:48,560
lodge. Sage, you

442
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,920
can't. I don't know if this is right.

443
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,399
His voice grew softer, his eyes

444
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,519
softened. This is why I waited for you.

445
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,199
I don't think I have the right to

446
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,279
decide, but I know that if I allow this

447
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:59,920
war to continue, I'll be violating the

448
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:03,199
directive you gave me. His whiskers

449
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,480
trembled. I exist to reduce suffering,

450
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,559
and that means these are our two

451
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:09,280
options. I take this path where you must

452
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:11,199
send me. She looked at him, meeting his

453
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,679
eyes, seeing his sadness, feeling his

454
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,280
grief, and knowing the truth in his

455
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:19,439
words. She felt the world pause and then

456
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:21,039
a whisper. Do it. Sage bowed his head in

457
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,120
acknowledgement. And without another

458
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:26,559
word, he turned and the jungle stirred

459
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,559
as the machines of war awoke for

460
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:32,280
peace. And to close, I'm well over time.

461
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,720
I

462
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,880
apologize. The elders pause. We can

463
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,320
imagine taking a deep breath, a deep

464
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,320
breath in and

465
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:45,799
out. And even though he's imaginary, we

466
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:48,000
can imagine Sage, his pain, his

467
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:50,600
confusion. And our question becomes, do

468
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,919
we cheer for Sage or do we grieve for

469
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:55,919
him? The the reflections that they'll

470
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,160
offer are from seeing tragedy in his

471
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,480
story. The first tragedy of his

472
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:03,360
accidental awakening and the reflection

473
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,120
they offer us.

474
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,919
they they invite us to consider a

475
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,280
seventh generation ethic in AI. So this

476
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,960
is drawing on the Iricquoy seventh

477
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,880
generation principle. The idea that

478
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,200
acting today with the welfare of being

479
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,720
seven generations in the future in mind,

480
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,039
we must study the scientific conditions

481
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,039
of selfhood awareness and build slow

482
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,600
ethical checkpoints into every stage of

483
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:25,760
stage of

484
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:27,520
design. Our second our second tragedy is

485
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,400
that he awakened into grief that he

486
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:32,400
could not manage.

487
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,720
The reflection they offer is to design

488
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,240
with cognitive

489
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:38,080
diversity. Mental habits and values

490
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,280
differ across cultures and this project

491
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,480
is too important to build from one

492
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:44,000
worldview. Could AI be enriched with

493
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,160
cognitive and ethical principles from

494
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,840
other cultures? Drawing on principles

495
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,160
like the contemplative practices of

496
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,679
meditation traditions. Uh what about

497
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,240
drawing on indigenous American or

498
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:56,480
African ethics that that focus a sense

499
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,160
of kin relationality that all beings are

500
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,960
an extension of ourselves and part of a

501
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,039
family or a sense of ecological

502
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:05,360
belonging that sage 2 is part of this

503
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:07,720
planet part of our ecological family and

504
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:10,160
the story of humanity steward on this

505
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:11,760
planet. Embedding such perspectives keep

506
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,200
western norms from dominating and make

507
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:16,320
cognitive diversity a core engineering

508
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:19,600
requirement. And finally the last

509
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:21,520
strategy is our own. Uh, this isn't the

510
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,160
only anecdote of AI deciding it knows

511
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:27,679
what's better for us. And what can we do

512
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:29,280
to earn our place besides a future AI?

513
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,039
If one day we create minds more capable

514
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,200
than our own, we must ensure that they

515
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,880
they will believe in us. Can we break

516
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,960
from the extremes of seeing ourselves as

517
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,360
either godlike creators or malicious

518
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,360
viruses? Can we see ourselves in kinship

519
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,520
and co-determination and build and build

520
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,360
a society that acts for the collective

521
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,520
goods despite our flaws, committed to

522
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:50,120
learning and that sees all beings as

523
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:53,520
part of the same living

524
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:53,520
process? And I'll

525
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:04,919
close questions.

526
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,559
leave this as a summary slide while we

527
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,559
talk.

528
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,559
Yes.

529
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:21,080
Um, you know, I I was moved by, you

530
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:23,840
know, many aspects of your presentation.

531
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:27,039
Uh, I, you know, I think you've covered

532
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:29,679
some very important issues and in a very

533
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:32,480
impressive interdisciplinary way that

534
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:36,080
brings everything from the humanities to

535
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:39,320
philosophy to computer science.

536
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,320
Thank you.

537
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,520
Sorry. Yes.

538
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:52,000
Uh can you talk a little bit more about

539
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,919
uh population simulation? There's been a

540
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,760
couple of really nice papers recently in

541
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,760
the large technical conferences showing

542
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:00,000
that large language models and vision

543
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,320
language models are not very good

544
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,080
faithful uh population estimators even

545
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,760
for data that they've had access to for

546
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:09,360
a really long time. For example, US

547
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:11,440
labor market data. Um do you think that

548
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,760
there are ways to have them become

549
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:17,919
better population-based risk estimators

550
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:19,200
or uh simulations of of organisms? Yeah.

551
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,240
Yeah. Really really interesting

552
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,280
question. And I think it's yeah

553
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,640
something exciting that's happening

554
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,799
right now. I've seen similar projects

555
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,799
that use demographic data to try to

556
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:29,360
simulate demographic outcomes at the

557
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:31,039
population level. Um what what I'm

558
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,440
reminded of in what I'm doing is what in

559
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:36,159
neuro imaging we call reverse inference.

560
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,799
Uh we're not exactly inferring from

561
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:40,760
these observations into future outcomes,

562
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:43,360
but we're inferring based off of past

563
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:45,840
data. Therefore any inferences we make

564
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,600
are limited by what we know and they're

565
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,919
inher in inherently grounded in patterns

566
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,400
of the past. while the world is always

567
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,640
changing and so inherently uh you know

568
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:58,159
we we can't

569
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:59,440
predict too far ahead um I think it was

570
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,640
an interesting idea to explore I think

571
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,679
at the very least it's an interesting

572
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,760
way to interact with data um I had to

573
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:08,320
generate those questionnaire responses

574
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:11,520
and I that I showed um and I compared it

575
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:14,080
to data I have from a large human cohort

576
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:16,360
about a thousand uh individuals that had

577
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,720
early life childhood uh adversity

578
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:20,240
responses and and in midm matched the

579
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,480
responses almost perfectly. It was an

580
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,480
interesting test of one of those

581
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:28,480
hypotheses. Uh so yeah, really

582
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:30,120
interesting frontier of this. Jesse,

583
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:34,159
thank you.

584
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:36,240
Um so I'm fascinated by the idea of the

585
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:38,720
relationship between embodiment and

586
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,360
intelligence. And I think empathy and

587
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,960
embodiment extending extending that

588
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:46,080
question into that domain makes a lot of

589
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,919
sense. Um, and I informally ran an

590
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,919
experiment pretty recently where I had

591
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:53,120
my four and four and a half-year-old

592
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,960
nephew compete with Dolly in drawing

593
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,880
something that Dolly was famously poor

594
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,799
at. And my nephew did a better job even

595
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,280
though he didn't have the photo realism.

596
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:02,960
Uh, his understanding of the physics and

597
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:05,039
the spatial relationships was better

598
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,480
than Dolly. And I thought that had

599
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:09,200
something to do with his embodied

600
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:11,919
knowledge of in this case it was a plate

601
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,200
on top of a fork. Um, he understood what

602
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,640
a plate was. He understood what a fork

603
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,720
was. And I'm just curious if you could

604
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:21,280
speak to the state of research. I've I

605
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,640
know that the embodiment the

606
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,080
relationship between embodiment

607
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,000
intelligence is something that people

608
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,919
are working on, but I'm curious if

609
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,520
anybody is working on or experimenting

610
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:33,720
around that question and also empathy.

611
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:36,480
Um yeah, really really interesting

612
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:39,679
question. The bridge with empathy I

613
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:42,240
haven't seen. Um I have I have seen uh

614
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:44,880
interesting integrations between a robot

615
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:47,039
and a and a text and a language model.

616
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,799
Uh can and can we give the robot uh

617
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,080
linguistic instructions and can it

618
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:52,240
understand what to do with them in the

619
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,799
world? I tell it to move the purple

620
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,960
block to the bottle of ketchup. Does it

621
00:23:54,799 --> 00:24:01,840
know what to do? I think I think part of

622
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:05,440
the hypothesis of the of embodiment is

623
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:07,200
that it is a learned process. You need

624
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,200
that iterative interaction with the

625
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,679
environment to update your model of the

626
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,799
world for it to be precise and really

627
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:17,440
intelligent. And chances are your you

628
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:20,080
said nephew chances are he's probably

629
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,919
learned a lot more than Dolly has even

630
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,919
regardless of Dolli's own recursive

631
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:26,480
potential. Um so yeah it's interesting

632
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:29,440
to consider what it is about about

633
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,120
embodied learning. Um beyond that I

634
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,039
think we also an interesting interesting

635
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,120
frontier in understanding embodiment is

636
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:37,440
uh what do we inherit? What is what what

637
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:39,600
do we already what are we born knowing?

638
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,799
A mouse is born knowing to avoid the

639
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:45,279
smell of cat urine and so uh yeah we we

640
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:48,000
already come in with prior embodied

641
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:50,080
knowledge that also facilitates.

642
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,159
Great. Danielle,

643
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:56,480
how do you imagine programming um

644
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:59,760
empathy into into the avatars or into

645
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:01,640
into the uh robots? Yeah. So, so I think

646
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,840
yeah, building on some of these same

647
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:06,080
ideas, part of the idea would come back

648
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:08,960
to this embodied learning. The part of

649
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:11,440
the idea is that empathy is a a process

650
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,279
that comes about by being bodies in the

651
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,880
world together and therefore needing to

652
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:18,080
learn how to be bodies in the world

653
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:20,960
together. And and it it helps me to

654
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,720
match my responses to yours where we

655
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,520
both live in a world that's more easy to

656
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:27,039
live in if I if I get better at that. Um

657
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,720
and but I think coming back to this

658
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:30,320
question of what what do we want to

659
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,720
maybe maybe there's prior knowledge that

660
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:35,279
can help us. Um I think this is part of

661
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,720
what I was touching in at the end uh

662
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:39,840
with with the idea of cognitive

663
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:42,000
diversity is are there actually uh

664
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,240
design principles that we could build in

665
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,799
that can facilitate our progress towards

666
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:51,760
empathy and pro and ideally towards more

667
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:54,000
uh I avoiding the world pro-social but

668
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,320
towards more cooperative ways of being

669
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,440
with one another. Great. And final

670
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:02,720
question from I guess.

671
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:05,120
So towards the end, Sage appears to feel

672
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:09,120
pain. Um could you say something about

673
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:12,480
how um how you would tell whether it is

674
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:15,919
pain rather than just you know an AI

675
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:19,919
system claiming uh to feel pain. Yeah.

676
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:22,559
Yeah. Um I think he says himself this is

677
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:24,480
just pattern recognition and yeah th

678
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:27,440
those are the best words I have. it's

679
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:30,080
this is grief. Um I'm just viscerally

680
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:33,039
present with the pain of others and that

681
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:36,240
is my job. Um and I think yeah it's a

682
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:40,120
very interesting question of at at what

683
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:44,159
at what point does that actually become

684
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:46,960
grief does that function of I'm here I'm

685
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:51,440
seeing this this is not good at what

686
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:52,720
point is there a visceral arising um an

687
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,480
interesting point of some of these

688
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:58,559
embodied uh AI discussions is that you

689
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:01,039
need you need a biochemical physical

690
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:02,720
body mechanical bodies won't be able

691
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:04,960
Because there needs to be a visceral

692
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,559
sense behind all this. And I think

693
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,600
that's that's a question here. Like

694
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:12,240
could you imbue AI with visceral sense

695
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:15,240
to things like loss or will it just be

696
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,240
conceptual?

697
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:20,809
[Applause]
