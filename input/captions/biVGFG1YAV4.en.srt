1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:06,080
So the question was, should I, Sarah

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:09,200
Hansen, use chat GPT right now to plan

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,400
my retirement? Not yet. Okay, please

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,880
explain.

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,839
>> Large language models are not yet ready

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,920
to be able to do delegated financial

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,480
decision-m for us. Turns out that saving

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,640
for retirement is one set of activities,

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,680
but then spending while in retirement,

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,279
that's a whole different set of

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,519
activities. But the more challenging

12
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,039
issue is how do we communicate that to

13
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,720
people who don't have any finance

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,200
background and and moreover can't afford

15
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,040
to hire the financial adviserss that

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,760
some of the higher net worth individuals

17
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:41,520
have access to. So we're working on an

18
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:44,160
AI solution uh an AI financial adviser

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,719
that can satisfy the most important

20
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,239
criterion of financial advice that

21
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,840
regulators impose which is something

22
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,760
called fiduciary duty.
