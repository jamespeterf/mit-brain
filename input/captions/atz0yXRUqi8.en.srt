1
00:00:00,919 --> 00:00:05,640
so now let's discuss the link between

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:07,680
ulcerative colitis and cancer so

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,400
unfortunately ulcerative colitis

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,200
patients have an increased risk for

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:15,599
coloral cancer it can be up to twofold

6
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:18,240
higher so to remind you all cancer is a

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,480
disease where healthy cells transform

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,600
start to grow uncontrollably and spread

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,160
throughout the body so on the left here

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,760
we see normal tissue and on the right we

11
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:29,439
see the cancer cells where there's this

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:32,000
uncontrolled growth and cancer is

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:34,280
triggered by by genetic changes changes

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,600
to the DNA inside the nucleus of your

15
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:39,960
cells and in ulcerative colitis there's

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,600
as I said before chronic inflammation

17
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,280
which results in the epithelial cells

18
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,719
constantly being destroyed and

19
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,239
regenerated and during these Cycles

20
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,640
there's damage to the DNA and this can

21
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:54,039
trigger the cancer that occurs in the

22
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:56,239
colon so for patients with ulcerative

23
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:59,079
colitis it's important that they undergo

24
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:01,280
screenings for cancer so we know that

25
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:03,760
early detection of cancer leads to

26
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,200
better patient outcomes so here we're

27
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,400
looking at statistics from the UK for

28
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:11,240
three different types of cancer lung

29
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,479
breast and coloral and we're seeing that

30
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:16,159
when cancer is caught at the earlier

31
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:19,479
stage uh there's much better chance of

32
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,680
survival over 5 years underscoring why

33
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:24,720
we need to really try to capture cancer

34
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,759
early now when a pathologist is looking

35
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,960
at an ulcerative kidus tissue section

36
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:32,119
that's been stained with h& e they are

37
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,920
looking for signs of displasia and

38
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:38,000
displasia is an abnormal growth of cells

39
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,240
in your colon that may become cancer so

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,759
it's something that needs to be looked

41
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:45,880
at so on the left here is a colonoscopy

42
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,000
and the gastrologist and the

43
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:50,399
Pathologists have noted that there's a

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,280
region here of displasia and this is

45
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,360
still pretty hard to see just with you

46
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:57,920
know a camera so what happens is uh they

47
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,600
take a biopsy from this section and a

48
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,320
pathologist then stains it with h& and

49
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,920
examines the tissue more closely and in

50
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:08,119
this darker region of the colon tissue

51
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,520
you can start to see what a pathologist

52
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:12,959
would consider

53
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:15,400
dysplasia so dysplasia occurs across a

54
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,840
Continuum in the kind of cancer

55
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,319
landscape so here we have a cartoon of

56
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,000
cancer development where on the left we

57
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:25,239
have normal colon mucosa and then you

58
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,560
start to see that the mucosa starts to

59
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:28,760
change and the structures are really

60
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,160
changing and you go from low grade

61
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:33,400
dysplasia to high- grade dysplasia which

62
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,280
is more of a risk for cancer and then

63
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,120
finally you have carcinoma which in this

64
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,080
case would be real colar rectal cancer

65
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,280
so now let's look at what those tissue

66
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,560
histology images would look like from

67
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,879
the displasia so on the left we have an

68
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,200
h& image of low grade displasia and on

69
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,560
the right an h& image of high-grade

70
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,440
displasia and one thing a pathologist

71
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,440
would note for the low grade displasia

72
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,319
is you have these hyper chromatic nuclei

73
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:00,920
so this is a mouthful but what this

74
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:03,480
means is the nuclei are darker than

75
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:05,840
normal so remember the h& stain stains

76
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,920
the nuclei of the cells this purple blue

77
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,280
and now these are showing up even darker

78
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,120
and this is often a sign of accumulating

79
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:16,040
DNA in the nucleus which typically uh is

80
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,840
associated with cancerous cells in the

81
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,280
high-grade displasia the pathologist has

82
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,200
noted this loss of nuclear polarity so

83
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,080
when you look at the nuclei they're kind

84
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,560
of scattered a little bit all over the

85
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,959
place so normally the nuclei of the cell

86
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,000
is in a specific region of the cell and

87
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,959
during cancer you start to lose this

88
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,879
regulation of where the nucleus is in

89
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,959
the cell so that's the loss of nuclear

90
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:40,680
polarity that a pathologist would note

91
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:42,599
in this tissue section so you know what

92
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,280
have we learned so far well you've seen

93
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:47,080
a lot of tissue pathology images and you

94
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,120
probably can see that they're incredibly

95
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,040
powerful I mean you haven't seen enough

96
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,760
to probably become a board certified

97
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,480
pathologist but you hopefully kind of

98
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,920
realize that you know these images are

99
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:00,079
really helpful for diagnosing ulcerative

100
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,360
colitis figuring out what treatment to

101
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:04,519
use and also detecting cancer early

102
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:06,040
which is super important the other thing

103
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:08,599
I want to point out about these tissue

104
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:10,680
pathology images these h& images is that

105
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:13,040
they are very cheap to collect this is

106
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,799
routine care and millions of these

107
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,359
images exist in hospitals so this is a

108
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:20,000
in a sense a really amazing data set for

109
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:22,199
machine learning because it's images and

110
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,600
you have many many of them and often

111
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:26,280
they are

112
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,360
annotated so at the same time the tissue

113
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:31,000
pathology images don't tell us

114
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,960
everything uh they don't don't tell us

115
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
how ulcerative colitis arises it just

116
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,199
tells us there is ulcerative colitis so

117
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,720
it doesn't tell us anything about the

118
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:42,000
disease mechanism it doesn't tell us you

119
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,320
know how a cancer could arise and you

120
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,960
know there's a lot of interest in

121
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,479
understanding disease mechanism because

122
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,520
once we understand how a disease arises

123
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,759
we have Pathways that we can start to

124
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:55,360
Target with drugs that we could develop

125
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:56,720
and these are really active areas of

126
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,800
clinical research so if you go to

127
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,880
clinical trials.gov you'll see that

128
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,280
there's 3 active studies right now for

129
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,479
ulcerative colitis and about 2,000

130
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,320
active studies for colar rectal

131
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:10,919
cancer so there's a lot of opportunity

132
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,360
in this challenge to work with these

133
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:15,080
tissue pathology images but ask what

134
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,320
more can we learn from them than what a

135
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:20,120
pathologist already learned and then

136
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:22,720
also using these images could we get

137
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:26,600
even better at detecting cancer earlier

138
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:29,960
and impacting uh patients with ultra of

139
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:31,520
citis so at this point I've given you an

140
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,440
introduction to the biology of

141
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:37,080
autoimmune disease in particular ulcer

142
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:39,000
of colitis and we've learned how uh

143
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:42,000
Pathologists can diagnose this disease

144
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,199
these diseases and also how ulcerative

145
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,039
colitis increases your risk of cancer

146
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:51,039
and why that means we need better ways

147
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,039
to detect cancer earlier
