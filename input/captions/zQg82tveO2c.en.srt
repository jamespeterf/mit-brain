1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,359
So let's let's

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:08,000
begin. Despite fears that new

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:10,480
technologies will displace workers, the

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,960
most common outcome is for new

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,759
technologies to transform the jobs we do

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,320
and how we do them. The question is, how

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:21,439
can we use technologies to make jobs

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:24,160
more enjoyable and more productive? With

9
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,800
historical examples and recent data,

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,519
MIT's Ben Armstrong will identify

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,480
strategies and opportunities for

12
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:35,520
positive sum automation that benefits

13
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:38,160
firms and workers alike. Please give a

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,400
warm welcome to Ben Armstrong.

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:54,889
[Applause]

16
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:54,889
[Music]

17
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,799
Thank you. Good

18
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:08,000
morning. I want to start by taking you

19
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,799
back in time a bit to 2010, 15 years

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,119
ago. A simpler time in some ways. Uh the

21
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,400
transatlantic alliance was was strong.

22
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,159
You know, we we had mentioned free and

23
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,200
fair trade was thriving, but the

24
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,360
manufacturing economy in the US was in a

25
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,680
really hard place. And I mentioned 2010

26
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,920
because it was really a turning point in

27
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:29,280
the history of US manufacturing. In the

28
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,640
previous 10 years, US manufacturers had

29
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,960
shed a third of their overall jobs. And

30
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,040
the President Barack Obama had just

31
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,680
bailed out the two two of the leading

32
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,920
automakers in the country. And when he

33
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,720
was signing a piece of legislation to

34
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,560
reinvest in US manufacturing, he

35
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,200
signaled that there would be a shift in

36
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,360
priorities, that the US would now begin

37
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,759
to care more about the future of the

38
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,399
industry. And what he said was the

39
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,960
answer isn't to stop making things. The

40
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,719
answer is to make things better. And I

41
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,560
think that's the big challenge today

42
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,360
where now there's a consensus not only

43
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,520
in the US, but also in Europe to make

44
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,879
things, but it's unclear really how to

45
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,599
make them better. And I think that's

46
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:14,080
what myself and others uh here today are

47
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,760
really focused on in our work. So I want

48
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,560
to show you a little bit about what's

49
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,400
happened since 2010 um in the US and

50
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,040
also in in Europe. So I'll start with

51
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,720
this where you could see over time

52
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,120
what's happened. This is construction

53
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,040
dollars spent on new factories in the

54
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,120
US. So this isn't manufacturing activity

55
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,440
explicitly. You could think about it as

56
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,360
manufacturing futures investment in

57
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,239
manufacturing to come several years down

58
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,480
the line. Now 2010 this was really the

59
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,959
bottom the the pit of of US

60
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,040
manufacturing performance and what's I

61
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,959
think really surprising is that over the

62
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,800
next 10 years manufacturing construction

63
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,560
steadily grows to a point where it's

64
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,360
about double at the beginning of the

65
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,440
coronavirus pandemic to where it was uh

66
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,519
in 2010 at the depths of the recession

67
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,560
and then there was another turning point

68
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,800
a realization after the pandemic that

69
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,280
the US should should reinvest now I

70
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,120
think the types of reinvestment were uh

71
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,360
were familiar earlier reinvestment in

72
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,480
infrastructure to produce

73
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,560
semiconductors, some infrastructure to

74
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,640
produce batteries for electric vehicles,

75
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,560
some infrastructure for defense and the

76
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,120
motivation I think is is intuitive as

77
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,360
well. There was increasing dependence on

78
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,280
foreign goods. So here I'm going to plot

79
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,000
the factory construction against

80
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,319
advanced technology imports from China.

81
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,760
So this is overall Chinese exports and

82
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,680
and what you could see is that there

83
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,080
there's a parallelism here that

84
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,879
increasing dependence on on advanced

85
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,640
technology products from China is is

86
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:41,360
becoming higher and higher and as the US

87
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,519
starts to invest there's a flattening of

88
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,920
the curve. Now I know that this this

89
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,440
challenge of of uh of exports and

90
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,920
foreign competition hasn't really gone

91
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,760
away. It's really just shifted forms.

92
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,080
Well, you might be surprised since about

93
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,599
2015 that advanced technology exports

94
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,799
for China have been flat. But there's

95
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:01,360
been a new challenge and that that uh

96
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,040
folks here uh in Austria and Germany are

97
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,760
very familiar with and that's really the

98
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,599
explosion of Chinese automotive exports.

99
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,599
Really a lot of the energy and the

100
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,360
investment has shifted from advanced

101
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,439
technologies like uh electronics which

102
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,360
is still very large much larger in

103
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:18,639
scale. This is just a plot of growth not

104
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,000
of scale. But the extraordinary really

105
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,320
extraordinary growth of Chinese

106
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,479
automotive experts after after co I

107
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,960
think has been a shock un unlike even

108
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,880
the the China shock of of 2000 with with

109
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,400
the speed and scale that it's uh that

110
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,759
it's happened. So this is really the

111
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,919
context in which we're talking about

112
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:37,680
what new manufacturing is required. Now

113
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,520
it looks small now but this this

114
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,120
tripling of US manufacturing investment

115
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,280
in the last three years is significant.

116
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,560
And what I want to say is it's not just

117
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,800
existing companies like Intel or uh

118
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,800
large uh automotive companies like Ford

119
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,160
investing in new factories. It's also

120
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,080
companies that hadn't really been in

121
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,080
manufacturing before. And these

122
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,160
companies represent new models of how to

123
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,960
approach a manufacturing problem. So

124
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,240
here is this is a a mockup, a bit of a

125
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,040
futuristic almost looks like it was

126
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,520
created by Generative AI mockup of a a

127
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,520
site in Ohio, a planned site in Ohio for

128
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,080
a company called Anderil. Has anyone

129
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,000
heard of Anderal here in the US? A few

130
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,400
people. So this is a new company that

131
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,199
began as a software company to create

132
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,120
new technology um some AI based

133
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,639
technology for the US government

134
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,800
particularly for defense and border

135
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:27,280
security purposes and it was motivated

136
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,360
by several folks out of Silicon Valley

137
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,720
who said Silicon Valley is developing

138
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,800
all sorts of technologies for the

139
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,440
consumer market but not really capturing

140
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,000
this huge opportunity in defense and

141
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:41,120
government industries. So the first uh

142
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,440
move for this company in about 2016 2017

143
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,520
was to develop software and then after

144
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,520
co they've been increasingly shifting

145
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,800
toward investments in hardware and this

146
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,960
was just a few months ago the

147
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,360
announcement of an enormous campus right

148
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,039
near uh the Columbus Ohio airport to

149
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,000
really expand their manufacturing of

150
00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:00,880
critical defense goods like drones and

151
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,560
and munitions. So this is a a new model

152
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,840
of manufacturing that I'm I'm going to

153
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,600
share more about, but I want to give you

154
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,240
a sense of kind of a visual of what new

155
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,639
factories in the US look like. Now this

156
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,479
is I think a parallel challenge maybe of

157
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,160
a of a different type, but a parallel

158
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,080
challenge to what you know recent news

159
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,759
is coming out of of Europe where there's

160
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,360
in increasing focus on how to invest in

161
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,600
new kinds of manufacturing, different

162
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,000
kinds of manufacturing in in Europe. And

163
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,759
and the question for me really is all

164
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,440
this planned construction of of new

165
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,800
manufacturing facilities, is this

166
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,039
actually going to make the manufacturing

167
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,120
economy better? Will these factories

168
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,120
make products better than the factories

169
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,000
that existed before? And why that's so

170
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,360
important is that US manufacturing in

171
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,280
particular, and I'll show you

172
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,039
comparative numbers for various European

173
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,560
markets in a second, US manufacturing

174
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,800
has been really struggling in its

175
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,199
performance over the last four decades.

176
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,880
So here's that performance in one chart

177
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,039
here. It's a lot. So, I'm going to walk

178
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,400
you through it. So, I'm I'm plotting a

179
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,400
few different variables here. I'm going

180
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,039
to focus on these these lower lines

181
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,960
first. So, this is the the kind of

182
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,560
mustard colored line is the number of

183
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,000
employees, number of workers in

184
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,240
manufacturing, workers on the factory

185
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,160
floor. The green line is the number of

186
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,560
factories overall. So, you could think

187
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,039
about that new factory construction uh

188
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:18,000
marker is is linked. Red is technology

189
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:19,120
investment. Then, pink is value added.

190
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,039
You can think about just the growth of

191
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,960
the manufacturing economy overall. And

192
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:26,160
then blue is is productivity. That's the

193
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:28,319
value added divided by the employees or

194
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,360
the worker hours. And what I want to

195
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:34,080
show you here is that over time

196
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,240
beginning in in the 19, you know, uh 40s

197
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,319
and 50s thereabouts, there was really a

198
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,720
positive equilibrium that was happening

199
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,080
here. Employment was going up. It wasn't

200
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,720
going up dramatically, but there was

201
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:47,199
about um between 20 and 30% of US

202
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,120
workers employed in in manufacturing. Um

203
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,800
wages were going up for those employees.

204
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,039
There was investments in new technology

205
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,360
and also growth in productivity. Very

206
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:59,919
positive indicators. And then something

207
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:02,560
happens around the 1980s, 1990s where

208
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:04,720
investments in technology stop. The

209
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,720
workers go down significantly. I

210
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,960
mentioned about a third of the workforce

211
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,840
had been lost between 2000 and 2010.

212
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,599
That's on top of a big drop between 1980

213
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,520
and 2000. Such that the manufacturing

214
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:18,560
economy in 2010 was about half of what

215
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:21,039
it was at its peak. And what you get,

216
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,720
you get a loss of workers, a really stop

217
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,720
investing in new technology, and

218
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,080
productivity continues to go up because

219
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,440
essentially these manufacturers are

220
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,199
doing the same things. They're

221
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,800
maintaining the same level of production

222
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,519
with fewer people, but they're not

223
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,360
growing. And over time, that really the

224
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,560
chickens come home to roost, as we like

225
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,000
to say. And in 2010, productivity begins

226
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,599
going down because we can't really

227
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,680
hollow out the manufacturing workforce

228
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,440
anymore. we start investing a little

229
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,440
more in new factories, start hiring more

230
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,040
workers, but we can't really keep up

231
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,399
with productivity. So that's the

232
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,399
challenge that we face in the US. To

233
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:55,519
zoom in on kind of the the recent

234
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:58,399
period, we see productivity since 2010

235
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,160
going down and employees growing just a

236
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:03,320
little bit and the overall manufacturing

237
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,440
economy, this blue line, is actually in

238
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,120
decline. It's not going to last forever

239
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,959
the decline partly because we know this

240
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,640
new factory investment is coming. But

241
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,320
that productivity curve really needs to

242
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,680
change for US manufacturing to be

243
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,160
competitive. It needs to start going up

244
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,480
again. Now you might wonder and and I

245
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,000
did too. How does this look compared to

246
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,519
other countries? And I had talked to

247
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,279
colleagues in Germany and uh in the US

248
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,120
for a long time uh students of

249
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:30,240
manufacturing have looked to Germany and

250
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,080
Japan and some other uh models of of

251
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,600
manufacturing excellence and saying well

252
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,519
you know we should we should adopt

253
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,800
practices or institutions like when I

254
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,160
talk to German colleagues they say no

255
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,320
we're actually facing a lot of the same

256
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,800
issues and the data really bear that out

257
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,839
that the uh the figures look a little

258
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,680
different because they're on a different

259
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:50,000
time scale but really you see high my

260
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,440
pointer's not much visible but this

261
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,360
green productivity line you see high

262
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,200
productivity growth until before this

263
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,680
great recession and then really a

264
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,080
flattening of productivity over time in

265
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,279
Germany and this is with more stable

266
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,959
employment I think part of the

267
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,279
institutional story in Germany is that

268
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,959
employment remain stable it wouldn't uh

269
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,160
it wouldn't really work to lay off a

270
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,440
third of the manufacturing workforce

271
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,560
like happened in the United States so

272
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,920
that's why these curves are a little

273
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:16,880
flatter um similarly Japan this is a

274
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,720
very similar curve right it's not that

275
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,519
productivity is declining but the rate

276
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,480
of productivity growth is certainly

277
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:24,560
decelerating. And then finally, I was

278
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,079
curious since we're in in Austria, this

279
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,160
is an Austria, what does Austria look

280
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:30,000
like? And I was prepared to say that

281
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,360
Austria looks similar given how the

282
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,120
German and Austrian economies are

283
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,959
intertwined. But actually the Austrian

284
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,440
econom economic story looks much better.

285
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:39,120
So I I I would propose that next year

286
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,120
maybe we have Austrian manufacturers at

287
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,360
MIT teaching us how to have a

288
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,360
productivity curve like this where the

289
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,360
the productivity growth is much steadier

290
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,720
from a different baseline but uh

291
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,800
employment and productivity are actually

292
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,440
growing in the Austrian manufacturing

293
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,360
sector. So what what can we do with all

294
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,360
this kind of what are the the obstacles

295
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,959
that we need to overcome to improve

296
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,440
manufacturing performance? I'm going to

297
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,800
focus on on three. the first and and

298
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,560
what I should say is I'll give you a

299
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,160
short preview of these three and then

300
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,959
the following speakers are going to go

301
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:12,160
deeper into these topics. So risk for

302
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:14,959
example which is really how do we um

303
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,480
have more companies that are able to um

304
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,240
to raise money to invest in new

305
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,480
technology to take uh experimental

306
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,600
approaches to growing Hyram Samuel is

307
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,440
going to talk about this a little bit

308
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,200
later different models for approaching

309
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,839
risk. I'll preview that a little bit.

310
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,360
The second is new technology. I think

311
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,959
one of the most striking things and this

312
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,640
comes I think from an MIT perspective.

313
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,959
One of the most striking things about

314
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,640
this chart in the background is that our

315
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:39,279
level of technology investment in US

316
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:42,240
manufacturing is at the same rate that

317
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:43,600
it was in the 1980s. We haven't really

318
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,519
grown our level of technology investment

319
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,160
on the factory floor. Despite all of

320
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:50,399
these videos about automated lines and

321
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,640
talks about uh lights out factories, the

322
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,519
level of technology investment on a on a

323
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:57,680
dollar scale is the same. And this is

324
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,360
borne out not just by the the dollars,

325
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,519
but also when we do surveys of

326
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,839
manufacturers. So, here's one survey

327
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,839
where um this is a a federal government

328
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,839
survey that asked US manufacturers

329
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,079
whether they had various technologies

330
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,560
represented within their firms. And it's

331
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,240
only a small minority of firms that say

332
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,839
they have various advanced technologies.

333
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,399
Of course, these aren't only the only

334
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,920
important technologies in manufacturing.

335
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,480
But what's important to say is that not

336
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,680
only is the spending flat, but these

337
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,760
technologies that we're going to talk

338
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,279
about today are in many cases rare. the

339
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,040
technologies exist and have high

340
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,440
potential but they haven't been absorbed

341
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,120
into the manufacturing economy and the

342
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,120
capability for absorbing them on the

343
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,720
right only a minority of companies say

344
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,720
that they have the capabilities to

345
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,040
adjust these technologies versus buy

346
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,200
them off the shelf so it's not just a

347
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,880
you know buy having the capital to take

348
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,279
the risk and buy the technology it's

349
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,360
also having the internal capabilities so

350
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,959
just to give you this is US data but I I

351
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,880
imagine you want the comparative I'm

352
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,800
going to zoom in on on robots here for a

353
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,440
second and here's a plot of robot

354
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,839
adoption over time across the major

355
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,760
markets for for robots in the US

356
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,760
depending on your measure it's about 10

357
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,839
to 12% of American factories have any

358
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,480
robots at all only about half of those

359
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:11,600
factories have more than one robot um

360
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:14,000
but and you could see that it's not like

361
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,560
this uh this is growing this is a

362
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,120
growing market in the US so actually um

363
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,800
in in the pandemic era I was expecting

364
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,720
that given a lot of the restrictions in

365
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,320
the pandemic new investments in in

366
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,920
manufacturing and technology that there

367
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,240
would be an up surge in investment in

368
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,480
robotics and actually Germany, Japan,

369
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,639
the US investments in robotics went down

370
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,720
in all three places in in 2020. So

371
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:37,839
really really striking and of course the

372
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,440
the standout story here um is China and

373
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,120
and I think that's partly a story of

374
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,240
investment in automotive manufacturing

375
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,760
where 50% of all robots reside. Um and

376
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,959
it's also a story of of massive

377
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,320
government subsidies to support

378
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:52,480
technology adoption within firms. Okay,

379
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,880
the final piece of this puzzle is that

380
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,560
you know you need to have the capital to

381
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,240
take some some risks and invest in new

382
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,440
things. You need to have technology that

383
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,040
helps you become more productive and

384
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,040
develop new capabilities. And then you

385
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,480
also need people. You need people to

386
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,800
figure out how to use these technologies

387
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,800
and deploy them well. And one of the

388
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,240
challenges which is is certainly a

389
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,839
shared challenge between the US and a

390
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,320
lot of European economies is a

391
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,480
demographic one. And one of the real

392
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,639
consequences of losing half of the

393
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,560
manufacturing workforce in the US is

394
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,480
that we went really a generation without

395
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,480
hiring many new manufacturing workers.

396
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,320
So the manufacturing workforce today,

397
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,760
here's a distribution of the ages of

398
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,519
manufacturing workers uh in in 2000 it

399
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,360
looks relatively healthy that the median

400
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,519
manufacturing worker is you know in

401
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,639
their is middle-aged maybe uh in their

402
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,399
early 40s and uh today what you see is

403
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,639
that the now the median worker is

404
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:46,000
nearing retirement age. That's the you

405
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:47,360
know the uh sorry this is in in the the

406
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,040
blue case the modal manufacturing

407
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,639
workers nearing retirement age. So this

408
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,839
is a huge challenge and it's a challenge

409
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:55,920
not only to find workers to to backfill

410
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,160
these jobs to maybe design new jobs for

411
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,320
workers to fill but it's also how do you

412
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,399
transition the knowledge of all the

413
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,720
workers at at the peak of this blue

414
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,880
distribution and transfer them to the

415
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,480
young people on the left. And this is uh

416
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,920
part of the challenge that John Louu my

417
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,600
colleague is is working on is going to

418
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,720
talk about later.

419
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:17,680
Okay. So now what I've been interested

420
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,120
in is some of these kind of uh I would

421
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,720
say somewhat depressing details about

422
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,000
the challenges facing manufacturing. So

423
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,560
I'm certainly interested in those, but

424
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,199
I'm also interested in finding companies

425
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,519
that defy these trends that really have

426
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:31,600
been performing really well despite the

427
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,519
overall challenges in the manufacturing

428
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,240
economy. So I go out and search for

429
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,920
these places. I try to visit them and I

430
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,199
found really two patterns of how these

431
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,320
companies behave. Every company's a

432
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,000
little different, of course, but I want

433
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,160
to share with you two approaches that

434
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
companies have tried to take to grow

435
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,600
quickly in manufacturing to adopt

436
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,680
technology and develop a really skilled

437
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,959
workforce. And the first approach, I'm

438
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,800
going to go back to Andrew. The first

439
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:55,120
approach really looks a lot like trying

440
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:58,639
to apply some Silicon Valley principles

441
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:00,720
to manufacturing problems. And I I think

442
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,639
this comes with a lot of risks. The the

443
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,519
most prominent risks I think are present

444
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,199
in uh a series of recalls at Tesla and

445
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,600
quality problems associated with Tesla.

446
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:11,600
that's present at explosions from SpaceX

447
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,959
rockets, right? Like these are these are

448
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,720
really prominent examples of

449
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:17,519
manufacturers following a different

450
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,519
playbook with serious concerns and and

451
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,920
results that lead to high growth but

452
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,360
also high volatility. But I want to take

453
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,480
a moment to maybe set aside some of

454
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,079
those concerns and just look at the

455
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,240
playbook and how companies are following

456
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,360
it. And and here here's what it looks

457
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,040
like when they think about, you know,

458
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,600
the challenges of risk, technology, and

459
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:36,160
skill. The risk is taken care of by a

460
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,800
very different financing model than what

461
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:41,680
a typical uh medium-sized manufacturer

462
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:44,240
might rely on bank loans or they might

463
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:46,480
pour uh profits back into the business.

464
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,240
These are companies that are relying on

465
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,399
risk capital and they don't feel the

466
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,480
need to pro to generate short-term

467
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,839
profits. And it's a very different model

468
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,839
that allows them to invest and

469
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,199
experiment in different ways than a

470
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,920
traditional manufacturing firm that's

471
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:02,720
held by a a private equity fund or one

472
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,559
that's publicly traded. The second is

473
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,319
that they bring a very different type of

474
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:08,480
technological approach. So I mentioned

475
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:10,640
Andrew started as a software company and

476
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,240
transitioned into manufacturing. So what

477
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,640
they had when they started investing in

478
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,640
in hardware was a set of software

479
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,240
products that were designed to really

480
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,319
support the hardware that they wanted to

481
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,720
build. So they had not just the

482
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:24,000
capability of using other technologies

483
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,520
that others had built, they had actually

484
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,199
developed had the capability to develop

485
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,960
software internally that was exactly

486
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,360
what they needed to solve manufacturing

487
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,799
problems. And then finally, one of the

488
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,240
skills, not to mention kind of the

489
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,160
software skills inherent in the

490
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,799
workforce they were hiring, one of the

491
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,799
skills was to experiment and improve

492
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:43,600
very quickly. So you might have heard

493
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:46,720
stories um many stories from places like

494
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:49,679
Tesla and SpaceX that in these companies

495
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,600
there was no boundary between the R&D

496
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,679
lab and the factory floor. In fact, at

497
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,600
Tesla, there is no really separate R&D

498
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,120
department. It is part of the production

499
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,799
team. And that's one of the really

500
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,160
different paradigms between these

501
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,400
companies. They're they're able to move

502
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,000
faster because they have no division

503
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,120
between these this traditional boundary.

504
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,640
There's no challenge of necessarily

505
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,320
translating or throwing something from

506
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,200
R&D over into

507
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,960
production. It's also a potential

508
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,200
explanation for quality problems as some

509
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:18,720
of you might have guessed. So all right.

510
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:21,919
So I think that it's important to note

511
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,679
these aren't just uh a few uh errant

512
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:28,160
examples at the moment. In the beginning

513
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:30,640
in in before co they were since uh this

514
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:34,000
is really over the last 5 to 10 years

515
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:36,240
there has been an extraordinary surge of

516
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,600
people leaving SpaceX and Tesla in

517
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,200
particular you can imagine why they

518
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,600
might leave and starting their own

519
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,360
companies with some uh with some

520
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,600
variation of this model. So trying to

521
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,919
apply the same experimentalism maybe

522
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,080
with less of an authoritarian streak uh

523
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:52,080
maybe with a little bit more balance and

524
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,240
a little bit more uh focus on process

525
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,000
control focus on on quality but really

526
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,600
you can see I there's no way of

527
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,880
displaying it. I tried to make it each

528
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,559
of these little lines if you could see

529
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,480
each of those is a company that came out

530
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,760
of SpaceX or Tesla and this is an

531
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,240
underestimate because these are just

532
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,600
alumni who are founders. They're also in

533
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,559
and for example the head of

534
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,400
manufacturing came from Tesla. So the

535
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,919
the heads of manufacturing at a lot of

536
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,360
these companies aren't necessarily

537
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,440
founders, but they come with the same

538
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,760
playbook from these companies. So this

539
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,679
is a um and I'm not I'm not trying to

540
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,520
endorse it. I'm just describing here how

541
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,120
this is a playbook that has diffused

542
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,960
really rapidly in the United States in

543
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,559
manufacturing. And you know, you could

544
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,000
see that there are there are a couple

545
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:32,240
precedents for this type of playbook

546
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,960
expanding. One is after World War II,

547
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,400
there was a a big surge in in the US of

548
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,240
folks leaving the military who had

549
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,799
gained technical skills and actually

550
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,160
learned at arsenals to try to um start

551
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,160
their own companies, many of which

552
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,520
became defense contractors. And the

553
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,600
second example is the founding of

554
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,039
Silicon Valley and and many of you might

555
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,120
already know the story, but if you'll

556
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:54,160
forgive me, Silicon Valley really

557
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:56,799
started out of one major semiconductor

558
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,720
company that was founded by the people

559
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,400
who were known as the Traitorous 8. They

560
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,880
were called traitorrists because they

561
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,840
left the lab of of William Shockley who

562
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,280
was a tyrannical eugenicist. Um they

563
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,200
didn't like working with him. So they

564
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,720
left to start their own company and that

565
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,880
company helped give rise to many of the

566
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,640
very important uh software and

567
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,480
semiconductor related firms that really

568
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,400
started this cluster and this boom and

569
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,840
and this is quite similar I think to to

570
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,760
what's happening today with the

571
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,760
diffusion of of SpaceX and Tesla. You

572
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:28,720
can see AMD, Intel, a lot of familiar

573
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,799
names in this in this bubble. Okay. And

574
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,480
and I I think this almost goes without

575
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:34,320
saying at this point, but there's a big

576
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,679
trade-off to this model. And and I think

577
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,360
one of the challenges for a lot of these

578
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,440
companies that have have come out and

579
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:43,120
are receiving venture capital today is

580
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:46,159
how to essentially use the the blue the

581
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:49,840
blue features to increase uh quality and

582
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:52,559
performance without seeing um seeing big

583
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:55,679
uh dips in big problems like um like

584
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:57,600
SpaceX and Tesla have seen. Okay. Now I

585
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,919
think the the alternative and and the

586
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:03,520
big critique of this model and and uh I

587
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:05,200
hear it often uh is from people who um

588
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,280
are really students of the Toyota

589
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:10,400
production system, students of of lean.

590
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:12,720
And this is a methodology that became

591
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:15,360
common practice in the US in the 1990s.

592
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,360
I I rarely go to any um traditional

593
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,720
manufacturing firm that that doesn't

594
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,480
tell me about how they're lean and what

595
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,720
they're doing to advance their their

596
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:25,200
lean agenda. Uh but but one of the

597
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,720
challenges of lean over time has been

598
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,799
that it's very good at optimizing

599
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,360
certain processes. It's very good as a

600
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:33,760
set of tools to help you do the same

601
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,919
with fewer resources, removing waste,

602
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,600
etc. But it's not necessarily a playbook

603
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,600
to help you grow and scale. It's not

604
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,840
really a playbook to help you innovate.

605
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,440
So one of the questions is for companies

606
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,640
that I think are more incrementalist

607
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,440
I'll call them incrementalist versus

608
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:50,320
kind of the radical approach of Anderil

609
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,400
is how do you take this lean playbook

610
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,400
and then add the tools for growth and

611
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,320
innovation and this incrementalist

612
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,880
approach is is really exemplified by a

613
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,799
company called Danaher which emerged in

614
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,520
in the 1980s one of the first adopters

615
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:05,760
of lean and I'm just comparing Danaher

616
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,039
to one of the favorite punching bags in

617
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,360
the US recently which is General

618
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:11,039
Electric in the blue line which is uh

619
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,200
has not really seen any improvement in

620
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:15,520
stock performance underperformed the Dow

621
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,600
Jones and the S&P whereas Danaher really

622
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,039
experienced extraordinary growth while

623
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,880
the rest of the manufacturing economy

624
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:23,360
was struggling and the playbook that

625
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:26,080
Danaher followed was quite different

626
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:28,640
than than a SpaceX or a Tesla. It was a

627
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,559
playbook of vertical integration so

628
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,880
controlling many different stages of the

629
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:35,200
manufacturing process. It was uh

630
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,880
investing in the long term. So it wasn't

631
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,400
necessarily going public early but

632
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,559
having a lot of patient capital and a

633
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,559
lot of very smart financial maneuvers to

634
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:44,159
invest in complimentary businesses over

635
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:45,520
time and it essentially served as a

636
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,760
holding company for all sorts of

637
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,440
different technological capabilities

638
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,840
software capabilities as well as

639
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,760
manufacturing assets and this I think is

640
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,919
is a incremental approach that now we're

641
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,880
seeing more uh more companies start to

642
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,640
follow and I think there are some

643
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,799
exciting examples that might come up

644
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,440
later that are consistent with this more

645
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:05,760
incremental approach and of course the

646
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:08,960
difficulty of this approach and uh one

647
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:11,039
of my favorite examples of of this is a

648
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,400
a US company called Proctor and Gamble

649
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,480
which is really a remarkable

650
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,360
manufacturing company that makes you

651
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,760
high quality but commodity goods is that

652
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,280
they are slow to change their

653
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,039
manufacturing process but when they do

654
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,320
change their manufacturing process you

655
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,919
know it's going to improve and it's

656
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,600
going to be very fine-tuned. So really

657
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,960
the trade-off here is speed and and

658
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:32,400
that's where these two models are sort

659
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,400
of the inverse of of the

660
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:38,480
other. One of the ways we're seeing this

661
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,919
model scale in the US isn't necessarily

662
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,280
from from US-based companies like

663
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,840
Proctor and Gamble, but it's from

664
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:45,039
foreignowned companies. And one of the

665
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,880
things I was really surprised to see

666
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:48,559
when I started looking at the data is

667
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,240
that, you know, we've had this upsurge

668
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,440
in in factory construction. Like I

669
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,520
mentioned, it's it's sort of

670
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,440
unprecedented how fast it's grown. And

671
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,960
if you look at the big factories, just

672
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,799
factories that are billion dollars plus

673
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,520
like the Arsenal project, you know,

674
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:04,159
we've had 40 of these. So in in just a

675
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:06,840
three-year period, really extraordinary,

676
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:09,280
40% of those are from foreignowned

677
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:11,279
companies. So there's been a a real

678
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:13,279
surge in foreign investment in the US,

679
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:15,919
perhaps anticipation of of changes to

680
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:18,000
trade policy or uh improved supply chain

681
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:21,440
resilience. Whatever the reason, you see

682
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,799
a big surge in in foreign uh in foreign

683
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,480
direct investment. And the blue line

684
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:27,760
down here is plotting that over time

685
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,600
that it it surged again after 2020, but

686
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:32,159
it it had been growing for some time as

687
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,919
overall manufacturing capital investment

688
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,840
had been pretty flat. So this is really

689
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,520
remarkable that a lot of companies that

690
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,360
have I would say a more incrementalist

691
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,279
approach and bring a lot of really high

692
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,960
quality manufacturing processes from

693
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,559
their home countries have been moving to

694
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,799
the US and that those practices have

695
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:48,960
been diffusing. So, so I look at this as

696
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:52,520
a a a positive development and one that

697
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:55,279
we should really be um trying to uh

698
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:58,799
emphasize. And finally, just to to

699
00:24:55,279 --> 00:25:00,640
conclude here, I I want to think about

700
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:02,320
just the the group we have here today

701
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,559
and kind of the the spirit of this

702
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:07,039
meeting which uh colleagues talked about

703
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:09,480
before. And I think there's a spirit of

704
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:11,360
uh mutual learning and transatlantic

705
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:13,679
cooperation. And there's actually a

706
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:16,240
really great history in in manufacturing

707
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:18,000
of this type of open learning. And I

708
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,919
want to talk about two examples of this

709
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
and what I think we can take away from

710
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,520
each and then maybe suggest to you,

711
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,840
let's think about together how we might

712
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,159
be able to do more um cooperation in the

713
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,679
future. So here here are my two

714
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:31,279
examples. You know, on the left, some of

715
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,799
you might know this is a uh the

716
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:35,799
headquarters of a company that no longer

717
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:38,080
exists called NUMI. Um and NUMI was a

718
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:41,039
collaboration beginning in the uh late

719
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:44,000
80s, early 90s between uh Toyota and

720
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:47,840
General Motors. And the story goes um

721
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:50,880
that General Motor CEO Roger Smith, he

722
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:53,440
saw the Toyota competition uh in the US

723
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:56,000
auto market and was very scared. And

724
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,600
first he tried to um develop what he

725
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,120
called the factories of the future. And

726
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:02,559
the factories of the future were really

727
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:04,720
G's answer GE GM's answer to lean,

728
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:07,520
excuse me. And GM's answer to Lean was,

729
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,440
"Let's lean into this software uh

730
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,039
advantage that the US has." This is in

731
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,559
the 1980s. Silicon Valley is just

732
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,480
bubbling up. So he said, "We're going to

733
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:15,679
start the Lights Out factory." Roger

734
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,480
Smith was the first person to coin this

735
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:19,760
term. And uh so he's like, "Let's let's

736
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,760
use our software advantage to compete

737
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,200
with Toyota through technology." And it

738
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,960
failed dramatically. It failed

739
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,880
miserably. These factories of the future

740
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,480
uh they tried to introduce tons of

741
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,000
robots, tons of software automation, and

742
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,120
it didn't work. And and it's a separate

743
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,320
talk on why it didn't work, but it

744
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,600
really didn't work. So he said, "All

745
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,200
right, if we can't beat the Japanese

746
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,159
with automation, we should join them. We

747
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,880
should do a joint venture." And that's

748
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:41,840
what Numei was. So they had Japanese

749
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,760
management and uh Japanese line

750
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,600
managers, production managers, and then

751
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,200
US workers. And what was interesting is

752
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,760
that in this California plant, which was

753
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,279
a GM plant before uh it was the lowest

754
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,279
per one of the lowest performing plants

755
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:55,200
of all the GM plants and once the

756
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:57,120
Japanese management came in and they

757
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,720
applied uh lean principles, it became

758
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,960
one of the highest performing plants.

759
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,480
really there was excitement that the

760
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,880
these types of lessons might be able to

761
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,640
spread throughout General Motors and

762
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,039
certainly for the Japanese they it

763
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,640
worked and and now you see multiple

764
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,080
Toyota and other Japanese car makers

765
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:15,440
producing very effectively in the United

766
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:17,440
States but the the the real frustration

767
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,039
of this partnership was that GM didn't

768
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,120
know what to do with the lessons. They

769
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:23,440
had a successful plant with a lot of GM

770
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:25,760
workers um unionized workers who were in

771
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,440
the plant. They had a group of people

772
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,640
American Americans who had been involved

773
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,240
in it called they called them the NUMI

774
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,240
commandos and they went out to try to

775
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,480
teach other firms these these lessons

776
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,080
and they didn't really stick and GM kept

777
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,720
doing business the same way that it

778
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,559
always did and I think one of the

779
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,000
challenges from from Numei is that well

780
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,279
you have this great success story but

781
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,600
you didn't really capitalize it you

782
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:46,640
didn't really institutionalize these

783
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:48,880
lessons and I think that's a very

784
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:52,640
different story from when BMW came to

785
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:54,960
South Carolina and BMW um you might know

786
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,880
the story better than I do In 1993, BMW

787
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,039
was looking for the next place to to

788
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,600
move a major manufacturing facility.

789
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:03,679
They chose South Carolina. Um,

790
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,960
management in Germany here was not

791
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:05,760
pretty skeptical of the idea. They

792
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,880
weren't really sure, how are we going to

793
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,279
do this in South Carolina? South

794
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,880
Carolina was more textile manufacturing,

795
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:13,679
even agricultural. Where's the workforce

796
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:16,679
going to come from? And what happened

797
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:20,000
was that South Carolina, to their

798
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:21,840
credit, listened to BMW's strategy for

799
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
workforce development, for investment,

800
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,840
new technology, and heads of South

801
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,279
Carolina technical colleges, workforce

802
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:30,080
development organizations went to

803
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:31,840
Germany to study how vocational schools

804
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,240
worked in in Germany to try to replicate

805
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:36,240
it in South Carolina. And the South

806
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,760
Carolina manufacturing economy went from

807
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,440
one of the lowest product lowest

808
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,279
productivity manufacturing economies in

809
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,200
1990 to today one of the highest

810
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:45,039
productivity manufacturing economies.

811
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,960
Wages have gone up and there's been an

812
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:48,240
an automotive cluster really a pretty

813
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,480
advanced automotive cluster that's

814
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,240
formed around the BMW plant. And if you

815
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,399
can believe it, South Carolina is the

816
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:57,279
leading source of apprenticeships in in

817
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:59,919
the United States um because of BMW's

818
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:01,760
influence not just over the individual

819
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:03,600
plant but over the institutions and

820
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,600
surrounding region. So this is really a

821
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,480
case where the lessons of this

822
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,520
partnership really spread and became

823
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,960
institutionalized albeit in in one

824
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:14,000
region of one state but really

825
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,600
successfully in ways that I fear the

826
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,600
lessons of Numei although they made it

827
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,279
through to a lot of consultants and a

828
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,440
lot of firms that adopted what they call

829
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:23,600
lean practices it it it hasn't been

830
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:26,000
institutionalized in the same way around

831
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:28,000
training and a more general approach to

832
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,080
manufacturing. So I think that the

833
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,399
challenge for us here today is to take

834
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,600
the lessons from a lot of my brilliant

835
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:35,279
colleagues that'll share about new

836
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,520
technologies and new approaches and

837
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:39,279
hopefully find ways to to cooperate and

838
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,200
then also we would love to hear lessons

839
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:43,760
from how how you do things differently

840
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:47,880
here um and try to learn from them back

841
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,880
at home. Thank you so much.

842
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:55,279
Do I have time for one question?

843
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:57,679
Okay, I think we have questions on a

844
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:59,039
board. Okay,

845
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:02,159
here. Here we are. I don't know if I've

846
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:04,159
ever been short. Okay. With with AI

847
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:06,200
being a huge part of manufacturing

848
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:08,679
today, what are some practical

849
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:12,480
approaches to training traditional

850
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:16,840
workforce to effectively utilize AI in a

851
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,840
way that enhances their performance?

852
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:22,640
So,

853
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:24,159
I forgive me question asker. I don't

854
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,520
think AI is a huge part of manufacturing

855
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:26,799
today. I think it's actually quite a

856
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,799
small part of manufacturing today. And

857
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:31,440
and the way that AI works in a lot of

858
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:33,120
the factories that I've seen it in p is

859
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,600
through let's say vision systems or

860
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:37,039
quality control systems where the main

861
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,720
skill that you would need to use these

862
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:40,799
tools is the same skill you would always

863
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,799
need is to kind of interpret you know

864
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:44,720
whether the part is of a high quality.

865
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:46,480
There might be more interpreting of the

866
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,399
underlying data and to understand when

867
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,240
to trust the algorithm and when not. But

868
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:51,919
that's really what my colleagues who who

869
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,720
are more expert at this than I focus on

870
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:56,159
is is not just how do you use AI more,

871
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,919
which I think has been the big focus is

872
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,440
get people to use AI more because some

873
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:01,039
by some magic it's going to increase

874
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,039
productivity. It's instead how do you

875
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:05,039
calibrate your use of new technologies

876
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:07,360
to use them when they might be

877
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:09,039
productive and and then avoid using them

878
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,159
when they might lead you astray, which I

879
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,440
think is is certainly the case in

880
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:13,279
manufacturing. You don't want to use

881
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,440
probabilistic tools in manufacturing

882
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:18,559
that needs to be very controlled and

883
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:20,640
very tightly refined. Okay. Our second

884
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:23,600
question, continuous training will help

885
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:26,320
with the skills gap. How much continuous

886
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:28,799
in quotes training is needed as we need

887
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:33,399
workers and lack the ability to always

888
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:36,559
be thinking about training? I

889
00:31:33,399 --> 00:31:38,080
um I think John John Lou let's maybe

890
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:40,080
hold this. I'll give a small answer, but

891
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:43,200
then maybe John can give a a longer

892
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:45,679
answer. So I have a a problem with this

893
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,960
idea of a skills gap in in the US. I

894
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:48,720
actually don't think that's the major

895
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,840
labor problem. Um, but I do think

896
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,080
continuous training is good. So, I'm

897
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,840
going to focus on that part. Um, so one

898
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,120
of the things that I think the some of

899
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:58,240
the highest performing companies I've

900
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:00,559
seen do is they try to map the skills of

901
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,320
their workers and also map the career

902
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:03,919
opportunities that their workers have.

903
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,679
So, you see even small companies that

904
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,200
kind of have a spreadsheet of necessary

905
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,720
skills on the factory floor. and they

906
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,880
develop whether it's internal to the

907
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,880
company or through an external

908
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,799
organization ways of training to get

909
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:17,200
those different skills and then a worker

910
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:18,880
can see oh by getting these skills I am

911
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,320
able to move up within my career and

912
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,559
that can be beneficial for the company.

913
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:24,480
I've also seen you recently I was at a a

914
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:26,240
really remarkable factory in Japan where

915
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,480
there's just an expectation and

916
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,840
requirement of continuous training and

917
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,240
training requirements through the year

918
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,679
and also everyone in the factory needs

919
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,200
to work at know how to work at every

920
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:36,559
position. So the expectations of

921
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,559
training are just much higher

922
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:39,559
inherently.

923
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:45,760
From the BMW moving to South Carolina

924
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:48,080
example, what issues did they consider

925
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:51,679
when choosing new locations for

926
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:54,080
production facilities, regulatory, local

927
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:56,559
market needs.

928
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,240
So in surveys of companies, and this

929
00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:00,320
this might be US companies, so I I can't

930
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,159
say this was explicit for BMW. In

931
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,679
surveys of manufacturing companies

932
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,120
looking for new locations, there are

933
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,640
three factors that come up consistently

934
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,080
as the top three that kind of change

935
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,760
places sometimes. One is skilled

936
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:12,880
workforce. So, do you have a workforce

937
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:15,120
that's able to um you know, able to go

938
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,960
and and fill the jobs that they need?

939
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,080
You know, in BMW's case, it was kind of

940
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,159
funny looking back at some of the

941
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,960
newspaper articles from this around this

942
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:24,880
decision. they kept coming up with um

943
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,720
that they were, you know, mechanically

944
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,159
mechanically talented farm boys was kind

945
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,080
of the the term that people thought that

946
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:31,200
BMW was looking for in South Carolina.

947
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,840
I'm not sure how that worked out for

948
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:36,720
them. Um but that that was the that was

949
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:38,159
the idea. And and they also uh the

950
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,640
complaint of other states that wanted

951
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,760
BMW to come there like Tennessee um was

952
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,360
that they weren't close enough to the

953
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,240
ocean. So that the port of Charleston

954
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:48,080
was actually a big uh uh access to the

955
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:51,200
coast for exports um was a big part of

956
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:53,440
BMW's decision to move. Fun fact, uh the

957
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:56,240
largest individual exporter in the

958
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:58,159
United States is BMW US. That is the

959
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,000
larger largest manufacturing exporter

960
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:01,440
overall. Um really remarkable and

961
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,480
another reminder that foreign direct

962
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,960
investment is really critical to the

963
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:07,200
American manufacturing economy.

964
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:09,839
What can manufacturers with legacy

965
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:15,119
hardware learn from the software

966
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:18,159
approach of an Anderil at all?

967
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:21,359
Yeah, I I think that the um one of the

968
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:23,599
keys is redesign of work. So I've been

969
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:25,919
focused on that manufacturers with

970
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:27,599
legacy hardware typically have the same

971
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:30,159
job descriptions over time and they

972
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:31,679
replicate these jobs even as the

973
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:33,520
underlying technologies that are

974
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,440
available to perform the jobs might

975
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,839
change and you might be able to redesign

976
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,919
a job that now can take on more tasks

977
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:42,159
than than previously. And when Andre and

978
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:44,240
and Tesla and others started really from

979
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,760
scratch and this was they started with

980
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:47,599
frankly engineers and not production

981
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,960
workers doing these roles that engineers

982
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:51,280
just thought of totally different job

983
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,040
descriptions for how to perform what was

984
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:55,280
production work. Another story that was

985
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:57,040
shared with some uh my myself and and

986
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,880
number of colleagues recently was that

987
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,839
when

988
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:01,839
Tesla encountered its various

989
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:03,200
manufacturing failures, they needed an

990
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:05,280
all hands-on deck approach on the

991
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,720
factory floor to solve the problems. And

992
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,480
one of the things was they had to have

993
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:10,079
actually their software engineers come

994
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,000
to the factory floor to be extra hands

995
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:13,599
on deck because the robots had failed.

996
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,520
And what happened was these software

997
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:17,359
engineers hadn't realized that the

998
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,960
manufacturing was done this way and they

999
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:20,720
said well I can fix that. I can develop

1000
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,480
a program for that or an algorithm for

1001
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,720
this and and there was new there were

1002
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,320
new tools developed because of uh

1003
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:29,280
different skills being exposed to these

1004
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:31,599
processes. So I think we have time for

1005
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,119
just one more question. What are ethical

1006
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:34,640
challenges when it comes to the

1007
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,680
automation of work? Oh, this is the one

1008
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:39,839
I was hoping you weren't going to ask

1009
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:41,280
me. Um, I think that I'm going to dodge

1010
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:43,200
the question a little bit because I I

1011
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,599
don't really have any authority to speak

1012
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:48,160
on on the ethics of it. Um, but I could

1013
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:51,079
we did a a survey recently on workers

1014
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:53,760
perspectives of automation

1015
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:56,160
and I'm I'm torn because I think that

1016
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:58,160
the the the threat of automation to

1017
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:01,040
displace work is frequently overblown.

1018
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:02,800
And one of the challenges really of new

1019
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,079
technologies is the question of whether

1020
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,760
they're going to make jobs higher

1021
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,960
quality, higher wage or lower quality,

1022
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,200
lower wage. That's a bigger question I

1023
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,880
think than than more jobs or fewer jobs.

1024
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,000
And one of the things that I was really

1025
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,880
surprised, we did a survey in nine

1026
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,880
different countries and we asked

1027
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,720
workers, do you think that automation is

1028
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,680
going to make your job better in in what

1029
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:21,280
aspects? And workers in the US were

1030
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,720
relatively positive but pretty skeptical

1031
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,680
that automation would help their job

1032
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:29,040
security or their wages. and workers in

1033
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:31,119
Germany, France, the UK, uh, Poland were

1034
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,480
very excited about automation and new

1035
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:34,079
technologies. They were eager. They

1036
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,160
were, I think it was a 30 percentage

1037
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:38,000
point gap in the optimism versus

1038
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:40,640
pessimism around automation and new

1039
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,680
technologies. And it's unclear. We have

1040
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,280
a graduate student who's trying to

1041
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,800
explain this transatlantic gap in

1042
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,200
perceptions of automation. Unclear

1043
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:49,520
really why. I think one reason is

1044
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:51,520
institutions is that with institutions

1045
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:53,599
that provide a safety net and provide

1046
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:55,280
some semblance of job security, you're

1047
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:57,359
less scared about automation displacing

1048
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:00,320
you and and are maybe more likely to see

1049
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:02,160
it as a as a tool. Um, so so I think

1050
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:05,530
that's potentially one one influence

1051
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:13,280
here. Well, thank you, Ben Armstrong.

1052
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:13,280
[Applause]
