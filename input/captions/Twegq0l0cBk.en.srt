1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,440
Thank thank you all for being here and

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,519
for having me. I apologize for the raspy

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,599
voice. I think I'm caught between the

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,360
cold weather and having so many meetings

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,039
over the past week that at the end of

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,960
Friday I was I was in worse shape. So

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,960
I'm I'm doing better. Uh and it's great

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,600
to be here and to tell you about

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,920
manufacturing. Uh we've launched a new

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,680
initiative at MIT focused on

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,920
manufacturing called the initiative for

12
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,239
new manufacturing. And in the time we

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,480
have, I'll share the details of that

14
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:37,760
with you wrapped within a perspective of

15
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,600
where I see manufacturing today and uh

16
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,480
hopefully where it is headed going

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:47,719
forward. And I welcome your feedback and

18
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,719
comments and questions uh as well.

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,239
So let's think about manufacturing.

20
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,520
Let's think about how physical products

21
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:59,280
are made. And I love Lego bricks.

22
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,680
Perhaps the most

23
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,440
high volume product across the history

24
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,519
of the world in terms of being, you

25
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,119
know, similar in its size and shape. And

26
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,119
imagine what it would take to describe

27
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,560
to someone how a Lego brick is made.

28
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,040
Maybe you know that it's made by

29
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,680
injection molding,

30
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,400
injecting molten plastic into a metal

31
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:22,960
cavity. uh and you know while it be

32
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:26,000
straightforward to tell that to someone

33
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,799
to provide the dimensions in the 3D CAD

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,439
model it would be a lot harder perhaps

35
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,479
impossible in in one stream of

36
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,799
communication to explain how to achieve

37
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:40,240
the tolerances the accuracy the surface

38
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:42,720
finish and all the things needed to

39
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,200
make the Lego brick have the

40
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,560
capabilities that an ordinary Lego brick

41
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:51,439
has so many times times over. And then

42
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:55,119
imagine what it would take to describe

43
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:56,799
how to make a smartphone. The incredible

44
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,280
information

45
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:02,240
content density

46
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,119
that's embedded in the materials, the

47
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,960
components, the supply chains, the

48
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,520
software and so on and everything that

49
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,760
works in synchrony together. So my point

50
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,680
is that

51
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:17,440
perhaps obviously ma manufacturing is

52
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,599
hard and in a way I feel the next

53
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,440
generation of manufacturing or the

54
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,760
emergent generation of manufacturing is

55
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:27,360
about understanding how to build an

56
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,920
equilibrium between

57
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,840
knowledge,

58
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,560
technology,

59
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:38,239
data and of course humans. And that

60
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:41,519
applies to all industries, all products,

61
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:44,000
all sizes of companies, uh, and arguably

62
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,760
all geographies.

63
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,920
Now, we're also, in my opinion, in a

64
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,560
very interesting time for manufacturing,

65
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,720
both domestically here in the US and

66
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,440
worldwide.

67
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,040
The world is always growing and

68
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,519
manufacturing as a result is always

69
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,640
growing because we need more stuff. uh

70
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:05,360
and manufacturing advances our daily

71
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,760
lives in so many ways.

72
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:11,680
But specifically here in the US, I feel

73
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,440
we're at a time where more so than in

74
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,280
perhaps one or two generations, there's

75
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,080
a renewed interest in the importance of

76
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:21,599
manufacturing to our economy, to our

77
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:24,319
national security, and to a sense of of

78
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:26,400
of accomplishment in our society. And

79
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,000
that statement is not political from one

80
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,319
angle to the other. It's it's it's

81
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,400
broadly recognized and that's reflected

82
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:35,360
by, you know, corporate interest in

83
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,360
building more manufacturing here. That

84
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,560
said, if you look to this report from

85
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,159
the United Nations in 2024, there's also

86
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,920
a prediction that manufacturing is going

87
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,640
to continue to grow and concentrate in

88
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,560
Asia, specifically in China. This

89
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,920
prediction is that manufacturing in

90
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,799
China by 2030 will be an astounding 45%

91
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,159
of the total value added worldwide. And

92
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,080
so we have to keep in mind that

93
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,920
manufacturing is this dynamic balance.

94
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,640
And how do we insert new technologies?

95
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,040
How do we build new companies? How do we

96
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:09,360
evolve established companies from small

97
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:12,239
to large to help craft this

98
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:15,760
continued improvement of the quality,

99
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:19,359
the efficiency, the capabilities of

100
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:21,759
products that are manufactured.

101
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:24,320
looking now with a with a slightly

102
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:27,440
tighter lens to the status of things

103
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,440
here in the US. Regardless of the

104
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,880
decline in manufacturing that's happened

105
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:35,520
in in total volume over the past 20 to

106
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:38,160
30 years, the US is still the world's

107
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,560
second largest manufacturing economy.

108
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,280
And as evidence of the importance of

109
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,280
manufacturing to the country,

110
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:51,360
manufacturers perform over half of

111
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:53,520
private sector R&D. And every dollar

112
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:58,160
of value created in manufacturing, every

113
00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:01,759
job created has a multiplier effect. $3

114
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:04,160
more added to the economy and five more

115
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,000
employees hired. And and all these

116
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,639
questions always have to be evaluated in

117
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,039
a business context. uh in in other

118
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:14,080
contexts but manufacturing is a huge

119
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:16,639
multiplier. It's kind of the hourglass

120
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,160
uh is the tightest part in the in the

121
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,560
value and we often look at the value

122
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,919
from production overall and real must

123
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:27,440
realize it casts value upstream as well

124
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:29,520
as downstream. And on the right side uh

125
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,000
the two charts express the the dilemma

126
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,759
that we face particularly in the US but

127
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,680
I think in in in certain parts of the

128
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:39,759
world outside of the US. The fact that

129
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,520
on aggregate if you look across

130
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:45,120
industries and you look at many but not

131
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:47,199
all industries productivity uh

132
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,680
manufacturing value add per unit of

133
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:52,800
labor has more or less stagnated for the

134
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:56,240
past 15 years. And at the same time, we

135
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,080
don't have enough new

136
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,479
individuals, young people entering the

137
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,280
manufacturing workforce. There are a

138
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:05,039
number of reasons for this

139
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,120
transition from the era of lean

140
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,800
manufacturing to an era of technology

141
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,039
adoption,

142
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,680
offshoring, you know, declining

143
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,680
expertise and the lack of sufficiently

144
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,240
broad awareness that manufacturing is an

145
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,360
exciting, technology-rich, rewarding

146
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,319
long-term career. But we really need to

147
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:27,759
confront this dilemma, confronts this

148
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:30,319
juxtiposition if we are able to

149
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,759
contribute to at MIT and elsewhere

150
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,160
building a next generation of

151
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,919
manufacturing and going from labs to

152
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,039
practice and classrooms to broader

153
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:42,319
audiences which is what I'll talk about.

154
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:46,319
And we need in a way more examples like

155
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:48,880
this. Right? I'll use this

156
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:52,400
example of the SpaceX rocket engine to

157
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:56,880
articulate a broader point. Over several

158
00:06:52,400 --> 00:07:00,319
years, SpaceX has

159
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:02,240
built a high performance culture of

160
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,639
quick iteration, rapid cycles of

161
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,599
learning that uses advanced

162
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:10,639
manufacturing technologies to quickly

163
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:12,800
iterate from one version to the next.

164
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,759
This example is using 3D printing at

165
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,400
scale to enable more and more of their

166
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:20,720
rocket engine to be optimized for higher

167
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,680
performance for lower cost. And you see

168
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:27,039
this kind of transformation right from

169
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:29,440
complexity to

170
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:32,639
simplicity in a in a general sense. So

171
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:35,759
how do we in a way do more with less or

172
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:38,479
do more with new approaches?

173
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:41,039
And that's in

174
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:43,680
a way the goal of the MIT initiative for

175
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:47,680
new manufacturing which we launched in

176
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:49,759
May of 2025 about six months ago. And

177
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,080
this is like MIT's other strategic

178
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,639
initiatives uh an MITwide effort

179
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,479
bringing together research education and

180
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,280
partnerships here to focus on

181
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:03,039
manufacturing that meets metrics that we

182
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:06,240
can call verifiably new. By new

183
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:09,199
manufacturing, we don't mean only brand

184
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,919
new manufacturing like only creating new

185
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,680
businesses or new factories. Uh while

186
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:16,639
that's certainly a part of it, we mean

187
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,520
infusing new technology uh evolved

188
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,879
organizational approaches into industry

189
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,440
through our classrooms, through our

190
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:26,160
research, and through our partnerships.

191
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,080
And this initiative, as I'll describe

192
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:31,120
today, is broad. It stretches across

193
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,440
campus and is focused not on one

194
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:36,240
technology domain or another, but as

195
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:39,279
enabler for MIT to make more impact in

196
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,519
manufacturing through the lens of

197
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,279
industry verticals from semiconductors

198
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,519
to biio manufacturing to the built

199
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,519
environment as well as addressing

200
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:50,320
crosscutting themes like the deployment

201
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,160
of AI and databased approaches in

202
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,920
organizations in manufacturing

203
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,320
addressing the hard problems while

204
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,480
trying to sort of set the stage for the

205
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,480
future.

206
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:04,000
Why is MIT doing this? Well, you know,

207
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,680
well, well, my opening words said, well,

208
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
kind of the time is now, and that's very

209
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,480
much the case. It's because

210
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,800
manufacturing is in MIT's DNA, right?

211
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,440
MIT's motto is mind in hand, right?

212
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:19,360
Combining the theory with the practice.

213
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:21,920
And from MIT's origins, rooted in

214
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,320
industrial practice and creating value

215
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,080
for industry, manufacturing has been

216
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,040
there. Today there's research in

217
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,720
manufacturing across all departments and

218
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,399
arguably all of the schools in a

219
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:37,600
different way. Uh from automation for

220
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:40,000
chemical synthesis to fast ways to 3D

221
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,600
print new furniture, advanced materials

222
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,720
processing and of course studying

223
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:49,200
the emergent embodiment of AI and how to

224
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,880
adopt technology. There's also a history

225
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:55,120
of MIT doing landmark studies such as

226
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,600
the machine that changed the world which

227
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,760
is the study that brought

228
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,560
lean manufacturing and an understanding

229
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:05,920
of lean manufacturing to

230
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:08,480
the world through working closely with

231
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:11,120
the domestic and Japanese auto industry

232
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:14,800
or the production the innovation economy

233
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:19,839
study about 10 years ago where we asked

234
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:22,000
and affirmed the question uh Is

235
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,680
manufacturing necessary for innovation?

236
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,399
In other words, product and process

237
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:29,519
innovation go so deeply handinand. And

238
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:32,160
of course, in MIT's DNA, and one reason

239
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:34,640
you all are here today is MIT's emphasis

240
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,240
on taking technology to the world

241
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,320
through industry partnerships and

242
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,720
through startup companies. And I've seen

243
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,200
in my 12 years on the faculty here an

244
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,440
immense growth in student and faculty

245
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,560
interest in not only creating

246
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:51,200
manufacturing oriented startups with new

247
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:54,399
manufacturing technologies and new you

248
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:57,120
know uh uh productivity approaches but

249
00:10:54,399 --> 00:11:02,399
also in understanding how manufacturing

250
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:05,920
fits into the critical path to scale of

251
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:08,800
technologies in energy, biotechnology,

252
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:12,160
electronics and more

253
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:14,959
and we started the initiative not by

254
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:18,079
honestly a a

255
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:21,279
top level strategic decision of MIT but

256
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:23,040
bottom up by building a community of

257
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,959
faculty of students with a strong

258
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:30,160
interest in manufacturing and figuring

259
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:33,519
out what should MIT do to contribute to

260
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:36,480
this important need for society and

261
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:39,040
we've held some really amazing events

262
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,279
hosting Morris Chang, the founder and

263
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,160
CEO of TSMC

264
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:46,800
uh and also an MIT alum at our launch

265
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,399
event in May with JB Strable, co-founder

266
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,120
of Tesla and now leading Redwood

267
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:53,839
Materials, which is uh developing a

268
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,320
circular workflow for battery recycling.

269
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,959
Uh and most recently, our event focused

270
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,640
on the defense industrial base with

271
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:03,920
startup leaders and executives from

272
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:07,200
established companies.

273
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:09,839
Now being an MITwide initiative, the INM

274
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,440
is one of a handful of strategic

275
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,519
initiatives and perhaps you've heard

276
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,560
about these if not today in another

277
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:19,440
venue. Reporting into the provost and

278
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:22,160
the president is a family of initiatives

279
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,079
including MIT's climate project, the

280
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,480
health and life sciences collaborative

281
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:28,240
called heels and the genative AI

282
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,320
consortium which goes by the acronym

283
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,920
magic. And the initiative for new

284
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:36,800
manufacturing for INM is in that family

285
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,480
and as a result of its centrality you

286
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:42,079
could say as a strategic initiative

287
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:45,040
means we have by definition an MITwide

288
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:47,760
mandate and MITwide reach and I'm one of

289
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,360
four faculty co-leads alongside Suzanne

290
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:52,320
Burer an institute professor and

291
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,839
political scientist Chris Love professor

292
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,079
in chemical engineering with a

293
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,760
particular focus on biio manufacturing

294
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,959
and professor Karen Zang who's a

295
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,600
professor in the Sloan School of

296
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:03,360
Management and focus on supply chains.

297
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,839
And our steering committee, our kind of

298
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,839
internal advisory board is chaired by

299
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:10,800
Paula Hammond, executive vice provost

300
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,079
and Rick Lockach, the dean of the Sloan

301
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:16,079
School of Management. And I go through

302
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:17,839
this to to to to articulate how for MIT

303
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:21,120
manufacturing is an institutewide effort

304
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,720
and the uh real impact I think will come

305
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,560
through collaboration between

306
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,600
disciplines, technology and social

307
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:30,079
sciences, technology and management. uh

308
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:33,040
and let us therefore make impact and

309
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:35,839
educate students across scales.

310
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:40,399
We have four themes uh four crosscutting

311
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:43,519
themes again uh agnostic to industry

312
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:46,320
manufacturing technologies and systems

313
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:49,680
elevating productivity and experience

314
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,839
scaling new manufacturing as I defined

315
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:55,680
earlier on and transforming the

316
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:58,240
manufacturing base. Collectively, these

317
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:01,680
speak to

318
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,839
work in our labs, bringing work from lab

319
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,399
to market, understanding how

320
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,760
technologies and humans work together

321
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,959
more effectively to increase

322
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:13,839
productivity to amplify human capability

323
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:17,040
as well as intentionally addressing

324
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,959
enterprises at all scales, small,

325
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,639
medium, large enterprises across the

326
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:23,120
manufacturing ecosystem in the US and

327
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,880
beyond. We have a number of program

328
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,199
areas and I'll highlight a few of those

329
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,760
for you today. The first is what we're

330
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:33,680
calling new manufacturing research and

331
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:35,920
this is a look at at uh exemplars in

332
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:39,040
manufacturing across industries and then

333
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:43,920
look into what questions can MIT answer

334
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:46,160
to help uncover best practices and help

335
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,639
learn how technology and organizations

336
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,079
go together in the future. So in a very

337
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,839
quick fashion, some things we've learned

338
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:55,040
through different studies are, for

339
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,639
example, what makes the latest electric

340
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,040
vehicle companies such as Tesla and

341
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:02,240
Rivian in the US unique. Well, here are

342
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:04,160
examples where manufacturing is achieved

343
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,000
uh at a worldclass level, it takes some

344
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,320
time, but by building brand new

345
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,160
manufacturing, by building new plants,

346
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,079
and there's a huge emphasis on

347
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,519
softwaredefined manufacturing. These

348
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:16,079
companies and their veterans who've

349
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:18,560
dispersed across other industries talk

350
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:21,040
about the role of software and

351
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,839
automation in enabling rapid changes to

352
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:26,079
products and process.

353
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:28,560
Back to Lego, right? I talked about the

354
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:30,800
Lego brick at the beginning. Here you

355
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,440
have, you know, from an architecture

356
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:36,160
perspective, something much less complex

357
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:39,600
than an electric vehicle, but incredible

358
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:43,040
efficiency in quality in supply chain

359
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:45,920
and exacting tolerances for simple

360
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:48,720
products, but uniformity of those

361
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:51,279
capabilities across a global supply

362
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:54,959
chain with regional nodes. And it's very

363
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:58,480
interesting to learn how

364
00:15:54,959 --> 00:16:00,160
LEGO goes from idea to production,

365
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,399
combines the market need with the

366
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,160
capability of their supply chain to

367
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,000
ultimately create products that define

368
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,959
new experiences.

369
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,000
There are also industries such as craft

370
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:13,440
brewing that are more like local modular

371
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,959
manufacturing. The craft brewing

372
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,120
industry, which has grown significantly

373
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:19,519
in the US over the past decade, is an

374
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:22,000
example of local economies in action.

375
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:25,680
There are 8,000 or more craft breweries

376
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,560
of beer in the US. Essentially a modular

377
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:31,839
biio manufacturing process. And here you

378
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:34,880
have examples of short adaptable supply

379
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:38,240
chains and flexibility and agility to

380
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:41,120
change market demands.

381
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,720
And last but not least, uh our

382
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,880
colleagues at Sloan, including Professor

383
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:48,240
Fiona Murray, have taken a deep dive

384
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:50,399
into drone technology and in particular

385
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,880
how the example of the conflict between

386
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:56,000
Ukraine and Russia also reveals very

387
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:58,720
interesting insights about innovation

388
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,759
ecosystems, right? the fact that lowcost

389
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:05,760
drones largely lean on the established

390
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:07,520
supply chains in China uh and the

391
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:10,000
ability to interchange standard

392
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:13,120
components and core technologies makes

393
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,039
innovation so affordable and so rapid

394
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,959
and there's interesting questions of

395
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:19,360
what happens in the next generation of

396
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,520
this model how big could the scale get

397
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:24,559
and how could this model be applied or

398
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:26,720
be be incompatible with uh development

399
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:29,360
of other other products going forward

400
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:32,160
forward

401
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:36,160
and I also pause and reflect on you know

402
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:39,200
the power of new companies to uh

403
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:41,039
take new perspectives on established

404
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,520
technologies and industries. So I know

405
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:45,120
you'll hear about many uh great startups

406
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,440
in the next session through the startup

407
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:50,160
exchange. Uh a company I've gotten to

408
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,240
know over the past uh year or so uh is

409
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,160
focused on metal casting. uh metal

410
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,960
casting being one of the you know

411
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:59,280
largest uh manufacturing processes for

412
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:02,720
making parts ranging from like jet

413
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:06,160
engine turbine blades to drain covers on

414
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:08,640
the street. uh and uh a very young

415
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:11,280
company called Fabri started by Steven

416
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,280
Davis who's a recent bachelor's graduate

417
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,440
from mechanical engineering who's did

418
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:18,080
some internships in the space industry

419
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:21,360
is attempting to reimagine the workflow

420
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:23,520
for metal casting combining established

421
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,200
expertise right folks who know how to

422
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,480
cast metal parts and know all the

423
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,679
problems that can't be written down

424
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,520
easily with a digital workflow 3D

425
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:34,880
printing of a model what's called the

426
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:37,280
core for the investment casting process

427
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,200
as well as advanced simulation that

428
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,840
allows them to simulate the casting

429
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,000
process before they make a single part.

430
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,160
And the company is very early in its

431
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,320
journey, but it's an example of this

432
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,640
combination of new and old that I feel

433
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,559
is very beautiful. And they're able to

434
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,840
significantly shorten the time it takes

435
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:58,240
to go from input from a company to the

436
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:00,880
finished part and therefore push the

437
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:04,160
existing supply chain.

438
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:06,799
So combining uh all of these examples

439
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:09,120
right we're looking at what are the

440
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:11,039
crosscutting themes right there's no one

441
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,200
example for how manufacturing works

442
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:16,000
across different industries but we can

443
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:18,559
learn a lot from the comparison and the

444
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,360
limit cases between examples right where

445
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:23,440
is manufacturing going giga where is

446
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,919
manufacturing going micro or going

447
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:28,880
modular and more deployed and what is

448
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,559
the balance between you know uh to use

449
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:34,080
you know defense techn technology as an

450
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:36,080
example here between the multi-deade

451
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,320
engineering flagships and agile

452
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,000
innovation quick iteration and we feel

453
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:43,200
there's a number of crosscutting themes

454
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,880
to be studied financial models firm and

455
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,919
industry structure how knowledge is

456
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,520
centralized and distributed and what co

457
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,520
limits the pace of innovation and the

458
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:54,080
adoption of new manufacturing

459
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:56,880
technologies

460
00:19:54,080 --> 00:20:00,400
without more details one of our initial

461
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:02,960
activities in the in the INM M has been

462
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:06,720
to fund a series of white papers to fund

463
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:09,360
faculty to define and answer questions

464
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:12,240
related to for instance how can

465
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:14,400
automation team with humans for high

466
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,840
mixed low volume production in

467
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:20,400
activities such as repair and

468
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:23,600
maintenance or how are large firms

469
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:26,400
viewing decarbonization these days and

470
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:28,400
the business value of it uh and

471
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,080
combining you know profitability

472
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,520
emission measure measurement, corporate

473
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:35,679
strategy and pol policy uh incentives

474
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:38,240
and these white papers and others will

475
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:40,799
be published as a collection in the

476
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,280
first half of 2026.

477
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:47,679
We also have a deep focus on education

478
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:49,840
and workforce uh both on campus and to

479
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:52,480
broader audiences which I feel is an

480
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:55,200
increasingly important part of MIT's

481
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:58,400
core mission.

482
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,559
We've looked systematically at a span of

483
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:04,000
education and manufacturing from campus

484
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:05,840
to the workforce at scale. Uh so we of

485
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,760
course have courses and degree programs

486
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:11,039
on campus in mechanical engineering. Our

487
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,559
students make a 100 yo-yos uh each uh

488
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:15,840
and go through the whole design to

489
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:18,720
manufacturing process. And we have

490
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:20,720
workforce training programs focused on

491
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,200
community college audiences. Dr. John

492
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,520
Louu leads the Techamp program which is

493
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,840
deploying out into a network of

494
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:31,280
community colleges in the United States

495
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:33,520
uh and hoping to take nationwide. And

496
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,760
alongside of the traditional way of

497
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,760
teaching manufacturing hands-on which I

498
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:42,600
feel should never go away, we have to

499
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,600
think of how we can bring more

500
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:46,720
visualization

501
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:49,280
digital rich content into students and

502
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,360
out to broader audiences. So there's big

503
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:54,640
efforts on using augmented and virtual

504
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:56,720
reality to for instance enable students

505
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,600
whether at MIT or halfway around the

506
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:02,159
world to do virtual product disassembly.

507
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:06,120
Uh and on the bottom right which comes

508
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,120
here uh

509
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,960
virtual machine shop training. So this

510
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,799
is an activity that we're prototyping in

511
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,400
our machine shop where before our

512
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:16,320
undergraduates

513
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,559
step into the shop and learn to use a

514
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,960
milling machine as first or second year

515
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:24,000
undergrads they take a virtual training

516
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:26,320
and they're able to follow instructions

517
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,120
and go through a process flow and also

518
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:31,280
fail also make mistakes and uh we think

519
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:34,720
that's a really interesting new paradigm

520
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:36,960
also to study the pedagogy of we have a

521
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,480
a large course in mechi focused on AI

522
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,240
and machine learning for engineering

523
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,799
design. So not just manufacturing but

524
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,559
design and colleagues uh such as

525
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:46,640
professor Brian Anthony who've developed

526
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:49,840
a kit-based approach for kind of

527
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:52,240
portable learning of AIdriven datadriven

528
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,080
manufacturing principles. This FRED

529
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,840
device stands for fiber extrusion

530
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,159
device. So, it uses the extrusion of

531
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,080
polymer fiber as a test bed to

532
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,159
understand and control manufacturing

533
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,799
processes where a group of students

534
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:07,120
could have this $200 kit sitting next to

535
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:09,360
them or it could be remotely connected

536
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,679
through the internet.

537
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:14,159
So, as I move toward uh the end here, my

538
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:16,320
last section is a short perspective on

539
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:20,400
where AI is headed for design and

540
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:23,520
manufacturing. uh and we uh wrote a

541
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:26,720
perspective in 2024

542
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:29,679
which you can look up here on where we

543
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,520
feel AI is headed from the current state

544
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:33,919
which is moving very quickly to a future

545
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:38,159
state where artificial intelligence is

546
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:42,080
multimodal involves you know real-time

547
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:44,480
data text images video and also combines

548
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:47,039
with simulation engineering tools and

549
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,640
human knowledge and outlined a series of

550
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:51,360
capabilities that we hope in the future

551
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,840
AI could be impactful for throughout the

552
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:56,159
design and manufacturing workflow. And a

553
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,799
related question uh that is being

554
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:01,200
actively researched today is how can we

555
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:03,039
develop AI models for manufacturing

556
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,679
environments within companies or across

557
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:08,000
supply chains that enable secure cross

558
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:11,120
learning? Can we take advantage of

559
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,279
federated learning approaches to train

560
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:15,279
uh local models and then contribute to

561
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,640
global models that can advance

562
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:18,640
collective understanding of

563
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,880
manufacturing processes? Could the

564
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,559
injection molding company of the future

565
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,640
rapidly identify their process

566
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:27,440
conditions by subscribing to a global

567
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:30,559
model that would be that would learn

568
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:33,039
from data sources without breaking the

569
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:35,840
security of that data.

570
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:38,720
And there's many examples of research

571
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:41,279
across the spectrum at MIT. work on

572
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,039
creating virtual quality sensors uh

573
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:45,679
that's deployed to manufacturing

574
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:48,960
facilities. Automating sequence planning

575
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:51,120
for assembly operations,

576
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,440
work on robotics from collaborative

577
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:57,679
robotics to

578
00:24:53,440 --> 00:25:00,000
dextrous manipulation uh as well as

579
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:03,679
developing physics-based digital twins

580
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,520
for biioarma for automated manufacturing

581
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:07,679
processes and so on. So it's a very very

582
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,840
rich area where I feel we can contribute

583
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:12,320
a lot going forward and you may so know

584
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:15,600
know some of this research already. An

585
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:17,679
example from my own work uh connected to

586
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,720
my lab's expertise in 3D printing or

587
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:23,360
additive manufacturing is an effort to

588
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:26,640
use a machine learning driven pipeline

589
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:29,200
to identify aluminum alloys that are

590
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,520
uniquely suited for use in 3D printing.

591
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:34,000
And we discovered a set of alloys that

592
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,760
appear to have higher strength than

593
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,039
established conventional aluminum

594
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:41,600
alloys. And importantly, uh the

595
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:44,320
discovery process included manufacturing

596
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:46,480
constraints upstream. So we're able to

597
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,720
start with 500,000 combinations, right?

598
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:52,400
a number that you the human mind or

599
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:54,960
manual uh computation couldn't handle

600
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,640
and ended with a small number of

601
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,679
candidates and only one that we tested

602
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:02,159
and verified at the end with actual 3D

603
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:04,080
printing and we're also working with

604
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:06,480
professor Fiazamemed's group who was the

605
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:10,640
lead author of that perspective on how

606
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:13,919
we can train multimodal models to uh

607
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:17,120
help in the reverse engineering process.

608
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:19,039
Can AI generate and recognize parametric

609
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,960
CAD data? Very important in an

610
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:24,080
engineering and manufacturing process

611
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:27,600
such that we could have a tool that can

612
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:29,840
scan any arbitrary 3D geometry like a

613
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:32,240
bracket or a gear and create a

614
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,840
parametric CAD model that is editable

615
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,679
that can be re-engineered, can be

616
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:38,080
scaled, can be remanufactured. And we

617
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:40,159
haven't quite sliced that problem yet,

618
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,840
but we've made important progress to

619
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:46,240
date.

620
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:51,120
This huge footprint and enthusiasm in uh

621
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:53,760
AI for manufacturing has prompted us to

622
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:56,720
identify a set of themes

623
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:58,720
manufacturing focused robotics agentic

624
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,200
AI for manufacturing process

625
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,600
intelligence control knowledge synthesis

626
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,840
from multimodal data uh and the

627
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:08,640
remaining list and issue a call for

628
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:11,919
proposals across MIT where we got about

629
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,039
50 ideas in a span of three weeks. and

630
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:16,080
we're going to be able to through the

631
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:18,880
initiative fund about 8 to 10 projects

632
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:21,600
uh and then you'll hear more about those

633
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:23,440
if you follow us going forward. And last

634
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,360
but not least, I apologize for the

635
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,000
perhaps overt plug, but we do have a

636
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,600
very uh

637
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,039
fundamental way that we're working with

638
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,159
industry within the manufacturing

639
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,240
initiative and that's through a

640
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,919
consortium structure. We have seven

641
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,600
founding members that we announced in

642
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,520
July and the members of the

643
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,679
manufacturing initiative are engaging in

644
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,520
all the activities I describe and more.

645
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:46,000
The support from those companies has

646
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:48,640
directly informed the themes that we

647
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,559
identified for AI and automation

648
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,320
research. The companies are deeply

649
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:54,240
engaged in education and workforce

650
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:57,840
development and participating in

651
00:27:54,240 --> 00:28:00,320
deployment of the technologist program

652
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,159
at their manufacturing sites and

653
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,159
dialogue with the companies is informing

654
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,080
our research and providing opportunities

655
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:08,080
to meet with and recruit students. So

656
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,640
I'm very happy to hear if you have

657
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:12,960
comments, questions on the initiative as

658
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,720
well as ways that we might be able to

659
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,960
understand your needs and explore how to

660
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,039
work together. Uh, and I'll stop there

661
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:23,320
and if time permits would love to take a

662
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:23,320
question or two. One question.

663
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,840
>> I'm going to take the first one. Uh,

664
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,600
thank you anonymous. How does computer

665
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:33,520
simulated virtual training videos

666
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,600
improve over standard video training? So

667
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,520
that's actually a question we are we are

668
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:40,240
focused on answering doing the research

669
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:42,720
to say between a cohort of individuals

670
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,559
who've done the ARVR training and then

671
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,799
the conventional training versus just

672
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:49,200
the conventional training is the

673
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:51,440
knowledge retention is the ability to

674
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,760
solve problems is the time it takes just

675
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:56,000
to get through it all different and are

676
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:58,000
there statistical significancees and

677
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,919
differences or not and and and maybe the

678
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,679
answer is you know some things are are

679
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:07,080
are improved and some things are not

680
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:07,080
improved for our uh our our less

681
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,360
can the US onshore manufacturing be

682
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,120
competed on global marketplace I think

683
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:15,360
so but not in all categories the new

684
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:17,440
manufacturing is not the manufacturing

685
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:20,080
of old and it's not that everything can

686
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,159
and should come back it's about

687
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:24,960
technologydriven manufacturing to

688
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:27,840
differentiate and to enable more

689
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,760
productive output uh and that's a a

690
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,840
question that uh you know we're just

691
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:34,415
starting to to think about as

692
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:36,435
Thank you.

693
00:29:34,415 --> 00:29:36,435
[applause]
