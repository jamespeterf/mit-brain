1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,720
Good morning. My name is Stephen Palmer.

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:06,240
I am with MIT's Office of Corporate

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,240
Relations and I'm honored to kick off

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,160
today's event.

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,759
Um, the next generation of global

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:16,000
communications isn't just about faster,

7
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,240
smarter relation. Uh, sorry, let me

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,680
start again.

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,080
The next generation of global

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,920
communications isn't just about faster

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,240
connections.

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,720
It's about smarter relationships between

13
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,480
people, machines, and data.

14
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,880
We're entering an era where networks

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,160
will sense, predict, and adapt in real

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,160
time, where connectivity becomes

17
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,760
contextaware.

18
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,440
This shift means the internet will no

19
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,640
longer be a static infrastructure we

20
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:47,039
use, but dynamic and one that learns

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,960
from us and about us.

22
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,039
The same networks that can bring fun and

23
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,840
frivolity will bring precision

24
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:56,559
agriculture to rural Africa. Real-time

25
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,840
tele medicine to remote villages,

26
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:01,680
situational awareness the military will

27
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,359
um will use while also amplifying

28
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,880
misinformation

29
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:10,799
or entrenching digital inequality.

30
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:12,960
The next decade will test our just not

31
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,799
our engineering skills but our wisdom,

32
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,560
our ability to build systems that are

33
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,560
technically brilliant and socially

34
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,840
resilient.

35
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,759
And yet the future of global

36
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,600
communications won't be defined by any

37
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,200
single technology.

38
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,720
It'll be shaped by the quality of

39
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,920
collaboration.

40
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,479
That's something I'll come back to

41
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,640
later. Between the people in this room,

42
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,320
industry, academia, and startup

43
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,000
ecosystems.

44
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,079
We're moving toward networks that are

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,640
intelligent, adaptive, and deeply

46
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:43,520
intertwined with human behavior both

47
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,200
quantitatively and qualitatively.

48
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,159
systems that not only connect devices

49
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,000
but mediate trust, privacy, and

50
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,000
opportunity across every corner of the

51
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,280
world.

52
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,960
Understanding the challenges and

53
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,040
opportunities that lie ahead requires

54
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,799
both perspectives.

55
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,799
Academia and our startup founders bring

56
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,680
the long view and the curiosity to

57
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:06,000
explore what's possible, while industry

58
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,560
brings the urgency, the scale, and the

59
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,479
practical insight

60
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,160
into how innovations take root in

61
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,400
society.

62
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,000
When these worlds engage meaningfully,

63
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,200
we don't just make the internet faster

64
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,640
and safer, we make it wiser. We build an

65
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,959
infrastructure that reflects not just

66
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,319
what technology can do, but what

67
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:28,640
humanity needs it to do.

68
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,400
I'm leaving MIT in a few days for

69
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,920
another opportunity. And someone asked

70
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,280
me recently, what have you learned over

71
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,879
the last decade?

72
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,040
After a few months moments of

73
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:41,599
introspection, I stole a line from our

74
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,360
former colleague Randle Wright and said

75
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,480
the power of discourse between the type

76
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:49,040
of people in this room.

77
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:52,319
So I'm defining discourse as discussion

78
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,400
and debate. We should not shy away from

79
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:58,319
speaking to people with different views

80
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,599
as it is the only way that we better

81
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,680
understand the opportunities and

82
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:04,159
challenges that lie ahead. I've

83
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,000
witnessed cutting edge research in the

84
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:09,920
internet of things when that was a a

85
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,400
term. Uh digitization, AI, sustainable

86
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,400
steel making processes, fast and

87
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,959
inexpensive medical diagnostic tools,

88
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,640
imaging of a black hole, the creation of

89
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,720
high temperature superconducting

90
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,319
electromagnets

91
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,440
and an instrument to produce oxygen on

92
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,120
the Mars the size of a lunchbox.

93
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,239
All these inventions, innovations

94
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,720
require scientific inquiry and rigor,

95
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,599
discussion, investment, validation.

96
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,799
Think that five stakeholder model. I

97
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,040
urge all of you to leverage this

98
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,640
platform that is corporate relations to

99
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,879
further your research, development, and

100
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:47,287
commercialization of technology that

101
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:49,307
will shape the way we live. Thank you.

102
00:03:47,287 --> 00:03:49,307
[applause]

103
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,760
Now, it's my pleasure to introduce Dr.

104
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,599
Dr. David Clark, senior research

105
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,159
scientist at the MIT Computer Science

106
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,840
and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.

107
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,519
For over five decades, David has been

108
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,080
one of the key architects behind the

109
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,360
internet as we know it. From his early

110
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,439
work shaping the protocols that

111
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,439
connected the world's first networks to

112
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,280
his ongoing research at the intersection

113
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,840
of technology, economics, and human

114
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,439
behavior, his insights have continually

115
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,079
helped redefine how we think about

116
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,359
connectivity and innovation. Today,

117
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,680
he'll take us on a journey through the

118
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,960
internet's evolution from days of

119
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,680
mainframes to today's world of

120
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,680
broadband, mobile, and things, and share

121
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,639
what he's learned about the forces, both

122
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:33,520
technical and human, that truly drive

123
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,520
progression.
