00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,840
there's nothing sacred about the

3
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,600
six-foot rule in some cases it's

4
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,120
inadequate and in other cases it's

5
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,120
overly conservative problem with any

6
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:11,400
measure quantitative measure limits one

7
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,880
variable is it's neglecting the

8
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,799
interaction between these variables if

9
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,160
you have really high ventilation maybe

10
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:19,119
you can have more people by analyzing

11
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,320
the available spreading data from Super

12
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,119
spreading incidents where the physical

13
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,960
characteristics of the rooms are known

14
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,679
to come up with quantitative guidelines

15
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,160
to say as a function of the various

16
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:31,880
parameters in a certain space what is

17
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,399
the actual risk it's not enough just to

18
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,800
qualitatively say oh you should open the

19
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,719
windows or you should increase

20
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,320
ventilation well how much what if we

21
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:42,039
already have a lot of ventilation do

22
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:44,079
anym and how many people can really be

23
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:45,760
in that room safely and for how long the

24
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,480
devil's in the details if you can't put

25
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,399
a number on these things then nobody

26
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:53,039
knows how to act for more MIT moments
