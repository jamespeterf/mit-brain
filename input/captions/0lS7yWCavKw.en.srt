2
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:20,480
is Michael cubert and I'm the professor

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:23,840
of a classa MIT 21m 383 computational

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,359

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:29,000
that you're going to be joining us in

6
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:32,399
this course and it's just absolutely

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,600
great to have people learning about how

8
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,600
computers can help understand music and

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,800
especially music theory from throughout

10
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,440
the

11
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:44,600
world I'm making this recording about a

12
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:47,559
year after the class is done to welcome

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,760
you and to say a few things along the

14
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:52,680
way throughout the class the first thing

15
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,920
I wanted to let you know is we had some

16
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,039
technical difficulties on the first day

17
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:01,079
and so you'll see that the lecture sort

18
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:03,400
of begins a few minutes in and and that

19
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:07,320
the video quality especially of the

20
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:09,360
Powerpoints and my live coding isn't up

21
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,360
to the Quality we would like to have so

22
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,920

23
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,960
things here and there and when you see

24
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:18,080

25
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,000
