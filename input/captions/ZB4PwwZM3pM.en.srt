check the mic um yeah my name is Ken pan

50
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:59,439
I'm from Boston I grew up in right

51
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,960
across the river in Brooklyn and my

52
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,799
background before Sloan is that I was

53
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:06,039
working in the Biotech Industry so I

54
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:08,640
created a company as a co-founder called

55
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:10,200
adene which distributes DNA samples for

56
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,800
life scientists and then I was Chief

57
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,040
Operating Officer of a venture back

58
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:16,080
biotech company for a couple years

59
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,599
before Sloan um and I think we'll get

60
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,560
into some of the reasons of why I chose

61
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:23,080
Sloan um after that but um currently I'm

62
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,360
working for a wearable tech company um

63
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,239
Selena I don't know how much more

64
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,920
information background you think is

65
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,280
useful now or do you want to keep it

66
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:33,120
that short for this inro um actually

67
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,400
yeah so why don't we do I guess name

68
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,560
program year I guess career before and

69
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:41,760
after Sloan um and then maybe like one

70
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,560
high level reason why you chose

71
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:48,440
Sloan yeah so um I did the the Sloan

72
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:50,760
fellows MBA program um in graduating in

73
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,800
in 21 I actually did a visiting fellows

74
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:56,239
session after that for an additional six

75
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,959
months um and we can go into more detail

76
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,480
but the main reason I chose Sloan is

77
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:01,720
that I wanted to Pivot out of the

78
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:04,560
biotech tech industry I wanted um um I

79
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:07,560
was in my M midcareer um wanted to

80
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,080
actually in explore some new technology

81
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,840
fields that were were not life science

82
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,319
um also wanted a break from you know

83
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,239
being in in biotech for a long time for

84
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:20,000
over 10 years and I wanted to be

85
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:21,560
immersed in the Sloan community so I I

86
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,680
looked at the EMA program I looked at

87
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:27,560
Sloan fellows I really wanted to be um

88
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:30,720
you know resident full-time um at at

89
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:33,480
Sloan and I hadn't done a NBA before so

90
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,319
I I really was looking for an MBA degree

91
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,640
and I really only applied to Sloan um

92
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:38,200
because it really matched my needs I

93
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,239
also want to stay in the Boston area

94
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,760
with the tech focus it was um absolutely

95
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,080
perfect for what I was looking for at

96
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,760
the time

97
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,159
awesome thanks kenon um next up can we

98
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,480
have

99
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:54,720
Ana sure yeah hey everyone so great to

100
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,239
uh I gu see you all virtually um I'm an

101
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,959
Nia originally from San Diego California

102
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:01,840
I was the master of business analytics

103
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:05,599
class of 20 to um so about almost two

104
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,200
years now um I'm prior to Sloan I

105
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,720
actually completed my undergrad in

106
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,799
computer science and cognitive science

107
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,159
at UC Berkeley um kind of had decided I

108
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:15,400
wanted to do more of the computer

109
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:17,359
science software side of things um and

110
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,720
then decided um you know soon after my

111
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,280
senior year that I actually wanted to

112
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,800
Pivot um and wanted to go back to school

113
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,400
um and get myself more involved in

114
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,440
analytics and data science which is what

115
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,759
brought me to the mband um I'm currently

116
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,880
working at Warner Brothers Discovery as

117
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:35,759
a senior data scientist um out of New

118
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:38,360
York City um I think you said one one

119
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:41,120
reason that I chose Sloan so the mban

120
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,479
program um was very special at least the

121
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,600
time that I was applying and and

122
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:47,600
actually I think still is um we had the

123
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:49,280
Capstone which was um a six month or

124
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,479
like about six to nine month duration

125
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,280
project where we get to work handson

126
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:56,160
with companies doing data science

127
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,560
projects and um it's a really unique

128
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,080
program and unique structure given um a

129
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,720
lot of the stuff you learn you can

130
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,160
actually apply in a real context um and

131
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,000
a lot of the projects that we worked on

132
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,479
you know made it to production um and so

133
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,080
we're able to get kind of an idea of

134
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,960
what it's like to deploy real data

135
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,840
science models um and you know analytics

136
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,360
um in the context of um corporate um

137
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,319
corporate environment as well so it's a

138
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:23,680
little bit about myself um but yeah

139
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:27,560
happy to pass it on thanks Ana uh

140
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:30,560
Katherine hey uh Katherine um NBA

141
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:33,160
2021 uh was in New York working before

142
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,199
coming to Sloan and now in Boston um so

143
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,280
prior to Sloan um I started my career in

144
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,240
finance so was an investment banker for

145
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,880
a bit and then transition of private

146
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,759
Equity um and then decided I wanted to

147
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:47,360
go into industry and so went to fizer's

148
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:49,039
business development team um and kind of

149
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,080
similar to Ken kind of worked in this

150
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:54,440
biofarma Biotech Industry um decided I

151
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,800
wanted to take some time off um to go to

152
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,960
school I at that point i' been working

153
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,639
for six years so probably on the like

154
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,240
kind of on the cut of what I thought um

155
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:08,360
of when I wanted to take that break in

156
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:10,759
my career to go to school um and uh kind

157
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:13,120
of at that point I sort of knew what I

158
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:15,280
wanted after Sloan um and so I knew I

159
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,120
wanted to work in the Biotech Industry

160
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,360
um I wanted to be kind of you know in

161
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,199
Boston at the Epic Center of Biotech um

162
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,160
and I wanted a more technical education

163
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,840
given kind of already the finance

164
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,919
business background I wasn't looking for

165
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:29,000
more Finance related coursework I was

166
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:30,360
actually looking more towards kind of a

167
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
data analy

168
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,880
um drug discovery type classes and so I

169
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,120
sort of narrowed down my search that way

170
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:40,720
um so came to Sloan and then I actually

171
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:43,120
like 75% of my education was actually

172
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,720
during covid uh so it was a lot of

173
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,599
online classes and small group

174
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,960
socialization um and then upon

175
00:06:47,599 --> 00:06:51,880
graduating Sloan I joined um a

176
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:54,319
five-person team building an oncology

177
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,879
startup um and we're currently on our

178
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,039
way to raising series C so I've been

179
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:59,199
there for the last three years kind of

180
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:01,120
just helping build out the company um

181
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,560
and so that's been a really rewarding

182
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,479
Journey so you know happy to chat about

183
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,080
kind of big corporate life or small

184
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:11,759
biotech

185
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,759
life thanks Katherine and then

186
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:19,319
hu hi everyone uh my name is Hu Kim I'm

187
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,960
an El class of 22 great to see you all

188
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:24,080
uh be first Alan I was working as an

189
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:27,240
engineer at Nasa building the mar Rover

190
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,639
that is currently there um currently I

191
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,000
work at a private Equity Firm called

192
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,120
American industrial partner ERS and one

193
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,759
reason why I chose flone was uh at the

194
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,520
time I was trying to further my

195
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:38,080
engineering education and also learn

196
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,879
more about the management business side

197
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,319
of the world which I had zero exposure

198
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:44,319
to and there was no place like MIT where

199
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:47,599
they really coupled that at a high high

200
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:50,919
degree of um expertise like they did at

201
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:52,639
MIT specifically the AL program so

202
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:55,440
that's why I joined being in a Boston

203
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:57,080
area was also big plus and I DJ my time

204
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,120
there thoroughly even though I was also

205
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:03,479
Co class and lost most of my time but it

206
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:06,159
was fantastic so awesome thanks um so I

207
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:08,080
think one uh question that we want to

208
00:08:06,159 --> 00:08:11,240
talk about is the community at Sloan and

209
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,400
so there's this whole I guess culture of

210
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,479
like sonies helping sonies um I'm

211
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,759
wearing the Asian-American Alliance like

212
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:20,240
Swig or sweatshirt that we have

213
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,440
available for um like during the school

214
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,639
year so I guess my first question is

215
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:26,560
around the community at Sloan so could

216
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,120
you describe the community that you had

217
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:32,519
at Sloan and maybe any areas that you

218
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:35,120
were in involved in um and maybe we can

219
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:38,080
start with Catherine because I think you

220
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,000
were also involved in I guess um the

221
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,080
Asian-American Alliance the healthc care

222
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,600
club and swim which is the women in

223
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:48,160
management club yeah um that's right so

224
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,640
I was also um I think with Ken one of

225
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,920
the co-presidents of the Asian-American

226
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:53,519
liance so we were we were really afraid

227
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,320
it was going to die during covid so I'm

228
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,920
really really happy that you're keeping

229
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,360
it going um but it was you know I

230
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,920
remember first semester um

231
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:05,279
before Co shut everything down it was

232
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:06,920
super fun like we always had um you know

233
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:10,040
like we had get togethers we had

234
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:12,079
potlucks uh we had like a big ski trip

235
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:15,399
um and I think you know I would just

236
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:17,279
describe the community as just very um I

237
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:19,079
guess very close-knit and very low ego

238
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,320
which I like which I you know don't

239
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:21,360
think is necessarily true for every

240
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,279
single business school I think every

241
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,640
business school has their own

242
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:27,560
personality um and I like that the crowd

243
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:29,839
that I kind of gravitated to was kind of

244
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:32,600
you know like nerdy a little bit quirk

245
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,760
really funloving um kind of like you

246
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,279
know really

247
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,839
hardworking um type of people and I

248
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:41,680
thought you know that was like very

249
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:45,120
similar to um to myself um you know I

250
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:47,000
think in terms of um how I continue to

251
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,360
be involved in the community um I would

252
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,480
say from a professional standpoint um

253
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,360
you know you mentioned the healthcare

254
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,920
Club that's been really helpful

255
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,440
throughout my career so actually my

256
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,079
current job that I that I found that I

257
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,440
quite frankly think it's a little bit of

258
00:09:58,079 --> 00:10:02,279
a once a-lifetime career opportunity at

259
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,920
least at this early stage I mean that

260
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:05,519
was not posted anywhere and I wouldn't

261
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,959
have found that if it weren't for a SL

262
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,240
introducing me to you know Executives

263
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:12,880
who worked at that company and I I fully

264
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,160
credit the Sloan network with that um

265
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,720
and I think you know even when I was

266
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,800
recruiting um I wasn't going down the

267
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,360
traditional path of you know rotation

268
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,760
program or applying through career um

269
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,880
the career site and so there was a lot

270
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,880
of um you know leveraging the healthc

271
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,839
care Alumni network as well as the club

272
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,120
members

273
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,760
um you know leveraging like people who

274
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,839
were local to Boston people who were

275
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,040
Consultants who like knew every company

276
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:41,120
there and so um and I I think today I

277
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:43,120
still do make use of that community so I

278
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,480
I think you know it's been um it's been

279
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,440
really great both from kind of the

280
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,079
social side despite covid um and you

281
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,880
know and also the professional

282
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:54,320
side awesome that's great to hear and

283
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:56,040
yes the triple the we call it AAA but

284
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,320
the Asian-American Alliance is Alive and

285
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:01,200
Well we have many I think we have like

286
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,360
200 people in our groups um the ski trip

287
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,000
is still happening as well and there's

288
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,959
like a very robust pipeline of events

289
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,639
I'd say maybe like two a week if like

290
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:13,480
two at the minimum a week it's it's kind

291
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:15,760
of crazy um maybe Kenneth will join will

292
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:18,120
jump to you since uh just to follow this

293
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,839
kind of like theme on yeah yeah actually

294
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:22,360
I wanted to add to cat's story I want to

295
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:25,639
give her credit for keeping triaa alive

296
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:27,279
during covid she really held the flag um

297
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:28,880
actually we graduated the same year but

298
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,880
I I mentioned I did a six-month

299
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,360
extension as visiting fellow and that's

300
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,560
when cat actually recruited me she was

301
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,440
like you have to also be one of the

302
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:40,079
co-presidents through this transition

303
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:42,160
period um so I very happy to uh to to do

304
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:45,279
that too as well and it was great to U

305
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:47,360
see triaa continue um yeah I I was very

306
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,040
involved in the organization both you

307
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,680
know with with CAD when she was

308
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,519
president and then when I helped with

309
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:54,000
the transition we had a really big

310
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:57,079
kickoff barbecue which was one of the

311
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,480
most successful um I think of any of the

312
00:11:57,079 --> 00:12:02,680
clubs that that happened that fall we

313
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:04,360
had like I think over 100 150 people out

314
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:07,040
um for for a barbecue and was really

315
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:09,160
wonderful um so I'll Echo what cat said

316
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:13,040
too as well I think Sloan is extremely

317
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:14,959
friendly um collaborative place and I I

318
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:18,199
I would say everyone's really open to be

319
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:20,160
able to you know just meet like anyone

320
00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:21,680
from any program that's something that I

321
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,079
I wasn't sure going in so I was in the

322
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,680
SL fell program I wasn't sure like how

323
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:29,560
easy it was to be able to meet slony

324
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:31,120
from the two-year program from enin from

325
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:33,040
outside of saloan just in the MIT

326
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,279
Community but MIT overall I think is

327
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,880
really approachable so actually a couple

328
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,000
of my friends that I met are you know

329
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,639
not even yet slan um you know there in

330
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,440
other programs whether CS or engineering

331
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:47,120
or um actually the IDM program which was

332
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:50,000
AC Cross School program at the time and

333
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,320
I feel like that of interaction might

334
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,120
not be common at at other schools but I

335
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:58,000
was really really grateful that to well

336
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,720
on different programs even you know cat

337
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,560
is is a good friend now and she's in the

338
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:05,000
two-year program where I was in in snba

339
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,480
and um that's something that I really

340
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,880
wanted uh with you know being resident

341
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,320
in um at Sloan versus the the Ember

342
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:14,360
program where you you kind of go part

343
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:16,480
time you don't um you don't overlap

344
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:19,720
programs um so I was really grateful for

345
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,880
that um but yeah I I would say that the

346
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:24,760
the community is is really strong and

347
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:27,199
then after graduation too as well I've

348
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:28,720
been involved in a couple different ways

349
00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:31,560
uh certainly talking to prospective

350
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,880
students and um you know both in in us

351
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,120
but actually quite a bit in Asia i'

352
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,680
actually been spending more time in Asia

353
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,000
because of family reasons and because of

354
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:41,399
work so I'm actually in um in Japan

355
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,800
right now but living mostly in Taipei

356
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:45,519
and um so I've got I've talked to a

357
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:49,360
bunch of prospective students and Alum

358
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:51,160
here in Asia and then um it I've

359
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,600
actually used the network too so

360
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:55,839
actually one of my contacts in China

361
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:58,199
recently was asking for to do sales and

362
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,360
marketing in the US in a very specific

363
00:13:58,199 --> 00:14:02,880
field in list ICS and one of my

364
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,079
classmates in SLO fellas was you know

365
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,120
exactly in that field I made that

366
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:08,279
connection and they may do a Big

367
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,800
Business Partnership together so very

368
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:11,560
happy to be able to connect people from

369
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,320
from the Sloan Community particularly

370
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:16,440
from Asia and us and that's one of my

371
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:19,000
interests too uh so it's really been um

372
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,720
wonderful I also go back to um SLO

373
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,839
fellows and embas have this opportunity

374
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:26,040
to go back for Executive Education in

375
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:27,440
January um for electives during I AP and

376
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:30,000
I've done that a couple years and found

377
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:33,360
that extremely rewarding too

378
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,320
I'll pass the mic that sounds great um

379
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,160
and N can I pass it to you about you

380
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:39,639
know describing your experience at slone

381
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:41,000
and the Zone community and and um

382
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:43,320
anything that you were involved in and

383
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,199
how that helped shape your experience

384
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,959
yeah absolutely um I can definitely

385
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:49,399
speak to the mband program at the time I

386
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:52,199
think we were around 60 around like yeah

387
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:54,759
66 65 students so relatively small class

388
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:57,040
I think compared to the other classes at

389
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:58,720
um Sloan for a year however our class

390
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,000
was incredibly tight knit I would say

391
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,839
you know the first semester at least in

392
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,560
the man program is quite difficult we

393
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,240
have to take you know I would say in

394
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:07,399
terms of academic curriculum especially

395
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,600
since a lot of students come from um a

396
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:10,680
lot of different backgrounds not

397
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:13,560
necessarily in computer science or

398
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:14,880
analytics um it's a lot of learning fast

399
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,120
learning quickly learning a lot of

400
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,079
languages um and we all really lean on

401
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,800
each other so whether that is you know

402
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:21,880
staying up pretty late to finish up

403
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,720
problem sets but then working

404
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,440
collaboratively and then um you know

405
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,519
being able to enjoy our weekends because

406
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,399
we are um you know we're leaning on each

407
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,720
other to be able to finish um you know

408
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:33,839
finish assignments um you know outside

409
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,040
of just outside of you know just

410
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:38,360
academics you know even from a

411
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:41,440
networking perspective um the mband

412
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:44,079
roots go very deep I know multiple years

413
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,880
prior to mine um the Alumni network just

414
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,519
stays strong whether it's um you know

415
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:50,000
alumni dinners or keeping going to

416
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:52,279
Capstone presentations year after year

417
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,839
um everyone stays connected to the mman

418
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:56,160
program um which is very nice um and

419
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:59,199
something that we can lean on and

420
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,800
leverage um as time goes on um one of

421
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:04,959
the one of the great things about Sloan

422
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:07,240
is my first um role out of um out of uh

423
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:10,279
the mband was actually a role that I got

424
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:12,920
through um a professor um through V

425
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:15,360
farias who um was far more technical

426
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:16,880
than I can ever be um but took a product

427
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,639
management class with him absolutely

428
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,959
loved it um and you really got to see

429
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,720
kind of the both sides of like the

430
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:23,360
technical and the non-technical side of

431
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:25,880
things and you know he was just a great

432
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,480
person to hang out with um and uh talk

433
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:29,319
about career and just everything in

434
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:32,680
general and he was actually able to help

435
00:16:29,319 --> 00:16:34,480
pivot me into my first role um outside

436
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,920
of that socially I mean during the year

437
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,440
was probably one of the best years of my

438
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,079
life had an incredible time in Boston um

439
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:42,720
originally from Cal I'm originally from

440
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:44,240
California this is my first winter um so

441
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,240
definitely had to lean on a couple of

442
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,759
the East Coasters or the Europeans who

443
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,959
had seen more snow than I had um to get

444
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:53,440
through that but um it was a lot of fun

445
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,560
and um you know I would say a good

446
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,560
number of them moved down to New York

447
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,040
City with me so I see you know a lot of

448
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,720
our classmates every single day I you

449
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,319
know we talk about different

450
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,600
methodologies that we're using at work

451
00:17:02,319 --> 00:17:06,640
and how we can apply them um you know in

452
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:08,039
the weekends a lot of my social life is

453
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,039
um you know meeting up with other M

454
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:12,160
bands from former classes and the

455
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:15,640
current class as well and and my class

456
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:17,439
so um the roots go very deep even in the

457
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,079
Alumni network but then also we stay

458
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,039
together socially and academically so

459
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:23,679
it's a good blend of both um but yeah

460
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:26,760
I'll pass it off now awesome that's

461
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:29,520
great to hear um and hu can I pass it to

462
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:31,400
you about yeah your experience as an and

463
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,720
how that kind of shaped your experience

464
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:36,080
in terms of the community and the

465
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,240
culture as well yeah of course um first

466
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,280
I'd like to Echo everything that I've

467
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:42,559
heard it's it's close-knit it's fun it's

468
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:44,679
it's just collaborative I've experienced

469
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:46,400
all the same things maybe maybe a couple

470
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:49,960
things for from my side that especially

471
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:52,160
with lgo is lgo is I mean slowo is close

472
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:54,240
nit lgo is even closer nit we're we're

473
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,559
sort of like a group on our own and we

474
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,159
have a joke that we don't make new

475
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:59,440
friends which is not true we always we

476
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:01,280
always try to go extent but you spend an

477
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,600
entire summer together with this core of

478
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:07,159
40 40 to 50 people and they really

479
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:10,159
become your family and from from my uh

480
00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:12,280
experience where I didn't have um that

481
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:14,640
much expansion outside my Asian-American

482
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:16,000
circle of social code eljo was really

483
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,840
the way for me to experience like

484
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,760
friendship with with other culture

485
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,360
International students a mother race it

486
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:24,720
it was just a very eye opening

487
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:26,840
experience and one of my closest friends

488
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,440
now it says people I red with as a kid

489
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:32,000
from Indiana and a Mexican guy from LA

490
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:34,799
and a Korean from New Jersey it's like a

491
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,640
just uh it's kind of a partnership that

492
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:40,840
you kind of don't get um my time is

493
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:42,919
slown I I was able to really utilize the

494
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:45,720
whole network I want to say so being

495
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:47,799
part of Elo I also had the access to

496
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,200
meet students not just from Sloan or the

497
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:51,120
business side of school but but also

498
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,200
within the technical side of MIT so

499
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,600
meeting with the research uh teams

500
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,440
meeting with PhD students that are

501
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,919
working on like really cool uh

502
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,240
experiment I was able to work with them

503
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,679
learn from them

504
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,640
um so that was really enriching in terms

505
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:04,480
of experience and then just the

506
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,039
collaborative side of things I don't

507
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,799
think I would be here without the

508
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:09,440
support of my friends and network who

509
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:11,840
helped me through the whole recruiting

510
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,120
process uh help me interview help me

511
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,559
prepare um just things that I probably

512
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:18,200
would not even had the I would have know

513
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:20,720
how to start without without their help

514
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:23,159
so all that's very very grateful and at

515
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,120
the same time just like a lot of fun and

516
00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:27,200
really extreme people to be to be fair

517
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:31,480
like Work Hard Play Hard is like a very

518
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:33,679
true um true uh culture within MIT SL

519
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:35,200
and like you meet people who always do

520
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,559
things like extreme like hey you like

521
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,200
mountain climbing well I'm like the

522
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:40,440
world champion in M climbing oh you like

523
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,840
to play piano I like performed at the

524
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,559
Carnegie Hall it's just like you meet

525
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,720
these fantastic people but we're also

526
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:47,760
really down to it in genuine it's just

527
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:50,320
something you don't get uh too much

528
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,200
elsewhere um post alone the community

529
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,919
still goes strong my my friend group

530
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:57,799
still sends a dad joke every Friday so

531
00:19:54,919 --> 00:19:59,520
that's still going um we help each other

532
00:19:57,799 --> 00:20:01,080
recruiting a lot so a lot of cers which

533
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,200
has happened you know immediately or a

534
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:05,280
couple years after Sloan and because

535
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,039
your network grows even larger to a

536
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,960
network of networks and it just

537
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,039
connections everywhere it's it's really

538
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,720
strong El specifically we also have Al

539
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:14,720
alumni conference every year which is

540
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,200
extremely fun like this year it's in

541
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,799
Mexico City so you still get to stay in

542
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,720
touch network uh learn about what's Best

543
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:23,760
in operation technical management all

544
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:26,320
these things and still have a good time

545
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,880
so uh yeah in many ways I think

546
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,280
lifechanging is probably the only way I

547
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:33,080
can describe this community and

548
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:34,200
experience that's awesome to hear um I

549
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,799
kind of want to touch on a point that

550
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,679
you mentioned earlier which was kind of

551
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:41,159
around the cultural Dynamics so I think

552
00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:42,960
the question is so how do cultural

553
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:45,640
Dynamics kind of play into the Zone

554
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:49,880
experience given how Dynamic and diverse

555
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:51,280
The Zone population is um I'll take any

556
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:55,760
volunteers for this I don't want to put

557
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:58,440
anyone on the spot but I will if no one

558
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:01,440
unmutes so by cultural Dynamic do you

559
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:04,679
mean mean like like like ethnic

560
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:06,120
backgrounds or like something um well

561
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:08,880
this

562
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:11,159
was I guess

563
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,120
um it could be yeah I guess like a

564
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:14,799
background of ethnicity or like where

565
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:18,640
you grew up I think also counts as like

566
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:22,279
a cultural Dynamic um I guess like yeah

567
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,840
how um how do the D how does like the

568
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:27,760
diversity of the stone population kind

569
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:30,400
of like factor into the stone experience

570
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:35,279
gotcha um well since it seems like this

571
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:38,720
is like a Asian focused um conversation

572
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:40,000
um so when I was there like and I'm

573
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,799
friends with all these groups

574
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,720
individually but I know like there's

575
00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:45,760
obviously Asian-American Alliance I know

576
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:47,799
there's like a Korean you know like

577
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,240
student group as well there's actually

578
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:51,360
like outside of the asian-americans

579
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:52,919
there's like a Chinese another like

580
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,480
separate Chinese group for people who

581
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:57,760
are like you know like more like expats

582
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:00,640
um and they communicate in Chinese uh

583
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:03,080
and and so I I think like you know even

584
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,760
within you know the broader group of

585
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:07,200
like Asian you know Asian American Asian

586
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,400
identifying whatever I think there's a

587
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,880
lot of subgroups um if you you know for

588
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,720
for people with you know even more

589
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:17,200
similar

590
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:19,120
cultures yeah for sure um I I think I

591
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,039
agree like we actually right now in

592
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,039
Triple A um there's a moon cake there's

593
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,360
a mid-autumn Festival event happening

594
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:26,279
right now and that's actually in a

595
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:28,720
collaboration with the greater China

596
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:30,200
club and the South Korea Club um just

597
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,039
because they all have we all have like I

598
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:35,600
think different but similar Traditions

599
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:37,520
around this um gonna add to what was

600
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:40,320
saying too as well um yeah there

601
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:42,400
definitely some strong sub populations

602
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,520
and sub subgroups too I'm still on a

603
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,600
WhatsApp thread for Taiwanese um

604
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:48,520
students at loan and it's the same group

605
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:51,320
that was still active for for me now

606
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:53,880
three years ago um and very like people

607
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:55,240
post a lot on help support uh T

608
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:57,919
Taiwanese students who are going to be

609
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:00,320
at slan um very impressed by by that

610
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,640
that it's still continuing and you know

611
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,640
quite quite helpful um the the other

612
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,080
thing that at Loan in terms of cultural

613
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,039
diversity are these things called C

614
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,880
functions they didn't happen as much

615
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:13,360
during the covid years but um you know

616
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:15,679
were sort of resurrected after covid was

617
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:18,240
over different cultural groups will host

618
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,360
them um different nights and uh so some

619
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,679
of them are you know could be the

620
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,960
Asian-American Alliance it could be you

621
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:25,200
know one of the different other um clubs

622
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:29,039
too as well it's a great way to be able

623
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:31,919
to share um culture food uh dance too as

624
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:34,279
well and uh so yeah I definitely

625
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,640
encourage you uh to to to check those

626
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:38,200
out if you're at Sloan um good way to be

627
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,000
able to learn about other cultures and

628
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,919
people but then also just great way to

629
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,279
have

630
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:47,200
fun definitely um and then did you have

631
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:49,640
anything you wanted to add sure yeah

632
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,559
happy to um I think our class you know

633
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:53,200
specifically I think around 50% of us

634
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:54,400
were from the states and the 50% or

635
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,760
actually not from the states which is

636
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,640
pretty cool um it was a combination of

637
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:01,640
Asia a lot of Europeans um but what that

638
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,320
really did brain or class was a diverse

639
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:05,080
range of perspectives a lot of different

640
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:07,279
backgrounds um a lot of people who have

641
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:09,000
lived in multiple different countries um

642
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:12,440
and are able to kind of give that

643
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,279
Insight um or their own thoughts on how

644
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,559
you know how data I guess in our

645
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:16,760
specific case how data is being

646
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:18,600
Incorporated in different companies what

647
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:20,919
the kind of um narrative around data is

648
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:22,320
how willing people are to um incorporate

649
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:24,919
data especially in businesses given that

650
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,840
was such a primary focus of our program

651
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:29,640
um I know I learned a lot about food

652
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:31,679
culture um I also attended multiple C

653
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:34,720
functions which were very fun um got to

654
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:36,679
learn about a lot of cultures and um and

655
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:40,360
um practices that I probably wasn't

656
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:41,720
exposed to um um prior to that um one of

657
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,559
the things I want to talk about I think

658
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:46,320
not necessarily cultural diversity but

659
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:47,480
also just academic diversity was a huge

660
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,480
thing um I don't know if that

661
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:51,760
necessarily TAPS in here but um you know

662
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,799
for example I was a computer science

663
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,360
major so I knew had a code very well um

664
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:57,080
and there were other individuals who had

665
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,039
math Majors um and they would come in

666
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,880
and we would kind of lean on each other

667
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,399
um and there were some people who

668
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,640
actually just never coded and never you

669
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:04,720
know hadn't studied math before they

670
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,960
were more social um Sciences oriented

671
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:09,960
but had a strong incling to um be able

672
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,840
to pursue data science um and that

673
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,919
diversity of basically strengths across

674
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,520
different disciplines um both in the

675
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:17,399
business side and that could have been

676
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,679
you know public speaking you know

677
00:25:17,399 --> 00:25:22,120
management multiple different areas um

678
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,640
and then also on the technical side um

679
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,960
that diversity really helped us like

680
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:28,399
lean on each other um play each other's

681
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:32,320
strengths which I think was um a great

682
00:25:28,399 --> 00:25:32,320
asset or our class especially for the

683
00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:37,200
program hu did you have anything else to

684
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,960
add I know you you kind of brought up

685
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,399
the first point that I latched on to but

686
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,240
if there was anything else you wanted to

687
00:25:40,399 --> 00:25:43,760
add please feel free yeah yeah I think

688
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,600
there is something I do want to mention

689
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:49,600
just just about how Sloan and and they

690
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:53,440
facilitate the the discussion around

691
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:56,200
race and diversity really well um we I I

692
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:58,799
was in class during the peak of black

693
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:01,120
livs matter so this what when a lot of

694
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:04,760
discourse was happening around race

695
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:07,080
equality and it it opened up an

696
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:09,320
opportunity for the school to offer a

697
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:11,399
forums and platforms for people to talk

698
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:14,440
about how their lives were affected or

699
00:26:11,399 --> 00:26:17,039
how they view the the system and um we

700
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:18,720
had conversations you know from from

701
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:21,279
African-American students as well as

702
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,840
like Midwestern Americans we were able

703
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:25,039
to talk and then we spun that off later

704
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:27,320
to conversation about uh someone from

705
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:30,120
International from China and also

706
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:31,840
perspective from US army military

707
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:34,600
Captain who who fought in Afghan it's

708
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:36,440
like you you you you can you able to

709
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,919
merge all these different views in a

710
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,600
very open and honest setting where you

711
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:42,360
can talk about your your views your

712
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,039
thoughts um and have like a very genuine

713
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:45,679
conversation about it I think that kind

714
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:47,760
of environment is very rare and it's

715
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:51,240
something that flown very well to

716
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:54,919
facilitate so um just a a commitment to

717
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:56,679
the to the community there yeah for sure

718
00:26:54,919 --> 00:26:59,120
um does anyone want to touch on I guess

719
00:26:56,679 --> 00:27:01,240
the diversity of their Cor for team CU I

720
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,799
know I think those are those are I think

721
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,080
like carefully designed to make sure

722
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:07,120
that there's diversity across

723
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:10,159
backgrounds but also academic diversity

724
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:11,919
um yeah I can talk a little bit about

725
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:14,039
slone fellows and maybe a little bit my

726
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:17,000
core team as well too so slone fellows

727
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:19,720
is a one-year program which is mid

728
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,720
career a lot actually a lot of the um

729
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:24,080
people in the cohort come from from

730
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:27,320
outside the US I think over 50% is

731
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:29,120
actually out from outside the US and um

732
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:30,880
they they they're coming with their

733
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,640
families often for for one year to be

734
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:35,240
resident at Sloan um and so I got a

735
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:37,840
chance to meet people from all sorts of

736
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:41,919
different countries uh at at the program

737
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:45,120
um Team actually we had uh one woman

738
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:47,919
from Nigeria she worked for Shell um The

739
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:50,320
Other Woman one one other woman was from

740
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:52,799
um New Zealand but she worked in Tech

741
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,880
and actually worked in webl which was

742
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,720
very helpful and we actually ended up

743
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:59,240
doing a project together on my weable

744
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:02,240
tech startup um and then the the other

745
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:04,600
guy was from Canada and he worked in in

746
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,760
the tech field too as well um so really

747
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:09,240
amazing my core team um I'm friends with

748
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:11,640
all of them still we still do meetups uh

749
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:13,000
and we we have a pretty strong bond but

750
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:16,039
it's pretty emblematic of how

751
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,320
International at least the SL was and I

752
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:22,000
saw that across all the programs but SL

753
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,000
was very International

754
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:27,840
Focus um so I think mentorship and

755
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:29,320
Community Support has been like a common

756
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,840
theme

757
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:34,679
um within different

758
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:36,840
communities can you share how mentorship

759
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:38,640
or Community Support has played a role

760
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,799
in your journey I know Katherine you

761
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,880
talked a little bit about um how you

762
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:44,200
that's kind of how you found your really

763
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,360
like the really cool startup that you're

764
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:49,000
working on um I guess and and could you

765
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:51,720
share more about that kind of mentorship

766
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,919
and Community Support opportunity or or

767
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:57,000
other similar experiences that you've

768
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:58,840
had related to that um yeah so so I

769
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,720
think I already touched on kind of the

770
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:02,840
student network but I really want to

771
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,279
highlight the professor Network um

772
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:06,360
because some of my professor syst some

773
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:09,519
really incredible things for me um so

774
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:12,240
when I was recruiting right after Sloan

775
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:14,279
um you know I was like I was mulling

776
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,760
over a number of options like you know

777
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:18,799
between Venture Capital um you know kind

778
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:20,840
of going back to be an investor or kind

779
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:22,960
of a midsize biotech or you know

780
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:25,080
starting you know very very like you

781
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,559
know early stage like SE series a stage

782
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,559
so there's a range of options and I

783
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:30,240
wasn't really sure where to start

784
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:32,559
um but I just remember like there's a

785
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,120
professor called uh Jonathan Fleming and

786
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:36,760
he he kind of does the healthcare

787
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:38,519
strategy course and I took his class um

788
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:41,960
and I remember just kind of and he's

789
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:43,679
kind of a like a Serial investor now but

790
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:45,240
I remember just talking to him and being

791
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:47,360
like hey like can you just walk me

792
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,919
through these options and over the

793
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,519
course of my recruiting Journey which

794
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:52,320
probably took a couple months like i'

795
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:53,840
met with him like you know like once a

796
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,919
month or like I met with him a number of

797
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:57,200
times um when I had all my options I

798
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,679
kind of laid down front him and kind of

799
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:03,200
got his feedback on it it I remember um

800
00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:04,880
I saw these two positions one at onum

801
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,600
and one at dierna which if you're in the

802
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:09,080
space you know these are those are kind

803
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:11,279
of you know big biotechs in the area

804
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:13,480
before DNA got Acquired and I saw

805
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:15,039
positions there that I liked and I told

806
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,519
Jonathan about them and within 30

807
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:18,399
minutes he had forwarded my resume to

808
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:20,960
the CEO of both companies and I was like

809
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:22,799
that was just an incredible like way for

810
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,240
someone for a professor to stick his

811
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:27,159
neck out and use his personal Network

812
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,760
for me um similarly Andrew low is

813
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:31,440
another kind of Finance professor and I

814
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,120
didn't even take his class but I had

815
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,799
heard from others that he's sort of kind

816
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,760
of a big name of the industry he knew a

817
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:39,360
lot of people and you know when I was

818
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:41,000
thinking about Venture um I had reached

819
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,600
out to him and said hey look like I have

820
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,360
never taken your class but heard a lot

821
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:47,240
of things about you like like to just

822
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:49,960
chat with you about kind of you know the

823
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:51,480
healthcare Finance World in Boston um

824
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:53,440
and this was like after I graduated he

825
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:55,519
had no idea who I was and he like you

826
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,000
know immediately like took the call and

827
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:58,360
kind of walked me through everything he

828
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,519
told me he was like building his own

829
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:03,279
Venture you know like shop and was like

830
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:06,399
looking to hire sloes and just so I

831
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:09,000
think just like um you know just the the

832
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:12,360
amount of effort that professors put in

833
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,679
to help a student whether or not they

834
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:16,480
actually have taught you or remember you

835
00:31:14,679 --> 00:31:19,200
um I just thought was kind of

836
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:22,679
incredible so I just want to Echo that

837
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:25,240
oh yes I was gonna H it to you yeah okay

838
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:26,840
amazing um yeah no Echo you know

839
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,720
whatever Katherine said really I think

840
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:30,720
the professor network is something that

841
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,799
um very underutilized you know we talk a

842
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,039
lot about our F you know friends and and

843
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:36,639
and students that we um you know work

844
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:38,440
with and their Network were incredible

845
00:31:36,639 --> 00:31:40,039
as well but the professors are doing

846
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:43,039
some incredible work you know at least

847
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:44,960
on in supply chain operations research

848
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:46,399
at least from the mban was um you know a

849
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,440
lot of the professors that we worked

850
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:49,679
with um not only are they brilliant but

851
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,880
they've worked with you know some of the

852
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:53,240
companies that um work directly with

853
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:55,960
companies and you know leading their

854
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:57,919
strategy whether it's a business side or

855
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:59,880
um you know supply chain and you know

856
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:01,480
operation side um I actually landed my

857
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:05,120
first job I kind of touched on this too

858
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:06,880
with um the sneakers app through um uh

859
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,200

product management class with so he

861
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,120
actually didn't even know my technical

862
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,880
skill I ended up taking a technical

863
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:15,399
class with him later on um but he you

864
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:18,240

865
00:32:15,399 --> 00:32:20,200
conversations about career um and you

866
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,720
know what the what the path was you know

867
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,279
depending on what what I wanted you know

868
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:25,399
saw myself four to five years down the

869
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:28,519
road um you know all of them are they

870
00:32:25,399 --> 00:32:30,120
make time um which is a uh you don't you

871
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:31,399
get you don't see often especially at

872
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:33,919
some schools you know professors are

873
00:32:31,399 --> 00:32:36,080
incredibly busy but um a lot of

874
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,639
professors at Sloan have been uh have

875
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,679
made time clear their calendar to make

876
00:32:37,639 --> 00:32:42,519
sure that they are um there to help and

877
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:44,600
Mentor so that's been

878
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:46,480
great and you did you have anything you

879
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:49,279
wanted to add from the perspective of

880
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,559
the lgo program or maybe other kind of

881
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:54,840
peer-to-peer or faculty mentorships that

882
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:57,519
you exp yeah definitely so maybe just to

883
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:59,440
continue the professor one there's uh

884
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:02,320
Fant fantastic network of Professor on

885
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,720
entrepreneurship MIT um I had a couple

886
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,080
classes there that's not where I ended

887
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:07,639
up but it was something I really wanted

888
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:10,200
to do as Lan uh I had no idea what I was

889
00:33:07,639 --> 00:33:11,960
doing really really terrible ideas but

890
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,279
these professors would sit with me hours

891
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,559
after hours just to guide you through

892
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:16,679

but brilliant people who's Will to will

896
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:27,320
to give their time too so Echo that from

897
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:29,279
Al perspective the mentioned again the

898
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:32,080
alumni network is just really really

899
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:34,320
strong um there's there's uh really

900
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,559
successful people including Jeff FY who

901
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:38,279
just left the Amazon who built the

902
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:40,679
Amazon's 2day Prime so very some some

903
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:42,639
impressive alumni there but uh my my

904
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:45,720
whole career started because uh I was

905
00:33:42,639 --> 00:33:48,039
looking for mentorship and I was able to

906
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:50,760
uh get gu mentorship from a few of the

907
00:33:48,039 --> 00:33:52,480
lgo Alumni network one of whom was a

908
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,639
founder of his own PE Fromm and that's

909
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,760
sort of where I started to learn about

910
00:33:53,639 --> 00:33:58,039

00:33:58,039 --> 00:34:01,919
when uh in the winter period when we are

913
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:03,559
supposed to usually have something

914
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:05,600
called a plan track where we visit

915
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:07,440
different factories uh because of Co

917
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:12,159

921
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:21,440
of where I ended up with so it's a

922
00:34:18,919 --> 00:34:22,960
really strong Network um also really

923
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,720
strong network with really strong people

924
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:29,040
who who are very genuinely willing to

925
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:31,280
help you so um yeah just going the

926
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,560
experience from everyone else nice and

927
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,280
Kenneth did you have anything you wanted

928
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:38,800
to add about mentorship or um whether

929
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:40,639
yeah PTO peer faculty alumni I don't

930
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,119
have too much else to add aside from

931
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:44,000
I'll just Echo The Faculty Point The

932
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:47,240
Faculty have been extremely helpful for

933
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,560
me while I was there and uh uh as was

934
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:50,480
said they they're very willing to make

935
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,760
introductions I remember my

936
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,760
entrepreneurial sales Professor had

937
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:56,800
several one-on-one calls with him he

938
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:59,640
helped like think about my my problem

939
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:01,520
for my my start up and made multiple

940
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:04,200
introductions to me too including to his

941
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,839
own son who was actually working um in

942
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:08,359
in Tech too and had some good

943
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:10,440
suggestions um so you know that type of

944
00:35:08,359 --> 00:35:12,320
those type of interactions I I were were

945
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:13,839
really valuable and you know this is

946
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,119
also during covid where it's even harder

947
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:19,599
to to build that face to-face personal

948
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:21,119
connection but professors really went

949
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:23,599
above and beyond to to build those

950
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:27,280
connections which I really appreciate it

951
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:29,480
that's awesome um so there there's a

952
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:32,440
couple questions that we got separately

953
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:35,560
from from like the intro on so one of

954
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:37,680
them was how does being um Asian or

955
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:40,880
Asian-American kind of shap H how did it

956
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:44,640
kind of shape your your slown experience

957
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:47,000
um can I start with you an NA sure yeah

958
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:50,599
um don't have much to touch on this um I

959
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,920
wasn't part of any of the um uh the the

960
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:54,640
Asian-American Alliance um and I know

961
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:58,040
that's I think within our within the

962
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:59,599
mband we did um we had like our own kind

963
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:02,000
of activities that we did just kind of

964
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:03,640
culturally so uh you know coming I'm I'm

965
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,319
Indian I'm Hindu and one of the big

966
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:07,720
festivals we celebrate is the Vol um and

967
00:36:06,319 --> 00:36:09,119
I remember so distinctly it's a big

968
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:10,400
holiday for us and a lot of us have

969
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,640
family and especially a lot of the

970
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,760
international students would come from

971
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:16,119
India um we kind of reminiscing about

972
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:18,400
this um this time that would you know

973
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:20,359
usually you get a week off um just to

974
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,359
kind of celebrate this holiday um and

975
00:36:20,359 --> 00:36:22,680
you know we were able to take that

976
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:24,000
opportunity just kind of get dinner

977
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,240
amongst us and it was not just you know

978
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,359
the Indian Community but it was also um

979
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:30,520
a lot of other you know friends and um

980
00:36:28,359 --> 00:36:33,000
friends and who were who didn't practice

981
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:34,720
but were there to celebrate with us um

982
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,640
and so that definitely felt like a lot

983
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:39,119
more welcoming and and being a part of

984
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:41,319
it I also um I think there was a lot of

985
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:45,599
just cultural experiences that I was

986
00:36:41,319 --> 00:36:46,640
able to learn from and um tap into um

987
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,400
that I probably would have gotten

988
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:50,160
elsewhere but um you know definitely

989
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,920
want to lean on you know pass it off to

990
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:54,240
Katherine and Kenneth I think who have

991
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,920
um you know work with the AAA American

992
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:58,640
all I mean the Asian Alliance um to hear

993
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:00,359
more

994
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:03,760
sure Katherine do you wan to do you want

995
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:06,920
to take it for a little bit um sure yeah

996
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:10,760
I mean I would say um Triple A probably

997
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:13,440
was like my core friend group um in the

998
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:16,480
first semester like it was a very you

999
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:18,839
know nice easy intro into like 400

1000
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,920
people where you know you just had like

1001
00:37:18,839 --> 00:37:23,000
a small group of people who like you

1002
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:24,839
know with similar cultural backgrounds

1003
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:28,680
whatever um and it was just you know

1004
00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:31,880
very easy um you know I don't have a ton

1005
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:35,440
more to add because I feel like you know

1006
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:37,240
my like I feel like I try to Branch out

1007
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:39,119
a little bit more outside of you know

1008
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:41,520
triaa as well it's not like oh I can

1009
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:43,800
only hang out with the asian-americans

1010
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:45,240
so you know it's like that was my

1011
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,920
initial friend group and a lot of those

1012
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:49,119
people have kind of stuck with me and a

1013
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:51,880
lot a lot of the first social outings

1014
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:54,440
have been with triaa but it you know by

1015
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:55,960
no means kind of limited or defined my

1016
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:58,040
slown

1017
00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:00,160
experience sure

1018
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:02,319
um Kenneth do you want to describe some

1019
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,960
of the things that you know how being

1020
00:38:02,319 --> 00:38:08,040
Asian or Asian-American helps shape your

1021
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:11,839
experience and or maybe if you and or

1022
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:14,119
maybe your favorite um event related to

1023
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:17,280
triaa well I don't know if this is an

1024
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:20,119
official AAA event but maybe a little

1025
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:23,200
bit of uh this could be a fun story so

1026
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:25,119
um while I think it was like maybe this

1027
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:29,040
the fall or is it actually it was I

1028
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:31,800
think this the the first part of my um

1029
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:33,760
of the slow fellows session uh was

1030
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,599
during Co and there wasn't a lot of big

1031
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:39,359
group activities happening it was hard

1032
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:40,960
to actually meet people and I I actually

1033
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:43,440
didn't necessarily have a lot of friends

1034
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:45,520
in in the first couple months um you

1035
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:47,440
know outside this loone fellows program

1036
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,359
and in my entrepreneurial sales class on

1037
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:52,640
on Zoom I got to know a couple of the

1038
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:54,480
asian-americans in that class and uh

1039
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:57,160
when they were planning a trip to go up

1040
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,680
to Maine in Acadia they reached out to

1041
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:00,880
me and said we've never actually met you

1042
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:03,160
in person but would you be interested to

1043
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:05,000
join us on this trip to Maine and and

1044
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:07,680
actually that's when I first met Kat was

1045
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,839
actually on that trip we hadn't actually

1046
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,280
well maybe maybe it was the second time

1047
00:39:08,839 --> 00:39:14,400
we had met but we we didn't really hung

1048
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:16,240
out with it um and it and and from there

1049
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,760
actually the people in the

1050
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:20,640
Asian-American Alliance Group and and

1051
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:22,720
and became friends with Katherine more

1052
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,480
and eventually led to me helping with

1053
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:27,560
you know the the leadership transition

1054
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:29,760
as well um but that type of Outreach was

1055
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:32,160
uh I I I really appreciate it and

1056
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:34,520
especially on zoom and you know to to

1057
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:36,440
reach out and to get to know somebody

1058
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:39,640
and um and make those bonds where it

1059
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:42,000
really was harder during during Co um

1060
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:44,280
and then then for me when I when we were

1061
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,280
leading when I was leading the alliance

1062
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:48,000
during my visiting fellows here I got a

1063
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:49,400
chance to meet some of the the incoming

1064
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,520
students too so actually it was a good

1065
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:55,839
chance to bridge that so I just I'm

1066
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:57,880
know like few like last last year a few

1067
00:39:55,839 --> 00:40:00,640
months ago um

1068
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:02,560
and uh so triaa was a good chance to be

1069
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:05,040
able to actually Bridge not just classes

1070
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:07,440
but also different different years um

1071
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:11,960
and and I really appreciate that yeah

1072
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:13,240
for sure and hu um any I guess can you

1073
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,960
describe how being Asian or

1074
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:18,599
Asian-American shaped your experience

1075
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:21,400
and or your favorite um Asian event at

1076
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:23,640
Slim So as I mentioned because I started

1077
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:25,319
with lgo and also Co and I also was in

1078
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:27,119
Germany for half a year for my

1079
00:40:25,319 --> 00:40:28,680
internship so I I really didn't get to

1080
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:30,800
spend spend that much time at Sloan to

1081
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:32,920
be to be completely Frank but but

1082
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:35,319
through all that time I I sort of stayed

1083
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:38,119
with with within my lgo class within my

1084
00:40:35,319 --> 00:40:41,040
slown uh Core Group within within my

1085
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:43,280
entrepreneurship classes and then the

1086
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,800
last semester came didn't really know

1087
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,119
that many people sort of like similar

1088
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,599
situation but I didn't know that many

1089
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:50,440
people so I just walk into the Korean

1090
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:51,920
club or walk into Asian-American club

1091
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:54,720
and then instantly it's like it's like

1092
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:56,760
family um you're you know out drinking

1093
00:40:54,720 --> 00:41:00,480
eating you know doing you know fun stuff

1094
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:02,319
and it it's it's just very easy to uh

1095
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,079
belong I think and that's it's it's

1096
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:06,560
always good to know that you have that

1097
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:08,839
option and it actually kind of extends

1098
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:11,440
Beyond just slan um there's a ton of

1099
00:41:08,839 --> 00:41:12,920
different Asian Affiliated uh business

1100
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:16,160
school network that you can also start

1101
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:18,520
to tap into um so it's all across the US

1102
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:21,280
there's a bunch of events uh so it's

1103
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:23,079
just no no shortage of things to do and

1104
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,359
no shortage of people to meet so it was

1105
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:28,000
just a just a lot of good times that's

1106
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:29,720
awesome that's great to hear um so our

1107
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,880
panel is coming to an end but we have

1108
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:35,280
one last question which was is there

1109
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:38,319
anything that surprised you about Sloan

1110
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:40,400
and or your um experience kind of like

1111
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:41,960
with the Asian-American Alliance so I

1112
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,560
guess more so for for Katherine and

1113
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:46,079
Kenneth but anything that surpris you

1114
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:49,880
about your stone experience um I'll

1115
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:52,760
start with

1116
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:54,640
kenon um well I was surprised how much I

1117
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:56,599
really want to spend more time there I

1118
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:58,319
think um particularly for midc career

1119
00:41:56,599 --> 00:42:00,839
the the idea this lone fellows program

1120
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:04,359
is designed so that you can get back to

1121
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:05,560
the Working World um but I you know

1122
00:42:04,359 --> 00:42:08,119
that's how I was like okay I just want

1123
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:10,240
to be there one year and then be out

1124
00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:11,560
that was my initial thought um but when

1125
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,160
I was ending I was like well I'm not

1126
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:15,000
really quite ready to leave yet and

1127
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:17,839
that's why I there's this option to

1128
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,480
extend six more months and um I really

1129
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:21,720
want to even stay longer than that too

1130
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:23,119
as well and I was like well might as

1131
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:26,559
well have done the two-year program at

1132
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:28,079
that point or the 20-month EMA um from a

1133
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:30,280
Time perspective

1134
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:32,400
um but it was I I I was surprised how

1135
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:33,839
much I really wanted to you know I love

1136
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,280
the academic environment I love the

1137
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:37,720
community at alone I just wanted to

1138
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,960
spend more time there um I think

1139
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,440
Financial pressure was like I better

1140
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,760
better leave they they asked me like do

1141
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:43,480
you want to do another visiting fellows

1142
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,599
program like another six month exension

1143
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:47,119
beyond that I wanted to it's just I I

1144
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:49,000
had to had to get back to to earn some

1145
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:52,319
money but um but I was surprised how

1146
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:55,319
much I really really uh enjoyed being

1147
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:57,680
there Anda um what surprised you about

1148
00:42:55,319 --> 00:42:59,599
your stone experience sure yeah just to

1149
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:02,079
Echo that I was surprised by how fast it

1150
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:04,040
went I mean the mban is um I guess like

1151
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:07,520
12-month program almost 12 months on the

1152
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:09,200
dot um went by super super fast had you

1153
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,880
know had a blast every minute of it yes

1154
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,800
it was a little bit stressful at times

1155
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:16,040
but um you know most of the time it was

1156
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:17,800
just a lot of fun um besides that um you

1157
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,920
know I really think one of the huge

1158
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:21,640
things that surprised me is how

1159
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:24,200
collaborative um everyone is and how

1160
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:26,079
everyone is willing to help um I went to

1161
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:27,720
a big you know my undergrad was in a big

1162
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:30,520
public school um

1163
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:32,440
by Nature competition is huge usually

1164
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:33,760
you're um it's not necessarily I would

1165
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:36,119
say you're not edging anyone out but

1166
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:38,160
it's definitely you know the focus is on

1167
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:40,000
your own learning um you really got to

1168
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:42,079
vouch for yourself um and you know in

1169
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,680
former schools at Sloan I did not feel

1170
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:45,240
that at all I felt like people were you

1171
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,680
know offering a hand they were they

1172
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:48,520
wanted to pick you up they wanted to be

1173
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:50,000
there to support you whether that's at

1174
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:52,440
you know whe that's in like you know in

1175
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,200
your classes or you know recruiting I've

1176
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:55,960
had so many of my friends mock interview

1177
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:58,119
me you know when I was going start doing

1178
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:59,400
technical interviews um or business

1179
00:43:58,119 --> 00:44:01,760
interviews you know I didn't even know

1180
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:03,240
what a case study was um up until you

1181
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:06,359
know second semester and I had to start

1182
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:08,359
interviewing prepping and um send me all

1183
00:44:06,359 --> 00:44:10,119
the documents and materials um to be

1184
00:44:08,359 --> 00:44:11,480
able to support that and even after um

1185
00:44:10,119 --> 00:44:13,680
you know people are so willing and open

1186
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:15,200
to help um which is a great networking

1187
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,680
Community to have and you know I think

1188
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:22,119
we're all looking for ways to give back

1189
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:24,559
as well so um yeah nice um and hu what

1190
00:44:22,119 --> 00:44:27,160
surprised you about your experience at

1191
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:28,680
sonone and or in involved in the

1192
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:30,920
Asian-American

1193
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:34,319
Community yeah I'll stick a little more

1194
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:35,640
to the slone side so I I I don't think

1195
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:38,760
it should have been a surprise they

1196
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:40,200
always tell you how much um potential

1197
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:43,680
things are there for you to experience

1198
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:47,319
this SL in terms of career paths just um

1199
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:49,480
new new technologies new new Industries

1200
00:44:47,319 --> 00:44:51,400
but the extent to which that you

1201
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:52,880
actually get to experience it and also

1202
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:56,559
how much Freedom you get to just go and

1203
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:57,839
explore was was amazing um if if

1204
00:44:56,559 --> 00:45:00,079
somebody told me I'll be going to

1205
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:01,720
private Equity after going to SL I don't

1206
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:05,040
think I would have known what private

1207
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:07,200
Equity was so so that kind of pivot is

1208
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:09,040
is allowed as slow and they definitely

1209
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:11,680
encourage it they let you explore it for

1210
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:13,359
the time you're there and just that much

1211
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:15,920
that much breath was just something I

1212
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:17,960
wasn't expecting so so definitely take

1213
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,960
advantage of that and also look forward

1214
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:22,440
to it because it's it's really fun

1215
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:24,880
experience and echoing that makes it

1216
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:28,559
feel very short TW years went by very

1217
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:31,559
fast for sure I feel like it's like gone

1218
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:33,920
by like this um and Katherine lastly but

1219
00:45:31,559 --> 00:45:35,880
not least um what surprised you about

1220
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:40,119
your experience at slan and or in the

1221
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:43,559
Asian-American community at SL

1222
00:45:40,119 --> 00:45:46,480
um well Co was definitely a surprise um

1223
00:45:43,559 --> 00:45:49,960
but outside of that I would say I've

1224
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:54,200
actually been surprised by um how my

1225
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:56,160
career didn't like pause when I went to

1226
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:58,760
get my NBA because I think my biggest

1227
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:00,480
fear um kind of taking two years off was

1228
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:02,440
oh am I going to have to you know am I

1229
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,920
going to take a step back in my career

1230
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:07,720
am I going to hit pause and am I going

1231
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:09,400
to keep up right um afterwards and and

1232
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:12,240
like going in that was very much a fear

1233
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:14,680
and and I don't know how many folks um

1234
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:16,680
here are familiar with kind of the life

1235
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:19,119
science recruiting cycle but what

1236
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:20,800
typically happens is after your MBA a

1237
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:23,200
lot of people enter into these two-year

1238
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:25,000
rotation programs which kind of you know

1239
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:27,200
circulates you into a couple different

1240
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,200
groups within a big Pharma company uh

1241
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:32,240
and then you kind of go out and you know

1242
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:35,160
you go out and you pick a team um and I

1243
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:37,200
was afraid that was my only path which

1244
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:39,160
essentially means I would have to repeat

1245
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:42,280
the two years I did at fiser right

1246
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:43,760
before Sloan um and so I was actually

1247
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:45,720
really surprised by the wealth of

1248
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:48,040
opportunities that was kind of off the

1249
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:49,880
beaten path um and how easy they were to

1250
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:51,319
find like I thought I would have a

1251
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:52,599
really tough time recruiting Because I

1252
00:46:51,319 --> 00:46:54,599
was looking for something that didn't

1253
00:46:52,599 --> 00:46:56,960
exist like a lot of companies will tell

1254
00:46:54,599 --> 00:46:59,079
you like oh or like you know I've heard

1255
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:01,160
like oh people don't hire mbas into you

1256
00:46:59,079 --> 00:47:03,280
know like mid-level or senior positions

1257
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:05,319
and I just didn't find that to be true

1258
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:06,960
when I started recruiting um I just

1259
00:47:05,319 --> 00:47:08,880
thought the network was strong enough

1260
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:10,880
the professors knew people who knew

1261
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:13,200
people like there's so many Venture

1262
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:15,640
firms in the Boston area like there was

1263
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:19,280
no shortage of companies that was

1264
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:21,319
willing to hire Sloan NBAs into like not

1265
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:24,559
