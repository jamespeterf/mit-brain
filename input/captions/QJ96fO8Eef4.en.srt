1
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,240
So um right so to one of the things I

2
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,840
want to focus on today and we'll get to

3
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:23,439
this in just a minute is uh how to write

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:26,439
a proof. So this is going to be

5
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,439
uh

6
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:33,160
how to write uh a mathematical proof.

7
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,079
So how how do you write a proof as

8
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:49,039
opposed to you know how do you think

9
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,840
about uh why something should be true,

10
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:55,600
right? And so this is like one of the

11
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,920
important topics for this uh course. So

12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,559
uh you know overall I mean there's a lot

13
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,600
of uh important concepts that we will

14
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:05,760
talk about right but some of the general

15
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,560
things that we learn is how to prove

16
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,799
something but also how to write a proper

17
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,799
mathematical proof right and those

18
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,159
things are a little bit different and

19
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:20,720
we'll talk about this in a minute.

20
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:22,799
Uh I also want to say that so on the

21
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,799
course information the last page of the

22
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,040
course several people were asking about

23
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,439
this on the last page of course

24
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,479
animation

25
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:34,560
there is uh there is right so there's a

26
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:37,200
notes there's a notes for the class that

27
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,880
I write uh and I typically I try to

28
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,880
write them in advance a couple of days

29
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,240
in advance and then I try to go over it

30
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,960
the day uh also to make sure to find

31
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:50,159
tbooks and things like that. So that is

32
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:53,360
more readable. Uh so if I were you, I

33
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:56,960
would first read the lecture notes that

34
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,719
I post after the lectures. Uh and then

35
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,159
there's also on the last page of the

36
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:04,159
course information there is uh and I try

37
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,840
to do this in advance but it's a little

38
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:11,920
bit difficult to do it in advance. So uh

39
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:15,040
it say the the date and it say the

40
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:18,800
material some keywords from the lecture

41
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,959
uh on that date. So I over the weekend I

42
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,959
posted for the two lectures for this

43
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,440
week

44
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,200
but then I go back I will try to go

45
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,599
back. So I actually went back this

46
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,720
morning and changed some of it from the

47
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:35,599
second lecture so that it fits more and

48
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:39,360
I think I will only uh I give references

49
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:41,360
there to the book but and initially I

50
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,840
was thinking giving both references to

51
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:48,400
Ruden and to the main textbook.

52
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,120
I think it's probably just uh maybe it's

53
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,319
I mean I think it's probably smarter

54
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:59,920
just to give it from the main textbook.

55
00:02:54,319 --> 00:03:04,080
Okay. But I and uh Rudin is a great book

56
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:08,400
um you know this was a book uh that was

57
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:11,599
that was um that was created here long

58
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,319
time ago and it it is like a classic in

59
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:16,560
the subject. It's a great book. It's

60
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:19,120
more formal than the other book. So the

61
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,360
other book is a little bit more

62
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,400
accessible.

63
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,560
Uh, and so that's why we're using that.

64
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,560
But but actually Rudin is a fantastic

65
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:33,519
book. If if it was just myself,

66
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,159
uh, I would just I think Ruden is hard

67
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,640
to beat. But but but the other one is is

68
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:43,400
more accessible and so it might actually

69
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,400
be better the first time you learn it.

70
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:49,120
And but so I think from here on out, so

71
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,879
I deleted the references I had to root

72
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,440
in. I think I would just give references

73
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:56,319
to the main textbook

74
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:58,159
uh and and but but you know I certainly

75
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,640
encourage you to look at root and also I

76
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:03,760
also encourage you to look at chapters

77
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,239
that we will skip uh but there's also

78
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,200
things that that we initially skip and

79
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:12,000
then we come back to

80
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:15,120
but but again you know you should and

81
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,880
it's like the when I list the things

82
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,639
that we will cover in the lecture in

83
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:24,400
advance it's only sort of approximation

84
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:27,759
right so um once I write lecture it

85
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:32,400
might be slightly different

86
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:34,080
okay so um so we had uh so last time we

87
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:40,600
talked about the theorem we didn't prove

88
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:40,600
it that the real is a complete

89
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,800
uh order field,

90
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:55,600
right? And so in particular, it was an

91
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:57,680
order set uh that was uh also a field

92
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,080
and it was complete, right? And so

93
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:04,560
again, complete meant so if you had a

94
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:06,320
subset a here, which was a subset of of

95
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:10,840
R,

96
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,840
then uh A is bounded.

97
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:16,910
It's bounded from above.

98
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:16,910
[Applause]

99
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,360
Uh if there exist

100
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:35,000
uh m in uh r such that

101
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,000
for all

102
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:43,680
uh a in a

103
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:46,479
a here is less equal to m. So,

104
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,840
and then if that's the case, then we say

105
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:53,720
that and M here

106
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,720
is set to be

107
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,320
uh an upper bound.

108
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,880
Likewise, might likewise

109
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:25,080
uh if um if a here is a subset of r

110
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,080
uh uh then we say that

111
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,560
that uh a is bounded from below.

112
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,240
If there exist

113
00:06:49,039 --> 00:07:03,080
uh little m in in R such that

114
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:03,080
uh m here is less than a for all Okay.

115
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,720
Okay.

116
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:12,160
So, this is upper and lower bounds.

117
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:16,639
Okay. And several people ask on on Piaza

118
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:20,199
they ask um you know they were a little

119
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,199
unclear about

120
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:26,960
um you know where does this M capital M

121
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,520
where does this have to be in what set

122
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:33,039
does it have to be? And likewise for

123
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:35,199
this little M, right? And so let me try

124
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:38,000
to give you some example and I try to do

125
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,599
that on P, but let me just uh just

126
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,199
because several people were asking about

127
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:46,479
it, let me just say again. So that this

128
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:49,039
capital M when you have it like this,

129
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:52,639
this capital M does not need to be in

130
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:55,800
the set, right? A is bounded. So here's

131
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,800
an example.

132
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:02,240
If you're looking at the set 0 one. So

133
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:05,840
this is the interval. This is the

134
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:08,000
interval but it does not contain zero

135
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,400
and it does not contain one but it

136
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,639
contain everything in between zero and

137
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,360
one.

138
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:19,280
This one here is bounded. So this if

139
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:21,919
this here is a and we think about a here

140
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:26,280
as a subset of r

141
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,280
then a is bounded

142
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:32,719
and so one usually say it's bounded if

143
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,719
it's it's it's both from above and

144
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,719
below.

145
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,120
All right. So if one just say that it's

146
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,839
bounded then one means that it's bound

147
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,839
from above and below

148
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:55,600
it's bounded

149
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:58,839
and uh right and so because like bounded

150
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,839
from above

151
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:07,120
about because you can just you have that

152
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:09,920
if x here is in this interval then of

153
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,959
course x is lesser or equal to one right

154
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:15,360
in fact it's strictly less than one

155
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:19,680
Right?

156
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:22,399
But you see this set here, there is no

157
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:25,839
element in the set that is an upper

158
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:28,560
bound for this set, right? The upper

159
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,880
bound is outside the set, but it is an

160
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:35,200
all of our and that's that's fine,

161
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:37,519
right? An upper bound uh is will

162
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:41,200
typically just be in a larger set. And

163
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:43,600
the same with uh with

164
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,560
with lower bound.

165
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,800
Now these this kind everything on this

166
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,519
board except this theorem but you know

167
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,440
this in terms of ordered sets right has

168
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:57,920
nothing to do you know it's just much

169
00:09:53,440 --> 00:10:02,120
more general than R. So if you take if S

170
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,120
here is an ordered set

171
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,760
and A here is a subset

172
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,760
it's a subset.

173
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:21,519
So it's a ordered set. So so it it's a

174
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:24,160
set with an ordering. And if a here is a

175
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:28,079
subset of s

176
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:31,720
then again we can say that uh a is

177
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,720
bounded from above.

178
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:42,040
If um if uh there exist

179
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:52,560
m again m does not have to be an a

180
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:56,560
but it can be just in the larger set so

181
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:59,519
that such that

182
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:05,760
for all

183
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:09,200
a in a it's lesser equal to m

184
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:11,839
Right? So this is just this is like the

185
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,720
definition in general being bounded

186
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:18,079
above if you have a order set and you

187
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:20,640
have a subset. Right? And now just to

188
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:24,959
illustrate it. So typically we're going

189
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:27,680
to think about where the set is with a

190
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:29,279
usual ordering and you have a subset of

191
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,399
it and you talk about whether it's

192
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:34,720
bounded from above or below.

193
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:37,279
But of course, you could also do it in

194
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:41,519
in a more general setting like this,

195
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:43,519
right? And so here's an example

196
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,360
that if you look at which maybe is

197
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:51,040
counterintuitive,

198
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:55,600
but if you take if s here is

199
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:57,519
is the half line. So it's it's all the

200
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,040
real numbers

201
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:03,519
between

202
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:05,839
uh say zero and infinity.

203
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:08,480
Um

204
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:12,560
and um

205
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:14,880
and then uh you would have a here is a

206
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:18,839
subset

207
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,839
zero to one.

208
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:26,480
Right?

209
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:29,920
Now a here and the ordering. So this is

210
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:32,000
this is of course a subset of r but you

211
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,399
should forget about r. I mean you know

212
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,560
you know the ordering from r but forget

213
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:40,639
about it because this is now what you

214
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:43,440
think about the set s right?

215
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:46,720
And so if you're looking at A as a

216
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:49,959
subset of this then A here A is bounded

217
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,959
from above.

218
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:03,600
Right? Why? This is just because for all

219
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,480
a in in a you have that A here is

220
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:10,800
strictly less than one. So one here is

221
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:15,040
an upper bound for A. Right? But now

222
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:18,160
think about does this set here has a

223
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:21,839
lower bound, right?

224
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:24,240
Well, a lower bound have to be inside

225
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:27,440
this set S, right? Because we're

226
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,279
thinking about this here as a subset of

227
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,399
this ordered set. We don't think about

228
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:35,279
it as a subset of the real line. But if

229
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:39,040
you think about it as a subset of this

230
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:42,399
set here, then there is no lower bound,

231
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:44,720
right? because zero is not in this set

232
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:47,519
and no negative numbers in this set. So

233
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:51,760
this here so and this seems maybe a

234
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:54,399
little bit counterintuitive but a is not

235
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:58,040
is not

236
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,040
bounded from below

237
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:07,320
as a subset of

238
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,279
of s. Obviously it is bounded from below

239
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,000
if you were thinking about it as a

240
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:16,320
subset of real real line. But if you

241
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,600
think about it as a subset of S, it's

242
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:23,170
not bounded from below.

243
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:26,800
Okay. So

244
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:29,920
[Applause]

245
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:33,600
another person was asking the infinite

246
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:36,079
and minus infinity those are not uh real

247
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:39,079
numbers. Okay.

248
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,079
>> Yeah.

249
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:47,639
try.

250
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,639
>> Yeah.

251
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:56,160
>> Uh

252
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:58,079
uh if it's not directly stated that if

253
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,639
that it's not directly stated that

254
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:03,199
there's a set S

255
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,680
uh and then it has to be a subset of

256
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:10,160
that set, right? then it would be

257
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:14,240
assumed that is a yeah a of course you

258
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:15,760
welcome to to ask on pat is you know I

259
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,560
don't have the homework here but but but

260
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:21,600
I would say that you're safe if it's if

261
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,760
it's not stated directly what the larger

262
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,040
set is then you can assume it's are

263
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,560
because we're going to concentrate

264
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:30,480
mostly on our this is another

265
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:32,720
distinction between Ruden and and this

266
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,600
book that is the main textbook ruden is

267
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,600
more abstract than the main textbook we

268
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:41,680
are using

269
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:43,760
in particular. Um you know the this the

270
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,000
main textbook here and I'll do the same

271
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:48,720
in my lectures is that a lot of things

272
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,399
are motivated from R and then you

273
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:54,639
abstract afterwards. So whereas ruden

274
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:57,199
starts with abstraction and then it

275
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,199
specializes to R and and of course

276
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:02,000
there's you know there's an argument for

277
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:03,600
maybe starting with a familiar and then

278
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,839
abstract instead of doing the other way

279
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:09,399
around.

280
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,399
Okay so

281
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:17,600
right and so for a whether it's just a

282
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:21,399
order set I mean just in general so so

283
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,399
remember that completeness

284
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,880
So completeness. So this is when you

285
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:33,279
have a order set.

286
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:36,519
So if you have a order set and a here is

287
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,519
a subset

288
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:43,000
uh of s that is bounded from above

289
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,519
from above.

290
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:57,279
uh then if this if it is complete if S

291
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:01,079
is complete. So if

292
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:01,079
S is complete

293
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:07,120
then any subset that is bounded from

294
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:10,319
above

295
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:16,679
uh has a has a least upper bound. Then

296
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:16,679
uh then a has a list

297
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,559
upper bound.

298
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:29,440
Okay. And that least upper bounds is

299
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:33,600
denoted by the soup

300
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:36,080
of a. Right? So, so this thing here it

301
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:42,000
has the property

302
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:44,320
that uh that a is lesser equal to m for

303
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:51,039
all

304
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:57,039
uh a in a and also if

305
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:59,600
m_1 is another upper bound

306
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,600
upper bound

307
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,840
for a

308
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:11,240
then

309
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:11,240
uh m is less or equal to m.

310
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:20,160
So that's a least ups

311
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:23,760
and the same thing is so similarly

312
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:28,400
when we have a order set and we have a

313
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:31,400
set if it's complete and if we have

314
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,400
uh

315
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:40,679
if uh a here

316
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,679
is bound from below Boom.

317
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,880
Then uh then

318
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:59,760
uh infair

319
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:04,360
of A is the least up is the

320
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,360
the largest the greatest

321
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,799
uh lower bound

322
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:20,960
for A right. So this again means that

323
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:25,520
this number here little M. So M here is

324
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:28,720
lesser equal to A for all

325
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:36,280
A in A.

326
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:36,280
And if M1 here is another lower bound.

327
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:51,760
then uh m1 here is less or equal to m.

328
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:56,960
So this is the symmetric property.

329
00:19:51,760 --> 00:20:00,720
And so again r the reals uh is complete.

330
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:02,799
So whenever you take a bounded subset of

331
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,679
the real so if it's bounded that means

332
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:08,640
that it's bounded from above and below

333
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:10,640
then it has a least upper bound and a

334
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:15,760
greatest lower bound. Okay. And those

335
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:19,840
are are denoted by soup and if right and

336
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:23,600
and in general soup and in are not in

337
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:25,760
the set itself in the set a right

338
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:29,400
I mean they could be but in general they

339
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,400
wouldn't be. Yeah.

340
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:34,200
>> Yeah.

341
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,200
>> Yeah.

342
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:40,080
>> That's as right. Uh so

343
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:42,799
uh no so so if you're looking at this

344
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:46,880
set here right

345
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:49,360
so suppose that this here is is the set

346
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,280
um

347
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,880
uh

348
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,640
um

349
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:59,440
um

350
00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:03,840
uh s then and if you take a here is a

351
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:07,200
subset of s and a here is bounded from

352
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:10,200
let's say that a there is bounded from

353
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,200
below,

354
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:21,440
right? If it's bounded from below,

355
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,280
you know, then it couldn't be this set

356
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,600
here.

357
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:28,320
This here is not bounded from below,

358
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,880
right? So, it sort of means that if it's

359
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:33,760
bounded from below, then a here could

360
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,960
not have numbers that was approaching

361
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:38,159
zero.

362
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,919
Right? And so actually if it is bounded

363
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,520
from below,

364
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:44,000
if it's a subset of this and it's

365
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:46,559
bounded from below, then actually it

366
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:50,919
would have a least lower bound lower

367
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:50,919
bound, right? You should mean

368
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,960
so it is it is I mean I'm not going to

369
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:58,159
prove anything is complete or not

370
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:02,360
complete but but it's pretty convincing

371
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,360
that it is actually complete.

372
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,960
Um in this sense there's an other sense

373
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,520
that is not complete but but anyway in

374
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:16,320
this sense it is complete. Yeah. No it's

375
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:18,640
it's it's a little bit uh it can be

376
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,480
confusing. Later on we'll talk about

377
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,520
maybe some other notion of completeness

378
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:27,120
and then it's not complete but but this

379
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:29,679
notion it is complete.

380
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:32,640
Okay. So, so

381
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:34,880
um the the the next thing I want to get

382
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:39,600
to is this with how to write a

383
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:41,760
mathematical proof. Okay. And so and and

384
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:44,960
again

385
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:47,840
I mean that's a super important thing to

386
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:52,880
learn in this class.

387
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:56,400
Uh and and it's not just a

388
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:59,120
it's not just a

389
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:01,679
a formal thing.

390
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:03,679
Uh I mean, you know, it Yeah. I mean, it

391
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:08,000
may seem like a formal thing, you know,

392
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:11,200
why bother with that? Uh uh but it's

393
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,840
really really useful and the more

394
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,799
complicated things become, the more

395
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:20,720
useful it is.

396
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:23,120
And so um so I want to illustrate this

397
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:26,480
with how to write a mathematical proof.

398
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:30,840
So I going going to illustrate this. So,

399
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,840
so we will illustrate it

400
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:45,000
by by uh proving again by by by uh by

401
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,000
writing a

402
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:50,039
a formal proof

403
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,960
of time

404
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:02,159
square root of two

405
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:05,039
is a real number.

406
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:08,320
So I want to write a a I want to you

407
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:11,440
know so last time we talked about that

408
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:14,480
square root of two was a real number and

409
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:17,440
but that what we when we proved it it

410
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:20,960
was more like we talked about the idea

411
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,799
and so and so then the question is so if

412
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,679
you have like you imagine you have a

413
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:27,520
piece of scrap paper what we did last

414
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:30,799
time was what you would be writing on

415
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:32,880
the scrap paper. So I want to talk about

416
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:35,279
you know if you were handing it in or

417
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,679
showing it to something somebody then

418
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:40,799
you wouldn't do that

419
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:43,039
uh you would do what we do now and but

420
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:45,440
it doesn't necessarily make for a great

421
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:48,400
a formal proof doesn't necessarily make

422
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,240
for a great lecture because it's kind of

423
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:55,440
formal.

424
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:58,640
So, so, so let me try to explain how you

425
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:01,520
should should write this. And again,

426
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:05,039
this is a very simple example.

427
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:08,240
Um, but hopefully it will give you an

428
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:11,919
idea of what to do. And again, this is a

429
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:14,559
really important part of this class that

430
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:18,559
you know you you're bound to use in many

431
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:21,200
other classes later on.

432
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:23,520
Okay. So let's first talk about what was

433
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:27,840
square root of two. So square root of

434
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:30,960
two this here was a number and it was

435
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:34,960
given by that it has a property that

436
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:38,000
it's positive and when you square it

437
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:41,880
then you get two right that was what

438
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,880
square root of two was.

439
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,799
Now

440
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:50,159
um

441
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:54,760
so we again so we want to prove so this

442
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:54,760
is the theorem. So theorem

443
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:02,559
square root of two is a real number.

444
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:06,840
So I know maybe I should write it more

445
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:06,840
formally. there exist

446
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:19,120
alpha greater than zero. Uh

447
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:22,960
there's alpha in r with

448
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:28,039
alpha greater than zero and alpha

449
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:28,039
squared is equal to two. Okay.

450
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:36,360
Now we look at the set

451
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:36,360
uh A.

452
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:45,039
The set A is the numbers uh the it's the

453
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:49,559
uh X

454
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:49,559
such that X is positive

455
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:56,159
uh and

456
00:26:54,159 --> 00:27:00,640
uh X²

457
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,640
is lesser equal to two.

458
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:10,880
Yeah. So x here and so now I was

459
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:12,240
specialized to the real numbers. So that

460
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,440
was why I didn't actually write it but

461
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:17,919
but you're right. Certainly can't hurt.

462
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:22,360
Uh okay. So that's the theorem and so

463
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:22,360
now we try to write a formal proof.

464
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:29,559
Uh observe first

465
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:41,559
that

466
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:41,559
um a here is non empty

467
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:49,840
since

468
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:52,640
one is in a right one is positive and

469
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:55,200
when you square one you get one so this

470
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:58,240
is definitely less or equal to two so a

471
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:03,320
here is non

472
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:03,320
Um uh next observe

473
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,520
that

474
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:18,520
uh a here

475
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:18,520
is bounded is bounded from above.

476
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:27,440
In general, by the way, when you write a

477
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:29,360
proof, then you then you really only try

478
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,679
to establish the properties that you

479
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,200
need because otherwise it's confusing.

480
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,760
If you establish all kind of other

481
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:38,720
property that is not needed, that just

482
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:41,720
makes it confusing. So it's bounded from

483
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,720
above

484
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:47,960
and this is just because

485
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,960
um since

486
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:54,760
since uh two is an upper bound

487
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:05,760
for

488
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,919
okay

489
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:11,679
now the next thing here. So now we have

490
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:18,640
a non- empty bounded subset. So we set

491
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:24,520
so set alpha equal to the soup of a

492
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:24,520
and we we want to prove want to show

493
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:35,080
that alpha is positive and alpha squ is

494
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,080
equal to 2.

495
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:40,670
[Applause]

496
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,989
Well,

497
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:43,989
[Applause]

498
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:55,360
right by definition the way we defined

499
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:58,480
uh

500
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:04,600
the way we defined a all the elements in

501
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:04,600
a were positive. So by definition

502
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:14,760
uh uh uh zero is a lower bound.

503
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:23,360
So so you for sure have that zero here

504
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:26,799
is less or equal to well it's actually I

505
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:28,960
mean even one is a lower bound. So, so

506
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:33,120
uh we can also just say that one since

507
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:36,080
one is a lower bound since since one

508
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:41,440
here is in a you also have that this

509
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:43,120
alpha here must be bigger equal to one

510
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:47,039
because it was supposed to be an upper

511
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:50,960
bound for a. So in particular

512
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:54,399
now um

513
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:57,600
and so we have that alpha is less than

514
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:59,919
one and it's the least upper bound and

515
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:02,159
two was an upper bound. So you are to

516
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:04,240
have this

517
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:08,159
since uh maybe I should write if you

518
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:12,279
write write it with this uh since since

519
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:12,279
one is an a we have

520
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:19,760
that one here lesser equal to alpha.

521
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:22,240
Uh

522
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,760
and

523
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:29,000
since

524
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:29,000
alpha is the least of a bound

525
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:42,760
and true is an upper bound.

526
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:47,799
We have

527
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:54,880
that alpha is less than equal to two.

528
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:56,960
Okay. Now remember I mean we're going to

529
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:59,600
do it exactly like we did last time but

530
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:02,080
we're just going to write it down uh in

531
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:04,240
a proper way as a proof. Right? So

532
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:07,679
remember that last time we then divided

533
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:13,039
the proof into two steps.

534
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:15,600
Uh the first step was uh so part one.

535
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:17,919
So, so, so now, so all we need to prove,

536
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:20,919
maybe I'll just say that all we need to

537
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:20,919
prove

538
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:30,480
to show

539
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:32,240
is that alpha square is equal to two,

540
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,840
right? Because we already have it as

541
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,159
positive now because it's bigger than

542
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:39,039
one, right?

543
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:41,360
And so there was two parts to this to

544
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:43,039
step one and step two or step part one

545
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:46,399
and part two.

546
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:49,399
The first part was so part one we will

547
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:49,399
show

548
00:32:53,760 --> 00:33:00,399
that uh alpha squared

549
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:03,720
is less or equal to

550
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:03,720
uh two

551
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:12,360
and so we prove this. So

552
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,960
assume not

553
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:23,320
uh we will show that that leads

554
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,720
that. Um

555
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:38,120
this

556
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,120
leads to

557
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,320
a contradiction

558
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:55,320
to that alpha is the least upper bound

559
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,960
for

560
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:08,240
I mean I'm writing everything out here

561
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:10,560
right just to illustrate is right as you

562
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:13,760
get more and more familiar with this

563
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:15,839
right then the structure is the same but

564
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,839
you know some of these steps will seem

565
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:20,159
almost too trivial and that's probably

566
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:23,440
fine right but of course it's always

567
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:26,440
good to air on more details than fewer

568
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,440
details

569
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:35,760
okay so so this is what we want to do so

570
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:38,399
so we assume not so assume

571
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,399
so assume

572
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:47,280
that alpha squared is strictly bigger

573
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:49,359
than two. Right?

574
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,919
Then and this is where it sort of

575
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:54,000
deviate more from how we did it last

576
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:55,839
time

577
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,880
and that's why you know what we did last

578
00:34:55,839 --> 00:35:03,119
time is really what you want to have on

579
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:06,960
on the scrap paper. I mean that's what

580
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:10,640
we did last time was like the idea and

581
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:14,240
then once you see the idea then you try

582
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:16,480
to write it as a formal proof like what

583
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:21,599
we do now

584
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:23,440
and so so so assume not

585
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:28,160
set

586
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:33,920
h equal to so I'm going to set h equ= to

587
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:37,440
alpha^ 2 - 2 over 4 alpha.

588
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:39,280
Okay. Right. Obviously, if this was like

589
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,720
the first time you would do it, you

590
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,720
wouldn't just come up with this sort of

591
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:44,720
thing, right? I mean, this is coming

592
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:47,599
from the scrap paper that you have,

593
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:51,240
right? You're setting h equal to that.

594
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:51,240
And then you observe

595
00:35:51,839 --> 00:36:03,119
you observe that since since uh

596
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:08,000
since alpha here is bigger than one and

597
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:12,000
uh alpha squared is bigger than two.

598
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:14,800
Since that right then the nominator here

599
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:21,320
is positive and the denominator is

600
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:21,320
positive. So h here is positive right?

601
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:28,720
You also have that you also have that h

602
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:30,560
is um

603
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:33,040
uh

604
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:37,440
uh right you also have automatically

605
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:40,720
that uh that h is maybe we don't need

606
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:46,880
that. Let's see if we need that.

607
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:52,640
Uh okay. So now uh you def set

608
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:55,440
uh alpha 1 equal to uh alpha

609
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:57,839
minus h.

610
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:01,079
And what I want to prove is so we want

611
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:01,079
to show

612
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:15,720
that uh alpha here alpha 1 is an upper

613
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,720
bound

614
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,280
for a.

615
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:26,480
So I want to prove that this is an upper

616
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:29,040
bound for a the first thing I want to do

617
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:31,200
if it's an upper bounds it does need to

618
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,800
be need to be positive. So let's check

619
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:36,560
that.

620
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:39,280
So um so since

621
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:43,200
uh since

622
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:46,400
so since

623
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:50,480
we already have that h was positive so

624
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:51,520
this here was h was positive alpha^ 2 -

625
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,760
2

626
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:56,400
over 4 alpha.

627
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:59,200
Right? This thing here is less or equal

628
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:01,680
to I can even forget about the two. So I

629
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:04,880
can write it as alpha squar over 4

630
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:09,040
alpha. And so this here is I can just

631
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:12,079
divide by alpha. So I get alpha over 4.

632
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:16,400
So I have since we have that h here is

633
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:18,640
less than alpha over 4 then

634
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:22,160
uh alpha 1

635
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:26,400
is uh is bigger than

636
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:30,880
uh is bigger equal to 3/4

637
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:33,359
of uh of alpha right

638
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:36,640
because I'm subtracting at most alpha

639
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:39,680
over 4 and so there's still 3/4 of alpha

640
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:41,680
left right so I have This in particular,

641
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:44,640
this thing here, it's actually bigger

642
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:47,640
than 3 over 4, but I just need it to be

643
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,640
positive.

644
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:58,599
So, it's positive. So,

645
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:58,599
so alpha over alpha 1 is positive.

646
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:04,880
Now, I'm looking at alpha 1 squared,

647
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:09,920
right?

648
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:12,960
And so alpha 1^ 2 is uh is equal to

649
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:15,960
alpha minus h

650
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,960
squared.

651
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:26,240
So this here is equal to alpha^ 2 + h^ 2

652
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:29,040
- 2 alpha h.

653
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:33,280
Okay.

654
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:36,400
And this thing here is less or equal to

655
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:42,640
uh alpha squared.

656
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:45,520
Uh here h here is uh h is uh so now I

657
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:47,200
like to say that h is lesser equal to

658
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:49,440
one.

659
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:52,480
Uh actually I'm going to use that it's

660
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:54,640
less than a half. And why is that the

661
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:57,119
case? It's actually

662
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:59,920
uh alpha itself. We already know that

663
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:04,079
alpha was less than two. So you have

664
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:08,640
that this thing here is less or equal to

665
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:11,640
2 over 4. So this is equal to a half.

666
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,640
Right?

667
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:23,200
Um so now uh now I have that

668
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:25,440
um now I have that this thing here is

669
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:29,119
less than

670
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:32,800
um then plus

671
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:35,200
um here I can here I I just use that

672
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:37,359
it's less than

673
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:40,960
uh this thing here by this here I just I

674
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:42,960
think it's fine to just use uh h here I

675
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:45,440
could use h over two. Maybe I'll use h

676
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:48,160
over two. So one of the h I just replace

677
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:52,640
by a half that is an upper bound and the

678
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:58,000
other one uh I just keep right.

679
00:40:52,640 --> 00:41:01,599
So I have that and then minus 2 alpha h.

680
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:04,480
But if you multiply alpha

681
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:09,599
by h then it's disappear in the

682
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:14,720
denominator. So you're getting minus 2

683
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:21,240
and then you're getting uh alpha squared

684
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:21,240
- 2 over uh 4

685
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:29,920
right and so here you get this here

686
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:33,119
becomes uh alpha squared

687
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:35,040
uh plus and here I'm just writing in and

688
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:38,880
I think it's at the moment we're sort of

689
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:41,920
overkilling it here. Um, and so I can

690
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:46,560
replace this one here. So, uh, right,

691
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:52,960
let me just write it in. Alpha 2 - 2

692
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:58,880
over, uh, 2 * 4 * alpha, right?

693
00:41:52,960 --> 00:42:01,440
And this thing here is alpha 2 - 2 / 2.

694
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:05,319
This two cancel with one of those two.

695
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,319
So, this is what I have.

696
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:12,720
Uh and so now I get

697
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:14,880
that uh this thing here

698
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:22,119
is so

699
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:22,119
so I get that this thing here is uh um

700
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:28,640
uh

701
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:32,480
we adding it here. So this thing here is

702
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:35,839
uh alpha squared. So, let's just let me

703
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:39,040
just bring these two together. Let me u

704
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:41,680
let me just maybe I'll just uh combine

705
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:43,680
all of these. I don't think I need it

706
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:46,680
this well.

707
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,680
Um

708
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:53,839
um right. So, if I if I combine these

709
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:58,240
two here, I think I'm fine with just

710
00:42:53,839 --> 00:43:03,920
having a a two here. H four, sorry,

711
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:07,520
instead of the two. So if I if I do that

712
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:08,800
then I get alpha squared

713
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,960
maybe I should just bring it on the

714
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:13,520
common denominator. So this here this

715
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:16,319
alpha sorry I'm get rid of I'm just I'm

716
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:20,160
replacing I'm bounding this from above

717
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:22,079
by alpha squar plus

718
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,760
and I'm going to I'm going to just make

719
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:26,480
it easy for myself. So I think it's fine

720
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:29,119
to just uh use that alpha is bounded by

721
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:35,359
one and then you can just bound it by

722
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:42,560
alpha squared minus 2 uh over 4

723
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:45,760
uh and uh and this in here is uh is

724
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:50,880
alpha squared

725
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:53,040
minus 2 over 2 right here again I'm just

726
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:59,680
using that alpha was bigger equal to

727
00:43:53,040 --> 00:44:02,880
one. Uh and um right and then I I just

728
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:07,319
actually ignore this true right. So this

729
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:07,319
is definitely an upper bound.

730
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:14,240
And so now you see that this thing here

731
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:16,079
is equal to alpha squared. This thing

732
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:18,240
here you can think about this thing

733
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:24,720
here. You can write this in here if you

734
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:32,000
will as alpha^ 2 + alpha^ 2 - 2 over 4 -

735
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:34,960
2 alpha^ 2 - 2 over over 4.

736
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:42,240
And so what you get is that it's alpha^

737
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:46,000
2 minus alpha^ 2 - 2 over 4.

738
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:48,400
Right? And this thing here is now this

739
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,240
thing here is positive right because

740
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:52,800
alpha square was strictly bigger than

741
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:57,200
two. This is positive. So this is

742
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:59,839
strictly less than alpha square right.

743
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:03,760
And so this here would also which is

744
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:06,480
still right. This is

745
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:10,079
right. So this thing here is also an

746
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:12,640
upper bound. Uh, sorry. Sorry. Oh, I

747
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:16,359
need to Oh, sorry.

748
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:16,359
Okay. So, I have this.

749
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:31,560
No, no, sorry about that.

750
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:31,560
Okay. So, yeah. No, I I sorry. I um

751
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:36,839
Okay, let let's go over this again.

752
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:36,839
Sorry.

753
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,319
So what I'm trying to prove here I'm

754
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:44,480
trying to write down the formal I mean

755
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:47,440
that that's a problem that it got so

756
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:51,040
formal that that I was now in. So what

757
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:54,480
I'm trying to prove here is that I want

758
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:56,079
to say this part one is that alpha

759
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:59,839
squared

760
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:02,240
is lesser equal to to one. Right? This

761
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:05,359
is what less equal to two. That's what I

762
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:08,000
want to prove. Right? This is part one,

763
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:10,960
right? And so I assume not so I assume

764
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:14,560
that alpha square was strictly bigger

765
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:17,599
than two, right? If alpha square was

766
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:21,680
strictly bigger than two, here you have

767
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:24,720
zero. Here you have alpha and now we

768
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:28,560
define this alpha zero.

769
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:31,280
Alpha zero was to the left so to speak

770
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:33,520
of alpha because it was subtracting a

771
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:36,079
little bit

772
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:38,640
and what I want to show is that this

773
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:41,520
alpha zero I want to show that this

774
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:44,640
alpha zero is also an upper bound so I

775
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:46,720
want to prove that this square here is

776
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:49,680
also bigger than two that's what I want

777
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:53,599
to prove right

778
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:55,599
so I want to find I want to to find a

779
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:58,160
lower bound B and that lower bound

780
00:46:55,599 --> 00:47:01,200
should be two. Right? So this is not

781
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:03,920
exactly what I wanted to do. Okay? So

782
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:06,079
let's just go through it here. Sorry. So

783
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:09,040
this here was correct and this here is

784
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:11,760
for really for the second part.

785
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:14,160
Uh

786
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:17,280
okay.

787
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:21,359
So we define it like this.

788
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:24,560
And now I say that this thing here

789
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:27,839
is bigger equal to

790
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:30,800
But I want to bound it from below. And

791
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:33,280
so then I can ignore the h squ. So it's

792
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:39,359
bigger than because that's positive just

793
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:42,800
bigger than alpha^ 2 - 2 alpha h. Right?

794
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:47,280
And this thing here is so this is equal

795
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:52,800
to alpha squar minus 2 alpha. I fill in

796
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:54,720
what h was. This here was h

797
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:58,960
right

798
00:47:54,720 --> 00:48:02,319
and uh and uh then you see that this

799
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:04,960
here cancel with that and this here and

800
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:07,119
you're getting that you're getting alpha

801
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:12,480
squared

802
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:18,800
uh uh this is this alpha squar minus

803
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:22,319
uh alpha^ 2 - 2 / 2

804
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:26,880
And this thing here is equal to this is

805
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:30,240
equal to alpha squared over two. This is

806
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:33,119
subtracting that and then you're adding

807
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:37,520
right you're adding one. So this is what

808
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:41,119
it is right alpha we have already proven

809
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:44,800
that alpha here was bigger equal to one.

810
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:46,559
So, so using so this here is bigger

811
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:51,880
equal to I claim that this here is

812
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:51,880
bigger equal to two using

813
00:48:51,920 --> 00:49:00,000
that

814
00:48:53,599 --> 00:49:04,160
alpha is uh bigger equal to one right

815
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,520
and so you see that alpha one that is a

816
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:09,280
smaller number because you're

817
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:12,960
subtracting a positive number from alpha

818
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:14,960
that is also an upper bound right. So

819
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:18,880
this is contradicting. So this

820
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:22,079
contradict and then one often writes uh

821
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:25,359
one often writes this symbol here. This

822
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:29,720
is a standard symbol that means this is

823
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:29,720
a contradiction. Yeah.

824
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:34,599
>> Yeah.

825
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:42,800
>> Yeah. Then you get two. But that's fine.

826
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:47,119
I just needed to show I all I needed to

827
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:50,559
do was I needed to prove

828
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:53,119
that I I I I have that. So So you see

829
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:56,240
that I have that I'm assuming that this

830
00:49:53,119 --> 00:50:00,880
thing here is strictly positive and then

831
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:03,920
I define alpha 1 but alpha 1 is strictly

832
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:06,880
less than alpha. Right? And then I have

833
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:09,599
that alpha squar alpha squar alpha 1

834
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:13,359
squared is bigger equal to two. This

835
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:17,280
here means that alpha 1 is also an upper

836
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:19,680
bound. This is strictly less than alpha.

837
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:22,880
This was supposed to be the least upper

838
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:24,800
bound. That's a contradiction. Right?

839
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:26,559
And so you see I fell into the trap. I

840
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:28,319
was doing it so formally that I lost

841
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:30,240
track of what I was doing. So I was

842
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:32,400
actually in a process of proving the I

843
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:35,520
mean that's a danger with but but the

844
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:38,079
formal proof is is much easier to read

845
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:41,599
afterwards, right? And so you see the

846
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:45,280
difference here with a formal proof was

847
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:47,280
last time we we sort of did a little

848
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:51,200
calculation and then we try to figure

849
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:53,599
out what should this H be and then it

850
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:55,920
sort of came at the end. Right? But but

851
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:58,400
when you write down the formal proof

852
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:59,839
then you would sort of upfront you would

853
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:01,920
already have done that little

854
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:05,839
calculation and you would up front say

855
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:08,960
what h was supposed to be and then you

856
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:11,960
kind of run through the argument. Right.

857
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,960
Yeah.

858
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
>> Sorry.

859
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:27,760
>> Uh um here. So

860
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:30,800
uh if I'm I'm I mean of course alpha is

861
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:33,839
much bigger than one but I'm just using

862
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:36,240
we already we I'm only need here that

863
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:39,920
alpha is bigger equal to one to say that

864
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:42,880
this thing here is bigger equal to two

865
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:46,559
>> sorry

866
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:49,599
>> this is right this is alpha so the the

867
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:53,280
inequality here is that alpha 1 2 is

868
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:54,800
bigger equal to two and I'm using that

869
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:56,960
alpha

870
00:51:54,800 --> 00:52:00,880
at this stage here to conclude this

871
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:03,359
inequality. I'm using

872
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:05,040
uh sorry no no you're right yeah sorry

873
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:07,040
about that you're right I'm using that

874
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:09,599
alpha no I'm not using that I'm using

875
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:11,920
that alpha squared is bigger equal to

876
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:14,720
two yeah sorry that was what you meant

877
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:17,200
yeah saying you

878
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:22,480
okay so that was uh why that was a

879
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:25,599
formal proof of uh parts one and then

880
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:29,280
there's part um

881
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:29,280
part two so the other inequality

882
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:39,400
So, how do we do that?

883
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:39,400
And and and when you write this,

884
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:46,319
when you write this, it's always good to

885
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:48,000
try to explain

886
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:51,520
um

887
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:53,359
what you're going to do and in in in

888
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:55,839
this case what is going to be the

889
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:58,160
contradiction. So let's try to prove

890
00:52:55,839 --> 00:53:01,839
part two and hopefully we get it

891
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:06,240
straight this time. So so part two so I

892
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:09,760
want to show that um so we have so part

893
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:12,319
one was establishing that alpha squar

894
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:15,280
was lesser

895
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:17,040
equal to true. Now we want to prove so

896
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:21,720
part two

897
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:21,720
uh uh want to show

898
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:29,960
that alpha squar is bigger equal to two.

899
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:36,319
And so

900
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:40,440
uh again we're proving this

901
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:40,440
we will show this by contradiction.

902
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:56,760
So

903
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:56,760
assume

904
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:03,760
that

905
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:06,480
alpha squared is strictly less than two.

906
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:09,839
Right?

907
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:11,760
And now it it's it's it's you know it's

908
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:13,520
it's I think it's helpful. Well, you

909
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:17,280
don't necessarily have to do it, but I

910
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:19,839
think it's helpful if you say um maybe

911
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:23,040
it's too, you know, too long, but it's

912
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:25,839
at least helpful to think about uh where

913
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:29,040
is the contradiction coming from. So, if

914
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:31,760
alpha square is less than two,

915
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:35,359
uh in so I I will say it, you don't

916
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:38,760
necessarily have to write it, but indeed

917
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:38,760
we will show

918
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:49,000
that if this is the case

919
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:52,520
is the case

920
00:54:55,839 --> 00:54:58,559
then they exist.

921
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:23,720
uh there exist some numbers alpha 2

922
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:23,720
bigger than alpha such that

923
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:30,800
alpha 2 squared is also less than

924
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:33,800
two.

925
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:33,800
Contradicting

926
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:43,480
that alpha is an upper bound

927
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:55,160
for for for the set A we defined. Okay,

928
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:55,160
that's what we will prove. Okay.

929
00:55:55,839 --> 00:56:03,680
And so we want to find a a a real number

930
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:07,680
that is larger than this

931
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:12,000
but still uh but still uh the square is

932
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:16,319
still less than two. Okay.

933
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:19,319
And so in this case I'm going to

934
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:19,319
so so

935
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:26,000
now we sort of do the you know the

936
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:29,040
structure is going to be the same.

937
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:31,280
you know, we had this little scrap paper

938
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:34,799
where we sort of outline the argument

939
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:38,079
and figure out what H had to be. And so

940
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:40,160
I'm going to use this H. So, so we're

941
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:42,319
going to again maybe I'll just erase

942
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:46,760
this here so we don't get confused with

943
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:46,760
the first part and the second part.

944
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:58,880
Okay.

945
00:56:55,690 --> 00:56:58,880
[Applause]

946
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:20,799
Okay. So,

947
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:23,839
so I'm going to set

948
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:26,880
h again. I'm going to define it very

949
00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:29,760
similar to what I did before, but now I

950
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:32,559
have to remember that I'm assuming that

951
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:37,680
alpha squar is less than two. So I

952
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:41,040
define h to be 2 minus alpha squar over

953
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:45,599
4 alpha.

954
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:49,119
Okay, this is how I define it.

955
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:52,480
uh and then I what I'm interested in is

956
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:55,200
so I have here zero I have this that is

957
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:57,359
supposed to be the upper bound but I

958
00:57:55,200 --> 00:58:01,040
want to prove that that really isn't an

959
00:57:57,359 --> 00:58:05,599
upper bound that's an element in in my

960
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:08,160
set A and so this is this alpha 2 so I'm

961
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:14,480
defy so I'm setting

962
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:16,799
set this and alpha 2 equal to alpha plus

963
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:18,400
h

964
00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:20,160
this here was just to illustrate you

965
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:22,880
shouldn't you don't necessarily have to

966
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:26,880
include that

967
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:29,880
okay and I want to show you we want to

968
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:29,880
show

969
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:34,400
I think it's good idea to write what you

970
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:37,200
want to show in particular if I really

971
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:38,480
had written that before uh then I

972
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:40,559
wouldn't have been in trouble right

973
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:44,559
because I was trying to prove something

974
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:47,960
else uh so you want to prove that alpha

975
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:47,960
squared here

976
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:57,200
is also less than two. Right?

977
00:58:52,400 --> 00:59:01,000
So this is this is so so we already have

978
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:01,000
that alpha here

979
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:07,400
uh is is positive.

980
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:07,400
It's

981
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:18,079
um it's bigger than one. So uh so this

982
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:22,520
number here this here we already know is

983
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:22,520
bigger than alpha. Okay.

984
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:29,920
And so if I can prove that so this here

985
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:32,640
is so this bigger than alpha if I can

986
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:36,000
prove that the square is less than two

987
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:38,000
then alpha here alpha here sorry would

988
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:41,280
not be an upper bound right there's

989
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:43,839
another element in the set uh a that is

990
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:45,920
bigger. Okay.

991
00:59:43,839 --> 00:59:48,559
So I want to prove that. So now I'm

992
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:53,359
looking at alpha

993
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:56,319
2 squared. So that is alpha plus h.

994
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:59,559
Right? That's how I define alpha 2 and I

995
00:59:56,319 --> 00:59:59,559
square it.

996
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:06,240
And if I do that then I get alpha

997
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:08,480
squared plus h 2

998
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:12,160
uh plus

999
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:16,119
um 2 h

1000
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:16,119
uh alpha right

1001
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:24,000
and I now uh so now I want an upper

1002
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:28,480
bound right and so we already have that

1003
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:34,400
alpha is this one here h is you see that

1004
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:39,920
h is in this case here. So h is is equal

1005
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:43,119
to 2 - alpha^ 2 over 4 alpha. Alpha is

1006
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:46,079
bigger equal to one. This here the

1007
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:48,480
denominator is bounded by two. So again

1008
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:50,880
it's 2 over 4. So this is bounded by a

1009
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:54,240
half.

1010
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:58,000
So h is positive

1011
01:00:54,240 --> 01:01:01,040
and we have that h is positive and h is

1012
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:06,240
less than half.

1013
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:08,880
And so now uh I this here I can bound I

1014
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:12,960
can bound trivially by just using that h

1015
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:15,119
is bounded by one. So I get this plus h

1016
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:20,720
+ 2

1017
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:24,319
uh and then h * alpha again or 2 h

1018
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:28,240
alpha. This is right when you multiply

1019
01:01:24,319 --> 01:01:32,240
this by two alpha then the alpha cancel

1020
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:34,079
out and the two cancel with one of these

1021
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:36,400
uh with

1022
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:41,640
two in this form. So you're getting 2

1023
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:41,640
minus alpha squar over two.

1024
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:52,240
Okay. And so now I get that this thing

1025
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:54,559
here is bounded by so h here

1026
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:56,559
h is also

1027
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:59,920
a

1028
01:01:56,559 --> 01:02:01,920
a very rough bound for h is so using

1029
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:07,720
sorry

1030
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:07,720
so using so I have that and now using

1031
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:21,359
that h here is equal = to alpha 2 -

1032
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:22,880
alpha^ 2 / 2 / 4 alpha which is less

1033
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:30,880
than

1034
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:33,760
uh 2 - alpha^ 2 over 2 since

1035
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:37,520
alpha here is bigger than one

1036
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:40,760
right so I have that right so using that

1037
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:40,760
we have

1038
01:02:42,799 --> 01:02:49,599
that alpha 2^ squared is less or equal

1039
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:52,480
to let me just write that line I'm just

1040
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:56,720
now filling in alpha squared to the h

1041
01:02:52,480 --> 01:03:00,400
here I'm using this inequality here 2 -

1042
01:02:56,720 --> 01:03:03,200
alpha^ 2 / 2 and then I have the same

1043
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:06,079
thing again

1044
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:09,920
and so you see that this here it's this

1045
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:14,960
here times 2 so this is just alpha^ 2us

1046
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:18,599
- 2 + 2 -

1047
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:18,599
uh alpha square

1048
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:24,960
and and this inequality here was one of

1049
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:27,440
these inequality I should have replaced

1050
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:29,839
by a strict inequality. This because h

1051
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:31,599
is positive and is strictly less than

1052
01:03:29,839 --> 01:03:33,920
one. So this here is actually a strict

1053
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:36,920
inequality. So this here is a strict

1054
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:36,920
inequality.

1055
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:43,119
Okay. But now you see that this thing

1056
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:46,720
here the alpha cancel out and you're

1057
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:50,319
getting two right so you have that alpha

1058
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:52,880
2 squared is strictly less than two

1059
01:03:50,319 --> 01:03:55,680
that's what we wanted to prove right and

1060
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:58,480
this this this

1061
01:03:55,680 --> 01:04:00,160
gives

1062
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:05,839
that

1063
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:10,799
alpha 2 is also in a and yet

1064
01:04:05,839 --> 01:04:15,240
alpha 2 was bigger bigger than alpha.

1065
01:04:10,799 --> 01:04:15,240
And this is the desired contradiction.

1066
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:29,839
Okay. So again, you know, we already did

1067
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:32,960
this last time, but but the the point

1068
01:04:29,839 --> 01:04:35,119
here is that how do you write down a

1069
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:37,920
formal proof, right? And a formal proof

1070
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:39,920
in this case is that you try very

1071
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:43,599
clearly in this case it was divided into

1072
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:45,599
two steps. So you you you you try to

1073
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:48,319
divide it into the two steps and then

1074
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:53,039
maybe you have a a last line that say

1075
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:58,039
that you know part one part one

1076
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:58,039
and part two together

1077
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:08,000
show

1078
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:11,720
that alpha squ is equal to two. uh

1079
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,720
completing the proof,

1080
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:21,200
right? And again, the point here was

1081
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:23,440
that so we already knew how to prove

1082
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:28,079
this, but like how do you write down a

1083
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:30,240
formal proof, right? And so in in in for

1084
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:32,559
this proof, it was divided into these

1085
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:34,400
two steps. So you try to write each step

1086
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:37,200
separately.

1087
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:39,760
They were both both of the two steps was

1088
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:42,000
proven by contradiction.

1089
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:43,599
And so you would say up front you would

1090
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,359
say that you're going to prove it by

1091
01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:47,680
contradiction.

1092
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:50,079
And then of course there would be you

1093
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:52,079
would you know it the statement that you

1094
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:54,319
want to prove since you're proving it by

1095
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:56,079
contradiction you would assume the

1096
01:05:54,319 --> 01:05:58,720
negation

1097
01:05:56,079 --> 01:06:00,799
and then I think if you can and it

1098
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:04,160
doesn't fill too much I think it's very

1099
01:06:00,799 --> 01:06:05,760
helpful to write what you are trying how

1100
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:08,960
you are trying to get the contradiction

1101
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:11,359
right that's what I tried here right and

1102
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:13,280
then but and then you see then the big

1103
01:06:11,359 --> 01:06:15,920
difference from when we were trying to

1104
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:19,839
figure out how to prove it is that you

1105
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:23,359
now go ahead and you just define

1106
01:06:19,839 --> 01:06:26,079
you define the things. You define H and

1107
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:29,520
alpha 2, right? That sort of seems to

1108
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:32,960
come out of nowhere

1109
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:34,640
and then you establish the property that

1110
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:36,480
you want to prove that that leads to the

1111
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:39,440
contradiction. Okay, that's sort of the

1112
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:43,920
structure.

1113
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:46,920
Are there any questions to this?

1114
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:46,920
Yeah.

1115
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:51,880
>> So,

1116
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:59,520
>> right. So, we're using a few things.

1117
01:06:55,359 --> 01:07:02,240
We're using um I mean and and and uh

1118
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:05,359
we're using a few thing uh we're using

1119
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:08,400
that is ordered that is ordered. We're

1120
01:07:05,359 --> 01:07:11,200
also using uh something about that is a

1121
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:12,720
ordered field. And why? because we're

1122
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:15,119
using something well we're using

1123
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:17,839
something about multiplication to at all

1124
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:20,720
define square root right and also we're

1125
01:07:17,839 --> 01:07:24,240
using something about that one is bigger

1126
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:27,920
than zero right

1127
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:30,079
uh and um

1128
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:33,119
and then

1129
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:35,119
um and then so we're using and then

1130
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:37,359
we're also using of course completeness

1131
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:40,000
in order to define this least upper

1132
01:07:37,359 --> 01:07:42,400
bound right so we're using a bunch of

1133
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:44,799
these things, right? But of course, if

1134
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:47,760
you have

1135
01:07:44,799 --> 01:07:51,200
Yeah. I mean, uh I mean, if you're

1136
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:54,480
asking when I mean and that's not really

1137
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:57,200
I mean you know uh at this stage I mean

1138
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:59,039
like very very soon um in one of the

1139
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:01,520
next few lectures

1140
01:07:59,039 --> 01:08:02,960
things will be in the real numbers. I

1141
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:05,760
mean we're not going to work on general

1142
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:07,520
fields and we're not going to yeah I

1143
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:09,920
mean general fields this is not part of

1144
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:12,480
the subject but you but of course it's

1145
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:14,480
interesting to ask

1146
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:16,880
and you see and and I think that's your

1147
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:19,600
point is like when can you define

1148
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:21,839
something like a square root of two in a

1149
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:23,120
field something like that and and

1150
01:08:21,839 --> 01:08:24,799
there's a lot of things you're

1151
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:26,239
absolutely right that there's a lot of

1152
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:29,040
these things that was just sort of

1153
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:31,839
general property but maybe we shouldn't

1154
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:31,839
get too much into

1155
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:40,159
the so I wanted to there's a few more

1156
01:08:36,239 --> 01:08:42,960
things I was hoping to do. So I also

1157
01:08:40,159 --> 01:08:46,799
wanted to just talk about the

1158
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:51,880
Archimedian property again. And so I

1159
01:08:46,799 --> 01:08:51,880
wanted to again you know just outline

1160
01:08:52,080 --> 01:09:00,640
uh how to write a formal proof and again

1161
01:08:56,960 --> 01:09:03,359
and the reason of course why I'm

1162
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:04,880
illustrating how to write a form the for

1163
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:07,199
the writing a formal proof is an

1164
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:12,000
important part of this class

1165
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:15,440
and and I'm obviously uh using the syncs

1166
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:17,679
that we already proved last time just so

1167
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:20,960
so that you can kind of focus on how to

1168
01:09:17,679 --> 01:09:22,960
not not the proof not the statements why

1169
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:29,159
the statement should be true but just

1170
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:29,159
how to write it. Um and so let's

1171
01:09:29,839 --> 01:09:34,359
let's talk about the Archimedian

1172
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:34,359
property

1173
01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:44,719
and so the Archimedian property just

1174
01:09:40,239 --> 01:09:48,159
saying that so this is the theorem

1175
01:09:44,719 --> 01:09:52,839
that the natural numbers

1176
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:52,839
is not bounded from above. Right?

1177
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:03,440
That's one way of formulating it. Right?

1178
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:06,080
You could also say like we did last time

1179
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:09,199
that whenever you take a real there's a

1180
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:13,440
larger uh natural number than that real,

1181
01:10:09,199 --> 01:10:17,800
right? This but that's the same.

1182
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:17,800
Okay. So now how do we prove this?

1183
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:24,800
So again here we're thinking about

1184
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:26,159
things as being subset of R. We always

1185
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:28,880
you know when when we don't really

1186
01:10:26,159 --> 01:10:31,760
mention it then we always think about it

1187
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:36,560
as being subset of R.

1188
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:39,560
And so we uh we pro we will show this by

1189
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:39,560
contradiction.

1190
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:47,640
by contradiction.

1191
01:10:49,199 --> 01:10:52,440
So suppose

1192
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:59,239
alpha is an upper bound

1193
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:05,560
for the natural numbers.

1194
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:13,159
Well, uh we can assume

1195
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:13,159
after replacing

1196
01:11:17,199 --> 01:11:25,960
uh alpha by by soup of a. We can assume

1197
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:36,520
that alpha

1198
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:36,520
is the least up about

1199
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:52,880
Right. So, and now uh and and then then

1200
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:56,000
I think it's nice again uh to to write

1201
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:58,080
where the contradiction is coming from.

1202
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:01,080
So,

1203
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:01,080
so

1204
01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:05,560
we'll show

1205
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:17,239
We will get the desired contradiction

1206
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:28,040
by showing

1207
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:40,000
that's uh that that's alpha minus one

1208
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:43,800
is also

1209
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,800
an upper bound

1210
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:47,800
contradicting

1211
01:12:50,239 --> 01:12:56,040
that alpha was the least of

1212
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:08,920
okay and So now uh since

1213
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:15,760
since uh alpha so so so this is what we

1214
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:21,880
want to prove that and since

1215
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:21,880
alpha is an upper bound

1216
01:13:26,159 --> 01:13:32,120
for all

1217
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:32,120
natural numbers.

1218
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:37,440
Uh if you add one to the natural number,

1219
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:40,800
this is also this here is also a natural

1220
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:45,440
number, right? N + one is also a natural

1221
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:50,000
number. So n + one must be lesser equal

1222
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:53,480
to this upper bound, right?

1223
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,480
But this implies

1224
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:06,719
that n subtracting one on both side

1225
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:10,159
implies that n is less or equal to alpha

1226
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:13,159
minus one. And this which holds for all

1227
01:14:10,159 --> 01:14:13,159
n

1228
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:29,159
are all natural numbers. So,

1229
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:29,159
alpha minus one is also an upper one.

1230
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:46,640
Okay. And that's and this is this is the

1231
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:48,640
right this this proof gives you this the

1232
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:50,080
side contradiction.

1233
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:52,800
Okay. So that's how you would write

1234
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:56,080
that.

1235
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:58,640
Let me um talk a little bit about

1236
01:14:56,080 --> 01:15:03,719
sequences and we so this will be a big

1237
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:03,719
topic. Uh so sequences

1238
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:12,719
so well first so we talked about that a

1239
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:16,520
little bit. So if you look at at the So

1240
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:16,520
how do we think about

1241
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:27,120
of of square root two uh on the on the

1242
01:15:25,199 --> 01:15:29,360
real line I mean so the way to think

1243
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:32,320
about square root of two is what we did

1244
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:34,880
here that it's this positive thing so

1245
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:40,000
that the square is two right but if you

1246
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:44,000
want to place two on the real line

1247
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:47,199
then uh you could sing about it as one

1248
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:51,280
as a limit of a sequence. If you take

1249
01:15:47,199 --> 01:15:54,140
one and then the one is less than 1.4

1250
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:55,600
which is less than 1.4

1251
01:15:54,140 --> 01:15:57,440
[Music]

1252
01:15:55,600 --> 01:16:00,960
one

1253
01:15:57,440 --> 01:16:02,880
which is less than 1.414

1254
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:06,560
etc.

1255
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:09,280
Right? And so this here is a

1256
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:11,440
sequence. I'll be make that precise in

1257
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:14,640
just a minute. But it's a an increasing

1258
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:18,640
sequence of numbers. And the limit the

1259
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:21,679
limit is square<unk>2. Right? So if you

1260
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:23,600
plug it two in on the calculator, it

1261
01:16:21,679 --> 01:16:25,360
will bring out a lot of digits, right?

1262
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:28,000
And these are the first digits and it

1263
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:30,480
will continue on. And that's how you

1264
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:32,159
think about uh square root of two. If

1265
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:34,640
you want to think about it on the real

1266
01:16:32,159 --> 01:16:38,880
line

1267
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:41,199
and so we want to and so square two is

1268
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:43,120
going to be the limit of these and we

1269
01:16:41,199 --> 01:16:46,880
need to make this precise and we also

1270
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:49,040
need to make precise what really a

1271
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:53,239
sequence is.

1272
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:53,239
So a sequence

1273
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:03,000
so a sequence

1274
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:08,360
of real numbers.

1275
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:22,480
This is a map.

1276
01:17:17,199 --> 01:17:24,640
It's a function from the natural numbers

1277
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:28,320
into R.

1278
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:32,560
So for each natural number you get a

1279
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:34,239
real number and and so right so a

1280
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:36,960
function

1281
01:17:34,239 --> 01:17:40,239
it is you know a function is is defined

1282
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:43,199
by the value at different points. So

1283
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:46,320
this thing here but if it but if you

1284
01:17:43,199 --> 01:17:49,120
want to think about it as a sequence

1285
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:52,880
then it's common to denote it to denote

1286
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:55,679
this here like that. So this is how one

1287
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:59,920
typically write a sequence where instead

1288
01:17:55,679 --> 01:18:03,360
of the you know what the the argument is

1289
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:07,199
this what what this is inside a bracket

1290
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:10,159
you write it as a subscript. Okay.

1291
01:18:07,199 --> 01:18:14,000
So this is a sequence

1292
01:18:10,159 --> 01:18:18,800
and so uh and so in in the case over

1293
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:25,760
there if you're thinking about a1 say to

1294
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:28,080
be equal to 1 a2 to be equal to 1.4 4 83

1295
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:30,560
and now I'm thinking about the sequence

1296
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:34,320
here as I'm thinking about square root

1297
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:37,679
of two and I take the number of you know

1298
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:40,080
the subscript here I'm just taking the

1299
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:42,400
number of digits in square root two so

1300
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:46,320
now I need three digits here I needed

1301
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:56,000
two one 41

1302
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:59,040
a4 is 1.414 4 1 4 etc. Right? And so

1303
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:02,040
so then you have so then a n here is a

1304
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:02,040
sequence

1305
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:08,080
of real numbers

1306
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:12,560
and it's actually increasing that the

1307
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:14,640
sequence a n is less than a n + one. we

1308
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:17,199
have this property

1309
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:20,880
and uh and we want to talk about next

1310
01:19:17,199 --> 01:19:23,199
time we want to talk about uh uh what

1311
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:27,320
does a limit mean?

1312
01:19:23,199 --> 01:19:27,320
What is a limit?

1313
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:33,920
And and so uh square root of two indeed

1314
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:36,400
will be the limit of this sequence and

1315
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:40,960
the limit you write like this sometimes

1316
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:42,880
as n goes to infinity of a n.

1317
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:45,880
But we'll talk about this next time.

1318
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:45,880
Okay.
