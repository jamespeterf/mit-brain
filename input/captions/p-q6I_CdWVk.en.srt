00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,880
A digital twin is a digital

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:07,200
representation of a physical asset or a

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,559
system or a process. In the real estate

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,559
world, we're talking about a digital

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,559
twin of a building. What we'll see is

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,320
huge advancements in specific components

7
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,960
within a building. So, we'll see digital

8
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,960
twins of HVAC systems, of electrical

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,800
systems, of mechanical systems, of

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,560
security systems and space optimization

11
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,840
within a building as well. And what will

12
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,760
happen is over time that they will

13
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,439
integrate into creating one entire

14
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,880
platform to showcase what's taking place

15
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,240
within that building. From that, what

16
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,760
we'll be able to do is create digital

17
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,520
twins, not just of buildings, but of

18
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,880
entire cities. And that's where we're

19
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,640
going to find ourselves delving into the

20
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,399
smart cities of the future. And from

21
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,000
that, we'll be able to create greater

22
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,760
efficiencies from a transportation

23
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,680
standpoint, from an operational

24
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,440
standpoint from within the city, from a

25
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,840
housing component, even the sewage

26
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,760
systems of the cities and then from that

27
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,360
make the decisions that can really make

28
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,320
significant improvements in a short

29
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,800
space of time. For more MIT moments from
