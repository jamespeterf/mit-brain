1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
PROFESSOR: So have you guys
seen the elephant toothpaste

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,450
reaction before?

3
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:07,800
So we're going to react hydrogen
peroxide with potassium iodide,

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,500
in this case, and
I'm going to pour out

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,170
about 10 milliliters of
this and then dilute it

6
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,352
so that our new
concentration is about 7%.

7
00:00:15,352 --> 00:00:16,560
So what's happening in there?

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,670
It's bubbling.

9
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,080
All right, so it's
taking its time.

10
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,740
So while that is going,
we can set up another one.

11
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,010
We said that concentration
effects rate, right?

12
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:27,077
So if that was 7%
hydrogen peroxide,

13
00:00:27,077 --> 00:00:29,160
what do we think is going
to happen if we use 30%?

14
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,050
Let's find out.

15
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:36,498

16
00:00:36,498 --> 00:00:39,970
[AUDIENCE EXCLAIMING]

17
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:40,980
AUDIENCE: Whoa.

18
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,628
PROFESSOR: So hydrogen peroxide
naturally decomposes over time,

19
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:46,170
so this reaction is
always happening.

20
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,220
So you can be
thinking about that

21
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,887
when you are thinking
about what happens

22
00:00:48,887 --> 00:00:51,630
in the cells of your body,
because you are forming

23
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:54,060
these superoxide radicals
and hydrogen peroxide

24
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,410
all the time in your cells.

25
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:56,850
And the reaction
that you just saw

26
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,470
is happening this
many times faster

27
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:00,830
in the cells of your body.
