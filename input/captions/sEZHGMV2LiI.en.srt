1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,560
Okay. Well, we can get started. So, in

2
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:18,320
the first class, we talked about like

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,080
what what is a projection estimate and

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,080
what is projection theory and tried to

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,920
give a little bit of motivation for it.

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,439
Um, and today we'll start getting our

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:29,439
hands on things and looking at examples

8
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,599
and proving theorems. Um now the the uh

9
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:35,440
cleanest setting in which to get started

10
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:37,920
is finite fields. Um and although most

11
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,920
of our class will be working in RN um

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,600
I'm going to start there because the uh

13
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,840
proofs are very clean and the examples

14
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,559
are very clean and it's also it is also

15
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,559
interesting in itself.

16
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,559
Okay.

17
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,800
Okay. So here's our setup.

18
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:09,920
So I'll have fq the finite field with q

19
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:13,520
elements. Um and then uh theta will so

20
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:17,600
then I'll I'll have a map pi sub theta

21
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:20,240
from fq^2 to fq. These will like be our

22
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,040
different projections from fq ^2 to fq.

23
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:30,560
And it's defined by

24
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:34,759
pi theta of x1 x2 is x1 * theta or x1 +

25
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,759
x2 * theta.

26
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,200
Okay. So here theta is also in f.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,520
Okay.

28
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:53,439
Um so now our setup is that we'll have a

29
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:55,439
set of points x in the plane fq ^2 and

30
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,640
we'll think about projecting this set of

31
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,880
points in a bunch of different

32
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,840
directions. So then we'll have a set of

33
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:05,280
directions which is called d.

34
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:09,000
So d is a subset of fq and think of it

35
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,000
as a set of directions.

36
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,959
I'm going to imagine taking this at X

37
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,599
and projecting it in all of these

38
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,360
different directions that are in D. And

39
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,920
we'll see um how big the different

40
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,920
projections are. And um the the thing

41
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,800
I'll measure, I'll call it S, which

42
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,440
depends on X and D, is the size of the

43
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,319
biggest projection.

44
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:39,640
So it's the maximum

45
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:39,640
theta in D of the size of pi theta of X.

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Okay. So, so one thing we study in

47
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,160
projection theory is we like to

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,760
understand for different sizes of X and

49
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,760
D, what can we say about S.

50
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,800
Okay.

51
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:00,959
[Applause]

52
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,440
So, let's look at a couple of examples

53
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,040
and then after that I'll put I'll tell

54
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,560
you some theorems what we know and some

55
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,680
conjecture what we think might be true

56
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,680
based on the examples.

57
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,680
Um

58
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,680
so the first example is a square grid

59
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,120
or integer maybe it's good to say

60
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,840
integer grid.

61
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:31,519
Um so for this example let's suppose

62
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:33,440
that Q is actually prime. Um

63
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,879
you could do similar things if if Q is

64
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:39,200
not prime. It's just easier to write it

65
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:44,400
down. Okay, so our set X is going to be

66
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:46,319
the set X1 X2 where X1 and X2 go between

67
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,680
one and M.

68
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,200
So even though we're over a finite

69
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,000
field, you can think of this as a square

70
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,640
integer grid.

71
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,040
Okay. And then we were saying last time

72
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,959
that if you take this a square grid, an

73
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,560
integer grid, and you do a projection in

74
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,360
a direction that's kind of a rational

75
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,120
angle, um then you get a small

76
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,360
projection. So that's what our set of

77
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:11,200
directions is going to be. Our set of

78
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:13,519
directions is going to be the set of a1

79
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:18,799
over a2

80
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:20,880
where a1 and a2 go from one up to some

81
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,479
a. So n and a are parameters that we can

82
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,240
play with. There are many square grids

83
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,080
many choices.

84
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,360
All right. So now let's figure out what

85
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:34,000
is s of xd. So what happens when I

86
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:36,240
perform a projection of of uh uh of x at

87
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,280
one of these angles?

88
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,280
So if theta is in d

89
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:53,759
and I take pi and if I if x is in x

90
00:04:46,400 --> 00:05:02,000
um so if I take pi theta of uh of x1 x2

91
00:04:53,759 --> 00:05:03,520
then I get um x1 plus a1 over a2 x2

92
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:10,400
and I'm going to put it over a common

93
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:13,639
denominator. So it's a2 x1 + a1 x2

94
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,639
over a2.

95
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,479
All right. Now in this situation, we're

96
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,880
imagining that theta is fixed and we're

97
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,720
varying little x and big x. So we're

98
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,680
going to try to see how big is pi theta

99
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,600
of big x. So I want to see if a is fixed

100
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,600
and I vary x1 and x2, how many different

101
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,120
numbers do I have here? So the

102
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,400
denominator isn't important because it's

103
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,560
not changing. And I want to know how

104
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,120
many different numerators I have. And

105
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,960
the numerator is going to be an integer.

106
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:44,320
And it has size a * n at most plus a *

107
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:48,479
n. So it basically has size a * n. So we

108
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:52,560
see that the size of the projection of x

109
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:54,479
is at most a * n. So this less than with

110
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,080
a squiggle here means there's a constant

111
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,479
factor that I left out. Here it's a

112
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,840
factor of two, but in general squiggle

113
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,720
just means there's some constant factor

114
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,720
left out.

115
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:14,360
Uh okay. And S is the biggest of these.

116
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:14,360
So S uh of XD is around a * M.

117
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,960
Okay. Um

118
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:25,680
so then uh you could do a little algebra

119
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:29,039
to see how S and X and D relate to each

120
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:35,800
other. Um and if you do that you see

121
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:35,800
that uh d is around s^2x.

122
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,160
Okay. So that's how it works in an

123
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,160
integer grid.

124
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,759
And there's one more example um that

125
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,440
that I thought I would mention which we

126
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,280
also mentioned last time. It's an

127
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:59,039
example that comes from sub fields. So

128
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:01,759
if Q is not prime um then FP is an

129
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:06,120
interesting subset of FQ and FP squ is

130
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:06,120
an interesting subset of FQ q^2.

131
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,240
So this is called the subfield example.

132
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,319
So let's say that Q is P ^2. There are

133
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,800
similar phenomenon if Q is a higher

134
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:27,120
power of P but the um the the

135
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,880
computations are a bit different. Um so

136
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,960
if Q is P^ squ um our set X is going to

137
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:37,280
be FP^2

138
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:41,280
sitting in FQ ^2. So the size of X is P

139
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:43,919
^2 which is Q and our set of directions

140
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,720
is going to be FP which is sitting in

141
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:50,720
FQ. So the size of our set of directions

142
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:55,360
is P which is Q to the 12.

143
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:57,919
Um and then if theta is in D

144
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:02,960
then

145
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:08,639
X1 and X2 are in X then pi X1 X2 is in

146
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:10,240
X. Pi theta of X1 X2 is X1 + X2 theta.

147
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:15,039
All those things are in the sub field

148
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:17,360
FP. So this is in FP.

149
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:20,479
Um so therefore

150
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:23,680
the size of pi theta of x is at most p

151
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:26,680
in fact exactly p. Um and so that's our

152
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,680
s.

153
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:30,279
[Applause]

154
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:38,640
Okay. Um and this example coming from

155
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,519
subfields is more extreme than the

156
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:44,000
example coming from grips. Um so if you

157
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:47,760
were to take this value of x and this

158
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,240
value of s and plug them in here

159
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,839
uh to make a sort of a fair comparison

160
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,800
in the grids we would have only one

161
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:57,920
direction if we did that. But here we

162
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:00,240
have many directions. So this thing um

163
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,080
has very small projections in many

164
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,399
different directions even more so than a

165
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,399
square grid.

166
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:19,959
Okay.

167
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,959
So those are a few examples and

168
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,279
and based on that I can tell you a

169
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,120
conjecture that we stated also last time

170
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,720
and also I can tell you some of the

171
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,600
things we know about this conjecture

172
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:36,160
some of the main results.

173
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:40,160
Um

174
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:45,760
okay so first I'll say the conjecture.

175
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:49,200
So if uh Q= P which is prime

176
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:54,000
um and we're in this setup

177
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:57,040
and S is smaller than around X over two.

178
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,360
um then we can't do better than the

179
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,360
square grid.

180
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,600
Okay, so let's explain all the

181
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:15,279
hypotheses in this conjecture. Um so why

182
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:18,800
do we have this? Well, if you take any

183
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:21,760
set D, S of XD is is obviously smaller

184
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,079
than the size of X.

185
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,839
So if s was allowed to be the size of x,

186
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:28,480
then d could be everything and there

187
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,720
would be no no meaningful upper bound on

188
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,279
d. So we have to insist that it's

189
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,640
somewhat smaller than that. Um you you

190
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,720
could ask about the range in between

191
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,480
here and x but there's something to say

192
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,399
but it's I think not not super

193
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,640
interesting. Um so we look at this

194
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:46,160
regime.

195
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:48,160
Okay. Um okay and we have this setup and

196
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,560
why do we also add here that Q is a

197
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,800
prime? Well, we have to add that because

198
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,399
of example two. If Q is not a prime, you

199
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,720
have that example. And we just saw that

200
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,720
this is false.

201
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,200
And this conjecture is plausible in the

202
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:03,120
sense that there's no counter example

203
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,519
that you no one has found an example

204
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,120
that beats the square grid. And

205
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:10,880
basically, no one has found an example

206
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,640
that even is well.

207
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,920
Okay. There are very few examples that

208
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:18,440
are competitive with the square grid.

209
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,440
And they're all small variations of it.

210
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:25,440
Um, okay. You also might wonder uh what

211
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,720
happens if Q is not a prime. And I

212
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,560
haven't seen anyone write down a

213
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:34,000
conjecture for that. Um, I think roughly

214
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:36,320
speaking what people believe is that the

215
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,480
all of the interesting examples should

216
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,399
be of this type or that type or maybe

217
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:45,120
you can combine them a little bit by

218
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:46,959
taking sort of a grid of sub fields. Um

219
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,360
so it would be a reasonable little

220
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:51,519
project if anyone is interested to try

221
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:55,720
to write down the known examples and and

222
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,720
make a conjecture about what happens.

223
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,320
All right. Now this conjecture is open

224
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,079
um but let's start to talk about what we

225
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,519
know. We'll we'll we'll I'm going to

226
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,000
state some theorems for you and we'll

227
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,920
prove the theorems and uh maybe more

228
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,600
importantly we'll introduce some of the

229
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,160
basic techniques in in projection

230
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,120
theory. Okay. So we're going to talk

231
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,600
about two techniques today. One of them

232
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,480
is a double counting argument that has a

233
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,880
combinatorics flavor and the other is a

234
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,880
for analytic argument that's based on

235
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:28,000
orthogonality

236
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:30,800
and this is what they give.

237
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,800
So theorem one which is based on double

238
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,800
counting

239
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:43,680
says if uh we're in this setup

240
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:48,560
and s is smaller

241
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:53,560
than x over two um then the number of

242
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,560
directions is smaller than around pass.

243
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:12,959
Okay. Um, now if S is around X over two,

244
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,800
this is actually sharp.

245
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,240
Um,

246
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,240
hold on, let me look at my notes for a

247
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,240
second.

248
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,000
Okay, actually I wrote that in my notes,

249
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,440
but I'm not quite sure it's true. Let's

250
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,920
just go on and I'll tell you theorem

251
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,680
two.

252
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,920
Um

253
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,720
so theorem two is based on what I'll

254
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:41,600
call a forier method or orthogonality or

255
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:44,800
something like that says if we have the

256
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:49,040
setup and this time if we suppose that s

257
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:50,560
is smaller than q / 2

258
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:56,200
then

259
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:56,200
d is smaller than s * qx.

260
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:05,279
Okay so let's digest this statement a

261
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:08,079
little bit. um uh so the projection is

262
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:10,720
always a subset of fq. So s is always

263
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:12,639
smaller than or equal to q. So this

264
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,320
hypothesis says that it's it's it's

265
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,839
significantly smaller than that. The

266
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,680
projection is significantly smaller than

267
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:20,800
the whole space.

268
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,800
Okay. And then we get this bound. Um and

269
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,040
this bound is most interesting in the

270
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:28,399
case that s was actually close to q over

271
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:30,880
two because in that case this q and this

272
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,959
s are about the same size. So this is

273
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:37,279
around s^2x

274
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:41,760
which matches the grid example.

275
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:47,560
So this is actually um sharp

276
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:47,560
if s is around q2.

277
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,880
Okay, I find that quite striking and

278
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,279
impressive. This is a great example. Has

279
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,120
an interesting intricate structure and

280
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:59,760
we're wondering whether it was sharp.

281
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,279
And at least in this one regime uh this

282
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,519
theorem is shows that it actually is

283
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:05,279
sharp.

284
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,360
Okay. On the other hand, S could be a

285
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:10,160
lot smaller than Q. Then we get some

286
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:14,240
bound here and we don't have any example

287
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:16,000
that that matches that bound. Um

288
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,480
I guess no I should also say this works

289
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,720
over any field. So if you plug in

290
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:25,680
example two, it's actually also sharp.

291
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:28,320
Um and so it's also sharp in example

292
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,320
two.

293
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,240
Um,

294
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,600
all right. But there are a bunch of

295
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,880
there are a bunch of choices of the

296
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,600
parameter you could make where it's not

297
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,600
clear that this is sharp.

298
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,920
Okay. So, the big goal of the class is

299
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,440
to introduce these two techniques really

300
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,000
and we'll use them to prove these two

301
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,440
theorems. But maybe it's a good place to

302
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,600
pause and check if people have questions

303
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,839
or comments. Yeah,

304
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,519
>> it's um in the first theorem, are you

305
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:03,759
assuming that it's prime?

306
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:05,839
>> We are not assuming that it's prime. Um

307
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,360
right. So that's right. We're not

308
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,880
assuming it's prime in either theorem.

309
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,519
And so where it says setup, it means

310
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:13,920
we're assuming this.

311
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,839
Yeah, that's right. Um okay. And so that

312
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,399
raises a point that it appears that the

313
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:21,279
true answer to this question uh depends

314
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:23,600
on whether Q is prime or not prime. But

315
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:25,839
neither of these techniques depend on

316
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,600
that. they work for all Q and they're

317
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,360
sort of not able to notice whether Q is

318
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,959
prime or not prime. That will eventually

319
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,480
be a big theme. We won't get to it

320
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,399
today, but eventually we'll try to find

321
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,839
some techniques that do notice whether Q

322
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,320
is prime or not.

323
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,399
>> Yeah.

324
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:43,680
>> Um for the premise S is less than or

325
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:45,440
equal to size of X / 2, how easy is it

326
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:49,720
to construct some other examples that

327
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,720
satisfy that element of the grid?

328
00:16:50,240 --> 00:17:00,399
>> Yeah. Okay. So the question is um uh you

329
00:16:55,199 --> 00:17:02,480
know can can we find

330
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,319
how how many examples can we find which

331
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,919
obey the hypothesis so that this theorem

332
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:10,000
says anything about them? Um well I

333
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:13,039
think it's not super hard because we're

334
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,240
allowed to take D to be small.

335
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:19,240
Um so uh

336
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,240
um

337
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,400
so you know if D is just one direction

338
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,679
then you could easily arrange the points

339
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,520
so that their projection in one

340
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,840
direction is quite small and you have a

341
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,520
lot more flexibility than a grid and if

342
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:37,039
you'd like the projection to be small in

343
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:39,520
two directions um then you would want

344
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,960
some kind of cartisian product but it

345
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,840
wouldn't have there's still a lot more

346
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,600
cartisian products than integer grids.

347
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,600
And then as you add more directions, it

348
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,200
gets more rigid and and and we we can

349
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,360
start to think about it. We can think

350
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,799
about it uh later on. It's it's a neat

351
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:57,160
question how many examples we can come

352
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:57,160
up with. Yeah.

353
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,799
Okay. Other questions.

354
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:14,679
In example one, you said Q = P prime.

355
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:14,679
Um, can Q be a prime power?

356
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:21,919
>> Yes. Right. Right. So, okay.

357
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:24,799
Yeah. So, the question was up in example

358
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,640
one, we assume that Q is prime. Um, are

359
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:28,480
there examples similar to that if Q is

360
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:32,080
not prime?

361
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:34,000
Um, so okay, so if N and A are smaller,

362
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,520
if Q is P to the R and you choose N and

363
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
A smaller than P, you can just use

364
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,240
what's on the board for Bane.

365
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,559
Um, if you wanted to choose N and A

366
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:46,240
bigger than P, it doesn't really make

367
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:47,760
sense in FQ. Um, so I think that there's

368
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,280
a fix for that, but I didn't have time

369
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,280
to think through the details before

370
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,280
class.

371
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,640
Um

372
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:03,760
yeah. So

373
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:06,240
homework for one of us.

374
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,840
Okay.

375
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,280
Okay. So let's start proving some

376
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:14,280
things. Um so first we'll do the double

377
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,280
counter.

378
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:29,360
Okay. So suppose that pi we just look at

379
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,160
one direction where this projection is

380
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:35,520
small. If s is a lot smaller than x, it

381
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:38,799
will look something like this. Um so

382
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:43,760
here's the space we're projecting onto

383
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:46,000
and we'll have some points.

384
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:49,520
Uh and this is our projection map. So

385
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,160
here we have x and this arrow is the

386
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:55,840
projection map pi theta.

387
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:59,640
Um and then and then down here we have

388
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,640
pi theta of x.

389
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,760
Okay. And you'll notice that for each

390
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,240
point in the projection or at least for

391
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,240
most points in the projection uh we'll

392
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,240
have many points of x that are going on

393
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,160
top of it.

394
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,880
Okay.

395
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:17,360
So, so we're going to pay attention to

396
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:20,559
that. Um and the first thing we'll say

397
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:24,400
is that um

398
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:26,080
if s is smaller than x over two then we

399
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:30,559
have a lot of points going on top of

400
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:33,600
each other. Um uh so for every theta in

401
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:38,320
our set of directions,

402
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:42,840
the number of pairs x1 and x2 and x that

403
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,840
got projected to the same point

404
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:54,159
that should be at least around um s * x

405
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:56,000
/ s^ squ.

406
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,120
Okay, so let's digest that. First of

407
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,640
all, I'll warn you that I changed

408
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:02,480
notation. So x1 and x2 are each points

409
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:07,039
in x. Those are not the components of

410
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:10,880
anything. Um, okay. And so why is this?

411
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:12,640
Well, imagine first that these uh each

412
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,280
that each point in the projection has

413
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:18,559
the same number of pre-im images. So

414
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:21,919
each of these points has about x over s

415
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:24,000
points of x sitting above it.

416
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:29,440
And then the number of ways to choose

417
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,960
two of them um would be x over s^2.

418
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:35,760
And that would be true for each of these

419
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:37,760
s points. So that would give us uh this.

420
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,760
Actually, let me add here that I'm

421
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:44,120
interested in two different points that

422
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,120
got projected to the same point.

423
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,559
So this is still true, but because I put

424
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:53,120
two different points here, that's where

425
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:53,120
I needed to use uh this hypothesis.

426
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,120
Okay, so that was some intuition why it

427
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,880
might be true. Um, then you might

428
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,400
wonder, well, maybe they're not evenly

429
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,559
distributed. Maybe some of these points

430
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,720
have more pre-im images than others. It

431
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:06,400
turns out that that only helps you. I'm

432
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,960
going to make it an exercise. It's kind

433
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,640
of a standard combinatorics exercise.

434
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:16,760
So, it's exercise on your first problem

435
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:16,760
set uh using Koshy Schwarz to

436
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,640
Okay,

437
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,200
cool. So, there are a lot of points

438
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,880
getting collapsed together in these

439
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,640
different projections and we're going to

440
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:36,480
put it all together. So the key object

441
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:42,559
that we're going to count is the number

442
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:46,400
of directions theta and distinct points

443
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:49,400
in x uh so that they have the same

444
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,400
projection.

445
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,960
Okay? And they have to be a lot of those

446
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,960
because for every direction there are a

447
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:00,799
lot of them. So the number of these is

448
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:03,039
at least x^2 s inverse number of

449
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:05,440
directions. The x^2 s inverse is just

450
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:06,799
that simplified and that was how many

451
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:10,200
there are in each direction and there

452
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:10,200
are d directions.

453
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,360
Okay.

454
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:20,400
So now the point is that it's hard to

455
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:22,960
have this many collapses

456
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,520
um because if you take any two pairs of

457
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,200
points in X there's only one direction

458
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,679
in which they get mapped on top of each

459
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:32,320
other.

460
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:37,840
So that gives us an upper bound on on

461
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:40,080
this star. So but for any points x1 not

462
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:44,159
equal to x2

463
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:49,280
the number of theta so that

464
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:52,000
pi theta of x1 = p<unk> theta of x2

465
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:54,400
there's at most one and that gives us an

466
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:59,440
upper bound for star

467
00:23:54,400 --> 00:24:01,679
is upperbounded by x2

468
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:04,480
once you choose x1 and x2 there's only

469
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,480
one choice of theta

470
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:11,039
Okay.

471
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,679
Um

472
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:18,000
so this key quantity is sandwiched in

473
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:23,279
between here and here. We have x^2 s

474
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:25,279
inverse d is less than star is less than

475
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:27,679
x^2.

476
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:31,679
And you simplify this a little bit and

477
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:34,679
we get that d is less than s. That's the

478
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,679
proof.

479
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:54,559
Let me summarize it without the

480
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:57,520
equations. The key object is this object

481
00:24:54,559 --> 00:25:00,080
star. U let's call let's call this the

482
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,919
set of coincidences. A coincidence is

483
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:06,080
when you have two points in X that get

484
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:08,240
mapped to the same point in by pi theta.

485
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:10,720
And if many projections are small, there

486
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,240
must be many coincidences.

487
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,400
But there can't be that many because if

488
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,840
you take two points X1 and X2, there's

489
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,120
only one direction that makes a

490
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:20,120
coincidence. And that's what we're

491
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,120
using.

492
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:34,200
Okay. Any questions or comments about

493
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,200
double counting?

494
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:44,640
Okay, let me show you the second

495
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:46,480
approach which is based on uh I called

496
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:50,919
it a forier approach or based on

497
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,919
orthogonality or based on cancellation.

498
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:56,320
So this approach begins with an image

499
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,600
that uh that that I want you to have in

500
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,400
mind and that you know we could try to

501
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:04,840
work on this image in many ways. Uh so

502
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,840
it's the overlapping lines image.

503
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,799
Okay. So suppose I have a bunch of

504
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:14,000
points that have small projections in

505
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:16,559
many directions.

506
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,799
Okay. So if I project this down it has a

507
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,799
small projection

508
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:27,600
And if I look at the so maybe I'll call

509
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:32,679
this pi theta 1. If I look at the pre-im

510
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:32,679
images of these I'll get some lines

511
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:38,080
in uh in a certain direction that

512
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:40,799
corresponds to theta 1. And so I've

513
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,880
covered my set with uh not too many

514
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:46,480
lines. So down here there are at most s

515
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:50,080
points. So over here we have at most s

516
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:53,400
lines. And I'll call this set of lines L

517
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,400
theta 1.

518
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:04,080
Okay. So to summarize uh

519
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:09,120
if pi I guess pi theta of x is less than

520
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:10,640
or equal to s then I get a set called l

521
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:16,640
theta

522
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:18,000
uh is a set of at most s lines

523
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:23,360
uh that are that are I guess

524
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:28,200
perpendicular to theta. Um and that they

525
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:28,200
cover my set X.

526
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,760
So now if I have many small projections,

527
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:36,000
I can do this in many directions. And so

528
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:39,440
I'll have sets of lines in different

529
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,799
directions and I'll cover X many times.

530
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:47,919
So I can do this

531
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:50,799
for every theta in my set of directions.

532
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:52,400
Okay. So I'll do one more. I was meaning

533
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,919
to bring some colored chalk, but I

534
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:57,440
didn't I don't have colored chalk today.

535
00:27:53,919 --> 00:28:02,240
So I'll do my best. Uh so let's say this

536
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:06,640
is a dotted direction and

537
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:08,559
when I project in the theta 2 direction

538
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,919
this

539
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:16,240
so this is um

540
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:18,960
uh so this would be l theta 2 in in

541
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,320
dotted lines. Okay, I'm not going to add

542
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,480
any more directions to the picture, but

543
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,559
in your imagination, imagine that this

544
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:27,919
set of points there are lines going many

545
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:30,720
different ways that are uh covering the

546
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:33,200
set of points.

547
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:35,039
Okay, so in our second method and maybe

548
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,200
in a lot of things that we do, we're

549
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:38,640
going to imagine these lines and work

550
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:43,159
with these lines as a way of

551
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,159
understanding the projection estimates.

552
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,360
Okay.

553
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:52,360
So, let me add a little vocabulary about

554
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,360
this.

555
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:59,919
So, we've defined L theta. L our whole

556
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,840
set of lines is the union over all the

557
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:05,520
different directions of the lines L

558
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:08,320
theta. So, that's a set of lines.

559
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:12,320
And um

560
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:14,880
so if L is a line, I'm going to write L

561
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:17,440
of X as an abbreviation for the

562
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:20,720
characteristic function of that line 1

563
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,640
sub L of X.

564
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,200
And think about what happens when we add

565
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:27,760
up all these characteristic functions.

566
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:30,960
So f ofx

567
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:36,200
is the sum over all the lines in my set

568
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:36,200
of lines of L of X.

569
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,880
Okay, so take a moment to visualize that

570
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:45,039
I have lines going in different

571
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,039
directions.

572
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:49,919
Imagine their characteristic functions

573
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:51,600
and add them all up. So when I add them

574
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:53,279
all up at any given point, it will tell

575
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:56,000
me how many different lines to my set of

576
00:29:53,279 --> 00:30:00,640
lines went through that point.

577
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:04,799
Um, and so if if x is in my set of

578
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:08,000
points, then f ofx is the number of

579
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:09,679
directions. If I take a point in my set,

580
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,840
this point is going to lie in one line

581
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:14,960
in every direction.

582
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:16,480
If I take a point that's not in my set,

583
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,559
uh, it's not very clear what's going to

584
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,399
happen. It won't necess not obvious it

585
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:22,640
will be in any lines, but it might be in

586
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:24,159
some lines. We don't know much about how

587
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,200
what f is doing at those points that are

588
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:31,520
not in my set x.

589
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:34,240
Okay, great. Um, okay. So, we're going

590
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:36,240
to get at projection theory by trying to

591
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,320
study this function and in particular

592
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,320
trying to uh study the set where the

593
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:43,440
function is big. That's going to be our

594
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:45,440
second approach. Um, and we're going to

595
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,080
study the set where this function is big

596
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:51,080
using for a analysis or andor using

597
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,080
orthogonality.

598
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:23,880
Okay.

599
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:23,880
So orthogonal.

600
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:34,960
Okay. So um so L L of X remember is the

601
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:38,320
characteristic function of a line and

602
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:42,480
I'm going to decompose it into pieces.

603
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:44,640
So um okay so there are Q points in a

604
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:48,559
line and there are Q squared points in

605
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:52,159
my whole plate. And so the average value

606
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:57,200
of L of X is 1 / Q. So I'm going to

607
00:31:52,159 --> 00:32:00,159
separate that out. That's 1 / Q plus a

608
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,679
piece that I'll call L sub high of X.

609
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:04,960
That H is for high. We'll talk about

610
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:08,440
that name more in a sec. So this is the

611
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,440
average value

612
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:15,679
of our function. And therefore the

613
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:18,240
leftover piece has mean zero

614
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:20,000
has value zero

615
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:24,480
and not value zero it has average value

616
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:27,360
zero as mean zero. Okay. Um and I also

617
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:30,559
will think of this as the zero frequency

618
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:32,799
piece and the high frequency piece in

619
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:34,080
terms of fora analysis. We can make that

620
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:35,760
precise. We'll do that a little bit

621
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:38,480
later.

622
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,760
But as a depending how much for analysis

623
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,399
you do, you may or may not like this

624
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:44,159
intuition. But this is a constant part

625
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:46,640
and this is like a higher frequency

626
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:48,640
oscillating part.

627
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:51,279
Okay, those are just words. So we

628
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:55,320
decompose it like this.

629
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:55,320
Now the key observation

630
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:03,840
is that um well oversimplifying just a

631
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:06,640
little bit. these high high frequency

632
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:08,880
parts are orthogonal to each other. So

633
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:13,760
here's a precise statement.

634
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:16,159
So if L1 uh not equal to L2 are lines,

635
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:18,080
so I have two different lines,

636
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:21,200
then

637
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:27,279
the sum over all of the points in the

638
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:31,720
plane of L1 H of X, L2, H of X

639
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:31,720
is less than or equal to zero.

640
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:36,960
Okay. Now when when we prove this lema

641
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:39,600
in a little bit we will see that it's

642
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:42,159
almost always equal to zero. So these

643
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,519
functions are almost always orthogonal.

644
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:45,279
Once in a while they're not orthogonal

645
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:48,240
but then it's negative. That that part

646
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:50,960
isn't that important anyway. So so

647
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:53,600
roughly speaking these functions L1H and

648
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:58,440
L2 are orthogonal.

649
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:58,440
Okay. Now how does that help us?

650
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:03,840
Well,

651
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:07,919
let's think about f ofx. f ofx,

652
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:10,480
remember, is the sum uh over all the

653
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:12,639
lines in our set of lines of L of X. And

654
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,800
so, we can break it up this way also.

655
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:16,159
When we add up the constant parts, well,

656
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,800
we'll just see what we get. We get the

657
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:20,879
number of lines divided by Q. And then

658
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:24,560
we have to add up all the high frequency

659
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:26,159
parts. So plus the sum l in our set of

660
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:30,960
lines

661
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:34,240
of lh x. So this thing here is the high

662
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:36,159
frequency part of f. I'll call it f subh

663
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:39,480
of x. For now you can think of that as

664
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:39,480
just a name.

665
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:44,800
Okay.

666
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:47,200
So this part we understand quite well.

667
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,720
Know exactly what it is. And so as

668
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:51,440
understanding this function boils down

669
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:53,599
to understanding this part. And for

670
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,839
understanding this part, we can use this

671
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:57,359
orthogonality. We've written it as a sum

672
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:59,440
of pieces that are each pretty simple

673
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:02,240
and they're orthogonal to each other.

674
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:05,040
And so that lets us figure out or

675
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:06,720
estimate quite well the L2 norm of this

676
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:09,119
FH.

677
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:11,890
So after the key lema, I guess there's

678
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:13,680
the L2 estimate.

679
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:20,000
[Applause]

680
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:24,440
It says the sum x in fq ^2

681
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,440
of fh of x^2.

682
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:36,320
Well, um that's the sum l1 l2 in l

683
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:42,839
of the sum x and f2

684
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:42,839
l1 h of x l2 h of x

685
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,520
Okay.

686
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:57,440
And because of my orthogonality in the

687
00:35:54,720 --> 00:36:00,160
key lema, almost all of these terms are

688
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:02,720
less than or equal to zero. Namely, if

689
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:05,200
L1 is different from L2, then this sum

690
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:06,880
is less than or equal to zero.

691
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:10,839
So then I'll just keep this the terms

692
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,839
where they're equal to each other.

693
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:14,579
[Applause]

694
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:24,359
Okay.

695
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:31,280
Now, this sum here is easy to do uh

696
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:34,000
because I just have to think one line at

697
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:35,520
a time and all the lines will be

698
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,280
equivalent to each other. So, it's just

699
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,200
the number of lines times whatever this

700
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,880
is.

701
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:43,680
This thing also is not very hard to

702
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:47,920
compute. Um, but

703
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:53,359
let me say that this is actually smaller

704
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:54,640
than if I uh did the whole L of x squ.

705
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:56,079
I mean, you could you could just compute

706
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:58,880
it and write down what happens though.

707
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:01,440
But anyway, but um if you take a

708
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:03,680
function and you subtract off its mean,

709
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,839
then the L2 norm is smaller than for the

710
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,839
original function. So anyway, so we

711
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:10,640
could write this and then we can compute

712
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:13,359
this even in our heads. So L of X is one

713
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:17,119
at Q points and otherwise it's zero. So

714
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:20,400
this thing here is Q. So we get the

715
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:23,800
number of lines times Q. So that's our

716
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,800
L2 estimate.

717
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:42,330
[Applause]

718
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:12,640
Okay. So now let's finish um the proof

719
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:15,760
of theorem 2. There's theorem two up

720
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:18,960
there. Um, we have this hypothesis that

721
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:21,920
S is a lot smaller than Q.

722
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,839
How does that matter? That controls this

723
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,839
term,

724
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:30,079
right? So, you know, if D was only as

725
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:31,520
big as L over Q, uh, then um, this

726
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:33,760
complicated thing wouldn't come into

727
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:36,760
play and and F could be that big

728
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,760
everywhere.

729
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,960
Um,

730
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:44,079
okay. So, let's see how that works. So

731
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:47,680
the number of lines in my set of lines

732
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:50,400
is s * d because I have d directions and

733
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:52,960
I have s lines in each direction.

734
00:38:50,400 --> 00:39:01,040
So this uh

735
00:38:52,960 --> 00:39:03,040
l over q is uh s * d / q

736
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:06,880
and I have a hypothesis that s is at

737
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:08,720
most q over two.

738
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,320
So that implies that when I take this

739
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:17,200
ratio

740
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:17,680
um L / Q is less than half of D.

741
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,520
>> Yeah.

742
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:25,040
>> Um equality L equals S * D. Does does

743
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:27,839
that assume that every uh so set of

744
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:29,760
lines has the same

745
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:30,720
like every L is the same size because I

746
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,480
thought that they could be different

747
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,960
sizes.

748
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:40,240
>> Yes. Right. That's okay. That's a good

749
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:43,119
technical catch. So um Right.

750
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:47,920
Right. So in each direction I have at

751
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:49,680
most S lines. Um but

752
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,359
it might be okay to work with that but I

753
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:54,079
find it slightly confusing to keep track

754
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:56,320
of and you can always add some extra

755
00:39:54,079 --> 00:40:00,800
lines and the lines will still cover the

756
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:03,040
set X. Um and so

757
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,880
[Applause]

758
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:07,440
so I don't know I don't know that this

759
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:09,359
is crucial but the what I like to do is

760
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,760
to say that there are equal to s lines

761
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:13,440
and they cover x and and we can say that

762
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:16,400
and then it makes this computation

763
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:19,359
clean.

764
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:21,599
Okay. Um

765
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:23,599
okay so this l over q is less than half

766
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:27,760
of d.

767
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:31,839
Now remember that at each point uh in x

768
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:34,640
f ofx is d and f ofx breaks up as l over

769
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:36,640
q plus the high frequency part and the

770
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:39,680
the what we just saw is the l over q is

771
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:42,240
less than half of d. So the high

772
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:45,880
frequency part is the majority uh of of

773
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,880
f at those points.

774
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:54,800
Okay. So we conclude that for every x

775
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:57,520
and x um the high frequency part of x is

776
00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:01,560
at least half of d.

777
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:01,560
I'll just write greater subd.

778
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:09,359
Okay. And now we can comp compare this

779
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:11,760
with our L2 bound there.

780
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:15,760
Right? So

781
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:17,760
um so we can say that the sum over all

782
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:20,800
of the

783
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:23,359
that the sum over all the points

784
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:26,079
of fh of x

785
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:29,040
squared. Well that should be at least as

786
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:31,440
big as the points at x times the number

787
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:34,160
of directions squared. So in this sum

788
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,839
some of these points are in my set x and

789
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:38,960
at each of those points this has size

790
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:40,480
around d. So that contributes this much.

791
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,599
Plus there are other points which I

792
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:45,440
really don't know what they're doing.

793
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:47,359
Okay. And then we have the upper bound

794
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:51,040
the L2 estimate that we just proved over

795
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:56,640
there that is upper bounded by the

796
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:59,640
number of lines time q which is s * d *

797
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,640
q.

798
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,160
Okay. And now we just rearrange this and

799
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:08,400
it will give us some information about s

800
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:12,319
and d and x and q. Um,

801
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:16,079
so I'm going to get the D by itself. So

802
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:21,440
I divide by that and I divide by that.

803
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:24,839
I'm left with D is bounded by S * Q /X.

804
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,839
There it is.

805
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,440
Yeah,

806
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:41,280
>> just going back and forth between

807
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,960
analysis. The mean value here is taking

808
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:46,079
over like talking about the mean over

809
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:47,760
the sex.

810
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:49,599
>> Yeah. So when we say the word mean,

811
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,119
yeah, when I say the word mean, okay, so

812
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:54,040
the question was when we said mean

813
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:56,720
value, the mean over what? Um,

814
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:59,359
[Applause]

815
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:05,119
so let me put that up here.

816
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:09,599
So if I have a function g fub^2

817
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:15,280
c then when I say the mean value

818
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:20,480
of g what I mean is um 1 over q ^2 sum

819
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:24,920
in x and f q ^2 of g of x. So it's the

820
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:24,920
mean over the whole vector space.

821
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,400
Other questions or comments about the

822
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:37,599
proof?

823
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:39,359
Okay. So, so

824
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:41,839
I am also working on digesting the

825
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:44,560
proof. Um, so the proof is all about

826
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:47,760
breaking up f as this constant part plus

827
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:50,480
this high frequency part. And the proof

828
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:52,160
is saying that in a certain sense the

829
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:55,119
high frequency part is actually kind of

830
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:57,599
small compared to the constant part.

831
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:59,040
So, I wanted to draw that out because I

832
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:02,079
feel like it helps my intuition about

833
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:05,079
what the what the proof is saying.

834
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:05,079
Um,

835
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:11,800
so, so let's look at this L2 estimate.

836
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:21,839
So, our L2 estimate was that um the sum

837
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:24,480
f ofx^2

838
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:28,560
x in the whole plane

839
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:31,560
was bounded by the number of lines times

840
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,560
Q.

841
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:36,720
Um, so I want to think about what this

842
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,720
means and uh, it helps me a little bit

843
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:41,920
to replace the sum by an average. So I'm

844
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:48,720
going to divide both sides by Q ^2.

845
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:51,839
So if I take 1 / q ^2 some x and f q^2

846
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:56,560
f h of x^2 then that's bounded by the

847
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:58,800
number of lines divided by q.

848
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:01,760
Okay, so this is an L2 version of an

849
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:03,760
average and by Koshy Schwarz that

850
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:08,640
controls

851
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:10,640
uh let's see yeah so then so so the if I

852
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:12,560
took a square root to get an L2 norm I

853
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:14,880
would have a square root over here and

854
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:18,880
by Koshy Schwarz

855
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:20,400
I would get that the L1 average

856
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:23,800
um

857
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,800
has a bound

858
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:31,640
and the bound is now the square root of

859
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:31,640
number of lines over Q.

860
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:36,520
Does that look right to everybody?

861
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:41,440
Okay. And so a bit informally, you know,

862
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:43,520
there might be some points X that are

863
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:45,760
different, but on average for a typical

864
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:50,000
point X, the high frequency part only

865
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:51,920
has the size square root of L over Q.

866
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,640
Whereas the low frequency part, the

867
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:57,680
constant part has size L over Q at every

868
00:45:54,640 --> 00:46:00,720
point. Here

869
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:05,040
let's call let's call this constant part

870
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:09,440
fnot that's your frequency part right so

871
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:13,359
for comparison the size of fnot of x is

872
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:16,800
always number of lines over q so the

873
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:21,680
conclusion is that if the number of

874
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:25,040
lines is uh much bigger than q

875
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:28,720
then this is way bigger than

876
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:31,760
Um so then

877
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:37,319
the high frequency part is much smaller

878
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:37,319
than the constant part on average.

879
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:48,720
So it's telling us that whenever I add

880
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:51,520
up a lot of lines has to be

881
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:54,319
significantly more than Q lines

882
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:56,800
then that sum is pretty close to being a

883
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:59,520
constant function.

884
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:02,079
At a typical point, the difference from

885
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:03,440
being constant is extremely small. And

886
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:04,560
there may be a few points where the

887
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,319
difference from being constant is

888
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:09,800
bigger, but but there's a pretty strong

889
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:09,800
bound on them.

890
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:30,599
Okay. Any questions or comments about

891
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,599
this? um orthogonality proof.

892
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:41,640
>> Yeah.

893
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:41,640
>> The inequality fater.

894
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:52,319
>> Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So, so to recap a

895
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:54,160
little bit, we have these lines going in

896
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:55,760
each direction and we have d directions

897
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:58,240
and we add up all the characteristic

898
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:01,680
functions of the lines. So that's called

899
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:03,920
f and each point of x is in all is in

900
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:05,839
the line in every direction. So f ofx is

901
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:08,560
d.

902
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:10,400
Now we broke up f into two pieces. The

903
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:12,960
constant piece which was number of lines

904
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:15,520
over q and then the mean zero piece or

905
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:18,880
high frequency piece.

906
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:20,400
Um, and I claim that the constant piece

907
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:22,480
is small. The constant piece is less

908
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,839
than half of D. And that would mean that

909
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:26,240
the high frequency part should be more

910
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:29,200
than half of D. And why is the constant

911
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:33,599
piece small? Well, this L is the number

912
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:36,079
of directions times S. Um, and we

913
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:38,000
plugged it in and we used the fact that

914
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:42,839
S is at most Q over2. It's one of our

915
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,839
hypotheses. That's what fell out.

916
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:51,680
Okay.

917
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:54,880
Um, okay. Now, I called this early on

918
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:57,040
the Forier method. We didn't actually

919
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:58,960
mention the Forier transform or for a

920
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:01,760
series of anything. We didn't have to.

921
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:03,760
Um, we did use orthogonality

922
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:06,880
crucially, which is an idea that I first

923
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:08,720
saw in 4A analysis. Um, but it is

924
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:13,920
possible to rewrite this proof using the

925
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:16,400
the 4A transform. um and um it is

926
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:18,640
uh I think it's worth doing even though

927
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:20,480
we didn't need the for transform this as

928
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:22,400
we keep going and do more sophisticated

929
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:25,960
things in this spirit it helps to have

930
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,960
the 4 transfer

931
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:30,520
okay um

932
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,760
I guess the other thing is we didn't

933
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:37,520
prove the key lema

934
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:40,319
okay actually why don't we let's so I'm

935
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:41,920
going to uh prove the key lema And I'll

936
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:43,839
show you two proofs. One of them is sort

937
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:48,240
of direct and the other one is based on

938
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:50,160
the uh for a transform. Okay.

939
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:51,760
Um so I think we can erase this board

940
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:55,000
here. We're just going to talk about the

941
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:55,000
key lema.

942
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:11,680
Okay. Um so I'll call this the direct

943
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:15,720
proof of the key lama and then we'll

944
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:15,720
also have a forier proof.

945
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:25,359
Um okay so actually two cases in the

946
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:28,839
lema. So the main case is that L1 and L2

947
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:28,839
are not parallel.

948
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:38,319
Okay. And in this case the the high

949
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:44,319
frequency parts are orthogonal.

950
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:47,280
So sum of x L1 H of X L2 H of X in this

951
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:50,400
case is exactly zero. The the less than

952
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:52,480
zero comes from the parallel keys.

953
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:55,200
Okay. Now there's a lot of symmetry in

954
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:56,559
this problem. And so we have the two

955
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,079
lines that intersect. We can make a

956
00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:59,680
linear change of variables and a

957
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:01,440
translation so that one of them is the

958
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:03,359
x1 axis and the other one is the x2

959
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:08,720
axis.

960
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:10,559
So after change of variables, L1 is the

961
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:14,480
actually I'm going to say L1 is the X2

962
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:16,960
axis and L2 is the X1 axis. I know that

963
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:18,640
looks a little silly. Um but yeah,

964
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:20,559
somewhere there's going to be a any is

965
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:22,160
that a point?

966
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:27,960
So

967
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:27,960
So over here is L2 and over here is L1.

968
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:38,160
All right. Now and we do that

969
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:39,760
if I take L1 high of a point X1 X2

970
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:42,240
um

971
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:46,160
it only depends

972
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:50,559
okay so okay so the function L1 of X

973
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:53,599
only depends upon X1 if X1 is zero L1 is

974
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:55,119
one if X1 is not zero we get zero then

975
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:59,280
we're subtracting a constant function

976
00:51:55,119 --> 00:52:03,839
from that so it still only depends on X1

977
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:07,040
so This is a function g of x1

978
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:12,920
and its mean zero. So the sum over x1

979
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:12,920
and fq of g of x1 is zero.

980
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:25,559
Okay. Similarly l2 high of x1 x2 only

981
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:25,559
depends upon x2 and it's g of x2.

982
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,800
This is the trickiest bit. Let me make

983
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:36,160
sure that looks okay.

984
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:38,400
So remember L L1 is one if X1 is zero

985
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:39,680
and it's zero otherwise.

986
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:41,280
And then we're subtract. So that's a

987
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:43,200
function that only depends on X1. We

988
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:47,240
subtract off its mean. We get a a new

989
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:47,240
function that only depends on X1.

990
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:53,680
I guess it's 1 - 1 over Q. If X1 is zero

991
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:57,200
and it's minus one over Q if X1 is not

992
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:57,200
zero. That's what G is.

993
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:06,880
Okay. So now when we sum L1H

994
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:11,520
of X1 X2

995
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:16,640
L2 H of X1 X2

996
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:19,280
well it's the sum over X1 X2 of G of X1

997
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:21,280
G of X2. And now we can just break up

998
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:25,359
this sum.

999
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:30,319
It's the sum on x1 of g of x1

1000
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:33,880
times the sum on x2 of g of x2

1001
00:53:30,319 --> 00:53:33,880
0 * 0.

1002
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:55,079
Okay. Does that look okay to people?

1003
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:05,800
Okay. Then there's the minor case that

1004
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:05,800
they're parallel and um

1005
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:13,280
okay, I don't have anything super

1006
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:15,280
instructive to say about this case. They

1007
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:17,280
might as well both be p parallel to the

1008
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:19,119
x2 axis.

1009
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:22,240
It's not hard to compute it by hand. and

1010
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:24,480
and you'll see that it's negative.

1011
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:25,520
So I I'm going to not do it on the board

1012
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:28,520
because I think it's not very

1013
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:28,520
illuminating.

1014
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:34,800
Okay, so that's one way to prove the key

1015
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:37,599
lema.

1016
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:39,440
Uh but the key lema also the whole setup

1017
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:41,520
also has a nice relationship to for a

1018
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:43,440
analysis and and you can use we can also

1019
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:45,440
use for a analysis to to prove the key

1020
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:48,720
lema and if we do it that way we can

1021
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:50,240
sort of justify in a precise way saying

1022
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:54,440
that something is the zero frequency

1023
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:54,440
part or the high frequency part.

1024
00:54:55,599 --> 00:55:04,409
Okay.

1025
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:04,409
[Applause]

1026
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:28,359
Okay. So let me remind everybody how

1027
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:28,359
fora analysis works over finite fields.

1028
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:51,359
Okay. So um

1029
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:53,200
I have a

1030
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:56,480
for analysis based on having some like

1031
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:59,920
group homorphism from your group into C

1032
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:03,520
star. So I'm going to call it E. So E is

1033
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:06,559
a map from FQ to C star. Think of it as

1034
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:08,000
FQ with addition. So this is a grouping

1035
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:10,880
group. That's an aelion group. Complex

1036
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:13,880
numbers with multiplication. This is a

1037
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:13,880
homorphism

1038
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:19,760
and I want it to be non-trivial. does

1039
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:22,160
not send does not just send everything

1040
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:28,160
to one.

1041
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:32,880
Okay. So for example, if Q= P is prime,

1042
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:36,200
then it would be E of X is E 2<unk>I I X

1043
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:36,200
over P.

1044
00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:40,880
And if Q is not prime, it takes a little

1045
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:42,559
bit more doing to write down a

1046
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:45,960
homorphism, but there but there is one

1047
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:45,960
that's not true.

1048
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:52,559
Okay. Um so now suppose I have a

1049
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:56,160
function on fq to the d.

1050
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:58,799
It has a fora transform. Um so the for

1051
00:56:56,160 --> 00:57:03,359
transform of c

1052
00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:08,240
is defined to be sum over q and fq to

1053
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:11,119
the d f ofx d ofx

1054
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:13,599
c.

1055
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:19,480
So this x c this is a dotproduct. It's

1056
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:19,480
just x1 c1 plus x2 c2 and so on.

1057
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:24,799
So that's the 4 a transform and it looks

1058
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:28,319
more or less uh like how you know how it

1059
00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:29,920
looks in uklidian space.

1060
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:34,799
Okay.

1061
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:37,799
So this c also lives in um

1062
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:37,799
inf.

1063
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:43,520
There are two main really fundamental

1064
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:46,160
theorems about transform. One of them is

1065
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:49,040
forier inversion and the other one is

1066
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:50,640
planer theorem as orthogonality and in

1067
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:53,839
the finite field setting they work out

1068
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:56,000
in the following way. So theorem one um

1069
00:57:53,839 --> 00:58:01,359
for a inversion

1070
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:04,720
f ofx is the sum c in fq to the d and

1071
00:58:01,359 --> 00:58:09,839
here we need to take an average

1072
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:11,920
f of c e of x dot c.

1073
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:14,240
So it looks like 4A inversion in

1074
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:17,200
uklitian space although there's this

1075
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:18,880
average here maybe worth saying that

1076
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:20,960
there are several reasonable conventions

1077
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:22,720
that you might put about you know

1078
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:25,760
somewhere in this setup we need to

1079
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:27,280
divide something by some powers of Q and

1080
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:28,720
there are several reasonable conventions

1081
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:31,520
and you see different conventions in

1082
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:34,319
different places um but anyway this is

1083
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:35,760
one that I picked um and I I never

1084
00:58:34,319 --> 00:58:37,280
remember it so I always take the

1085
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:39,200
function one and comput it for a

1086
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:43,240
transform and check that this works and

1087
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:43,240
that tells May I have this factor?

1088
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:49,640
Okay. And theorem two is planer.

1089
00:58:52,000 --> 00:59:00,960
So that says that if I take the sum

1090
00:58:55,280 --> 00:59:02,960
over fq to the d of f ofx g of xar

1091
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:04,400
then that's equivalent to a sum on the 4

1092
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:08,000
a side. And there's also a

1093
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:12,079
normalization. So that's 1 / q to the d

1094
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:20,480
sum x and sum c

1095
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:23,040
and f q to the d f of c g hat of c bar.

1096
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:24,559
So again if you compute a simple example

1097
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:27,559
you'll see that this is the right

1098
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:27,559
normalization.

1099
00:59:36,799 --> 00:59:40,799
Okay.

1100
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:43,440
So now if you take the characteristic

1101
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:45,040
function of a line you can take its fora

1102
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:48,640
transform and something interesting

1103
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:50,880
happens that represents uh important

1104
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:52,880
connection between I don't know between

1105
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:54,559
lines and the 4A transform and and

1106
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:57,520
therefore between projection theory and

1107
00:59:54,559 --> 01:00:04,040
the 4A transform. So okay so here's what

1108
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:04,040
happens. So suppose L is an athine line

1109
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:09,440
in FQ ^2

1110
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:13,520
or or really the characteristic function

1111
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:18,160
of the alpha.

1112
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:24,880
Okay. So then it has a perp so L perp is

1113
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:30,079
the set of C. So that um c do x1 - x2 is

1114
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:31,760
zero for any x1 x2 in the line.

1115
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:35,280
So in uklitian space this would look

1116
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:38,160
like this. So

1117
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:40,559
so here's my line l

1118
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:43,359
uh this is x space

1119
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:45,920
and then over here in c space I would

1120
01:00:43,359 --> 01:00:47,760
have

1121
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:49,520
l.

1122
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:52,520
Notice that L perp always goes through

1123
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:52,520
zero.

1124
01:00:53,520 --> 01:01:00,400
So here's here's my X1 and X2.

1125
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:03,119
So this direction here is a tangent

1126
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:06,240
direction to L and then these are the

1127
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:09,200
perpendicular directions.

1128
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:11,839
All right. So

1129
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:14,960
proposition

1130
01:01:11,839 --> 01:01:18,480
if you take L hat of C and you take its

1131
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:22,559
absolute value there are two cases

1132
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:26,799
one of them is that you get Q and that's

1133
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:32,480
if C is in LP and the other one is you

1134
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:34,480
get zero and that's if C is not in LP.

1135
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:37,119
So the for transform of a line first of

1136
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:39,280
all has is very sparse. It's zero almost

1137
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:44,119
everywhere. The only places where it's

1138
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:44,119
not zero are on this perpendicular line.

1139
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:53,520
Okay. So, um I think it is a good

1140
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:56,480
experience to uh compute this out and

1141
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:59,119
check that it happens. When you write

1142
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:00,880
down this sum,

1143
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:03,200
the sum

1144
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:04,720
will reduce to a geometric series and

1145
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:07,599
then you can sum the geometric series

1146
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:10,880
and you can see exactly what happens.

1147
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:14,359
So this is an exercise

1148
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:14,359
on the homework.

1149
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:22,880
Okay. And now um okay so we also do this

1150
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:24,559
thing of subtracting off the mean

1151
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:29,079
and and that has a very natural

1152
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:29,079
interpretation in for analysis.

1153
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:34,680
Um let's erase this.

1154
01:02:40,319 --> 01:02:43,440
Okay.

1155
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:47,599
So,

1156
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:51,920
so if you have a function g from f q to

1157
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:56,720
the d goes to c, then we can write g as

1158
01:02:51,920 --> 01:03:00,079
1 / q to the d sum over c g hat of c e

1159
01:02:56,720 --> 01:03:02,319
of x c. And one of these frequencies is

1160
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:04,319
often very special, namely the frequency

1161
01:03:02,319 --> 01:03:11,520
zero. So I'm just going to break up this

1162
01:03:04,319 --> 01:03:17,839
sum. It's 1 / q to the d g hat of zero

1163
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:19,680
plus um the sum over the nonzero c 1 / q

1164
01:03:17,839 --> 01:03:24,160
to the d

1165
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:26,559
g had x c e of x.

1166
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:29,200
All right. So if you think about what

1167
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:31,359
this is, ghat of 0 is just the sum of

1168
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:34,319
the values of g and then I divide by

1169
01:03:31,359 --> 01:03:38,000
that I get this formula here. That's the

1170
01:03:34,319 --> 01:03:41,200
mean value of G.

1171
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:44,559
So this is G knot and it's the mean

1172
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:49,359
value of G.

1173
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:51,680
And this thing here we'll call G high.

1174
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:55,079
G high is G minus its mean value. So it

1175
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:55,079
has mean zero.

1176
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:01,839
Okay. So that's what we did with our

1177
01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:04,640
lens. This is the zero frequency part of

1178
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:07,039
L and this is the nonzero frequency or I

1179
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:09,599
called it high frequency part of L. So

1180
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:10,960
from from from the for analysis point of

1181
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:15,240
view that that's what that's what these

1182
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:15,240
things precisely mean.

1183
01:04:16,799 --> 01:04:25,760
Okay. Now we can put this together

1184
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:28,880
to give a a new explanation of the key

1185
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:30,400
orthogonality lama.

1186
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:34,119
Um

1187
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:34,119
where should I put it?

1188
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:41,119
Yeah. So we we gave one proof of the key

1189
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:44,119
lama over here. We can do now another

1190
01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:44,119
one.

1191
01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:55,359
All right. So let's give the forier

1192
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:59,000
proof

1193
01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:59,000
of the key lama.

1194
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:06,559
uh we'll still do the main case

1195
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:07,920
which is that L1 and L2 are not parallel

1196
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:12,160
and that's where we get literal

1197
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:20,160
orthogonality then we get that the sum

1198
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:22,799
of L1H of X L2 H of X is Z

1199
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:26,200
how will we do it we'll evaluate it with

1200
01:05:22,799 --> 01:05:26,200
planer Wrap.

1201
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:53,440
Okay. So that's planer theorem 2. And

1202
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:55,039
now I have the high part here. What does

1203
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:58,640
the high part mean? The high part means

1204
01:05:55,039 --> 01:06:03,599
I crossed out the zero frequency.

1205
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:06,000
So this is 1 over Q ^2 times the sum on

1206
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:11,359
nonzero C

1207
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:13,680
L1 hat of C L2 hat.

1208
01:06:11,359 --> 01:06:16,640
So if if you compare the for transform

1209
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:18,880
of L1 and L1 high, the only difference

1210
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:21,039
is the zero frequency. I take I take the

1211
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:22,720
zero frequency here and I throw it out.

1212
01:06:21,039 --> 01:06:25,440
All the other ones are the same. So this

1213
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:30,000
is the same as this.

1214
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:35,960
Okay. Now I'll make a picture. Um so

1215
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:35,960
here in in X space I have a line um

1216
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:45,200
I have a line L1 and I have a line L2.

1217
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:49,119
What happens in for space C space? Well,

1218
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:53,559
there's uh L1 per

1219
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:53,559
and then there's L2 per

1220
01:06:54,559 --> 01:07:00,480
and L1 P and L2 per intersect only at

1221
01:06:57,599 --> 01:07:02,400
zero.

1222
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:05,400
So here I'm summing over nonzero

1223
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:05,400
frequencies.

1224
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:19,280
So if C is non zero then C is not so

1225
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:21,280
either C is not in L1 per or C is not in

1226
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:23,039
L2 per

1227
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:25,839
because those two those two purps they

1228
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:28,720
only intersect at the origin.

1229
01:07:25,839 --> 01:07:31,039
Okay. But this function is only

1230
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:33,039
supported when C is in L1 per and this

1231
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:36,000
one is only supported when C is in L2

1232
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:41,160
perp. So at every C in this sum, one of

1233
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:41,160
these guys is zero. So this is

1234
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:48,079
or to put it a little bit differently,

1235
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:49,839
uh these two functions have disjoint for

1236
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:53,319
a support.

1237
01:07:49,839 --> 01:07:53,319
So they are orthogonal.

1238
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:12,640
Okay,

1239
01:08:10,319 --> 01:08:14,160
so those are these are the two main

1240
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:16,080
classical techniques of projection

1241
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:19,679
theory. The double counting argument and

1242
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:23,839
the forthagonality argument. Um they're

1243
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:26,319
each not that difficult. Um, but it

1244
01:08:23,839 --> 01:08:28,319
actually is really pretty hard to go

1245
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:29,839
beyond them even though there's a lot of

1246
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:32,159
situations where they're they're not

1247
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:35,279
sharp. That's a that's a theme that

1248
01:08:32,159 --> 01:08:37,120
we'll get to. Um, but before we get to

1249
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:40,239
that theme, we'll explore these for a

1250
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:41,600
while. Um, and we'll see that uh a bunch

1251
01:08:40,239 --> 01:08:43,359
of people have used them in fact in

1252
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:44,799
different areas of math to do some

1253
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:47,120
different different things that things

1254
01:08:44,799 --> 01:08:49,040
that I think are interesting.

1255
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:52,080
Um,

1256
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:54,480
so the next thing that we'll do is the

1257
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:58,080
the more analytic setting of working in

1258
01:08:54,480 --> 01:09:02,560
R2 instead of over a finite field and

1259
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:04,799
having balls instead of points. And I I

1260
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:06,640
sort of waved my hands about it uh last

1261
01:09:04,799 --> 01:09:10,799
class about exactly what we would try to

1262
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:12,960
prove. Um and um uh so in our in our

1263
01:09:10,799 --> 01:09:15,199
last 10 minutes I'll introduce the setup

1264
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:17,279
with balls and I'll tell you what are

1265
01:09:15,199 --> 01:09:20,080
the analog of theorem one and theorem

1266
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:23,080
two and this conjecture.

1267
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:23,080
Um

1268
01:09:23,199 --> 01:09:26,960
okay and then we'll see we'll see the

1269
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:28,560
proofs of all that next class and we'll

1270
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:31,040
see the proofs are morally the same as

1271
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:32,960
these proofs in finite fields but with a

1272
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:37,199
little bit of extra technical issues

1273
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:39,600
from uh from working in uklitian space.

1274
01:09:37,199 --> 01:09:42,600
Okay.

1275
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:42,600
Um.

1276
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:59,320
All right. So, let's do a setup with

1277
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:59,320
balls.

1278
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:06,679
Setup in R2

1279
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:06,679
with balls.

1280
01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:16,640
All right. So, our set X is going to be

1281
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:19,840
a set of disjoint

1282
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:23,600
unit balls

1283
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:26,320
in a large ball.

1284
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:29,440
And then D, our set of directions. I'll

1285
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:31,199
think of it as a subset of S1. So, this

1286
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:34,679
is a set of directions that we'll do

1287
01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:34,679
projections in.

1288
01:10:34,719 --> 01:10:38,239
and they will also be disjoint and what

1289
01:10:36,719 --> 01:10:40,960
I'm going to put here is that they're 1

1290
01:10:38,239 --> 01:10:44,080
/ r separated.

1291
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:46,239
So you take so these these um you can

1292
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:48,480
think of d as a set of angles and any

1293
01:10:46,239 --> 01:10:50,320
two angles are at least 1 / r apart from

1294
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:52,000
each other. The reason for that is if

1295
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:53,760
they were closer together than that the

1296
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:55,679
two projections would basically be the

1297
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:58,080
same in terms of how they what they do

1298
01:10:55,679 --> 01:11:00,400
to a set of unit balls in in a ball of

1299
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:07,360
radius r.

1300
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:09,520
Okay. So that's x and d. And then our s

1301
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:12,400
s of xd

1302
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:14,880
is the maximum over any direction in our

1303
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:17,679
set of directions of the size of the

1304
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:19,120
projection of x in that direction. So

1305
01:11:17,679 --> 01:11:20,960
this is a one-dimensional set. It's

1306
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:22,800
basically a set of unit intervals. And

1307
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:25,800
and this this absolute value is its

1308
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:25,800
length.

1309
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:30,600
Okay.

1310
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:35,600
All right. So, we could ask just in

1311
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:38,320
terms of the size of X and the size of

1312
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:41,280
D, what can you say about S and how does

1313
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:43,520
it compare to the finite field case? And

1314
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:46,400
we saw last time that it's rather

1315
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:48,400
different from um the finite field case

1316
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:50,640
because of an example where X is very

1317
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:52,960
clumped together.

1318
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:58,120
Um okay, so let me put up here a couple

1319
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:58,120
of examples in our new geometric setup.

1320
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:07,640
Okay. So, example one

1321
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:12,520
is a square grid

1322
01:12:13,679 --> 01:12:17,480
that's spaced out.

1323
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:22,199
Okay. So, it looks like this.

1324
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:31,679
It's going to be an n byn grid.

1325
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:33,040
And um I'm going to it's inside of an R

1326
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:34,960
ball, but I'm going to make it as spread

1327
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:37,840
out as possible. And so the distance

1328
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:40,719
here is about r.

1329
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:43,520
So that's my sax.

1330
01:12:40,719 --> 01:12:47,320
Okay. And d could be the same as before.

1331
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:47,320
It could be the directions

1332
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:55,440
with slope

1333
01:12:50,320 --> 01:13:00,040
um a1 over a2 where a1 and a2 are

1334
01:12:55,440 --> 01:13:00,040
integers going from one up to a.

1335
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:06,239
Okay. And if you if you compute how big

1336
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:08,640
the projection is, it's the same as

1337
01:13:06,239 --> 01:13:10,719
before.

1338
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:13,199
A * n the same that's the same thing we

1339
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:15,040
got before at the beginning of class.

1340
01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:17,280
except that the projection is never

1341
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:19,120
bigger than r. You know, you project a

1342
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:21,120
whole ball of radius r, you get an

1343
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:22,640
interval of length r. So, it's never

1344
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:27,080
bigger than that. So, I'll put the

1345
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:27,080
minimum the same.

1346
01:13:28,239 --> 01:13:31,760
Okay, there was one scenario. This is an

1347
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:34,080
integer grid, which was an important

1348
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:35,360
example before. But another thing you

1349
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:39,080
can do is you can take these points and

1350
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:39,080
clump them way together.

1351
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:47,199
So example two

1352
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:50,560
is a clump.

1353
01:13:47,199 --> 01:13:54,280
So I take a ball of radius n and I fill

1354
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:54,280
it with unit balls.

1355
01:13:57,199 --> 01:14:00,640
So we still have the number of balls is

1356
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:03,360
around n^ squ but they're much more

1357
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:07,120
clumped together.

1358
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:09,520
And when you do that, pi theta of x is

1359
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:11,440
only around n. You know, you project

1360
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:14,080
this set x in any direction, it'll be an

1361
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:16,239
interval of length n. And so that's true

1362
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:17,840
for everything.

1363
01:14:16,239 --> 01:14:22,480
And if you compare these examples,

1364
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:27,040
you'll see that this one uh has has a

1365
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:29,040
much smaller has much bigger s than uh

1366
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:30,880
sorry, much smaller s's than than this

1367
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:33,679
one. This example is much more extreme

1368
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:33,679
than the grid.

1369
01:14:34,159 --> 01:14:38,159
Okay,

1370
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:40,560
so it turns out that just asking the

1371
01:14:38,159 --> 01:14:43,360
question, if you know the cardality of X

1372
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:46,719
and you know the cardality of D, um what

1373
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:47,840
can you say about S? Uh we we'll answer

1374
01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:49,120
that question. That's a somewhat

1375
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:51,520
interesting question and and we'll

1376
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:56,000
answer it. Um but it's not the most

1377
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:57,199
interesting question. the the phenomenon

1378
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,120
there's a phenomenon that's more

1379
01:14:57,199 --> 01:15:00,640
interesting which is that as the points

1380
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:03,120
get spread out you get stronger

1381
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:05,360
estimates.

1382
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:07,600
Okay. So what does it mean that the

1383
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:10,719
points get spread out? We need to have

1384
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:12,159
some rules about it or you know how do

1385
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:16,320
we make that precise that they're spread

1386
01:15:12,159 --> 01:15:18,640
out. Um so being clumped together means

1387
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:21,440
there are a lot of points in a small

1388
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:23,840
ball and we can quantify that in the

1389
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:27,920
following way.

1390
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:30,159
N subx of R is the maximum over any

1391
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:33,280
choice of center

1392
01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:37,800
of the size of X in the ball around

1393
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:37,800
center C with radius R.

1394
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:41,840
So you can see that this quantity would

1395
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:45,199
be quite large in this example

1396
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:47,199
especially if you took little r to be n

1397
01:15:45,199 --> 01:15:48,960
and it would be a lot smaller in this

1398
01:15:47,199 --> 01:15:51,960
example. So that point is more spread

1399
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:51,960
out.

1400
01:15:53,920 --> 01:16:01,360
Okay. And it turns out it doesn't just

1401
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:02,880
matter how our set of points is spaced.

1402
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:05,120
It also matters how our set of

1403
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:08,480
directions is spaced.

1404
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:12,880
So we'll talk about that also. So n subd

1405
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:15,760
of r is the maximum

1406
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:16,880
um over any

1407
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:21,920
actually I'll give this another letter.

1408
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:24,880
I'll call it row. Any arc

1409
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:27,520
um of length row

1410
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:32,000
in s1. So we have the directions as a

1411
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:36,000
subset of S1 of the number

1412
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:38,159
of the directions in the arc.

1413
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:40,960
So for you pick a particular parameters

1414
01:16:38,159 --> 01:16:43,199
a size row and you ask how many uh

1415
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:48,280
directions are there in in an arc of

1416
01:16:43,199 --> 01:16:48,280
size row. So that's this thing.

1417
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:59,840
Okay. Um so you could describe the our

1418
01:16:58,159 --> 01:17:02,800
goal in projection theory in uklidian

1419
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:04,640
space in the following way. Given some

1420
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:09,199
information about this thing and that

1421
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:11,440
thing try to estimate um uh s and d and

1422
01:17:09,199 --> 01:17:14,440
x.

1423
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:14,440
Um

1424
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:23,920
you can phrase it that way. Um and then

1425
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:24,960
there's a whole world of questions

1426
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:27,920
because there's a lot of different

1427
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:31,760
things you could assume about nx and n

1428
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:33,360
uh d. There's one particular scenario uh

1429
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:36,000
one particular set of assumptions that

1430
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:37,600
has been investigated a lot and it seems

1431
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:41,600
it's not the only interesting one but it

1432
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:43,920
seems to be uh important and and uh a

1433
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:49,199
good thing to focus on.

1434
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:52,199
So we could say that X is a alpha

1435
01:17:49,199 --> 01:17:52,199
dimensional

1436
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:55,960
set of balls.

1437
01:17:57,679 --> 01:18:01,760
F

1438
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:03,679
the total number of balls is around R to

1439
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:07,199
the alpha

1440
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:10,440
and N sub R of X is less than little R

1441
01:18:07,199 --> 01:18:10,440
to the alpha.

1442
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:16,600
This numerology is sort of consistent

1443
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:16,600
with how fractals behave.

1444
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:23,239
Okay. And there's a and then you can

1445
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:23,239
make a similar definition for D.

1446
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:43,280
Maybe people feel it's not so I know

1447
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:44,960
people might feel it's not so clear why

1448
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:48,080
to focus on this particular set of

1449
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:51,199
conditions. We can talk about it. Uh

1450
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:54,159
okay. Anyway, so

1451
01:18:51,199 --> 01:18:57,040
so the final thing is that if you take

1452
01:18:54,159 --> 01:18:58,880
this set of conditions, then we can do a

1453
01:18:57,040 --> 01:19:01,360
version in uklidian space of the

1454
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:04,320
conjecture and theorem one and theorem 2

1455
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:05,840
and all the numbers match up and we can

1456
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:08,000
prove a version of theorem one that

1457
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:09,600
looks just like that with this double

1458
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:11,280
counting and we can prove a version of

1459
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:13,440
theorem two that looks just like that

1460
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:15,120
with for analysis

1461
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:17,360
and we have a conjecture that looks just

1462
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:21,360
like that.

1463
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:23,440
Um and um the the big recent result that

1464
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:25,920
I hinted at in the first class is that

1465
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:28,880
that that the analog of that conjecture

1466
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:30,960
is proven.

1467
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:32,640
Okay. So at the beginning of class on

1468
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:35,840
Tuesday, I will write all those things

1469
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:38,080
down and then we'll um and then we'll do

1470
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:39,520
analysis in R2 and we'll and we'll prove

1471
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:42,640
theorem one. Theorem one prime and

1472
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:44,960
theorem two prime.

1473
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:46,800
Okay, great. We'll stop there. Have a

1474
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:49,800
great weekend and I will see you next

1475
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:49,800
week.
