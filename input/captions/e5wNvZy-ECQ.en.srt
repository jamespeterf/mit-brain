graduate of Purdue and USC mr. Armstrong

59
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:53,420
joined NASA as a test pilot after

60
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:55,250
serving in Korea in 1962 he transferred

61
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:57,950
to the astronaut corps it was a

62
00:02:55,250 --> 00:03:00,040

66
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:09,740
mr. Armstrong is known throughout the

67
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:11,930
world for the words that's one small

68
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:14,209
step for a man one giant step for

69
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:16,940
mankind which he spoke as the first

70
00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:20,450
human to step on the moon on July 20th

71
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:24,620
1969 his hiking partner on the Apollo 11

72
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:26,420
expedition dr. Buzz Aldrin jr. also a

73
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:29,110
graduate of our department is here with

74
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:29,110
us today Buzz

75
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:52,730
after late after leaving NASA sorry buzz

76
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:55,519
I have to cut off the applause after

77
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:56,480
leasing leaving NASA in 1971 Neil has

78
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,129
been a professor of aerospace

79
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,409
engineering at the University of

80
00:03:58,129 --> 00:04:02,140
Cincinnati and as president presently

81
00:04:00,409 --> 00:04:05,930
chairman of ail Systems Incorporated

82
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:08,390
electronics manufacturer twenty-five

83
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:10,790
years ago the attention of the world was

84
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:13,310
focused on a race to put man on the moon

85
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:16,639
such a feat seemed unbelievable to most

86
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:19,100
humans today mankind debates the wisdom

87
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,560
of man space program and the priorities

88
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:24,260
for its funding but since Neil and Buzz

89
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:26,570
walked on the moon how many times have

90
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:29,720
we all heard someone say if we can put a

91
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:32,720
man on the moon why can't we whatever

92
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,610
the problem is the Apollo program stands

93
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,860
as the benchmark for what mankind can

94
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:39,530
accomplish and a challenge to all those

95
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:41,780
who follow today we will hear just how

96
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:43,280
difficult this challenge was as our

97
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:45,889
speakers tell us about engineering

98
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,419
aspects of a lunar landing please join

99
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:48,220
me in welcoming dr. Siemens to the

100
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:51,429
podium

101
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:51,429
[Applause]

102
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,730
thank you

103
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:10,789
Neal and I flipped the coin I'm going to

104
00:05:09,169 --> 00:05:15,529
take the left-hand side he's going to

105
00:05:10,789 --> 00:05:19,339
take the right it's certainly a

106
00:05:15,529 --> 00:05:21,589
certainly a great honor for me to to be

107
00:05:19,339 --> 00:05:25,400
involved with the Gardiner lecture and

108
00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:27,499
to be on the podium with Neil and I can

109
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,839
honestly say that that wouldn't it

110
00:05:27,499 --> 00:05:33,620
wouldn't have happened if it hadn't been

111
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:37,430
for my my former boss my my first boss

112
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:40,659
my mentor for for 15 years here at the

113
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:45,800
Institute person by the name of dr. a /

114
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:48,830
now doc on occasion used to use the

115
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:51,620
analogy of fire engines their power

116
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:53,539
their speed their energy when Air Force

117
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:56,749
or Navy brass complete with entourage

118
00:05:53,539 --> 00:05:58,639
use would visit the lab he'd say we're

119
00:05:56,749 --> 00:06:02,569
nothing but little boys on the sidewalk

120
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:04,039
watching the fire engines go by and at

121
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:10,729
this point I'm going to show you what

122
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:14,020
doctor like to do best doc love to work

123
00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:16,520
with equipment he also like people but

124
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:19,729
nothing nothing better for Doc than to

125
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:22,819
and to have a new design coming along

126
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:25,219
but to test it to try it to take it up

127
00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:28,729
at an airplane or put it through its

128
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:30,889
paces and here you see my my my mentor

129
00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:33,469
dr. Draper up on the roof of his

130
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:35,719
laboratory checking out the guidance and

131
00:06:33,469 --> 00:06:38,449
navigation system that was to be used

132
00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:40,430
going to the moon and in the distance

133
00:06:38,449 --> 00:06:44,830
you can recognize the Longfellow bridge

134
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:50,439
you can see the Prudential building now

135
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:53,680
now in the in the late 1950s NASA

136
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:56,889
reminded me very much of Doc's analogy

137
00:06:53,680 --> 00:07:00,169
Keith Glennon the fire chief up front

138
00:06:56,889 --> 00:07:02,389
Bob Gilruth there he was manning the

139
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:05,270
life-support vehicle for the seven

140
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:06,649
astronauts Wernher von Braun was driving

141
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,520
a hook and ladder fortunately he had a

142
00:07:06,649 --> 00:07:09,080
Baha'i Driss

143
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,490
back in the rear the hook and lanta to

144
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:15,139
keep on the road he was a chief engineer

145
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:17,419
other engines were driven by people like

146
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:18,860
Abe silverstein and tommy Thompson and

147
00:07:17,419 --> 00:07:21,500
all the various directors and

148
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:23,270
and program managers there were a lot of

149
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:26,120
engines and there were a lot of fires to

150
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:28,699
put out now I was one of the small boys

151
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:31,819
watching the a minor approached one day

152
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:32,629
and said I wish and I was aboard when

153
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:34,669
all of a sudden

154
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:36,349
Keith Glennon who the fire chief he

155
00:07:34,669 --> 00:07:38,509
swerved over to the curb and he opened

156
00:07:36,349 --> 00:07:43,129
the door and he invited me to ride along

157
00:07:38,509 --> 00:07:44,419
with him and dr. Dryden you know asked

158
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:46,759
about you know what's really going on

159
00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:49,280
what's the rush why all this energy what

160
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:52,129
capabilities were needed before

161
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,840
obtaining all the answers Keith left and

162
00:07:52,129 --> 00:07:57,560
Jim Webb became the chief the fire

163
00:07:53,840 --> 00:08:00,590
intensified it was no longer merely a 10

164
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:03,229
alarm fire new facilities and kinds of

165
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:05,419
equipment were required we had only only

166
00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:07,639
eight years to meet a major deadline of

167
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:11,629
landing men on the moon and returning

168
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:13,879
them safely to earth now we know we met

169
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:15,229
those met the deadline below sometimes

170
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:17,419
I'll have to admit when I see the moon

171
00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:20,659
coming up over the horizon I really

172
00:08:17,419 --> 00:08:23,810
wonder if it actually happened and I

173
00:08:20,659 --> 00:08:26,360
also find it find it sometimes hard to

174
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:28,550
believe that it took place 25 years ago

175
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,580
I mean Neil and Buzz haven't changed a

176
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,580
bit

177
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:39,289
but the magnitude of the effort required

178
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:42,140
to achieve this goal was so great that

179
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:45,470
no single person could possibly observe

180
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:47,630
the total endeavor I say this because

181
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:49,640
there may be differing views of the

182
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:52,640
mission and so on could after all there

183
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:55,279
were 400,000 people involved and there

184
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,980
were many different jobs to be done now

185
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:59,690
you're about to hear two accounts

186
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:02,480
discussing the program from an

187
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:06,890
engineering standpoint when I joined

188
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:08,839
NASA in the late summer of 1960 the

189
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:12,170
agency was four hundred million dollars

190
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:15,170
apart from from President Eisenhower's

191
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:17,209
view of what we should be getting Keith

192
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:20,529
Glennon met with Maurice Stan's director

193
00:09:17,209 --> 00:09:24,190
of OMB soon after I arrived to reclaimer

194
00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:26,600
60 million of the 400 million difference

195
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:29,720
stands left at the idea

196
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:32,840
in desperation Keith's eyes what do you

197
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:37,330
want in space and Stan's replied

198
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:39,800
a bargain-basement figure 1.09 billion

199
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:42,050
sometime later at a cabinet meeting

200
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:45,350
Joyce Castilla Kowski who was the

201
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:48,200
present science advisor presented the

202
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:50,630
result of a study that indicated the

203
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,870
cost of man lunar landing would be

204
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:55,880
between twenty and forty billion dollars

205
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:58,910
after the gasping subsided around the

206
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:01,730
table Eisenhower said I wish someone

207
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:07,010
could tell me the best 1 billion dollar

208
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:10,100
program for space after Jim Webb became

209
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:13,070
chief I joined him in a visit to the new

210
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:15,020
director of OMB Dave Bell we made a

211
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:17,600
pitch for Saturn boosters in the Apollo

212
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:20,710
manned exploration beyond the existing

213
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:23,270
man operating on a shoestring mercury

214
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:26,180
when we proposed design studies for

215
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:28,370
Apollo there was no sale and it was no

216
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:29,920
sale a few days later when we met with

217
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:33,170
President Kennedy

218
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:35,240
however Gagarin's flight around the

219
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:38,090
world in 1 hour and 48 minutes of much

220
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:42,640
late a month later raised anew the

221
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:45,680
question why was the USA so far behind

222
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,460
the Congress went crazy looking for a

223
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,340
scapegoat

224
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:52,040
why wasn't NASA working 24 hours a day

225
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:53,870
to get ahead of the Soviets and let me

226
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:56,600
say at that time people were working

227
00:10:53,870 --> 00:11:00,080
down here 24 hours a day to get mercury

228
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:02,090
into orbit President Kennedy had wanted

229
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:05,120
to hear the evidence before weighing in

230
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:08,090
on new space initiatives however the

231
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:11,450
evidence had become clear whether by

232
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:13,490
luck or careful planning the Soviets had

233
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:16,460
scored big in the international arena

234
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:20,660
and Kennedy didn't propose hauling up

235
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:22,430
the white flag but what or which goals

236
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:26,420
would permit the u.s. to gain greater

237
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:28,430
respect in future years some counseled

238
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:31,700
against further manned space in favor of

239
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:35,270
intensified scientific research here on

240
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:36,650
earth or in space Kennedy reached out

241
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:39,290
beyond the staff to Vice President

242
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:41,930
Johnson and ultimately to McNamara

243
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:45,740
secretary defense and a Jim Webb for the

244
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:48,350
answers now if I can find the right

245
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:52,900
button here we go

246
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:56,360
what you have here is that that mercury

247
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:59,600
vehicle up on top of the redstone

248
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:02,480
booster this was this was really a wing

249
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,400
and a prayer type operation of it it was

250
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,500
the it was the it was a vehicle that was

251
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:10,400
being prepared for Alan Shepard at the

252
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:13,010
Cape behind it you see the very large

253
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:15,110
gantry we said I've overpowers it which

254
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:17,510
was which was backed off so that some

255
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:19,580
tests could be run but when when work

256
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:21,590
was to be done on either redstone or the

257
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:26,210
or the mercury vehicle it'd be rolled up

258
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:27,650
into place now is some foreboding the

259
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:31,400
White House allowed the mercury

260
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:33,680
suborbital flight to proceed and on May

261
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:35,870
5th Alan Shepard became a whorl figure

262
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:40,250
by traveling six hundred and thirty

263
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:44,270
miles downrange in 15 minutes the Webb

264
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:47,360
McNamara meeting it took place at the

265
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:49,070
Pentagon a following day had the benefit

266
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,520
of the world reaction to Shepards

267
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:56,060
completely open televised flight he was

268
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:58,660
agreed by the two of them that all

269
00:12:56,060 --> 00:13:01,820
missions should be conducted openly and

270
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:04,910
also that prestige was a valid national

271
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:06,860
goal it was felt that the Soviets would

272
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:08,560
soon be able to fly with multiple crew

273
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:11,480
and that proved to be correct

274
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,450
he might soon be able to actually fly

275
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:17,120
out around the moon or even go into

276
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:19,550
circumlunar flight around the moon but

277
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,350
it was also believed that they did not

278
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:22,940
have would not have the capability for

279
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:25,210
an extended period and with new

280
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:31,280
equipment to actually land on the moon

281
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:33,290
so so at this point let me just show you

282
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:36,740
what happened to just about the time

283
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:38,840
that the that this report was to be

284
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:41,450
handed in to the Vice President Johnson

285
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:42,890
and then to Kennedy there was a meeting

286
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:46,460
out of the front and the back of the

287
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:49,010
White House where President Kennedy gave

288
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:51,380
Alan Shepard the highest award that NASA

289
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:55,520
can give and behind Alan is his

290
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:58,520
beautiful wife now thanks in part to the

291
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:59,950
success of Shepards flight the President

292
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,740
and Vice President accepted the

293
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:03,970
go as did the Congress following

294
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:09,940
President Kennedy State of the Union

295
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:12,730
address on May 25th 1961 now to achieve

296
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:15,580
this goal policy issues had to be

297
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:17,260
resolved and quickly and one of one of

298
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:20,080
them had to do with with NASA personnel

299
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:22,990
build-up and a decision was made that

300
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:25,600
the necessary build-up and capability

301
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:27,910
around the country would not come by

302
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:31,090
increasing substantially the number of

303
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:33,580
people at NASA rather major support

304
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:35,490
would be required from many other

305
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:37,990
departments and agencies of government

306
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:40,390
for the Air Force for example played a

307
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:42,310
major role from a large number of

308
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:44,650
contractors and I forget the number but

309
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:46,240
it was staggering and from foreign

310
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:48,340
nations particularly those nations that

311
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:54,130
that were located where we wanted to put

312
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:56,980
large tracking antennas now the space

313
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:58,840
Task Group which had been a thousand

314
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:00,520
strong not at Langley field where the

315
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,350
astronauts were being trained and where

316
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:06,460
the where the design of the mercury was

317
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:08,920
taking place was moved to Houston Texas

318
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:11,890
and became the manned spacecraft Center

319
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:14,830
and and and now the Johnson flight

320
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:16,360
center new operations were started in

321
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:18,550
New Orleans for assembling the first

322
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:20,830
stages of the Saturn booster and in

323
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:24,130
Mississippi for testing large rocket

324
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:26,370
engines and boosters a tremendous amount

325
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:29,470
of engineering was required obviously I

326
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:31,840
believe it's true that every engineering

327
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:34,570
discipline was brought into play from

328
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:36,400
pile-driving in the in the Florida sands

329
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:39,910
to support those to become the second

330
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:42,880
largest building in the world to the

331
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:47,260
study of orbital mechanics for transfer

332
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:49,840
of astronauts from lunar landing to for

333
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:51,670
example the orbiting craft going around

334
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:55,450
the moon with Mike Collins aboard as it

335
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:59,710
turned out now I'm going to discuss for

336
00:15:55,450 --> 00:16:02,290
you three aspects of the engineering

337
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:04,690
decisions that had to be made first a

338
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:07,450
mode selection for achieving lunar

339
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:09,340
landing and return second a message

340
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:12,370
method for assembly and check-out at

341
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:13,870
Cape Canaveral and third the strategy

342
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:16,390
for evolving development

343
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:19,570
hardware into flight ready launch

344
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:23,740
vehicles as rapidly as possible and as

345
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:25,900
safely and reliably as possible I kneel

346
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:28,360
in the other hand is going to talk about

347
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:31,330
the design requirements for the lunar

348
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:32,740
landing you'll get into the subject of

349
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:36,310
the rocket engines you'll get into

350
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:38,410
guidance and navigation as well as a

351
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:40,660
subject of training and the simulation

352
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:43,480
and the special age that were required

353
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:47,589
for the crew before they made their

354
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:54,130
first of a kind mission so now turning

355
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:57,250
to the the mission itself and how is to

356
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:59,890
be accomplished the favored mode in

357
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:03,310
those days you know followed the Jules

358
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:06,760
Verne script of a takeoff with all

359
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:10,929
equipment aboard in this version called

360
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:13,329
direct ascent you peeled off booster

361
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:16,510
stages as you as you required more and

362
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:18,429
more acceleration so this happened as

363
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:20,860
the trip progressed arriving back home

364
00:17:18,429 --> 00:17:24,209
aboard the capsule that had been a home

365
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:28,809
away from home for the whole journey a

366
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:31,929
variant on its approach involved placing

367
00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:33,820
the hardware and propellants in Earth

368
00:17:31,929 --> 00:17:37,330
orbit through a series of two or more

369
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:39,280
launches several several stages or

370
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:42,660
modules could be launched separately

371
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:45,970
connected together in Earth orbit after

372
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:47,770
rendezvous and docking much as in plant

373
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:49,140
much as as a space station has been

374
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:51,429
planned today

375
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:54,429
the astronauts once they were in Earth

376
00:17:51,429 --> 00:17:56,110
orbit would then proceed to the moon and

377
00:17:54,429 --> 00:17:59,230
back just as though they'd taken off

378
00:17:56,110 --> 00:18:02,230
direct descent however there was a

379
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:05,380
strategy proposed by John who vault and

380
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:08,250
NASA research engineer which is quite

381
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:10,540
different in this mode the astronauts

382
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:13,870
traveled to the moon with two separate

383
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:16,270
habitats one spacecraft would stay in

384
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:18,280
orbit around the moon the other the

385
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:20,559
lunar lander would separate from this

386
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:23,230
spacecraft to land on the moon after

387
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:25,810
visiting a lunar surface the astronauts

388
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:27,460
would lift off from the moon rendezvous

389
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:30,490
and transfer to the

390
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:33,580
turn spacecraft what did this seemingly

391
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:36,250
more complex and possibly more dangerous

392
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:39,039
approach have to offer I mean I was

393
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:41,200
posing you don't rendezvous and dock the

394
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:44,470
obvious answer was to limit the launch

395
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,929
requirement the return spacecraft

396
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:49,049
required a heavy heat shield to protect

397
00:18:46,929 --> 00:18:52,000
the astronauts during high-speed reentry

398
00:18:49,049 --> 00:18:54,340
the requirement to land then accelerate

399
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,580
the return spacecraft back into lunar

400
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:59,500
orbit if we done it that way would have

401
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:03,640
doubled the size of the launch vehicle

402
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:05,620
at takeoff from Cape Canaveral more

403
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:08,260
detailed design brought out additional

404
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:10,210
advantages the lunar lander could be

405
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:13,720
configured for maneuverability and and

406
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:17,350
and crew visibility in the in in the

407
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:18,970
vacuum and as approach the moon where

408
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:20,500
the visibility was clearly very

409
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:23,500
important and Neill will be discussing

410
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:25,360
that with you shortly but obviously all

411
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,230
was lost if the astronauts failed to

412
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,289
rendezvous

413
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:31,090
I didn't say dock because the astronauts

414
00:19:29,289 --> 00:19:33,640
were trained to transfer to the return

415
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:37,659
capsule by evie a extra vehicular

416
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:39,700
activity if docking failed and the

417
00:19:37,659 --> 00:19:40,539
return vehicle would also be maneuvered

418
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,730
for a rendezvous

419
00:19:40,539 --> 00:19:44,830
if the lunar lander happened to run out

420
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:47,649
of gas or something went wrong assuming

421
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:49,390
it was up in orbit these aspects of the

422
00:19:47,649 --> 00:19:51,789
mission were practiced extensively on

423
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:57,700
Gemini missions that preceded Apollo and

424
00:19:51,789 --> 00:20:02,799
in simulated Apollo flights on one one

425
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:05,470
at one flight Gemini six rendezvous with

426
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:07,120
with with Gemini seven but we flipped

427
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:10,270
the numbers it was much more fun to talk

428
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:15,760
about the 76 mission rather than the 67

429
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:18,340
mission here you see a Gemini 7 with

430
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:21,159
Frank Frank Borman and Jim Lovell aboard

431
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:25,029
and they took off from a pad they were

432
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:28,330
going to fly for 14 days anyway and the

433
00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:30,850
idea was that in about 7 days if we work

434
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:33,940
posthaste night and day we could get

435
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:36,820
Gemini 6 and it's a Titan booster on the

436
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:39,650
pad and it could take off and we could

437
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:43,940
demonstrate rendezvous and

438
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:45,740
but not docking well obviously this did

439
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:47,540
take place there's little trouble at the

440
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:50,059
takeoff we had to delay a couple of days

441
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:53,150
but they not only were able to come

442
00:20:50,059 --> 00:20:54,980
reasonably close they differ as to how

443
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:58,970
close they came but I believe the

444
00:20:54,980 --> 00:21:02,150
measurement was made in centimeters no

445
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:07,220
the the extra vehicular was actually

446
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:10,220
tested on first on Gemini 4 and here you

447
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:11,929
see ed white outside the capsule and he

448
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:15,290
found that once he got outside he had a

449
00:21:11,929 --> 00:21:16,700
little a little hand rocket gun and he

450
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:19,309
could aim it in different directions and

451
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:21,530
and move back and forth and the idea

452
00:21:19,309 --> 00:21:23,300
here was that if all else failed if you

453
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:25,370
didn't dock you'll be possible for the

454
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:28,240
transfer to take place by going out of

455
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:31,550
one capsule and coming into the other

456
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:33,470
now finally the added risk had to be

457
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:36,350
viewed in the context of total risk

458
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:38,110
weighing the pros of a smaller launch

459
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:40,190
vehicle at Cape Canaveral

460
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:42,800
maneuverability and visibility near the

461
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:45,559
moon and the advantage of to inhabit of

462
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:47,750
inhabitable vehicles each with its own

463
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:49,460
life support against the greater risk

464
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:56,920
associated with rendezvous of two

465
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:59,929
vehicles in orbit around the moon now

466
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:03,559
there were there were many differing

467
00:21:59,929 --> 00:22:08,120
views on this both within and and and

468
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:10,730
without NASA let me say and a brain at

469
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:12,470
Holmes who headed the man program at

470
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:15,650
that time and Joe Shea the systems

471
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:18,380
architect who worked with him ran all

472
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:20,990
kinds of analyses and to try to get a

473
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:24,320
better feel for which was the best of

474
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:26,360
these emission approaches and while all

475
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,910
this was going on and before a decision

476
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:30,620
had been made President Kennedy and Vice

477
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:32,030
President Johnson decided they'd like to

478
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:36,920
go and visit the various centers

479
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:39,380
involved in the in the program and the

480
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:42,740
first stop was Huntsville and we ended

481
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:45,380
up very early on inside of the large

482
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:49,040
assembly hangar that's there and here

483
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:51,020
you see the entourage with President

484
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:52,460
Kennedy on the left you can see the Vice

485
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,999
President Johnson looking a little

486
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:56,419
gloomy

487
00:22:52,999 --> 00:22:57,979
facing us and on his on his right as Jim

488
00:22:56,419 --> 00:23:00,349
Webb talking to Wernher von Braun

489
00:22:57,979 --> 00:23:04,249
there's a spy looking over somebody's

490
00:23:00,349 --> 00:23:07,819
shoulder there and and then you have a

491
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:09,559
Secretary of Defense McNamara Jerry

492
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:11,179
Wiesner and Howard brown Jerry Wiesner

493
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:14,079
at that time was President Kennedy's

494
00:23:11,179 --> 00:23:15,889
science advisor and Kennedy was very

495
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:18,229
interested in so the intellectual

496
00:23:15,889 --> 00:23:20,779
aspects of things and right on the floor

497
00:23:18,229 --> 00:23:22,699
here of the this big building he started

498
00:23:20,779 --> 00:23:24,879
asking about the pros and cons the kind

499
00:23:22,699 --> 00:23:27,709
of thing we've just been discussing and

500
00:23:24,879 --> 00:23:29,029
there's a roped-off area and a whole

501
00:23:27,709 --> 00:23:30,169
bunch of press and everything on the

502
00:23:29,029 --> 00:23:32,449
other side of the rope and they could

503
00:23:30,169 --> 00:23:33,949
see this earnest discussion and Liza's

504
00:23:32,449 --> 00:23:37,129
say there was plenty of probing by the

505
00:23:33,949 --> 00:23:38,689
press after this had taken place but

506
00:23:37,129 --> 00:23:41,389
when all the dust settled and everything

507
00:23:38,689 --> 00:23:43,579
was taken into account reason prevailed

508
00:23:41,389 --> 00:23:46,269
and the Apollo mission was conducted by

509
00:23:43,579 --> 00:23:46,269
lunar orbit rendezvous

510
00:23:46,719 --> 00:23:54,439
now all previous space vehicles had been

511
00:23:51,409 --> 00:23:56,749
assembled on a launch pad and when

512
00:23:54,439 --> 00:23:59,629
latched the ground team usually about

513
00:23:56,749 --> 00:24:01,819
250 strong we're as close as you could

514
00:23:59,629 --> 00:24:03,439
get them and to have them close and have

515
00:24:01,819 --> 00:24:05,629
it safe they had lots a

516
00:24:03,439 --> 00:24:07,909
reinforced-concrete over their heads so

517
00:24:05,629 --> 00:24:09,409
the only way they could get information

518
00:24:07,909 --> 00:24:11,239
as to what was really going on was by

519
00:24:09,409 --> 00:24:13,849
looking through a submarine type

520
00:24:11,239 --> 00:24:18,339
telescope or by reading a whole bunch of

521
00:24:13,849 --> 00:24:21,979
dials and when we and in order to

522
00:24:18,339 --> 00:24:25,189
proceed you had to take the the vehicle

523
00:24:21,979 --> 00:24:26,419
stage by stage first stage on the pad

524
00:24:25,189 --> 00:24:28,609
and the next in the next Welcome

525
00:24:26,419 --> 00:24:31,479
altogether test it out and why are you

526
00:24:28,609 --> 00:24:36,259
doing this you might have tremendous

527
00:24:31,479 --> 00:24:39,919
sand storms rain hail lightning all

528
00:24:36,259 --> 00:24:41,779
kinds of things and it was just as we

529
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:43,429
thought about it as we and we tried to

530
00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:46,759
plan how we're going to assemble the

531
00:24:43,429 --> 00:24:48,829
Saturn 5 which was many many times more

532
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:51,199
larger and more complex than anything

533
00:24:48,829 --> 00:24:53,529
we've been before it was just daunting

534
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:57,889
to think of doing it out of doors and

535
00:24:53,529 --> 00:25:01,039
and for that reason we thought thought

536
00:24:57,889 --> 00:25:03,559
we should assemble indoors but of course

537
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:06,109
then you run up against the very the

538
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:07,040
very obvious problem how are you going

539
00:25:06,109 --> 00:25:09,410
to get it on the page

540
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:15,440
and also how are you going to check it

541
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:19,130
out and here you see the Saturn 5 and

542
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:20,720
the Apollo on the transporter now how

543
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:22,820
did the transporter come to look like

544
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,110
that incidentally in the distance you

545
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:26,030
can see the vertical Assembly Building

546
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:28,940
that very large building I mentioned

547
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:31,640
earlier now in the past when we move the

548
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:33,830
gantry back and forth it ran on wheels

549
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:36,020
and so we thought why not we just put a

550
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:37,940
lot of track down in wheels and no

551
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:39,740
matter how many wheels we put on we

552
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:42,230
found that if you stop the transporter

553
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:46,580
overnight you had flats on the wheel the

554
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:48,530
next day the loads was so great then we

555
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:51,620
we thought well we got a lot of water

556
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:54,260
down at the Cape and we can just build

557
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:57,310
some canals and we have floated out and

558
00:25:54,260 --> 00:26:00,800
and and and the and there wasn't a

559
00:25:57,310 --> 00:26:02,930
marine type engineer who could figure

560
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:07,640
out how to keep the hull Cluj stable if

561
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:09,470
you tried it that way so things with

562
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:11,870
titan look pretty bleak the whole

563
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:13,820
concept of an assembly bearing a

564
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:16,840
building appeared to be going out the

565
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:20,360
window when the von braun team

566
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:22,490
discovered the enormous drag lines that

567
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:25,220
are used for surface mining of coal in

568
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:27,970
Appalachia the low is carried by the

569
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:32,330
caterpillar tractors and you can see

570
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:34,910
perhaps the 3 or 4 of them there we're

571
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:36,950
carrying loads that were comparable so

572
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:39,890
what Apollo Saturn would weigh along

573
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:43,280
with its umbilical Tower and and along

574
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:45,760
with the platform itself and the drag

575
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:48,320
lines had had automatic leveling

576
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:51,200
obviously an important feature and

577
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:53,270
particularly important since to get out

578
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:56,180
to the pad three miles away this whole

579
00:26:53,270 --> 00:27:00,050
ensemble whole assembly had to go up a

580
00:26:56,180 --> 00:27:08,620
three degree slope however the use of a

581
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:13,100
transporter introduced other problems

582
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:15,350
until 1962 as I've described everybody

583
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:17,030
isn't a blockhouse and what you use

584
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:18,560
there for instrumentation is what you

585
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:20,360
use practically at home you had

586
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:22,659
thermometers and and

587
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:25,789
wires perhaps coming out inside

588
00:27:22,659 --> 00:27:27,760
voltmeters to read and so on but there

589
00:27:25,789 --> 00:27:32,090
was no way that you could connect

590
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:35,690
directly from the sensors on the on the

591
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:40,279
Apollo and the Saturn directly in to the

592
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:42,830
large control here three miles away the

593
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:45,710
the solution necessitated the conversion

594
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:48,950
of analog to digital signals never

595
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:52,460
before had so many sensors and convert

596
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:53,990
has been required the same devices were

597
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:57,320
to be used for checkout and for

598
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:59,870
launching which was also important at

599
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:02,630
large on the order of 70,000 signals

600
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:05,510
were automatically verified during the

601
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:07,220
file two minutes before a liftoff and if

602
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:09,409
the signals were not within tolerance

603
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:11,539
the launch crew would investigate and

604
00:28:09,409 --> 00:28:15,350
determine whether to scrub or continue a

605
00:28:11,539 --> 00:28:17,419
whole extensive digital processing and

606
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:19,519
computing equipment was installed in the

607
00:28:17,419 --> 00:28:22,100
base of the transporter to provide all

608
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:23,960
the necessary information for the

609
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:26,179
checkout and large cruise where the

610
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:28,130
vehicle was in assembly or sitting on

611
00:28:26,179 --> 00:28:31,100
the launch pad and you can see their

612
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:32,779
individual consoles and and at each

613
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:35,899
console you had somebody who is a

614
00:28:32,779 --> 00:28:38,510
specialist in the particular area that

615
00:28:35,899 --> 00:28:41,990
the that the instruments were measuring

616
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:44,450
and if anything appeared to be out of

617
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:46,370
Tolerance the light would go on to tell

618
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:49,279
a fellow to get alert of the gal to get

619
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:51,500
alert and and by means of the instrument

620
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:53,570
of the of the computer and so on you

621
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:56,210
could zero in and find what the fault

622
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:57,529
was and and or if you couldn't fight it

623
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:59,899
you certainly were going to we're going

624
00:28:57,529 --> 00:29:01,309
to hold or scrub if you could find it

625
00:28:59,899 --> 00:29:03,230
there were occasions when something

626
00:29:01,309 --> 00:29:09,350
would be slightly over tolerance and you

627
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:11,330
could go ahead now the last item I want

628
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:16,549
to discuss is what I've called all up

629
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:20,360
testing technologies enters into design

630
00:29:16,549 --> 00:29:23,090
decisions in many obvious ways but it

631
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:27,500
also effect affects optimal developments

632
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:30,200
often in such a subtle fashion a rocket

633
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:32,600
propelled vehicles have experienced many

634
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,780
failures pride of success went back to

635
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,850
the beginning

636
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:38,460
I understand it was a seventy-first

637
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:40,470
firing of the v2 before the Germans

638
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:44,490
achieved success at peenemünde II and

639
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:46,560
thank goodness that was the case as a

640
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:50,220
consequence the planning for the Saturn

641
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:54,050
with the von braun team in charge called

642
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:57,660
for four launches of the first stage

643
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:59,730
before going to the second stage so that

644
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:02,100
you get the first stage under control

645
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:05,460
and then you'd move on to the next now

646
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:09,030
all four were successful and by the time

647
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:11,600
saturn was it's called sa 3 and sa four

648
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:13,950
came along the press got wind of this

649
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:16,440
that we had a quite a time with a meteor

650
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:19,020
explaining why we had to spend all this

651
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:20,880
money to carry tons of sand across the

652
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:28,110
Atlantic Ocean that's about all we're

653
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:32,160
accomplishing now just just prior to the

654
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:34,380
launching of sa 5 President Kennedy who

655
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:35,820
was staying at Palm Beach said he'd like

656
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:37,290
to come over and see how things were

657
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:41,640
going on with his friend senator

658
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:44,160
smothers and and hear you here you see

659
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:45,510
him that's the that's that's a cement of

660
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:48,030
the Secret Service behind Wernher von

661
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:52,590
Braun and here you see President Kennedy

662
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:56,430
and and President Kennedy is is pointing

663
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:58,620
up at the SI five and a model of it was

664
00:30:56,430 --> 00:31:01,260
used for explanation and that's right

665
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:02,940
next to Werner and if you want to see it

666
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:05,070
in the flesh and go to the Kennedy

667
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:07,830
Library where that very same model now

668
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:10,290
rest but what we're explaining to

669
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:12,180
President Kennedy was that the next

670
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:16,620
launching which actually occurred about

671
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:18,840
six weeks later had a live upper stage

672
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:20,520
it's called the s4 stage for very

673
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:22,770
complicated reasons but it's really the

674
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:25,740
second stage would be the first time

675
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:30,540
that we tried in a major way to make use

676
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:32,880
of hydrogen as a fuel now you can see

677
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:35,310
that if we were going to proceed step by

678
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:39,150
step this way we had a long road to go

679
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:42,620
before we got to full-scale launching

680
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:46,350
with astronauts aboard of the saturn v

681
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:47,220
now george miller when he came aboard

682
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:50,520
all right

683
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:52,890
these questions in a dramatic fashion he

684
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:56,370
stated we couldn't reach our goal step

685
00:31:52,890 --> 00:32:00,750
by step we must test as much hardware as

686
00:31:56,370 --> 00:32:03,960
possible on each mission all up testing

687
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:07,409
became the watchword the first flight of

688
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:10,049
a saturn v and included all three rocket

689
00:32:07,409 --> 00:32:13,260
stages and the Apollo capsule with a

690
00:32:10,049 --> 00:32:19,740
service module the official designation

691
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:21,840
was Apollo 4a s 501 all systems were go

692
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:24,600
at lunch right on time

693
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:28,020
November fourth nineteen second sixty

694
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:29,820
seven nobody aboard of course and all

695
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:38,520
continued to perform essentially

696
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:42,240
perfectly during the entire flight and

697
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:45,830
there you see the Apollo Saturn for the

698
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:49,049
first launch of the Apollo Saturn and

699
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:51,030
it's almost read the bottom has almost

700
00:32:49,049 --> 00:32:54,299
reached the top of the umbilical tower

701
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:57,450
you can see those swing arms of our back

702
00:32:54,299 --> 00:33:00,539
away from the vehicle and this is at the

703
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:02,640
point when since the three mile distance

704
00:33:00,539 --> 00:33:06,150
to the spectators and to the large

705
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:10,919
control when you could first hear the

706
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:13,620
sound of those rocket motors and it was

707
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:15,480
really intense when I say here you

708
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:18,390
didn't just hear them with your ears you

709
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:20,130
could feel it in your chest and you fell

710
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:23,539
it all over the roar of those engines

711
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:26,309
and the vibrations were really fantastic

712
00:33:23,539 --> 00:33:28,860
but this the principle of all our

713
00:33:26,309 --> 00:33:32,039
systems testing was established by this

714
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:33,929
daring but essential plan made possible

715
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:36,230
by greatly improved component

716
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:38,820
reliability and company and

717
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:40,200
comprehensive testing this is one of the

718
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:44,520
reasons that we had across the

719
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:47,130
Mississippi test facility now as I have

720
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:48,929
mentioned earlier Neil Armstrong will

721
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:50,909
discuss certain engineering aspects of

722
00:33:48,929 --> 00:33:52,340
the lunar landing from quite a different

723
00:33:50,909 --> 00:33:55,620
perspective than mine

724
00:33:52,340 --> 00:34:00,020
Neil's view was that of a very

725
00:33:55,620 --> 00:34:00,020
interested and technically minded user

726
00:34:01,809 --> 00:34:10,879
he was the first to conduct a successful

727
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:13,429
docking when it when he piloted Gemini 8

728
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:14,960
and docked with the Agena and that's the

729
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:16,909
whole story in itself and that was a

730
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:19,550
very exciting experience he ended up

731
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:22,700
spinning when the thing went out of

732
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:26,330
control at two revolutions a second and

733
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:29,349
he pulled his way out of it he then

734
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:33,230
landed eagle in the Sea of Tranquility

735
00:34:29,349 --> 00:34:36,109
with Buzz Aldrin at his side they worked

736
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:38,060
together as a team obviously followed by

737
00:34:36,109 --> 00:34:40,580
a docking with Mike Collins aboard

738
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:43,040
Apollo 11 spacecraft in lunar orbit and

739
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:45,379
then he went through a very high-speed

740
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:50,500
reentry to return back into the Earth's

741
00:34:45,379 --> 00:34:53,030
atmosphere and for his remarkable skills

742
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:55,669
demonstrated live before millions of

743
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:58,460
people he earned the privilege of

744
00:34:55,669 --> 00:35:01,880
addressing August groups like the one

745
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:05,960
I'm showing you here the joint session

746
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:09,530
of Congress and and here you see Neil

747
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:11,540
buzz on the right Mike on the left vice

748
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:16,580
president Agnew and the speaker

749
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:21,650
McCormack and and now the shoe is on the

750
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:25,099
other foot we here are privileged to

751
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:26,869
have Neil with us today to tell us some

752
00:35:25,099 --> 00:35:29,920
of the engineering aspects of his flight

753
00:35:26,869 --> 00:35:29,920
thank you

754
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:54,430
jacket

755
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:03,430
that's a very kind welcome and I'm most

756
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:08,260
appreciative I'm appreciative to be

757
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:11,140
asked to to give the gardener lecture as

758
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:15,190
I look on the back of your program at

759
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:19,500
the list of former lectures I'm struck

760
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:23,110
that there are some of the most able and

761
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:26,460
creative leaders in in aviation and

762
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:29,080
aerospace in in our history and the

763
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:31,650
honored that Bob and I would be asked to

764
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:34,210
add our names to that list

765
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:37,060
Bob said I'm going to talk a little bit

766
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:39,730
about the engineering aspects of the

767
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:42,790
lunar landing and you can of course find

768
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:45,310
the thousand kinds of engineering

769
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:48,460
challenges and solutions to talk about

770
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:51,670
so I thought I would highlight just that

771
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:56,140
part of the flight which was involved in

772
00:36:51,670 --> 00:37:00,090
getting from from lunar orbit to the to

773
00:36:56,140 --> 00:37:05,020
the surface of the Moon the requirements

774
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:08,260
were were relatively simple begin in

775
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:10,780
lunar orbit and end up parked on the

776
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:14,800
surface hopefully in a suitable

777
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:18,550
condition to take off again it was

778
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:23,440
desirable to be able to land at a

779
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:27,370
pre-selected location without runways

780
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:31,510
without control towers beacons or any

781
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:34,270
other aids on the surface each of the

782
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:37,150
sites that we would like to go to would

783
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:42,130
be selected to investigate different

784
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:44,680
types of lunar topography to photograph

785
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:47,340
and sample the Highlands and the craters

786
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:47,340
in the Mari

787
00:37:55,470 --> 00:38:01,710
after selecting a landing site it's

788
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:04,500
longitude and latitude could be

789
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:08,090
accurately determined from lunar maps

790
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:11,100
drawn from astronomical photographs

791
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:14,690
elevations relative to the mean surface

792
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:18,990
level was considerably less certain a

793
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:22,500
landing site near the equator certainly

794
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:25,830
has advantages equatorial orbits would

795
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:28,620
pass over or near the landing area on

796
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:30,270
every revolution and would give the

797
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:34,200
flight planner a good deal of

798
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:37,410
flexibility because the landing site

799
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:40,650
must lay underneath lie underneath the

800
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:44,040
orbital path or near it a site well

801
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:47,910
north or south of the equator requires

802
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:50,910
an inclined orbit the moon's rotation

803
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:55,350
about its axis is about a half a degree

804
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:58,290
per hour and so the landing site is

805
00:38:55,350 --> 00:39:02,040
always moving toward or away from an

806
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:06,560
inclined orbit adding constraints to the

807
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:10,080
trajectory plan the fact that

808
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:12,140
earth-based radar could provide accurate

809
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:15,210
spacecraft position and velocity

810
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:18,660
information at lunar distance was a

811
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:21,360
substantial engineering achievement of

812
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:23,700
course the rotation of the earth meant

813
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:27,390
that the radar itself was moving at

814
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:29,640
substantial speed additionally half of

815
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:33,060
the time it was on the side of the earth

816
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:36,950
away from the moon and could not be

817
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:39,660
utilized so three giant radars were used

818
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:42,690
more or less equally spaced around the

819
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:45,300
earth so that at least one of them was

820
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:49,470
always located in a position to give

821
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:52,020
good coverage of the spacecraft because

822
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:55,530
the entire orbit around the moon

823
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:58,380
subtended only a half a degree as seen

824
00:39:55,530 --> 00:40:02,250
from Earth some amount of tracking time

825
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:04,940
was and mathematical smoothing was

826
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:08,850
required to establish an accurate value

827
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:11,390
for the three orthogonal components of

828
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:17,670
position and the three orthogonal

829
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:21,660
components of velocity these six vectors

830
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:25,700
with the Associated time tag was known

831
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:28,560
as the spacecraft state or state vector

832
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:31,860
it could be accurately determined and

833
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:34,080
projected ahead in coasting flight but

834
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:35,790
wasn't unable to keep up whenever the

835
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:45,540
spacecraft was changing its trajectory

836
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:47,370
due to rocket thrust in 1966 the

837
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:50,700
trajectory planners were given an

838
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:52,680
unwelcome surprise it happened during

839
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:56,250
the flight of an American robot

840
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:59,730
spacecraft named lunar orbiter the first

841
00:40:56,250 --> 00:41:02,520
craft to fly around the moon its orbit

842
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:03,090
as recorded by the giant radars here on

843
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:07,020
earth

844
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:09,120
had some peculiar Wiggles in it whenever

845
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:12,210
the spacecraft flew over one of the dark

846
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:17,450
areas our Mari it was attracted inward

847
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:20,280
toward the moon the only known cause for

848
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:22,110
such a phenomenon would be an

849
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:25,170
extraordinarily strong gravitational

850
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:28,860
pull due to the very heavy spots on the

851
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:32,820
moon's surface these mass concentrations

852
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:35,370
or mass Khan's were mapped by analyzing

853
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:39,090
the orbit of the lunar orbiters and

854
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:41,670
later by the or mapping the the orbit of

855
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:44,130
Apollo 8 the first manned craft to fly

856
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:47,520
around the moon which occurred during

857
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:49,590
the Christmas of 1968 and again on

858
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:52,980
Apollo 10 the lunar landing dress

859
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:55,230
rehearsal his orbit Wiggles were quite

860
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:58,920
pronounced indicating that the mass cons

861
00:41:55,230 --> 00:42:01,170
were quite near the lunar surface there

862
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:03,720
was substantial concern that these

863
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:05,970
gravitational uncertainties would

864
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:09,680
preclude landing at a precise location

865
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:12,180
on the surface nasa's landing trajectory

866
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:14,400
specialists in houston ran many

867
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:17,280
trajectories with the varying levels of

868
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:22,100
Muskaan influence they concluded that

869
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:22,100
the masks on effects were acceptable

870
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:28,570
additionally they considered aspersions

871
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:31,180
in inertial guidance alignment in rocket

872
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:34,920
engine performance to possible

873
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:38,310
conditions were to be considered a

874
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:42,310
successful completion of the landing or

875
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:45,070
a discontinuance of the approach during

876
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:48,850
the descent for any one of a variety of

877
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:51,370
reasons the dispersions should not

878
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:54,880
prevent the successful execution of

879
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:58,300
either in the case of the abort back to

880
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:01,210
orbit the dispersion should not put the

881
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:03,670
lunar module in a trajectory that would

882
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:07,690
make a subsequent rendezvous with the

883
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:09,640
command module impossible the rocket

884
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:13,320
engine to be used in the descent was

885
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:17,110
critical there would be a substantial

886
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:20,590
advantage in using a minimum weight

887
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:24,670
system wait was that a real premium as

888
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:28,720
bob has discussed that would dictate

889
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:32,220
high chamber pressure and high energy

890
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:35,350
propellants top candidates would be

891
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:39,190
liquid hydrogen as the fuel and liquid

892
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:41,710
oxygen as the oxidizer these propellants

893
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:44,560
were cryogenic it is they had to be kept

894
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:47,290
at very low temperatures to maintain the

895
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:49,930
liquid phase and it was a four-day trip

896
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:52,210
to the moon and there was a chance of

897
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:57,850
substantial evaporative loss during the

898
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:59,350
trip an alternate possibility was to use

899
00:43:57,850 --> 00:44:03,090
propellants that were liquid at normal

900
00:43:59,350 --> 00:44:09,760
temperatures fuels such as alcohol or

901
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:11,200
kerosene hydrazine oxidizers such as

902
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:16,410
hydrogen peroxide or

903
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:20,110
nitrogen tetroxide the combination

904
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:24,490
eventually was selected was a hydrazine

905
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:27,070
udmh blend as the fuel and nitrogen

906
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:29,430
tetroxide as the oxidizer now both of

907
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:32,620
those are liquids at normal atmospheric

908
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:34,370
pressures and temperatures but they're

909
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:37,310
very toxic and nasty

910
00:44:34,370 --> 00:44:39,620
to work with they had been in common use

911
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:42,530
for rockets for decades however in their

912
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:46,430
nature however unpleasant was well known

913
00:44:42,530 --> 00:44:49,780
and understood combination had an

914
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:54,320
important advantage they were hypergolic

915
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:56,660
that is they the fuel burned whenever it

916
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:58,940
came in contact with the oxidizer they

917
00:44:56,660 --> 00:45:01,130
were self-igniting so there was no need

918
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:04,690
for spark plugs or other special

919
00:45:01,130 --> 00:45:07,780
ignition devices or other systems

920
00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:10,970
additionally the combination had

921
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:14,120
reasonable specific impulse or energy

922
00:45:10,970 --> 00:45:17,210
efficiency at relatively low chamber

923
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:20,060
pressures that permitted a pressure fed

924
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:22,670
rocket that did not require the weight

925
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:26,060
and complexity of a turbo pump to boost

926
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:29,770
the pressure the resulting combination

927
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:32,510
was conceptually simple and reliable

928
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:36,290
however there was one other requirement

929
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:39,590
that was everything but simple somehow

930
00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:44,060
this rocket needed to provide a wide

931
00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:47,150
variation in thrust to efficiently

932
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:50,870
decelerate from orbital velocity

933
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:54,670
required a high thrust level landing

934
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:57,830
required a relatively low thrust level

935
00:45:54,670 --> 00:46:03,040
orbital speed in lunar orbits

936
00:45:57,830 --> 00:46:05,870
approximately 5,500 feet per second now

937
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:10,090
some of you will be surprised by my

938
00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:10,090
archaic use of English units

939
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:21,050
although new metric RSI was used in a

940
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:23,420
few places in NASA in those days English

941
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:25,910
units were the predominant standard and

942
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:28,970
because this is an engineering history

943
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:39,530
lecture I'll use the English units that

944
00:46:28,970 --> 00:46:41,900
were the norm at the time using Newton's

945
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:44,000
law and the second law and the

946
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:46,610
definition of rocket specific impulse

947
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:49,610
one can readily determine the propellant

948
00:46:46,610 --> 00:46:52,430
required to decelerate a mass from orbit

949
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:57,710
to zero velocity we leave it as an

950
00:46:52,430 --> 00:47:01,310
exercise for the student for the lunar

951
00:46:57,710 --> 00:47:03,440
case each for each pound to be delivered

952
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:05,510
to the surface requires slightly more

953
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:08,360
than a pound of our selected propellant

954
00:47:05,510 --> 00:47:11,870
so the initial weight in orbit must be

955
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:15,140
more than twice the landing weight when

956
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:18,080
the craft was landing or hovering above

957
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:19,880
the surface preparing to land the thrust

958
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:22,850
would need to be equal to the landing

959
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:25,370
weight plus some modulation to allow for

960
00:47:22,850 --> 00:47:29,200
increasing and reducing the rate of

961
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:29,200
descent while maneuvering for landing

962
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:38,800
most of rocket engines of that era were

963
00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:41,870
operated at essentially fixed thrust

964
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:44,450
throttle engines were very rare and

965
00:47:41,870 --> 00:47:48,230
those that had been tried had far less

966
00:47:44,450 --> 00:47:51,070
modulation than would be necessary the

967
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:54,380
engineering challenge was substantial

968
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:57,860
two contending approaches were tried one

969
00:47:54,380 --> 00:48:00,950
concept use an inert gas into the

970
00:47:57,860 --> 00:48:03,200
propellant it inserted in our gas into

971
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:05,570
the propellant line between the tanks

972
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:08,060
and the rocket so that the thrust would

973
00:48:05,570 --> 00:48:09,770
be reduced while the total flow rates

974
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:13,400
through the combustion chamber would be

975
00:48:09,770 --> 00:48:16,820
constant at all times the competing area

976
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:20,900
are competing idea used a mechanical

977
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:23,779
throttling system using cavitating

978
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:28,319
venturi flow control valves

979
00:48:23,779 --> 00:48:31,890
that engine which was built by STL later

980
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:34,289
to become TRW was selected for the lunar

981
00:48:31,890 --> 00:48:37,589
module but actually both approaches

982
00:48:34,289 --> 00:48:40,140
worked quite well surprisingly well the

983
00:48:37,589 --> 00:48:42,869
engine had a maximum thrust of 10,000

984
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:47,339
pounds and could be modulated between

985
00:48:42,869 --> 00:48:50,759
1000 and 6000 pounds the thrust needed

986
00:48:47,339 --> 00:48:54,059
to hover before landing was about 2,500

987
00:48:50,759 --> 00:48:58,109
pounds and the variation available then

988
00:48:54,059 --> 00:49:00,930
1 to 6000 was adequate for that task in

989
00:48:58,109 --> 00:49:03,269
the thrust region between maximum thrust

990
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:05,729
and and the throttling range the

991
00:49:03,269 --> 00:49:07,979
cavitating then Therese would be

992
00:49:05,729 --> 00:49:11,660
intermittently cavitating or not and

993
00:49:07,979 --> 00:49:14,309
produce an unpredictable mixture ratio

994
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:18,539
the thrust that thrust range was

995
00:49:14,309 --> 00:49:22,009
prohibited to us due to the probability

996
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:25,019
of excessive erosion of the nozzle

997
00:49:22,009 --> 00:49:28,650
simplicity and reliability were selected

998
00:49:25,019 --> 00:49:31,380
over performance the rocket is the

999
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:33,989
simple pressure fed system the

1000
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:37,349
propellants were pushed into the rocket

1001
00:49:33,989 --> 00:49:40,229
by gas pressure helium stored in a

1002
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:43,680
supercritical state at about 1600 psi

1003
00:49:40,229 --> 00:49:48,930
and that was used to pressurize the

1004
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:51,619
tanks at about 235 psi maximum chamber

1005
00:49:48,930 --> 00:49:56,670
pressure in the combustion chamber was a

1006
00:49:51,619 --> 00:49:59,130
remarkably low 103 psi at maximum thrust

1007
00:49:56,670 --> 00:50:02,849
and considerably less in the throttling

1008
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:04,589
region there were many engineering

1009
00:50:02,849 --> 00:50:06,900
accomplishments in the Apollo program

1010
00:50:04,589 --> 00:50:12,059
but many believe the descent engine was

1011
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:16,410
one of the most outstanding for guidance

1012
00:50:12,059 --> 00:50:19,529
navigation and control the lunar module

1013
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:22,319
had an inertial guidance system designed

1014
00:50:19,529 --> 00:50:23,999
here at the Draper lab which at that

1015
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:28,559
time was called the instrumentation

1016
00:50:23,999 --> 00:50:29,969
laboratory the system included a three

1017
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:34,099
degree of freedom and Herschel

1018
00:50:29,969 --> 00:50:36,950
measurement unit and a digital computer

1019
00:50:34,099 --> 00:50:39,829
the IMU was the navigation

1020
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:42,700
sensor using accelerometers and gyros to

1021
00:50:39,829 --> 00:50:47,180
sense attitude and velocity changes a

1022
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:49,250
computer which included the navigation

1023
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:52,010
logic for calculating the guidance

1024
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:59,740
commands was a 70-pound

1025
00:50:52,010 --> 00:51:03,950
16-bit machine at 36 K Arum and woven

1026
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:06,320
woven rope cores had no color monitor

1027
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:10,760
not even a black and water white monitor

1028
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:13,460
no alpha numerics all communication to

1029
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:16,880
and from the operator was through three

1030
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:21,140
registers of seven digits two for

1031
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:24,680
identification and five for data by

1032
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:27,380
today's work stamp workstation standards

1033
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:32,570
or even in comparison with a Mac or PC

1034
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:35,359
it was a primitive device but it was far

1035
00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:36,079
advanced over anything we had had up to

1036
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:38,420
that time

1037
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:42,339
and we were delighted to have it even

1038
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:42,339
though it cost more than a small country

1039
00:51:46,859 --> 00:51:53,619
the orbital altitude selected to

1040
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:56,980
initiate the powered descent was 50,000

1041
00:51:53,619 --> 00:51:59,170
feet descents from altitude above 50,000

1042
00:51:56,980 --> 00:52:02,440
feet required increasing amounts of

1043
00:51:59,170 --> 00:52:05,430
propellant and altitudes below 50,000

1044
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:08,200
feet increasingly reduced safety margins

1045
00:52:05,430 --> 00:52:11,140
altitude errors in either direction

1046
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:12,790
could prevent guidance equations from

1047
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:16,869
converging and would prevent a

1048
00:52:12,790 --> 00:52:19,869
successful landing the moon of course

1049
00:52:16,869 --> 00:52:21,880
has no atmosphere the normal flight

1050
00:52:19,869 --> 00:52:24,340
instruments of an aircraft the altimeter

1051
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:26,859
airspeed indicator Mach meter rate of

1052
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:29,310
climb are all atmospheric sensing

1053
00:52:26,859 --> 00:52:32,410
devices and will not operate in a vacuum

1054
00:52:29,310 --> 00:52:35,350
but clearly such information directly

1055
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:38,880
measured would be of considerable use to

1056
00:52:35,350 --> 00:52:41,890
the crew so a specially designed radar

1057
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:48,880
attached to the lunar module was used to

1058
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:54,609
determine altitude and velocity the

1059
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:58,330
landing radar directed four beams to the

1060
00:52:54,609 --> 00:53:00,970
lunar surface a three beam Doppler

1061
00:52:58,330 --> 00:53:03,970
velocity sensor and one beam for the

1062
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:05,950
determination of slant range with

1063
00:53:03,970 --> 00:53:07,810
appropriate coordinate transformations

1064
00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:09,670
the results could be converted into

1065
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:12,510
altitude and three components of

1066
00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:15,130
velocity all relative to the surface

1067
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:17,830
because the radar beams were traversing

1068
00:53:15,130 --> 00:53:20,200
an irregular in even mountainous surface

1069
00:53:17,830 --> 00:53:24,040
the radar data was jumping and required

1070
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:29,890
some smoothing within the guidance

1071
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:34,150
computer and I'd mentioned a lot about

1072
00:53:29,890 --> 00:53:39,460
two guys at the at the Draper lab or the

1073
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:43,650
instrumentation lab who were in in large

1074
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:47,320
way responsible dick bet and then George

1075
00:53:43,650 --> 00:53:52,030
cherry-picks here today and many of you

1076
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:54,180
all here today I'm sure helped NIC and

1077
00:53:52,030 --> 00:53:57,059
George with those projects and

1078
00:53:54,180 --> 00:54:01,289
and we remember that work and very well

1079
00:53:57,059 --> 00:54:05,160
and with a great deal of respect the

1080
00:54:01,289 --> 00:54:06,450
descent trajectory was divided into

1081
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:08,999
three parts

1082
00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:12,869
the breaking phase the approach phase

1083
00:54:08,999 --> 00:54:16,230
and the landing phase the breaking phase

1084
00:54:12,869 --> 00:54:19,170
was intended to provide deceleration

1085
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:22,859
from orbital velocity down to something

1086
00:54:19,170 --> 00:54:24,630
under 1,000 feet per second best fuel

1087
00:54:22,859 --> 00:54:27,089
efficiency dictate that that be

1088
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:29,759
conducted at maximum thrust as we've

1089
00:54:27,089 --> 00:54:32,609
discussed the breaking phase covered

1090
00:54:29,759 --> 00:54:35,549
slightly more than 200 miles in about

1091
00:54:32,609 --> 00:54:38,460
eight and a half minutes the last two

1092
00:54:35,549 --> 00:54:42,180
minutes utilized the lower throttling

1093
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:44,549
region of the of the engine to allow for

1094
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:49,200
Corrections of dispersions in engine

1095
00:54:44,549 --> 00:54:52,680
thrust and in trajectory the braking

1096
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:54,599
phase was designed to place the lunar

1097
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:57,089
module at about four and a half miles

1098
00:54:54,599 --> 00:55:00,989
short of the landing site at an altitude

1099
00:54:57,089 --> 00:55:04,230
of about seven thousand feet from this

1100
00:55:00,989 --> 00:55:05,849
point the approach phase was initiated

1101
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:08,069
here the cruise should be able to pick

1102
00:55:05,849 --> 00:55:11,099
up visual contact with the planned

1103
00:55:08,069 --> 00:55:13,769
landing site the guidance logic which

1104
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:16,019
could be characterized as downrange

1105
00:55:13,769 --> 00:55:18,869
acceleration command which was a

1106
00:55:16,019 --> 00:55:21,390
quadratic function of time was designed

1107
00:55:18,869 --> 00:55:24,569
to bring the craft down to 500 feet just

1108
00:55:21,390 --> 00:55:26,880
short of the landing point from this

1109
00:55:24,569 --> 00:55:29,249
point the autopilot could complete an

1110
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:30,869
automatic touchdown or the crew could

1111
00:55:29,249 --> 00:55:33,720
maneuver to the preferred landing

1112
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:35,849
location in actuality the crews were

1113
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:38,670
reluctant to commit to an automatic

1114
00:55:35,849 --> 00:55:40,650
landing the auto pilot had no way of

1115
00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:42,960
picking out the smoothest landing area

1116
00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:44,819
and it was not protected against landing

1117
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:49,049
with one landing pad sticking in a

1118
00:55:44,819 --> 00:55:51,809
crater analytical studies had indicated

1119
00:55:49,049 --> 00:55:55,680
7% of automatic landings would overturn

1120
00:55:51,809 --> 00:55:59,069
on touchdown so it's not not surprising

1121
00:55:55,680 --> 00:56:01,789
that the Apollo landings where land were

1122
00:55:59,069 --> 00:56:01,789
flown manually

1123
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:08,720
now I put this diagram in because when

1124
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:13,120
I'm when I was teaching these these are

1125
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:13,120
the quality of the slides I used to use

1126
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:19,310
because of the reduced gravity a machine

1127
00:56:16,850 --> 00:56:20,680
hovering over the moon as shown in the

1128
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:23,060
middle there would require only

1129
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:25,550
one-sixth of the vertical thrust it

1130
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:29,090
would need hovering over earth as on the

1131
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:32,360
left side so while slowing to a hover

1132
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:34,990
the forward component of that of that

1133
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:38,360
thrust is consequently only one-sixth of

1134
00:56:34,990 --> 00:56:44,090
its value on earth and likewise the

1135
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:46,520
deceleration is only 1/6 so to obtain

1136
00:56:44,090 --> 00:56:49,010
the same translational acceleration or

1137
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:51,530
deceleration as you would get in an

1138
00:56:49,010 --> 00:56:55,460
earth on the left there requires

1139
00:56:51,530 --> 00:56:57,410
attitude changes as shown on the far

1140
00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:59,510
right side that are approximately six

1141
00:56:57,410 --> 00:57:02,690
times larger than would be required on

1142
00:56:59,510 --> 00:57:05,510
earth traversing large pitcher role

1143
00:57:02,690 --> 00:57:09,080
angles of course either requires more

1144
00:57:05,510 --> 00:57:10,400
time or larger control powers it was

1145
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:12,740
expected that the control

1146
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:14,620
characteristics ideal here on earth

1147
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:18,740
would not at all be acceptable

1148
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:21,380
acceptable on the moon these concerns

1149
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:23,630
had been the subject of much attention

1150
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:27,530
in the years immediately prior to the

1151
00:57:23,630 --> 00:57:31,040
landing attempt a variety of studies and

1152
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:34,190
simulations had been conducted attitude

1153
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:36,410
changes in roll and pitch in yaw were

1154
00:57:34,190 --> 00:57:39,740
assumed to be achieved by the use of

1155
00:57:36,410 --> 00:57:42,860
small attitude control rockets in the

1156
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:45,350
ground-based flight simulators pilots

1157
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:48,470
found that they could control attitude

1158
00:57:45,350 --> 00:57:50,840
well with reaction control rockets but

1159
00:57:48,470 --> 00:57:53,690
they encountered difficulty in making

1160
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:56,110
precise landings and eliminating

1161
00:57:53,690 --> 00:57:59,360
residual velocities at touchdown

1162
00:57:56,110 --> 00:58:02,470
it was clear that something nearer to

1163
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:05,510
the real flying experience was needed

1164
00:58:02,470 --> 00:58:08,420
helicopters were tried they could hover

1165
00:58:05,510 --> 00:58:11,330
and they could duplicate the final lunar

1166
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:14,540
landing trajectory unfortunately they

1167
00:58:11,330 --> 00:58:15,450
were incapable of investigating the

1168
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:19,590
problems of moe

1169
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:22,320
concern they could neither replicate the

1170
00:58:19,590 --> 00:58:24,660
consequences of the lunar gravity or the

1171
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:28,140
handling characteristics of reaction

1172
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:30,390
control system machines fortunately

1173
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:33,120
there were two projects which were very

1174
00:58:30,390 --> 00:58:36,060
effectively filled the void the lunar

1175
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:40,520
landing research vehicle LL RV and the

1176
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:44,940
lunar landing research facility ll RF

1177
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:47,040
the LL RV was developed by NASA's Flight

1178
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:49,110
Research Center at Edwards California

1179
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:52,110
and built by the Bell Aircraft Company

1180
00:58:49,110 --> 00:58:54,540
in the lunar simulation mode the

1181
00:58:52,110 --> 00:58:56,970
turbofan engine mounted in a double

1182
00:58:54,540 --> 00:59:01,350
gimbal was aligned to the local vertical

1183
00:58:56,970 --> 00:59:05,790
and the thrust adjusted to 5/6 of the

1184
00:59:01,350 --> 00:59:07,980
LRV weight the equivalent of the lunar

1185
00:59:05,790 --> 00:59:12,360
module descent engine was provided by a

1186
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:15,120
pair of throttle able 500 pound thrust

1187
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:16,170
rockets fixed to the fuselage outside

1188
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:18,780
the gimbal ring

1189
00:59:16,170 --> 00:59:22,290
these were mono propellant rockets using

1190
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:24,330
a hydrogen peroxide as a fuel the

1191
00:59:22,290 --> 00:59:26,700
turbofans angle and thrust could be

1192
00:59:24,330 --> 00:59:29,790
modulated to compensate for aerodynamic

1193
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:34,290
drag so that the craft coasted as if it

1194
00:59:29,790 --> 00:59:36,120
were flying in a vacuum the LL RV had a

1195
00:59:34,290 --> 00:59:38,760
very lightweight structure and

1196
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:41,370
encountered a variety of interactions

1197
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:43,500
between controls and low structural

1198
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:45,630
frequencies after a number of

1199
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:50,370
development changes were incorporated

1200
00:59:45,630 --> 00:59:53,070
this cleverly compensated flying machine

1201
00:59:50,370 --> 00:59:55,320
actually managed to closely duplicate

1202
00:59:53,070 --> 00:59:58,320
flying as if it were over the moon and

1203
00:59:55,320 --> 01:00:00,540
became a very useful tool for

1204
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:07,650
understanding the needs of flying in the

1205
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:11,550
lunar environment at the NASA Langley

1206
01:00:07,650 --> 01:00:15,120
Research Center an alternate approach to

1207
01:00:11,550 --> 01:00:16,560
a lunar simulation was initiated in what

1208
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:19,350
they called the lunar landing research

1209
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:23,640
facility don't have a slide I'm sorry

1210
01:00:19,350 --> 01:00:26,610
but you can imagine a craft like one of

1211
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:30,590
those stick figures I I drove suspended

1212
01:00:26,610 --> 01:00:30,590
by cables from a large gantry

1213
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:35,080
the idea again was to duplicate the

1214
01:00:33,670 --> 01:00:39,190
lunar gravity and control

1215
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:42,460
characteristics the method was to lower

1216
01:00:39,190 --> 01:00:45,880
the vehicle apparent weight to its lunar

1217
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:48,430
equivalent by lifting upward on the

1218
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:52,170
vertical cables attached to a traveling

1219
01:00:48,430 --> 01:00:55,660
bridge cake cream in a complex

1220
01:00:52,170 --> 01:00:59,400
electro-hydraulic system kept the crane

1221
01:00:55,660 --> 01:01:02,770
platform directly over the machine and

1222
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:04,960
with an upward force equal to 5/6 of the

1223
01:01:02,770 --> 01:01:07,480
vehicle weight even during translations

1224
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:11,490
and angular motions and weight changes

1225
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:16,090
during due to fuel usage it had a

1226
01:01:11,490 --> 01:01:19,300
wonderful combination of structural

1227
01:01:16,090 --> 01:01:21,810
cable stretch pendulous frequencies

1228
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:24,850
requiring innovative compensation

1229
01:01:21,810 --> 01:01:29,830
techniques it indeed was a mechanical

1230
01:01:24,850 --> 01:01:31,540
engineers dream the vehicle was attached

1231
01:01:29,830 --> 01:01:33,870
to the cables through gimbal rings

1232
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:36,460
allowing pitch roll and yaw motion

1233
01:01:33,870 --> 01:01:41,170
provided by hydrogen peroxide rockets

1234
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:42,970
and the 1/6 vehicle weight not lifted by

1235
01:01:41,170 --> 01:01:45,100
the cable system was lifted by a

1236
01:01:42,970 --> 01:01:47,860
throttle a bull hydrogen peroxide rocket

1237
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:50,140
fixed to the structure after the kinks

1238
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:51,240
worked that were worked out it it worked

1239
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:54,730
surprisingly well

1240
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:58,750
the flying volume which was about 180

1241
01:01:54,730 --> 01:02:01,870
feet high 360 feet long and 42 feet wide

1242
01:01:58,750 --> 01:02:05,290
was somewhat limiting for a pilot but

1243
01:02:01,870 --> 01:02:06,940
adequate to give a substantive

1244
01:02:05,290 --> 01:02:11,560
introduction to lunar flight

1245
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:13,990
characteristics both the L LRV and the

1246
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:16,710
ll RF were able to investigate a wide

1247
01:02:13,990 --> 01:02:19,690
range of control characteristics

1248
01:02:16,710 --> 01:02:22,360
controlled system parameters were varied

1249
01:02:19,690 --> 01:02:26,020
an optimum combinations recommended

1250
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:28,720
primarily based on pilot opinion both l

1251
01:02:26,020 --> 01:02:31,300
lr v and l l RF studies indicated that

1252
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:34,570
much lower control powers were

1253
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:37,330
acceptable than had been expected based

1254
01:02:34,570 --> 01:02:40,980
on VTOL aircraft and helicopter

1255
01:02:37,330 --> 01:02:44,670
experience it was a welcome surprise

1256
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:47,640
because low control powers result in low

1257
01:02:44,670 --> 01:02:50,339
attitude control fuel consumption these

1258
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:53,339
and related evaluations were most useful

1259
01:02:50,339 --> 01:02:57,030
in establishing the actual lunar module

1260
01:02:53,339 --> 01:02:59,579
control configuration the final lamb

1261
01:02:57,030 --> 01:03:02,490
attitude control system was rate command

1262
01:02:59,579 --> 01:03:05,220
attitude hold that is the control stick

1263
01:03:02,490 --> 01:03:07,770
commanded angular rate in all three axes

1264
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:12,240
but when centered attitude was

1265
01:03:07,770 --> 01:03:14,210
maintained based on the studies I've

1266
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:16,859
just been talking about pitch and roll

1267
01:03:14,210 --> 01:03:19,380
control power had been established at

1268
01:03:16,859 --> 01:03:21,750
eight degrees per second and maximum

1269
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:25,920
commanded rates at 20 degrees per second

1270
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:28,589
handling 20 degrees per second for the

1271
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:31,079
lunar module and that that provided

1272
01:03:28,589 --> 01:03:35,640
handling qualities that were remarkably

1273
01:03:31,079 --> 01:03:37,859
good in the ll RV here the the rocket

1274
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:40,619
was directly controlled by the throttle

1275
01:03:37,859 --> 01:03:43,320
but the lunar module the real lunar

1276
01:03:40,619 --> 01:03:45,450
module added an automatic throttle that

1277
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:48,480
would modulate thrust to maintain a

1278
01:03:45,450 --> 01:03:50,579
constant descent rate workload was

1279
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:52,980
substantially reduced and gave the pilot

1280
01:03:50,579 --> 01:03:57,650
more time to concentrate on selecting a

1281
01:03:52,980 --> 01:04:02,130
suitable landing spot a number of

1282
01:03:57,650 --> 01:04:06,930
concerns regarding lunar flying emerged

1283
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:09,630
that were unrelated to the hardware for

1284
01:04:06,930 --> 01:04:13,079
many decades astronomers were mystified

1285
01:04:09,630 --> 01:04:13,730
by the peculiar reflective qualities of

1286
01:04:13,079 --> 01:04:17,510
the moon

1287
01:04:13,730 --> 01:04:20,790
these are surprisingly large changes in

1288
01:04:17,510 --> 01:04:22,890
brightness and sun angle and a very

1289
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:25,619
bright spot along the Sun line it was

1290
01:04:22,890 --> 01:04:28,140
feared that visibility visual acuity and

1291
01:04:25,619 --> 01:04:30,140
depth perception during a lunar landing

1292
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:32,400
could be severely degraded

1293
01:04:30,140 --> 01:04:34,770
throughout the Apollo program

1294
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:37,530
development there were worries about

1295
01:04:34,770 --> 01:04:39,780
visibility degradation due to dust

1296
01:04:37,530 --> 01:04:42,869
clouds caused by the high velocity

1297
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:43,670
rocket exhaust impinging on the lunar

1298
01:04:42,869 --> 01:04:46,650
surface

1299
01:04:43,670 --> 01:04:49,319
additionally rough country a closer

1300
01:04:46,650 --> 01:04:51,599
Eisen and lack of a strong sense of the

1301
01:04:49,319 --> 01:04:54,130
vertical were possible impediments to

1302
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:57,279
precision flying

1303
01:04:54,130 --> 01:04:59,920
Lunar Module experienced normal design

1304
01:04:57,279 --> 01:05:02,019
evolution the cabin volume was changed

1305
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:04,329
from spherical to cylindrical the

1306
01:05:02,019 --> 01:05:06,910
landing legs were reduced from 5 to 4

1307
01:05:04,329 --> 01:05:11,160
the window area was substantially

1308
01:05:06,910 --> 01:05:14,049
reduced and the seat was removed a

1309
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:17,200
standing pilot or trolley conductor

1310
01:05:14,049 --> 01:05:19,720
cockpit reduced weight moved the pilots

1311
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:22,539
eye closer to the window improving

1312
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:25,240
visibility and improved the structure a

1313
01:05:22,539 --> 01:05:27,160
cable restraint system was devised to

1314
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:29,200
keep the pilots in the proper position

1315
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:33,329
in the cabin and to hold them secure

1316
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:36,220
during landing loads the fears about

1317
01:05:33,329 --> 01:05:40,799
being blinded by the sun's reflection

1318
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:43,720
were unfounded the right spot was there

1319
01:05:40,799 --> 01:05:46,930
but the human eye is quite capable of

1320
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:50,319
accommodating to it and it did not

1321
01:05:46,930 --> 01:05:53,380
hinder operations the initial flights

1322
01:05:50,319 --> 01:05:56,049
landed early in the lunar morning that

1323
01:05:53,380 --> 01:05:59,589
provided long shadows which improved

1324
01:05:56,049 --> 01:06:01,599
depth perception lunar dust on the other

1325
01:05:59,589 --> 01:06:05,920
hand proved to be a substantial

1326
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:08,920
impediment the dust was found not to

1327
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:11,769
erupt in clouds as it would here on

1328
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:14,740
earth it travels radially outward from

1329
01:06:11,769 --> 01:06:18,789
the exhaust impingement area in horror

1330
01:06:14,740 --> 01:06:21,250
horizontal thin flat sheets it's very

1331
01:06:18,789 --> 01:06:25,200
logical in the lunar vacuum that's a

1332
01:06:21,250 --> 01:06:29,200
most surprising phenomenon to earthlings

1333
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:31,980
when the rocket engine stops the dust

1334
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:35,170
immediately disappears over the horizon

1335
01:06:31,980 --> 01:06:37,480
leaving a perfectly clear view with no

1336
01:06:35,170 --> 01:06:42,190
dust cloud or other residual effects of

1337
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:45,849
any sort as might be expected the dust

1338
01:06:42,190 --> 01:06:49,740
quantity varied from landing site to

1339
01:06:45,849 --> 01:06:52,960
landing site on Apollo 11

1340
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:56,019
buzz and I had a dust sheet that was

1341
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:58,150
opaque and that's a disconcerting due to

1342
01:06:56,019 --> 01:07:00,869
its rapid movement but boulders

1343
01:06:58,150 --> 01:07:03,250
protruding above it provided benchmarks

1344
01:07:00,869 --> 01:07:07,630
adequate for estimating speed and

1345
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:11,759
altitude on Apollo's 1460

1346
01:07:07,630 --> 01:07:14,470
and 17 the dust was quite thin and

1347
01:07:11,759 --> 01:07:18,130
permitted visual reference to the

1348
01:07:14,470 --> 01:07:21,190
surface on Apollo's 12 and 15 however

1349
01:07:18,130 --> 01:07:23,950
the surface was completely obscured with

1350
01:07:21,190 --> 01:07:26,049
dust below 50 feet altitude and the

1351
01:07:23,950 --> 01:07:32,859
landings were completed essentially on

1352
01:07:26,049 --> 01:07:37,150
instruments all in all in in spite of

1353
01:07:32,859 --> 01:07:41,019
its ungainly appearance the lunar module

1354
01:07:37,150 --> 01:07:42,789
was a superb flying machine was a credit

1355
01:07:41,019 --> 01:07:49,329
to the engineering profession and to

1356
01:07:42,789 --> 01:07:53,950
those at Drummond TRW Draper lab and the

1357
01:07:49,329 --> 01:07:56,259
others who created it I'm in the debt of

1358
01:07:53,950 --> 01:07:58,150
all those folks and I thank you all for

1359
01:07:56,259 --> 01:08:45,290
the chance to join you today

1360
01:07:58,150 --> 01:08:48,120
[Applause]

1361
01:08:45,290 --> 01:08:50,760
I'm sure our speakers would be happy to

1362
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:53,880
take a few questions if maybe I could

1363
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:56,700
invite Bob and Neil to come back the

1364
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:58,350
podium and I'll sit down and I would

1365
01:08:56,700 --> 01:09:00,240
like to ask that those of you who want

1366
01:08:58,350 --> 01:09:02,090
to ask questions come forward the

1367
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:05,250
microphones because this is being

1368
01:09:02,090 --> 01:09:07,170
televised across the campus cable TV

1369
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:20,100
system and we'll have a couple questions

1370
01:09:07,170 --> 01:09:23,120
and then we'll we'll conclude it if

1371
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:26,070
you're concerned at all that the that

1372
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:28,050
funding with funding levels for the

1373
01:09:26,070 --> 01:09:29,760
space program in this country have left

1374
01:09:28,050 --> 01:09:31,770
it in decline or do you think that

1375
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:34,830
things are moving along well from your

1376
01:09:31,770 --> 01:09:39,770
point of view that's a question that has

1377
01:09:34,830 --> 01:09:39,770
to do with history in the future and

1378
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:47,250
it's really a bit outside the scope of

1379
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:52,350
this lecture but I would just say that I

1380
01:09:47,250 --> 01:09:55,290
think all of us that have been involved

1381
01:09:52,350 --> 01:09:57,960
in these these programs over the past

1382
01:09:55,290 --> 01:09:59,400
quarter century or so I've been very

1383
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:01,110
pleased with the things we have

1384
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:05,010
accomplished we're a little disappointed

1385
01:10:01,110 --> 01:10:09,780
that more things aren't being initiated

1386
01:10:05,010 --> 01:10:13,950
unless new projects are are being

1387
01:10:09,780 --> 01:10:16,230
supported but I it's my hope that that's

1388
01:10:13,950 --> 01:10:18,300
that's a temporary situation the world

1389
01:10:16,230 --> 01:10:19,050
is full of hills and valleys and that

1390
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:20,910
won't ever change

1391
01:10:19,050 --> 01:10:23,670
is there any feeling you have about

1392
01:10:20,910 --> 01:10:25,290
where programs should be where funding

1393
01:10:23,670 --> 01:10:26,940
should be directed or is there any

1394
01:10:25,290 --> 01:10:29,040
particular program or other programs

1395
01:10:26,940 --> 01:10:32,210
that you think should be priorities and

1396
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:32,210
then I promise I'll let you get away

1397
01:10:35,020 --> 01:10:43,160
well I I think I'm I feel comfortable

1398
01:10:41,180 --> 01:10:47,060
arguing in favor of any one of a number

1399
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:53,000
of new elements I'm not gonna use today

1400
01:10:47,060 --> 01:10:54,380
to pick one over the other I wonder if

1401
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:56,870
he might be able to recount some of the

1402
01:10:54,380 --> 01:11:00,290
last moments up to the lunar landing

1403
01:10:56,870 --> 01:11:01,550
specifically I understand there was the

1404
01:11:00,290 --> 01:11:02,900
radar picked up a number of boulders

1405
01:11:01,550 --> 01:11:05,180
over your landing site and you had to

1406
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:06,770
hover for quite a while and nearly ran

1407
01:11:05,180 --> 01:11:08,900
out of fuel and almost had to abort the

1408
01:11:06,770 --> 01:11:10,180
mission work you could recount how close

1409
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:18,740
you were to aborting the mission in

1410
01:11:10,180 --> 01:11:24,200
someone's last moments not sure you'd

1411
01:11:18,740 --> 01:11:27,740
all hear that but the question was

1412
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:31,490
directed toward the final part of the

1413
01:11:27,740 --> 01:11:38,930
Apollo 11 landing we're where we did

1414
01:11:31,490 --> 01:11:41,860
have some amount of divergence keep our

1415
01:11:38,930 --> 01:11:45,650
keep our minds occupied

1416
01:11:41,860 --> 01:11:49,490
fortunately Buzz was a master on the

1417
01:11:45,650 --> 01:11:53,420
computer and he was able to keep me from

1418
01:11:49,490 --> 01:11:56,540
worrying about that too much we were

1419
01:11:53,420 --> 01:11:58,910
flying into the computer the the auto

1420
01:11:56,540 --> 01:12:00,920
pilot was flying us into an area as I

1421
01:11:58,910 --> 01:12:05,890
said it couldn't know where it was going

1422
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:09,250
and it picked a very rough spot a very

1423
01:12:05,890 --> 01:12:09,250
large crater

1424
01:12:09,550 --> 01:12:16,400
but that's the size of a football

1425
01:12:12,769 --> 01:12:21,829
stadium and that would have been

1426
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:24,590
scientifically interesting but I think

1427
01:12:21,829 --> 01:12:26,389
both buzz and I both agreed that on the

1428
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:29,570
first landing we ought to pick something

1429
01:12:26,389 --> 01:12:31,039
that was a little less challenging so we

1430
01:12:29,570 --> 01:12:33,199
looked for a smooth spot and that took

1431
01:12:31,039 --> 01:12:35,690
us a while to to get over to a smooth

1432
01:12:33,199 --> 01:12:40,670
spot and yeah we did use up most of the

1433
01:12:35,690 --> 01:12:43,130
fuel that we had but I wouldn't and.yes

1434
01:12:40,670 --> 01:12:45,710
had we had to fly very much farther we

1435
01:12:43,130 --> 01:12:48,199
might have had to abort back into orbit

1436
01:12:45,710 --> 01:12:49,699
but I can't say that I really was

1437
01:12:48,199 --> 01:12:51,739
concerned about that because we were

1438
01:12:49,699 --> 01:12:54,079
getting to get down fairly close to the

1439
01:12:51,739 --> 01:12:56,119
to the surface and even if we ran out of

1440
01:12:54,079 --> 01:12:59,119
fuel a lot as long as we had an attitude

1441
01:12:56,119 --> 01:13:03,400
control with the one 6gy we thought we

1442
01:12:59,119 --> 01:13:08,090
could absorb that bump okay so I really

1443
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:10,010
I really believed that it probably

1444
01:13:08,090 --> 01:13:13,909
wasn't a significant concern although

1445
01:13:10,010 --> 01:13:15,650
buzz was worried about everything on the

1446
01:13:13,909 --> 01:13:18,409
vehicle I only had to worry about one

1447
01:13:15,650 --> 01:13:23,239
thing so he should ask him to speak for

1448
01:13:18,409 --> 01:13:25,719
himself have you ever played lunar

1449
01:13:23,239 --> 01:13:25,719
lander

1450
01:13:31,380 --> 01:13:37,010
I I have to admit I have not already

1451
01:13:35,550 --> 01:13:39,990
snot myself

1452
01:13:37,010 --> 01:13:44,250
he doesn't native I was curious as to

1453
01:13:39,990 --> 01:13:56,430
whether it was accurate thanks have you

1454
01:13:44,250 --> 01:13:58,470
but I'm sorry I was born in 1973 I was

1455
01:13:56,430 --> 01:14:00,630
wondering if you had any idea where

1456
01:13:58,470 --> 01:14:04,070
thoughts to whether people would be

1457
01:14:00,630 --> 01:14:04,070
walking on the moon during my lifetime

1458
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:18,360
well I when I was your age I was

1459
01:14:15,950 --> 01:14:22,250
absolutely certain that no one would

1460
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:22,250
walk on the moon in my lifetime

1461
01:14:24,490 --> 01:14:36,580
[Applause]

1462
01:14:38,810 --> 01:14:44,430
from the from the lecture and from

1463
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:46,380
history it was pretty clear that lots of

1464
01:14:44,430 --> 01:14:50,010
systems were being tested at once as you

1465
01:14:46,380 --> 01:14:51,870
described how did that either people in

1466
01:14:50,010 --> 01:14:54,810
the program and the pilots how did that

1467
01:14:51,870 --> 01:14:56,910
approach to testing not maybe rigorously

1468
01:14:54,810 --> 01:14:58,980
testing each system independently how

1469
01:14:56,910 --> 01:15:02,450
did you react to that how what was the

1470
01:14:58,980 --> 01:15:02,450
reaction inside the program to that

1471
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:14,460
that's perceptive question those of us

1472
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:16,800
who had been involved in testing some

1473
01:15:14,460 --> 01:15:21,240
period of time before this were had

1474
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:26,600
become advocates of of the step at a

1475
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:31,350
time system that dr. Siemens discussed

1476
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:33,090
and it was difficult for us to accept

1477
01:15:31,350 --> 01:15:38,700
the idea that we were going to test

1478
01:15:33,090 --> 01:15:40,530
everything at the same time past

1479
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:43,440
experience with that kind of thing and

1480
01:15:40,530 --> 01:15:45,330
in the aeronautical business some of you

1481
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:47,220
well know that when you fly a new

1482
01:15:45,330 --> 01:15:49,320
airplane that's also has a new engine

1483
01:15:47,220 --> 01:15:50,790
and also has a new autopilot and stuff

1484
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:53,960
you usually have a lot of problems

1485
01:15:50,790 --> 01:15:56,550
because you like to have something solid

1486
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:59,750
nevertheless what we didn't appreciate

1487
01:15:56,550 --> 01:16:02,460
at that point in time was the the

1488
01:15:59,750 --> 01:16:05,940
increased confidence level that could be

1489
01:16:02,460 --> 01:16:08,790
achieved by very diligent component

1490
01:16:05,940 --> 01:16:10,620
tests and systems testing before we got

1491
01:16:08,790 --> 01:16:12,390
to flight and that was a level of

1492
01:16:10,620 --> 01:16:15,300
concentration that we had not been

1493
01:16:12,390 --> 01:16:16,550
exposed to and didn't previously

1494
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:19,880
[Music]

1495
01:16:16,550 --> 01:16:19,880
recognize the value

1496
01:16:21,530 --> 01:16:29,100
like I speak to the pilots view of all

1497
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:32,970
up system testing but it really became

1498
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:35,400
obvious that we we're not going to be

1499
01:16:32,970 --> 01:16:38,910
able to to proceed to a final conclusion

1500
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:40,890
of the program by just putting on a

1501
01:16:38,910 --> 01:16:43,470
stage and then testing it in another

1502
01:16:40,890 --> 01:16:45,240
stage and flying it and so on but I

1503
01:16:43,470 --> 01:16:46,050
would say that we didn't didn't shift

1504
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:49,650
over

1505
01:16:46,050 --> 01:16:52,469
in desperation I mean we we felt that we

1506
01:16:49,650 --> 01:16:55,020
went we were taking a reasonable risk

1507
01:16:52,469 --> 01:16:58,550
we obviously carried out the that first

1508
01:16:55,020 --> 01:17:00,750
Saturn 5 flight without anybody aboard

1509
01:16:58,550 --> 01:17:06,630
we weren't going to go to that extreme

1510
01:17:00,750 --> 01:17:09,119
but the component testing was it was

1511
01:17:06,630 --> 01:17:11,460
obviously important but there really and

1512
01:17:09,119 --> 01:17:13,130
I think important testing that had not

1513
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:15,900
really been done so extensively before

1514
01:17:13,130 --> 01:17:18,750
was done down at the Mississippi test

1515
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:20,909
facility where we were able to take take

1516
01:17:18,750 --> 01:17:23,550
the whole a whole stage and fire up all

1517
01:17:20,909 --> 01:17:25,949
the engines and you have to realize that

1518
01:17:23,550 --> 01:17:28,020
when you did that you had to control

1519
01:17:25,949 --> 01:17:30,059
seven and a half million pounds of

1520
01:17:28,020 --> 01:17:32,880
thrust and that was that was a pretty

1521
01:17:30,059 --> 01:17:35,489
gigantic test facility but we had we

1522
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:37,949
were planning to do that anyway and by

1523
01:17:35,489 --> 01:17:40,530
increasing the level of that testing we

1524
01:17:37,949 --> 01:17:41,940
had we said we certainly had a lot more

1525
01:17:40,530 --> 01:17:45,389
confidence that what we're doing was

1526
01:17:41,940 --> 01:17:47,699
correct but I'll have to say that that

1527
01:17:45,389 --> 01:17:50,250
particularly that German teamwork were

1528
01:17:47,699 --> 01:17:52,619
quite dubious about it and they could

1529
01:17:50,250 --> 01:17:56,119
not believe it when that saturn v the

1530
01:17:52,619 --> 01:17:58,110
very first one went all the way were

1531
01:17:56,119 --> 01:17:59,820
downrange the where it's supposed to go

1532
01:17:58,110 --> 01:18:02,130
and everything fired the way it was

1533
01:17:59,820 --> 01:18:04,380
supposed to it was it was a major

1534
01:18:02,130 --> 01:18:06,030
accomplishment press wait just a little

1535
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:08,570
bit lucky but that's also important when

1536
01:18:06,030 --> 01:18:08,570
you're running a program

1537
01:18:23,530 --> 01:18:29,410
well I I certainly sense that the

1538
01:18:27,790 --> 01:18:31,330
audience is joining me in thanking our

1539
01:18:29,410 --> 01:18:33,400
speakers today and our distinguished

1540
01:18:31,330 --> 01:18:35,230
guests a number of who I've not had a

1541
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:36,700
chance to introduce to you that are in

1542
01:18:35,230 --> 01:18:38,860
the audience that contributed heavily to

1543
01:18:36,700 --> 01:18:40,120
the Apollo program you've been a

1544
01:18:38,860 --> 01:18:41,960
wonderful audience and thank you very

1545
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:47,680
much for coming

1546
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:47,680
[Applause]
