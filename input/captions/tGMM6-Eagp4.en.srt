1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:05,040
Good evening everyone. Welcome to this

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,040
evening's broad discovery center talk.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,559
My name is Tom Olrich. I'm the associate

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,880
director for science communications at

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,400
the Broad and it's my pleasure to have

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,799
you all here with us for a little while

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,400
tonight. For those of you who might be

8
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,720
joining us for the first time, the broad

9
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,480
discovery series um has a bunch of

10
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:25,039
different um bunch of different goals

11
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,320
that go along with it. Uh we explore um

12
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,920
you know, I'm usually better at this.

13
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,920
You'd think I do it four times a year.

14
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,559
We explore the genetic and biological

15
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,559
roots of health and disease.

16
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:37,360
We explore also the mechanisms that

17
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,879
govern how our cells and bodies work. We

18
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,280
talk about new technologies that are

19
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,120
changing what's possible in science. And

20
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,559
we also are talking about the progress

21
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,239
that's being made to translate new

22
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,879
discoveries into treatments for both

23
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,399
common and rare diseases. It's my

24
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:53,680
pleasure tonight to introduce Nyall

25
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,920
Lennon. Nyall is the senior director for

26
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,680
Broad's genomics platform. He's also the

27
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,920
associate director for Broad's Gersonner

28
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,760
Center for Cancer Diagnostics and in

29
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,080
addition he's also the chief scientific

30
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,000
officer of Broad Clinical Labs which is

31
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,920
a wholly owned subsidiary of the Broad

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,600
Institute.

33
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,159
Now is going to talk tonight about the

34
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,320
opportunities that the constantly

35
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,080
increasing speed and dropping cost of

36
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,960
genome sequencing are allowing for

37
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,560
healthcare both now and in the future.

38
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,240
If you have any questions for Nile

39
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,000
tonight, I encourage you to flag one of

40
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,040
our micr runners during the Q&A portion

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,280
of the evening and they'll bring a

42
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,119
microphone right to you. If you're

43
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,119
watching online, I'll be keeping an eye

44
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,640
on YouTube chat. So, if you just enter

45
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,240
your questions there, I'll make sure to

46
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,840
do my best to try to work you into the

47
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,680
conversation.

48
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,680
If you're a scientist or a Brody with a

49
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,720
deep technical question for Nile, I'm

50
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,479
going to encourage you to please

51
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,799
approach him during the reception after

52
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,240
the Q&A so that members of our local

53
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,320
community have an opportunity to have

54
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,880
their questions answered.

55
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,479
And lastly, speaking of receptions, I

56
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,560
invite everybody here in the room to

57
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,240
join us after tonight's talk and for a

58
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,560
reception at the Broad Discovery Center

59
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,560
right back out the doors here. Um, where

60
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,680
I encourage you to explore the cent's

61
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,840
exhibits and interactive elements coming

62
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,840
up now.

63
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,879
All right. Good evening. Can you all

64
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,440
hear me? All right. Yes, the

65
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:18,239
microphone's working. Fantastic. Great.

66
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:21,440
Okay. So, I am delighted to be here this

67
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:24,239
evening to talk to you about what the

68
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,760
title says, which is essentially how the

69
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,160
technologies that we're using at the

70
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,080
Broad, the data we're generating here,

71
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,360
and the biology that we're increasingly

72
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,200
understanding might play into a future

73
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,200
health care system that incorporates

74
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,319
genomic medicine.

75
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:43,040
So, in my title, I used a word that

76
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,599
should make us feel all warm and fuzzy,

77
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,920
but actually, I imagine for many people,

78
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,680
it's actually a cause of stress,

79
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,280
healthcare,

80
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,879
right? Who wakes up at three in the

81
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,879
morning and you're you're wide awake and

82
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:58,000
your mind is rushing with all of the

83
00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:00,000
topics of the day? I do sometimes. And

84
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,400
sometimes those thoughts are like, why

85
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,720
can't I play golf better? Um, sometimes

86
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,760
those thoughts are, what if I get sick?

87
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,519
What if one of the kids gets sick? It

88
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,159
today it feels like the health care

89
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,159
system has become a system that we never

90
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,159
want to have to interact with.

91
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:20,239
>> And that's probably not where we want to

92
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:21,519
be. Um but but we shouldn't despair. I I

93
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:25,840
do want to point out there's there's

94
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:27,440
some things to give us hope and

95
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,680
some things that you know when we think

96
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,920
about what's possible in modern

97
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,879
healthcare that we should really excited

98
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,599
about. um just some examples at a high

99
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:41,120
level. We do now have the capability to

100
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:44,319
see disease at the genomic level. I'll

101
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,239
describe more what that means. But more

102
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,720
importantly, we're actually increasingly

103
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,280
able to actually target with therapies

104
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,959
the exact molecular causes of disease.

105
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,599
Whereas historically we may have treated

106
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:58,879
the symptoms of disease, how diseases

107
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:01,439
show up, through the technologies that

108
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:03,040
I'll describe and the insights, we are

109
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,879
increasingly being able to see what's

110
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,360
causing that disease at the molecular

111
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:10,000
level and designing therapeutics that go

112
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:13,040
after that and that is more effective

113
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,640
and that now also for the first time

114
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,120
through technologies developed here and

115
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:21,040
elsewhere we are able to not just

116
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:23,120
identify those uh underlying changes in

117
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,040
our genomes that might be causing

118
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,800
disease. But for the first time, we can

119
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:31,440
actually start to think about editing

120
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:35,520
those genomes to fix that underlying uh

121
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:37,120
error. So these are all exciting

122
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,440
developments and they've happened just

123
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,120
over the last 20 years. Uh in fact,

124
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,000
they've started to happen just when I

125
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,680
joined the Broad Institute 20 years ago.

126
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,960
Coincidence?

127
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,320
Yes, definitely a coincidence. However,

128
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,080
there are some things that I think are

129
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,600
not coincidences. I think there's some

130
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,240
examples that we should look at where

131
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,320
there is a clear cause and effect thing

132
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:02,320
happening, right? And I I want to point

133
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:06,240
us to that time when we collectively

134
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:09,520
decide to invest in audacious projects

135
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,600
in really difficult things to generate

136
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,960
uh to achieve some really hard to

137
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,880
achieve goal and that the effect of

138
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,919
doing that has been positive in our

139
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:23,280
history. So one example being the Apollo

140
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,880
program, right? To send um uh astronauts

141
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,919
to space to land on the moon and come

142
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:31,360
back. That program ran for about 13

143
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:33,360
years from 1960 to 1973.

144
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,840
The government invested about $25

145
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,160
billion in that program. All told in

146
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,680
that time frame and estimates now

147
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,600
suggest that for every dollar we

148
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,160
invested in that program, we got a

149
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,960
return on that investment of about $7.

150
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,720
And that return on investment came from

151
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,360
solving the problems that we needed to

152
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,840
solve to achieve the goal. Uh and it

153
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,080
resulted in advancements in material

154
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:59,280
sciences, in batteries, in portable

155
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,960
tools, in memory foam. Hey, I've got a

156
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,080
memory phone mattress. Cool. I didn't

157
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,639
realize it came from the shuttle

158
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,080
program. Um but the point is when we do

159
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,720
something like this, we invest public

160
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,039
funds in something really difficult, we

161
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,479
actually receive uh returns on that

162
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:17,199
investment. So another largecale

163
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:19,360
investment that we've made as a country

164
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,120
was the human genome project. It's not

165
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,120
something that probably most of the

166
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,400
general public holds in their mind the

167
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,919
same way that sort of the Apollo

168
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:30,479
missions um kind of you know are known

169
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:32,000
but it similarly was actually

170
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,919
technologically

171
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,759
extremely difficult when it was started

172
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:38,720
when it was contemplated first.

173
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:41,840
Sequencing the three billion letters of

174
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,520
code that make up our genome at the time

175
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,560
this program was started was

176
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:49,199
extraordinarily difficult task. The

177
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,080
program took about 13 years as well to

178
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:55,759
complete. Um it ended up being about $3

179
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,759
billion of public investment and the

180
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,440
National Human Genome Research Institute

181
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,360
estimates that we've seen about a return

182
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,680
on investment of about $5 for every

183
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,800
dollar invested in that program. So

184
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,960
again, an audacious idea that we should

185
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,880
sequence the human genome has resulted

186
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:15,280
in a proliferation of fields that now

187
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,919
use those technologies and the

188
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:20,400
information that we can now generate. Um

189
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:25,280
not just in biio medicine but also in

190
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:27,520
forensics, in genealogy, in agriculture.

191
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,840
Um, so there's a ton of spaces where now

192
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,240
we use the technologies that had to be

193
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:37,199
invented to solve the human genome

194
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:39,039
project um, now in everyday uh, life.

195
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,720
So

196
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,319
I'm going to not use too much jargon

197
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,240
tonight, but I do I've already mentioned

198
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,160
the word genome a few times. So just to

199
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,720
level set the genome is basically the

200
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,319
genetic material of an organism. um

201
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,199
predominantly I'll talk about human

202
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:55,039
genomes but actually in our community

203
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,960
there are folks who study human genomes,

204
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,120
we study microbial genomes, viral

205
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,720
genomes, there are um you know

206
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,120
industries that look at plant genomes,

207
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,440
animal genomes but largely they're all

208
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,199
using the same sets of technologies to

209
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:11,440
do that.

210
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:13,599
And so the other term is variant. And so

211
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,840
in the past we might have turn used

212
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:17,919
terms like mutation but today we would

213
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,919
say a variant essentially any difference

214
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,000
that's in our genome between two

215
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,840
different individuals and part of the

216
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,919
reason to actually do the human genome

217
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,720
project was there was an understanding

218
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:31,759
that variance that differences in our in

219
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:34,640
our DNA in our genomes might be

220
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,719
underlying not just sort of our traits

221
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,279
you know how we appear but also might be

222
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,760
under underpinning some diseases but

223
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:44,080
until we actually sequence the genome.

224
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,320
There was no way to actually know which

225
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,000
variants in our genomes are totally

226
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,399
harmless and which are the ones that

227
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,040
actually could be the triggers for

228
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:57,200
disease. So that was the reason to start

229
00:08:53,040 --> 00:09:01,279
doing genome sequencing. Um

230
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:03,360
and the other important point is that

231
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,120
to understand variance across many

232
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,959
people of course you can't just do the

233
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,880
human genome once. You actually have to

234
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,320
do it many many times. You know, ideally

235
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,519
we would have everyone's genome sequence

236
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,360
and then we would know all of the

237
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,360
variation in the world and we would be

238
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,080
able to catalog what variants are

239
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,320
actually disease-causing or disease risk

240
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,920
um increasing and what ones are totally

241
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:26,320
harmless. And so

242
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,959
the other thing I guess to to think

243
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,839
about is unlike space travel which is

244
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:33,600
still pretty expensive um it is now

245
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,800
primarily you know the purview of

246
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,880
billionaires and minor celebrities um

247
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:42,800
sequencing human genomes has actually

248
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:45,680
continued to go down in cost. Um so from

249
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:48,640
that first human genome which again

250
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:51,839
overall cost about uh $3 billion dollars

251
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,680
to sequence to understand the code of

252
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:57,120
through technological advances over the

253
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,640
last 20 years we're now at the today if

254
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,560
you come to the Broad Institute as a

255
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,360
researcher you can get a human genome

256
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,680
sequenced for a few hundred dollars

257
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:09,200
and unlike that first human genome which

258
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:12,399
took 13 years to sequence today

259
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,440
routinely we can do it actually in days.

260
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,200
And I'm going to tell you something

261
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,320
special that can h that happened about a

262
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,519
month ago that might uh indicate that in

263
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,560
the future we'll be able to do this

264
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,640
routinely in hours.

265
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,399
So today at the human at the broad we

266
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:29,040
actually sequence thousands of human

267
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:31,600
genomes every week.

268
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,040
Um in fact uh in our group at the the

269
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,760
genomics group at the broad institute

270
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:38,000
we've now sequenced over 870,000

271
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,640
human genomes.

272
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,480
And if you think about the idea again of

273
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,360
sequencing the genome, there's also a

274
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,680
lot of information in the genome that we

275
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,279
don't yet know fully what to do with.

276
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,440
The genes that make up all of the

277
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:53,680
proteins that sort of make up our body

278
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,519
are actually encoded in about 2% of the

279
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,800
information of our genome. And if you

280
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,959
just sequence that portion of the

281
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,440
genome, it's known as exo sequencing,

282
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:03,200
the expressed part of the genome. And of

283
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,399
exosomes, we've done over a million of

284
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,880
those. So the technology and the drop in

285
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,959
cost has allowed us to now expand the

286
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,839
scope of how many genomes or portions of

287
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:17,040
genomes we can routinely sequence

288
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:19,600
and and why do that I guess right so I

289
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,360
hinted at you know um before that you

290
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,800
can't just sequence one human genome and

291
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,800
start to really unlock all of the

292
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,560
insights of biology that's that are

293
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,480
locked in there you actually have to

294
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,040
sequence lots of genomes and so the

295
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,880
genomes the over 870,000 genomes that

296
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,560
we've sequenced and hundreds of

297
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,880
thousands that have in sequence in other

298
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:40,160
parts of the world um have been feeding

299
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:42,399
into research programs funded by federal

300
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,640
government, by philanthropy, by disease

301
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:47,360
foundations, by pharmaceutical companies

302
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,600
and biotech to really push forward all

303
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,160
of the possible applications of human

304
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,320
genome sequencing. And these are some of

305
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,399
the application areas I want to sort of

306
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,320
describe to you in more detail tonight.

307
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,560
And these are the the areas that

308
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,160
actually where people are showing the

309
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,399
utility of genome sequencing across

310
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,880
their entire lifespan from birth all the

311
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:09,920
way through aging.

312
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:12,160
And so um I'm going to dig into a couple

313
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,920
of examples. By no means is this an

314
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,600
exhaustive catalog of all of the

315
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,360
activity that's happening, but I just

316
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:21,120
want to give you in in certain parts of

317
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:24,320
of this sort of lifespan uh space where

318
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:26,880
we're at and where we might be going. So

319
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,600
think about newborns. So babies just

320
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:32,800
born. Most states, I not all states in

321
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:35,279
the US have statemandated newborn

322
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,120
screening programs. So we test babies.

323
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,600
We do a little heel prick, get a little

324
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:43,440
bit of of blood and we test babies for

325
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,959
some small number of diseases that are

326
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,399
important to know about as soon as you

327
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,240
can possibly know about them because you

328
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,959
want to take an action that would avoid

329
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,360
that baby uh getting sick in in early

330
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,800
childhood. So these are known as newborn

331
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,440
screening programs and they're typically

332
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:00,160
managed by departments of public health.

333
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,079
So several studies now over the last few

334
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,959
years have been investigating rather

335
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:07,440
than this sort of small suite of 30-ish

336
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:10,399
bio largely biochemical types of tests

337
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,320
that we do on those newborn heel pricks.

338
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,800
Um should we be doing whole genome

339
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,399
sequencing? two notable studies. One is

340
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,920
the Guardian study run out of New York

341
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,760
City

342
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:23,440
where they sequenced many thousand

343
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:26,000
newborns and um initial results they

344
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:29,279
published a year or so ago showed that

345
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,839
by doing whole genome sequencing um in

346
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:34,079
you would find many many more conditions

347
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,320
that geneticists would agree you would

348
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,240
want to know about in a newborn than you

349
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,000
do by traditional screening methods. So

350
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,040
this idea of like establishing sort of

351
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,760
clinical uh clinical utility. another

352
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:48,000
study. And uh good news for us in the

353
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,480
Boston area, that program, that guardian

354
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,959
study was run by an investigator out of

355
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,760
Columbia University, Wendy Chung. Wendy

356
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:57,600
Chung is now the uh chief of pediatrics

357
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,199
at Boston Children's Hospital. So, she's

358
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,920
been bringing this concept to

359
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:04,720
Massachusetts as well. Another study

360
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,399
closer to home run by uh Dr. Robert

361
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,560
Green out of Harvard and Brigham and

362
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,920
Women's Hospital was called Baby Seek.

363
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,760
And the sequencing of these newborns

364
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,600
actually happened in our clinical lab

365
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,440
here at the Broad Institute. And that

366
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,160
found again in a smaller cohort of

367
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,399
several hundred uh newborn families that

368
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,959
they found disease risks in about 11% of

369
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:25,279
the babies where we sequenced them. And

370
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:28,240
that importantly in that study they were

371
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:30,160
also addressing sort of the the family

372
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,000
response to the information because one

373
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,000
of the fears of doing this type of

374
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,399
testing on a newborn certainly a healthy

375
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,800
newborn is like will it cause anxiety to

376
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,560
the family? if will knowing this

377
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,720
information cause families to be super

378
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,240
stressed out and they did surveys of

379
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,680
their families found that that wasn't

380
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,920
necessarily the case that typically

381
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,440
families were happy to participate and

382
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,760
the ones who found out actionable

383
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,440
information were very happy to have it

384
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,800
so that was great so these have sort of

385
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,639
set the set the stage going forward

386
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:01,360
there's actually a new program funded by

387
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:04,320
NIH um called the beacons program that

388
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,399
is going to understand try to understand

389
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,320
the feasibility of offering this type of

390
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:11,760
whole genome sequencing as a firstline

391
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:14,079
test in newborns on a multi-state level.

392
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:16,880
So the sort of technical components of

393
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:19,600
doing this and the initial you know

394
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,720
impact studies have been done. The real

395
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,639
challenge now is actually the

396
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,959
implementation science. It's like how do

397
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,560
we actually roll this out into states

398
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,560
where this is managed by departments of

399
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,880
public health who are not typically

400
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,040
managing high complexity molecular

401
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,880
testing programs and so this program

402
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,800
will actually seek to bring this out

403
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,560
into more states. So this will help us

404
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,320
in the future and if the results are

405
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,040
positive we might see a national program

406
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,199
at some point in the future.

407
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,199
Another case in the in the sort of the

408
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:49,040
newborn field is unfortunately some

409
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:51,360
small number of babies are born who

410
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,519
actually have a serious uh problem and

411
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:57,199
they end up in the neonatal ICU or the

412
00:15:53,519 --> 00:16:00,399
NICU and these are very sick babies can

413
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:02,800
be very sick babies and there again you

414
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,399
now you're you're not dealing with

415
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,759
screening for disease in a healthy

416
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,399
newborn. Now you're looking for can we

417
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,759
get to a diagnosis for a very sick baby

418
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,160
and obviously you want to do that as

419
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:14,240
quickly as you can and so a study again

420
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:17,279
a landmark study out this time run out

421
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:20,240
of raises children hospital in San Diego

422
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:23,199
um run by Dr. Dr. Steven Kingsmore over

423
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:25,199
there again looked at the feasibility of

424
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:27,600
running whole genome sequencing in this

425
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:29,279
niku cohort and understanding what is

426
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,560
the benefit and actually we found that

427
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:34,079
there he found that there was a a huge

428
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:37,440
benefit and that the information you

429
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:39,680
gain actually can decrease the length of

430
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,839
time it takes to get to a diagnosis.

431
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,680
Importantly, they also looked at what

432
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:46,160
would be the health care economics of

433
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,240
doing this and and saw that you might

434
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:51,120
actually reduce the cost, the healthcare

435
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,519
cost by doing this testing upfront.

436
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,240
Those savings are driven by fewer

437
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:58,160
hospital stays or days in the NICU

438
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,079
because if you get to an answer sooner,

439
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,320
you can get out of the NICU sooner. Uh,

440
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:04,720
and those are very expensive stays.

441
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,240
Fewer major surgeries. you can avoid a

442
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,280
major surgery if you can get to a

443
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:12,559
definitive diagnosis sooner and not do

444
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:14,319
unnecessary procedures. So all of that

445
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,559
together indicates that it might be

446
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:20,160
really valuable to do whole genome

447
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:23,520
sequencing in the NICU setting. Based on

448
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,600
this and other studies like it, um, now

449
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,679
clinical commercial laboratories have

450
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,600
started offering what they call rapid

451
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,880
whole genome sequencing programs,

452
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,000
clinical whole genome sequencing

453
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:36,799
programs that are can be used by ICUs

454
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,559
and NICUs around the country. Um, with

455
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:40,640
current technologies, they're still

456
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,640
taking, you know, between two and five

457
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,880
days to actually get you that answer

458
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,840
back, though, which is really fast.

459
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:50,880
Again, two and five days, really fast.

460
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:53,120
But in the NICU, every hour matters. And

461
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,720
so we were fortunate a few months ago to

462
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,280
actually engage in a study to assess

463
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,760
could we do it even faster.

464
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,520
So this was a collaboration between us,

465
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:04,240
RO, which is a large pharmaceutical

466
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,000
company, but also has a a diagnostics

467
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,880
arm, RO Diagnostics, which is a very

468
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,200
large uh entity in its own right. And

469
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,080
within that arm has a small group that's

470
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,640
been developing a novel DNA sequencing

471
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:19,120
technology. So we worked with them using

472
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,600
this novel technology and our friends at

473
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:25,200
the NICU and Boston Children's Hospital

474
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:27,200
to run a small study where we showed and

475
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,679
the plot sort of shows a sort of you

476
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:34,960
know think about this is sort of the um

477
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:36,640
a clock of a day um where we were

478
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,559
uh so Monica Wujek who is the

479
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,000
neonatlogist at Boston Children's

480
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:41,520
enrolled families into this as a

481
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,840
research study. So it's not a clinical

482
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:46,080
diagnostic test. It's a research study.

483
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,840
Their baby samples were already being

484
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,880
sent for standard of care clinical

485
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,720
testing. But as a research arm, we got

486
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,679
additional blood from the NICU babies,

487
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,760
the sick sick babies, had that collected

488
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,600
at uh by a courier at Boston Children's

489
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,039
Hospital. We rushed it out to our

490
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,840
clinical lab, which is actually located

491
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:05,600
in in Burlington. Um

492
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,760
and so and then we started working on

493
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,640
that blood sample using this new

494
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:13,039
technology. We, you know, by about noon

495
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,039
on that day, we had from the blood

496
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:16,480
sample extracted genomic material, run

497
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:18,880
it through this novel sequencing

498
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,799
technology and gotten to sort of the

499
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,559
data files, the the the the

500
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:25,039
computational files that contain the

501
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:26,559
variants within that baby's genome. And

502
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:29,039
then we started what's called tertiary

503
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,880
analysis. That's where trained clinical

504
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:33,200
geneticists look at all of those

505
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,600
variants in special software that allows

506
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:38,160
them to sort between those variants that

507
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:40,320
we know are most likely harmless and

508
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,080
those variants that have been associated

509
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,840
with disease. And they have the

510
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,760
phenotype that is what are the symptoms

511
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,679
that the baby is exhibiting and by

512
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,160
looking at the symptoms and the variance

513
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,520
in in the genome they can sort of say is

514
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,160
there something here that actually might

515
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:56,480
be causing this uh these symptoms in

516
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,480
this baby. So in two of the seven cases,

517
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,320
we actually located what we think is

518
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:03,280
likely the pathogenic variant, the

519
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,880
variant that was causing um those babies

520
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,720
um

521
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,880
symptoms.

522
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,080
And importantly, if you look at the

523
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,919
clock, what happened was we were

524
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,600
collecting blood at 6:30 in the morning

525
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,960
and in the earliest cases getting the

526
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:19,440
neonatlogist the answer by around 2 p.m.

527
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,760
that same day. It had never been done

528
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,960
before. And so we published this in New

529
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:26,640
England Journal of Medicine about a

530
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:28,320
month ago. um as a feasibility to say it

531
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,480
might be now possible in the future.

532
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,000
Once this technology is commercially

533
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,080
available, it's still not commercially

534
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,080
available, but once it is, as soon as

535
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,080
next year, we may be able to now

536
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,480
routinely deliver whole genome

537
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:42,720
sequencing the same day. And that would

538
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,880
really radically change the thinking of

539
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:48,159
neontologists in how they create a care

540
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,760
plan for for the sake of babies. And

541
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,520
just for fun along the way, we actually

542
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,120
picked up a Guinness World Record for

543
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:57,799
the fastest human genomes ever

544
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,799
sequenced. So if you remember

545
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:04,159
uh if you remember, you know, we've come

546
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:06,720
a long way from 13 years in in some of

547
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:09,760
the in in this study, we sequenced the

548
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:12,080
genome in less than four hours. So from

549
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,919
um that DNA to those variants in less

550
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,520
than four hours. So the technological

551
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:19,120
advancements have been you know

552
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:22,559
mind-blowing over the last uh decades.

553
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:24,640
All right. So

554
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:26,159
other the next place in our lifespan

555
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,320
where diseases can show up is in

556
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:32,159
childhood. And a lot of childhood

557
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:33,760
diseases are rare diseases. And so um we

558
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,600
call them rare diseases because each

559
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:38,080
sort of disease that shows up doesn't

560
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,080
show up in a lot of children. But in

561
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:43,120
aggregate there are a lot of rare

562
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:45,520
diseases. In fact, there are over 8,000

563
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,679
rare genetic diseases now described. So

564
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:51,360
the burden on the population is actually

565
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:53,280
quite large and fewer than 500 of those

566
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,760
rare genetic diseases have any treatment

567
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:58,080
available. So understanding the causes

568
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:00,640
of rare diseases is very important and

569
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:03,039
again rare diseases are often have

570
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,440
genetic causes and so we've been looking

571
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:07,039
at again with collaborators at Boston

572
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,520
Children's and there's many programs at

573
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:11,440
the broad that look at rare disease um

574
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:15,120
you know how can we bring these new

575
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:17,440
technologies to look at um the

576
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,520
underlying genetic causes of disease.

577
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,360
Sometimes the sort of standard genome

578
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:24,240
testing we do is not enough and we need

579
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,440
to go to additional data types,

580
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,240
different types of doing genome

581
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:32,400
sequencing to find that sort of missing

582
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:33,760
um um cause. Um

583
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,360
because what you're really trying to do

584
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:39,280
in the rare disease case is decrease

585
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,880
what's known as the uh diagnostic

586
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,720
odyssey, which is that families who have

587
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,039
a child with rare disease often go

588
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,799
through years of of like incremental

589
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:48,559
testing, testing one gene, testing the

590
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:50,080
next gene, and and it could take years

591
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:52,320
to get to an actual definitive

592
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,799
diagnosis. If you can do that sooner,

593
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,480
again, you have great b you know, many

594
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,480
benefits for the family. Just having an

595
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,240
answer is really important. It helps

596
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,000
them with planning. is it likely to

597
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,600
happen in subsequent children? It helps

598
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,520
them find support groups and other

599
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,679
people who may have the same diseases

600
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,120
and then also you know start to figure

601
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,480
out are there clinical trials we can

602
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,080
enroll in. So it's really important to

603
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,080
get to that diagnosis as soon as

604
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:17,039
possible and that's been a lot of focus

605
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:19,440
of um next of whole genome sequencing

606
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:21,120
methods. Other programs that we've been

607
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,960
running with uh disease foundations

608
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,360
include the the Simons Foundation which

609
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:28,480
runs a large autism research program.

610
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:31,440
There are actually um over 300,000 now

611
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,840
participants both um participants with

612
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,440
autism and their families and we've been

613
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,039
doing whole genome sequencing on many of

614
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,679
those individuals to again understand

615
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:41,600
some of the underlying genetic causes of

616
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,440
autism.

617
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:46,080
A future-looking program that started at

618
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:48,400
the Broad Institute um under Anna Grea,

619
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,799
a researcher at the institute um is

620
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,799
called Ladders to Cures. And this is a

621
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:54,480
really tantalizing prospect that that

622
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:57,200
Anna has described in detail in other

623
00:23:54,480 --> 00:24:01,360
talks. Um, but where if you think about

624
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,960
these 8,000 uh rare genetic diseases,

625
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,120
it's entirely possible under sort of

626
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:08,000
growing evidence that you might not be

627
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,840
actually working with 8,000 completely

628
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,760
different diseases that have just sprung

629
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,520
up independently, but that if you look

630
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,279
deep enough that they actually might

631
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,520
sort of whittle down into smaller

632
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:20,080
numbers of sort of systemic kind of

633
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:23,039
network effects where you know something

634
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:25,360
that's happening in a node in sort of a

635
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:27,600
you know underlying system in the body

636
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,440
is manifesting in lots of different ways

637
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,880
and getting diagnosed as different and

638
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,960
showing up as what we call different

639
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,760
diseases. But actually the fundamental

640
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,919
molecular thing this pathway is actually

641
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,840
common across many of those diseases. So

642
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:42,559
if you can under you know if you can

643
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:45,679
discover and describe those pathways

644
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:47,520
those nodes um you might be able to come

645
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:49,600
up with more effective therapies for

646
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:52,240
more diseases at once rather than trying

647
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:54,400
to tackle all of them individually. And

648
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,400
this uses other aspects of technology

649
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,400
that we have really looking at the

650
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,799
single cell level. Looking at individual

651
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:03,440
cells and many many cells and

652
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:05,919
engineering them to display some of the

653
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,320
the uh variants that are showing up in

654
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:10,320
these diseases and seeing what happens

655
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,080
seeing what happens across different

656
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,240
variants. Did the cells start to do the

657
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:17,760
same thing different things? So this is

658
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:20,960
really um an exciting new way to get to

659
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,799
uh address rare disease uh research.

660
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,720
Of course, chronic diseases and common

661
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:27,679
diseases are the largest cause of sort

662
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,520
of mortality and morbidity um in the

663
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:31,760
world and there are many programs as

664
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:34,320
well of course that address um address

665
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:37,039
these diseases. Um there are programs

666
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:40,960
funded by the NIH which address lots of

667
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:43,120
um um common diseases using both genome

668
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,039
sequencing or genomics as well as many

669
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,960
other omics. When we talk about

670
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:49,440
genomics, there's also really looking at

671
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:54,559
the protein level, proteomics, looking

672
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:55,919
at um the sort of chemical um signatures

673
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:58,799
that are on top of our genome or

674
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:00,480
epigenomics. Um there's metabolomics,

675
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:02,640
there's transcripttoics, there's lots of

676
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:06,000
omix. And so we're, you know, we're

677
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,840
increasingly understanding that for um

678
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,480
cohorts of people with disease, it's

679
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:12,640
really more powerful to generate as much

680
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,480
omic data as we can because that gives

681
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:17,200
you a much fuller picture of what's

682
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,600
happening again at the molecular level.

683
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,679
Another really important um area in in

684
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,559
common disease research at the broad is

685
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,279
coming through a philan

686
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:26,559
philanthropically um founded center at

687
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:28,720
the broad, the Stanley Center for

688
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:30,480
Psychiatric Diseases. That group has

689
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,200
been doing large-scale population

690
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:36,320
sequencing um across the world of

691
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:38,159
different populations that have um

692
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,000
psychiatric diseases, schizophrenia,

693
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:42,000
bipolar disorder, major depressive

694
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
disorders. And they've actually through

695
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,360
this large-scale genomic data generation

696
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:50,159
activity started to uncover biomarkers

697
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:54,480
or those little signals in the genome

698
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:57,679
that um strongly can be linked to these

699
00:26:54,480 --> 00:27:00,000
um devastating mental um health issues.

700
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:02,080
And in some cases, these are the first

701
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,799
sort of genetic targets that we've

702
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,480
identified in decades in these diseases.

703
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:08,559
And so this gives the idea that there's

704
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:11,840
hope to start to to generate better,

705
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:14,559
more targeted therapies um for major

706
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:18,000
psychiatric diseases. Again, looking

707
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:20,640
forward, one of the newest centers um

708
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,640
created at the Broad is the biology of

709
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:26,320
adversity project. This is a really

710
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:29,039
interesting area um driven by Jason Bwin

711
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:32,000
restro the broad institute which is to

712
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:35,520
understand how adversity can actually

713
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,039
lead to chronic health problems. And so

714
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,799
you know we've all been taught that the

715
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:40,559
DNA is your blueprint. It's in every

716
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:42,320
cell of your body and it's sort of we we

717
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:44,240
kind of imagine it's sort of fixed. Once

718
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,400
you've got your DNA you've got your DNA.

719
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,799
But actually, it turns out that things

720
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:51,600
that happen to you in your life can

721
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:53,440
actually leave a mark on your DNA. And

722
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,760
this is part of that epigenomics, the

723
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,760
idea of molecular scars or little

724
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:00,480
signals, little chemical modifications

725
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:02,399
that can get imprinted on your DNA and

726
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,640
propagate through your life. And we're

727
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:09,039
increasingly understanding that these

728
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:10,640
molecular scars if you're uh can lead to

729
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:14,000
later life development of chronic

730
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:16,000
diseases, heart disease, diabetes, major

731
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,159
depressive disorders, you know,

732
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,840
post-traumatic stress syndrome. And so

733
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:23,039
Jason's group and the biology adver

734
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,399
adversity project is seeking to really

735
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,679
do what the Stanley Center has been

736
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:27,520
doing in the psychiatric disease

737
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:30,720
research area with looking at these

738
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:32,240
molecular scars in cohorts who have had

739
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,480
adversity. So these are childhood

740
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,720
traumas understanding cohorts of people

741
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,799
who have had some some traumatic event

742
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:41,120
and seeing are there can we find these

743
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:42,720
markers and are they actually things

744
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:45,200
leading to chronic disease. So this is a

745
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,720
re very fascinating area that could be

746
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,880
really powerful to understand a lot of

747
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:52,000
chronic disease.

748
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:54,559
All right. Um cancer of course is one of

749
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,559
the sort of prime examples of where

750
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:59,200
we've seen a major benefit of being able

751
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:02,559
to do molecular genomic profiling.

752
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:05,120
Increasingly today patients um diagnosed

753
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:08,000
with cancers will have their tumors

754
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:10,080
genomically characterized. And so when

755
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,799
we think about your genome, the the

756
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:15,279
genome of your of your body, sort of the

757
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:17,679
quote unquote normal healthy genome, in

758
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:20,799
cancer, for the most part, that genome

759
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:23,200
has somehow become, you know, mutated,

760
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:26,080
transformed in some way that has led to

761
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:28,880
this uncontrolled proliferation and that

762
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,960
shows up as tumors. And so there are

763
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,919
many programs um at the bro and

764
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,360
elsewhere to really catalog the variants

765
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:38,159
that are associated with different

766
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,919
cancer types. And these are so and what

767
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:41,840
one way you can do that is to take a

768
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:44,240
blood sample and a tumor sample from an

769
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:46,000
individual with cancer and sequence the

770
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,760
genomes or portions of those genomes

771
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,440
from both of those. And what you'll find

772
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,520
is that in the sort of the quoteunquote

773
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,760
healthy non-tumor cells you'll have the

774
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,919
person's underlying genome but in their

775
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,919
tumor cells you'll find this abnormal

776
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:01,200
genome. And by cataloging all of the

777
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:03,919
ways that it has become abnormal you can

778
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,760
uncover these uh molecular pathways that

779
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:08,399
are leading to cancer. And this is the

780
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:10,000
underpinning of most targeted molecular

781
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:12,000
therapies now, precision medicine

782
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,840
therapies for cancers that have been so

783
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,360
transformative in changing the sort of

784
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:19,200
the prognosis for most cancers. And so

785
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,200
there are programs across the road

786
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,600
cataloging these variants in in

787
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:26,159
different tumor types. Also again using

788
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:29,200
this idea of single cell technology to

789
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:31,440
create sort of tumors or uh in engineer

790
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:34,240
in modifications that represent a

791
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:36,720
cancer-like mutation and then be able to

792
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,320
quickly screen what do different small

793
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,399
molecules what do different medicines

794
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,320
what do different drugs do to those

795
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:44,799
cells. Can we find even you know even

796
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:47,279
better targeted therapies and then also

797
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:49,679
the idea of overcoming resistance. Some

798
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:51,760
sometimes people get a a therapy for

799
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:53,279
their cancer, cancer goes away, but they

800
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,720
develop a resistance and the cancer

801
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:57,120
comes back. So understanding those

802
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,559
programs of resistance is also really

803
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,320
important.

804
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:01,360
another center at the bro the Gersonner

805
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:04,399
center that that I've had some

806
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:06,559
involvement with um is is doing similar

807
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:09,039
things but actually in the the sort of

808
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:10,720
the burgeoning field that's come in the

809
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:13,679
last couple of years of understanding

810
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:16,480
that actually a tumor in your body

811
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:19,440
because of the nature of cancer tumor

812
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:21,840
cells are often dying and when they die

813
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,679
they release their genetic material that

814
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,880
essentially gets drained into your blood

815
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:27,279
system which is how your body

816
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:29,279
essentially you know cleans out and so

817
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:30,799
that by looking at blood samples, just

818
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:32,880
taking a blood sample, you might be able

819
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:35,279
to find what's known as circulating

820
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,880
tumor DNA, that's little pieces of DNA

821
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:39,120
from the tumor that are actually

822
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,880
circulating in the blood. And so this

823
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:43,760
field of what's known as sort of liquid

824
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,840
biopsy. So a traditional tumor biopsy

825
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,679
would be to there's a tumor, let's take

826
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:51,200
a piece of that tumor out, that tissue,

827
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:53,840
and look at it. Um

828
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,840
the field of liquid biopsy is actually

829
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:59,279
taking a biopsy not from the tumor but

830
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:01,360
from the blood or other liquids. Um and

831
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:02,799
this is particularly important where you

832
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:05,200
know you've had a patient who's had

833
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:06,720
cancer their tumor has been removed.

834
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,360
You've taken away the cancer. So now

835
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,559
there is no tumor to biopsy anymore. Um

836
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:13,679
but what you really want to understand

837
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:15,679
is like did we get all of it or is there

838
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:18,159
still is there another tumor that we

839
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:19,679
haven't seen yet? Is there metastasis?

840
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:20,960
These are really important things

841
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:23,440
because these are the things that

842
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:25,840
actually lead to a lot of mortality in

843
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:28,559
in cancer patients. And so being able to

844
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:30,799
detect can we find any signals of

845
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:33,039
lingering cancer. This is a field known

846
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:36,799
as minimal residual disease. Is there

847
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:39,919
any small signals of that of tumors um

848
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:42,640
circulating in the body? And so now um

849
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:46,000
by taking blood samples at some period

850
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:48,320
after the person has had surgery or or

851
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,399
treatment with curative intent um

852
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:53,200
there's a whole field of can we detect

853
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:55,039
any cancer and if you don't that's great

854
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,799
these methods are getting now more and

855
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:58,240
more sensitive you know thanks to the

856
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:00,640
work of folks at the Gersonner center

857
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:03,360
and elsewhere to see the earliest

858
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:05,039
possible time if you do detect it again

859
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:07,840
that's the time to take an action

860
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:09,600
because detecting it and having it see

861
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,880
that it's actually coming back is the

862
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,480
first signal that something is going to

863
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,960
come back. And so the earlier you can

864
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:18,320
you can have that min minimal residual

865
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:20,159
disease detected the more powerful um

866
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:22,080
intervention will be. So that's a that's

867
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:24,880
a huge area now in the field of cancer

868
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:26,960
research. Looking forward again just in

869
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,640
the last few months um locally again

870
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,080
we've we've been able to bring together

871
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,640
the best of our cancer research

872
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:35,279
community and our local um hospital

873
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,360
community with one initiative called

874
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:39,360
Brightsee which is a again a

875
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:41,360
collaboration between Dana Farber Cancer

876
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:44,159
Institute Boston Children's Hospital and

877
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:48,720
the Broad Clinical Labs here to develop

878
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:51,760
a suite of um pediatric cancer assays.

879
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:54,720
So there are many now both companies and

880
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:56,240
and labs that do adult cancer testing

881
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,720
because that is the vast majority of

882
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:01,279
cancers that show up in the world. The

883
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:03,760
pediatric cancer is thankfully quite

884
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:05,200
rare. Um but what that means is from a

885
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,840
commercial perspective for these

886
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:09,440
companies, it's not actually a super

887
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,359
viable business. And so you have less

888
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:14,480
development of assays really

889
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:16,960
specifically developed to detect or

890
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,879
monitor pediatric cancers. And so we've

891
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,520
been as part of this collaboration we

892
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:24,639
will be developing u both solid tumor

893
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:27,359
and liquid biopsy based assays uh for

894
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:29,520
pediatric cancer uh diagnosis and

895
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:33,919
research.

896
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:35,919
All right moving on. So a bio bank has

897
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:38,800
anyone has anyone know has anyone been

898
00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:40,720
asked to be a participant in a bio bank

899
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,079
as far as you know so if you've got the

900
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:44,240
mass general you might have at some

901
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:45,599
point been asked might have seen

902
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:49,679
>> is that like all of us

903
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:52,159
>> yes exactly right so a biioank is

904
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:55,919
essentially a program that you know

905
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:57,520
creates a secure consented repository of

906
00:34:55,919 --> 00:35:00,160
biopecimens

907
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:02,079
and people's information right and so

908
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,760
the way to really drive forward many of

909
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:05,599
the things that we've just talked about,

910
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,200
right? Understanding that catalog of

911
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:08,960
human variation, what ones cause

912
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,440
disease, what ones don't cause disease.

913
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,680
Um, is to actually have information from

914
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,560
lots and lots of people.

915
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:20,160
You know, you know what we're realizing,

916
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:21,680
of course, is that again, fundamentally

917
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,960
at a very simplistic level, when you

918
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,440
sequence a genome, you're trying to

919
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,960
understand the variants that you find in

920
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:29,200
that genome. And there's millions of

921
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,320
them in all of our genomes. a variant,

922
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,720
something that's different than somebody

923
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,000
else's genome, there's millions of them.

924
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:36,960
So, if you're just looking at a computer

925
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,200
file with a million or three million

926
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,440
variants in it, and you're trying to

927
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:43,359
decide which one of these three million

928
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,680
things might be causing this person's

929
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:48,400
disease, that's really hard, right? So

930
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:50,720
you need to have knowledge bases,

931
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,320
computer systems, software that can sort

932
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,240
through all of that and annotate it and

933
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,800
say in all of the people we've ever

934
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:59,599
seen, this variant, this difference in a

935
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,520
piece of DNA has never been known to

936
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:03,359
cause a disease. That would be ideal if

937
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,560
we could do that for all three million.

938
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:06,720
But of course to do that, we actually

939
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:09,200
need to see all of the variants that

940
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:11,359
exist in the human population. It turns

941
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,760
out bio banks are a great way to start

942
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:15,599
cataloging that. Um because bio banks

943
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,680
try to enroll people some people who

944
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:19,920
have disease but ideally just regular

945
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:22,480
people who you know we all we've all got

946
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,480
something going on but nominally healthy

947
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,480
people right if we can all contribute

948
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,720
our information both our genetic

949
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:31,280
information you know surveys about our

950
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:33,359
health our medical records you know

951
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:36,400
information about us that goes into a

952
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:38,720
large biioank like knowledge base we can

953
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:42,000
really start to understand you know the

954
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:43,520
impact of that variation um you know a a

955
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,359
bio bio bank that got started early and

956
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,680
has been very successful is the UK biio

957
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:49,440
bank. The NHS and the UK government have

958
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,839
been very forwardlooking in investing in

959
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,400
in in biioanks and genomics. And so

960
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:56,880
they've got a really mature bioank with,

961
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,560
you know, over 500,000 individuals with

962
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,240
this sort of linked information about

963
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,240
health records and activity and

964
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,760
everything else. And so that's been very

965
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:06,480
powerful to understand some of the

966
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:08,400
variation in humans.

967
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,560
But what we're realizing of course is

968
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:13,040
that variance in our genome don't just

969
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:15,440
account for sort of our hair color and

970
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:17,839
our eye color and our you know whether

971
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:20,560
or not we have asparagus pee. Um they

972
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:23,200
also account for like they actually also

973
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:25,040
come from our genetic ancestry. So

974
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,280
different human populations will have

975
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,640
different variants and so some of those

976
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,520
differences between us come from our

977
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:33,440
genetic ancestry. Um and it turns out

978
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:36,960
that if you look at a variant in one

979
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:39,119
population and say oh in this population

980
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,800
we see this variant and then that person

981
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:42,880
also has this disease. So maybe that

982
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,480
variant causes that disease. But if you

983
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,800
look at enough people maybe you find in

984
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:49,359
a totally different human population

985
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,800
that variant exists and is quite common

986
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:52,560
and none of those people have that

987
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,560
disease. Well now you've realized

988
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:56,079
actually that variant can't be the one

989
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,079
causing the disease. So you actually

990
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:00,960
need to catalog people from all types of

991
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:02,640
genetic ancestries to really understand

992
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,440
um what variants are important to look

993
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:07,119
at. And so if you look in UK biioank,

994
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,400
you know, and you look at a variant and

995
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:10,720
you want to predict something about my

996
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,560
genome, that would be fairly accurate.

997
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:16,720
Now, I'm from Ireland. Ireland is not

998
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:18,079
part of the UK, but um but genetically,

999
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,880
we might not want to admit it, but we're

1000
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:22,880
sort of similar. Um, so it's going to be

1001
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:25,599
accurate for me because most of the UK

1002
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:27,680
bio bank is from northern European white

1003
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:29,680
individuals who live in sort of that UK

1004
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,880
area. Um, but it's not going to be as

1005
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,480
accurate for somebody who comes from

1006
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,079
Africa or somebody who comes from Asia,

1007
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,880
you know. So we actually have to start

1008
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:38,880
creating bioanks that reflect everybody.

1009
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:41,440
And so all of us is one of those

1010
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:44,560
programs that in the US is trying to

1011
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:46,560
catalog um at least a million US

1012
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:49,040
residents and capture sort of the

1013
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:51,680
genetic diversity and socioeconomic

1014
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:53,760
diversity of this country because unlike

1015
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:55,119
many countries in the world, US

1016
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,040
traditionally has been this sort of what

1017
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:58,560
we call like the boiling pot. You have

1018
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,160
immigrants like me who come over from

1019
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,760
Europe and you've got other people who

1020
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,200
come from all over the world and then

1021
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,800
they meet somebody and they have

1022
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,160
children and so it turns out your

1023
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,480
grandfather's from Ireland and your

1024
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:12,560
grandmother's from the West Indies. And

1025
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:14,000
so your genetic ancestry now is actually

1026
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,160
the combination of two different

1027
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,079
entirely different human populations

1028
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,760
genetic ancestries. And so from a

1029
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:21,599
geneticist perspective, we would say

1030
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,359
you're admixed, right? Your your

1031
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:26,000
genetics are mixed across different

1032
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:27,599
genetic ancestries. And so we need to

1033
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,680
capture a lot. We need to capture all of

1034
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:31,119
that. So it's not just useful to cap to

1035
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,480
sequence a bunch of people from Europe

1036
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,920
and a bunch of people from Africa and a

1037
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:36,000
bunch of people from Asia. We also have

1038
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:38,079
to sequence just all the people who've

1039
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,160
all kind of you know um had offspring

1040
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:41,839
together. So you really need to capture

1041
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:43,599
it's a it's a numbers game. You need to

1042
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:46,160
capture as many people as you possibly

1043
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:48,160
can to build up the knowledge base in a

1044
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,760
bio bank and then you need to associate

1045
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,680
that with a lot of interesting

1046
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,079
information about their health and their

1047
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:55,920
activities and and all of that to really

1048
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:58,720
build up this picture of what's going

1049
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:00,720
on. And so that was the program, the all

1050
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,560
of us program. It's enrolled over

1051
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:04,400
800,000 people. It was started many

1052
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:06,079
years ago with a goal of enrolling a

1053
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:08,800
million and sequencing all of their

1054
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:11,280
genomes. Um it's enrolled about 800,000.

1055
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:13,359
we have sequenced over 500,000 of those

1056
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:16,079
participants genomes. Many of them were

1057
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:17,440
done here at the Broad Institute. Um the

1058
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:19,920
program has run into some federal

1059
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:21,760
funding issues and so the future of that

1060
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:26,079
program is uncertain. Um and I think

1061
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:28,400
that would be um a tragedy. um more

1062
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:30,640
locally actually if you if you you know

1063
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,720
attend a hospital around here in the

1064
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:34,320
Mass General Bighgam network Mass

1065
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,960
General Brighgam has a pretty actually

1066
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:39,040
active and pretty good um bioank program

1067
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,960
as well and that's enrolled over 160,000

1068
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:43,040
people from the Mass General Bighgam

1069
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,640
hospital network and that's also a

1070
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:47,680
really powerful data set to start to

1071
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:50,480
look at again um associations between

1072
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:52,000
your health and your genome. So, as well

1073
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,920
as being a principal investigator on the

1074
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,920
all of us program because we generate a

1075
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,839
lot of the data, I I believe in this

1076
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,760
stuff. I'm a participant in the program.

1077
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:02,079
My genome was sequenced as part of this

1078
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:04,319
program. Uh my wife's genome was also

1079
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:06,079
sequenced as part of this program. Um

1080
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:08,480
early in the program when it had more

1081
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:10,400
money, it was also returning some health

1082
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,160
related information to participants. And

1083
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,800
so, you would get some information back

1084
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:16,079
about your health risks. You know, there

1085
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,000
are some things that we can tell that

1086
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:19,520
are important to know. My wife actually

1087
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,160
found out that she has what's known as

1088
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:23,760
Lynch syndrome from the participating in

1089
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,200
the all of us program and that means

1090
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,520
that she's at an increased risk

1091
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:29,440
potentially of colorectal or ovarian

1092
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:31,839
cancer and so now she's brought that

1093
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:33,440
information to her PCP and now she gets

1094
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:35,839
more frequent screening for those

1095
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,680
particular conditions. So that idea of

1096
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:39,520
like just learning something about your

1097
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:43,520
genome that you didn't know can

1098
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:45,119
completely change your your healthcare.

1099
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,800
So

1100
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:48,240
to kind of recap from a bioank

1101
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,400
perspective, what can you do? You can do

1102
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:52,079
lots of things with it. A rich bioank

1103
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,640
that has lots of sort of genomic and

1104
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:57,359
other omics and um associated health

1105
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:59,920
information can help us catalog this

1106
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:01,839
human variation. It can help us now

1107
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:04,079
because if you if you actually enroll

1108
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:05,839
hundreds of thousands of people, you're

1109
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:07,920
going to have lots and lots of people

1110
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:09,520
with any one disease. Certainly common

1111
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,720
diseases are going to be common. So

1112
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,640
you're going to have lots of people with

1113
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:15,920
cardiovascular disease, lots of people

1114
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:17,839
with cancer. And so you can then look in

1115
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,280
this program and say, well, what's the

1116
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:21,440
same about all of those people with that

1117
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,960
disease that's not in the people who

1118
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:25,280
don't have that disease and start to do

1119
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:27,520
those genetic associations.

1120
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:29,440
The other tantalizing thing that I think

1121
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:31,280
you know looking forward is that by

1122
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:33,119
having all of this data, we can start to

1123
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:35,520
get really fancy with the sort of the

1124
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:37,760
math, right? And we can start to create

1125
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,599
what's known as risk models, right? And

1126
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,960
so this is the last sort of um area that

1127
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:44,480
I'll cover which is preventative

1128
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:45,920
medicine. the idea that, you know,

1129
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,280
treating disease, we've gotten really

1130
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,680
good at treating disease and we've got

1131
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:52,079
world-class hospitals here in Boston,

1132
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:53,680
but it's a lot better to avoid getting

1133
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:56,480
the disease in the first place if you

1134
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:59,200
can. And that's actually fundamentally

1135
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:02,160
longer term going to be better for the

1136
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:04,720
whole health care system if we can avoid

1137
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:07,200
uh treating the the the symptom but

1138
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:09,280
actually, you know, avoid getting the

1139
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:11,280
underlying disease at the beginning. and

1140
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:14,240
and a Milicanin Institute analysis

1141
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:16,720
estimated that if we could just prevent

1142
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:19,200
or better ma better manage just seven

1143
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:21,920
common diseases cancer diabetes

1144
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:23,920
hypertension stroke uh pulmonary

1145
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:26,000
conditions and mental illness we could

1146
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:28,640
reduce the US treatment costs by about

1147
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,160
$200 billion per year and we'd save

1148
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:32,800
about a trillion dollars per year in

1149
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:34,800
loss productivity so prevention is

1150
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,640
clearly better than cure but of course

1151
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:39,040
it's difficult and and there's lots of

1152
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:40,720
things that go into preventing disease

1153
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:42,079
And it's hard to measure because you're

1154
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:44,720
looking for the absence of something if

1155
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:46,000
you've prevented a disease. But this is

1156
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:48,000
something that I really feel passionate

1157
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,839
about and I think has driven me and my

1158
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,160
own sort of journey into into this kind

1159
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:55,520
of science. When I was 16, my father had

1160
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:57,200
a heart attack. He was 46 at the time. I

1161
00:43:55,520 --> 00:44:00,640
was 16. So I thought, "Wow, he's really

1162
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:02,800
old, you know." Then I turned 46 three

1163
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:04,640
years ago and and I had three children

1164
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,880
under 12 and I went, "I don't want to

1165
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:09,359
have a heart attack. I I'm really young

1166
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:11,760
still." um if other survived and he's

1167
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:13,359
actually alive and kicking um has had

1168
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:16,079
several stances and bypass surgeries

1169
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:17,599
since then right so so clearly I was

1170
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:20,160
really focused on the idea of like what

1171
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:21,760
is my risk of cardiovascular disease I'm

1172
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,520
really cognizant of that because I've

1173
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:26,800
got this family history so I'm like I

1174
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:28,160
really want to know about that um and so

1175
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,880
when you think about this idea of like

1176
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:33,760
well what goes into this mental model of

1177
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:37,200
like what is my risk of developing this

1178
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:39,040
disease of having a heart attack um And

1179
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:41,359
so there's lots of things we've touched

1180
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:43,920
on this. One is your genetics, your

1181
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:45,359
family history, any other underlying

1182
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:49,359
sort of medical conditions you might

1183
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:51,680
have. Um there's these ideas. So the

1184
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:54,240
terms up here, polygenic and monogenic.

1185
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:56,560
Without getting into too much detail,

1186
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:58,400
mono as the as the name implies is

1187
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:00,400
essentially there are some variants in

1188
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:02,400
some genes that are well known to be

1189
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:04,720
associated with disease. So we all might

1190
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:06,800
have heard about this idea of the the BA

1191
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:11,200
one bracka 2 mutations in breast cancer

1192
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:12,880
right this Angelina Jolie mutation um so

1193
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:14,640
uh that's well known that's known as a

1194
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:17,760
monogenic risk if you have that one

1195
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:19,359
single variant in that gene we know

1196
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:21,200
that's really strongly associated with

1197
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:23,760
developing that condition and there's

1198
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:25,920
monogenic risks for lots of diseases

1199
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:28,480
polygenic risk really means this idea

1200
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:30,480
that idea that there are not these sort

1201
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:32,400
of you know single sort of smoking gun

1202
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,839
this one variant is really bad. But

1203
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,160
actually distributed throughout our

1204
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:38,000
entire genome, there are small, you

1205
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:40,560
know, there are variants that have small

1206
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,480
or varying degrees of of effect on our

1207
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:44,160
health and that any one of them wouldn't

1208
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:46,240
really cause a disease. But in

1209
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:48,400
aggregate, if you had all of the wrong

1210
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:49,760
kinds of those variants together, you

1211
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,760
might actually be increasing your risk

1212
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:53,440
of a disease. That's known as polygenic

1213
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:56,160
risk because it's in lots of genes.

1214
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:58,160
Okay? So the idea of to get a big a full

1215
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:00,560
picture of our risk of disease, you need

1216
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:02,800
to understand monogenic and polyenic and

1217
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:04,240
your family history and also social

1218
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,359
determinance. You know, what is your

1219
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,200
access to health? What is your

1220
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:10,400
exposures? Are you living in an area

1221
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:11,839
with polluted air? That also contributes

1222
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,760
to our risk. So you need to get a big

1223
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:15,520
picture. So bio banks are a great place

1224
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:17,760
to start to aggregate all of this

1225
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:19,760
information and then to build these

1226
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:21,440
models. And these models can be super

1227
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,599
powerful. And basically there are

1228
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:25,760
algorithms that take all of these pieces

1229
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:27,760
of information together and come up with

1230
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:29,920
a a risk and say you are at an increased

1231
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:32,640
risk of this disease. You should take

1232
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:36,400
action. We were fortunate to be part of

1233
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:37,920
a study uh funded by the National Human

1234
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,760
Genome Research Institute known as

1235
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:42,480
Emerge or Genomics in the medical

1236
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:44,640
record. um which was which actually

1237
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:47,599
sought to address to look at this this

1238
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:49,520
idea of what happens if you report back

1239
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:51,760
to individuals their monogenic and their

1240
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:54,000
polyenic and their family history risk

1241
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:55,760
of some chronic diseases. You know, we

1242
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,280
chose models that were mature for for

1243
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:01,280
for the diseases listed here. And across

1244
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:02,640
24,000 participants and 10 clinical

1245
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,400
sites across the entire country

1246
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:08,880
including both adults and pediatric

1247
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:11,280
cohorts, we we sequenced, we calculated

1248
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:13,280
their risks of these diseases through

1249
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:15,839
these models and then returned that to

1250
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:18,640
them through their healthcare providers

1251
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:20,960
and and again the science is sort of

1252
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:23,040
there but a big part of this study is

1253
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,560
actually the implementation science part

1254
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,960
of it. Like what do they do with that

1255
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:29,200
information? What do they do? How does

1256
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,800
not just the the patient what does the

1257
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:32,720
doctor do with that information? You

1258
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,800
know, so this idea of polygenic risk for

1259
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:36,480
cardiovascular disease has been

1260
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,000
developed and and some of the seminal

1261
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:40,640
work on that came out of the broad

1262
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,400
institute several years ago. I'm a

1263
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:45,200
patient and and broad institute and

1264
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:46,960
researchers at Mass General with us

1265
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:49,200
published some seminal papers on this

1266
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:51,119
many years ago. And of course I'm like

1267
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:53,280
oh I'm interested in cardiovascular

1268
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:56,480
risk. I'm going to go talk to my PCP

1269
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:57,760
who's at Mass General and say, 'What do

1270
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,280
you think about this polygenic risk?

1271
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,960
Should I get tested for polygenic risk

1272
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,880
for cardiovascular disease? He went,

1273
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:04,240
what's that? Right? He didn't have a

1274
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,560
clue because we're not training

1275
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:08,640
physicians in who are like, you know, in

1276
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:11,280
the field with 50minute appointments on

1277
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:13,040
like what polygenic risk is. So part of

1278
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,720
this study was actually what about

1279
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:17,520
creating educational materials for the

1280
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:19,680
health care provider and action plans

1281
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:21,280
and how do we you know train the health

1282
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:23,359
care system to actually be able to

1283
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:25,920
handle this information as well not just

1284
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:27,680
the participants. Uh and so this is

1285
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,960
again I think the next generation of

1286
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:32,480
what we're going to start doing is like

1287
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:35,359
how do we start to distribute the more

1288
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:37,440
cutting edge models of risk so that

1289
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:39,839
people can start to take actions

1290
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:41,520
earlier. And so we've been fortunate

1291
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:43,599
building on this study and other work

1292
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:45,520
that's been happening to now work with

1293
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:48,000
lots of groups to try to get this

1294
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:50,480
information out there. So Mass General

1295
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,240
Brighgam again across the river uh Praep

1296
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:54,640
Narajan who runs the preventative

1297
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:57,200
cardiology clinic at Mass General and is

1298
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:58,559
a a member at the Broad

1299
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:01,280
you know he's been really interested in

1300
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:02,720
this topic as well for his clinic you

1301
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:05,440
know because you can do all the risk

1302
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:07,680
factors of lipids and weight exercise

1303
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:09,119
smoking but he wants to also capture the

1304
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:11,280
full risk which means I he wants to

1305
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:14,240
understand that polygenic and monogenic

1306
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:16,720
risk as well. So together we worked on

1307
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:18,400
launching a clinical test now that any

1308
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,920
patient and not just at Mass General but

1309
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,760
any patient around the country can talk

1310
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:24,640
to their doctor. They can order it from

1311
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:26,720
Mass General um across eight different

1312
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:30,240
cardiovascular conditions. They've now

1313
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:32,559
got these risk scores um of course um as

1314
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:34,000
well as being a collaborator I'm also a

1315
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:35,359
patient of Praeps because I go to the

1316
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,400
preventative cardiology clinic because

1317
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:39,040
I'm someone who's obsessed with

1318
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:41,119
cardiovascular risk, right? Um so I got

1319
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:43,520
this test done. Um turns out I don't

1320
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:45,359
have polygenic risks. That's great. Um,

1321
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:46,880
haven't found any monogenic risk. The

1322
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:49,839
all of us program didn't find any risk

1323
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:52,240
in my genome. So, uh, it's a lot of

1324
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:55,520
family history and all I can do is

1325
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:57,119
essentially have a healthier lifestyle

1326
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:58,640
than I would say my father had in his

1327
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:01,040
40s where he was a smoker and he was

1328
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:03,200
overweight. I can avoid to the as great

1329
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:05,200
extent I can those things and then

1330
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:07,839
hopefully my you know it looks like now

1331
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:11,440
my you know risk of having a heart

1332
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:13,200
attack is lower um than than it could

1333
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:15,920
have been had I not taken those

1334
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:18,960
interventions um those lifestyle

1335
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:20,880
interventions other programs in the VA

1336
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:22,480
so the the Veterans Administration

1337
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:25,119
actually has another very interesting

1338
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:27,040
bio bank known as the million veterans

1339
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:29,599
project and so they've been enrolling

1340
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:31,920
veterans into a bio because veterans

1341
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:33,520
also have a set of healthcare issues,

1342
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:35,839
some of which are unique to them to

1343
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:39,200
their population. And so with Jason

1344
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:41,040
Vassie, who's an investigator at the VA,

1345
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:42,640
um we've launched a clinical trial in

1346
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:44,400
prostate cancer risk in the VA

1347
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:46,319
population using the same sort of

1348
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:48,800
methods that we're using in the other

1349
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:50,160
programs. Also working with companies,

1350
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:53,040
there are companies who work directly

1351
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:54,319
with consumers. Now my as an example um

1352
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:57,920
they've also been working with a

1353
00:50:54,319 --> 00:51:01,520
research institute in Alabama to provide

1354
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:03,760
free genetic testing for common healthc

1355
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:05,520
care risks in the population to Alabama

1356
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:07,760
because Alabama has one of the poorest

1357
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:09,359
healthcare outcomes uh in in the

1358
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:11,280
country. So bringing this kind of

1359
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:12,880
cutting edge testing to to the state of

1360
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,720
Alabama

1361
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:16,400
and then other you know companies are

1362
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:18,960
offering this as well using the same

1363
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:20,400
underlying technologies and algorithms

1364
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:25,280
and models that we've been building

1365
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:28,000
here. Okay. So I hope I've convinced you

1366
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:31,440
that there's a there is a potential

1367
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:33,119
future in which the technologies that

1368
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:35,359
you heard about tonight could actually

1369
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:38,000
make a material impact on all of our

1370
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:41,839
healthcare. And I really would like to

1371
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:43,599
see us be able to get to a place where

1372
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:46,079
we spend, you know, number one, we're

1373
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:47,680
not afraid afraid to interact with the

1374
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:51,680
health care system, that the healthare

1375
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:54,240
system is in fact interactive. That the

1376
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:56,160
insights I haven't talked about AI and

1377
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:57,920
machine learning yet, ML, right? But

1378
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:59,599
almost everything I've talked about

1379
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:02,400
already incorporates some amount of AI

1380
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:05,599
and ML in it. The the software that we

1381
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:08,000
use to look at the variance uses AI. the

1382
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:10,960
the chips on the computers that we use

1383
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:13,040
to do the 4hour genome or Nvidia

1384
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:15,280
accelerated, you know, machine learning

1385
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:17,440
chips. It's already part of what we're

1386
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:19,440
doing today. But there's more we can do

1387
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:21,760
with AI and ML. There's a whole bunch of

1388
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:24,079
hype and nonsense in AI and ML. But

1389
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:26,559
actually, fundamentally, it's just a

1390
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:28,319
really powerful tool that will help us

1391
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:30,240
sort through all of this information

1392
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:32,480
that we're gathering that humans are

1393
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:34,319
just not equipped sort of to manually

1394
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:35,760
sort through. When you think about a bio

1395
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:37,680
bank, if you've got hundreds of

1396
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:40,079
thousands of people with hundreds of

1397
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:42,000
thousands of genomes, each genome has

1398
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:43,520
millions of variants and they've got all

1399
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,119
these other pieces of information about

1400
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:46,800
their health and their lifestyle. A

1401
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:49,200
human can never make those associations

1402
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:51,839
and those patterns. It's exactly what AI

1403
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:53,359
is built to do. So AI is already making

1404
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:55,599
a difference. It's going to continue

1405
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:58,160
making a difference. the more we have

1406
00:52:55,599 --> 00:53:00,400
linked data sets and larger bio banks,

1407
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:03,200
we'll be able to train better models and

1408
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:05,359
get these risks like out there much more

1409
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:06,880
powerfully, much more predictive. And I

1410
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:08,480
think there is a possible world and

1411
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:09,839
there's companies working on it where

1412
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,920
you can have your genome sequence and

1413
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:15,280
you will be able to sort of interact

1414
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:17,839
with that risk model and understand it.

1415
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:20,000
Um, and I think it would be great if,

1416
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:22,160
you know, we spend as much time sort of

1417
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:25,119
tinkering with and making small changes

1418
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:28,240
in our health care and our our healthy

1419
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:30,480
aging plan as we do in our 401k. Like

1420
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:32,480
the Fidelity app is really easy to use,

1421
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:34,720
you know, for most part. If we had a

1422
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:36,480
little health app that, you know, that

1423
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:38,319
your hospital system or your your your

1424
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:40,720
insurance maintained, maybe not your

1425
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:42,400
insurance, who knows? um but that

1426
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:44,480
somebody maintained that you had control

1427
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:47,040
over that you could start to say well

1428
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:48,480
look this risk over here um I should

1429
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:50,800
talk to my healthcare provider about

1430
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:52,720
additional screenings for these diseases

1431
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:54,880
because one of the things about saving

1432
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:56,400
money in the system is you know if we

1433
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:58,400
all just go out and get screened for

1434
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:01,040
everything more often that actually

1435
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:02,960
increases the healthcare cost burden but

1436
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:04,559
but by actually modeling your risk and

1437
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,920
say well actually I'm not at higher risk

1438
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:08,400
for any one of these diseases than

1439
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:10,319
anybody else but these two things I'm at

1440
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:12,240
much higher risk for and I'm only going

1441
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:13,920
to really focus on additional screening

1442
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:16,480
for these things. We would end up saving

1443
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:18,160
the system money. Okay. So the idea of

1444
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:20,400
interactivity I think that would be a

1445
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:22,000
really great place to get um the

1446
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,839
healthare systems themselves can also

1447
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,680
use this through their bio banks through

1448
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:27,839
their there's fascinating stuff

1449
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:30,160
happening just looking at EHRs that the

1450
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:32,640
electronic health records little signals

1451
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:35,359
in your labs the notes that you have in

1452
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:36,880
your visits. Um Jordan Smaller who runs

1453
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:38,960
um some of the the psychiatric program

1454
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:42,480
at Mass General has published papers

1455
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:44,559
showing um risk of bipolar disorder,

1456
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:47,520
things like suicidal tendencies. You can

1457
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:49,359
actually find signals of those things in

1458
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:51,920
people's medical records when you apply

1459
00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:54,079
AI. So there's there's a tremendous

1460
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:56,480
amount that's going to happen in that.

1461
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:58,480
Um so that's that's sort of risk

1462
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:00,800
modeling and planning. When we

1463
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:02,240
inevitably when people have diseases,

1464
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:04,240
the other types of studies and

1465
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:06,160
technologies are going to help us have

1466
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:08,240
better therapies, more targeted

1467
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:10,240
therapies, not just in cancer but in

1468
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:13,359
rare diseases as well. The ability to

1469
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:15,200
edit genomes is is a tantalizing idea.

1470
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:17,440
And the idea that we can sort of, you

1471
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:19,760
know, maybe hopefully bucket diseases

1472
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:21,760
together so that there are incentives to

1473
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:23,680
create therapies for more of the rare

1474
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:26,559
diseases.

1475
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:29,680
So to summarize,

1476
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:33,200
I guess my message was

1477
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:35,599
public investment in really difficult

1478
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:38,640
audacious projects like the human genome

1479
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:41,599
project have

1480
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:44,319
really returned a massive amount of um

1481
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:45,680
value to us both as a sort of a research

1482
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:48,000
community but increasingly in the

1483
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:50,000
biomedical field and now getting into

1484
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,400
the healthcare system. I think that

1485
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,559
we're only going to see more

1486
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:56,160
improvements, more control, more ability

1487
00:55:54,559 --> 00:56:00,000
to direct our own healthcare and our

1488
00:55:56,160 --> 00:56:03,760
aging, our healthy aging with modern

1489
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:06,319
methods. And I think this is and and

1490
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:07,839
realizing that we can't just make this

1491
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:09,520
sort of the sport of kings for the

1492
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:11,119
people who can afford it. that actually

1493
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:13,520
the way to reduce the healthcare burden

1494
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:16,240
is to catalog this variation across all

1495
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:18,160
ancestries, all all people and make the

1496
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:19,839
sort of the the risk mitigation

1497
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:22,559
available to all. That's where we're

1498
00:56:19,839 --> 00:56:26,400
actually going to save uh save money and

1499
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:28,960
and really it just it all comes from our

1500
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:33,880
continue continuing to believe and

1501
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:33,880
invest in science. Thank you.

1502
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:43,440
Thank you so much, Nile. Uh, if you have

1503
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:45,839
any questions in the audience, raise

1504
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:47,359
your hand and one of our micro runners

1505
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:50,160
will come over to you. But first, I'll

1506
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:52,240
just start off with we clearly we have

1507
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:54,240
the science, we have the technology, we

1508
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:56,720
can make them better.

1509
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:59,200
What is it going to take to make

1510
00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:00,799
sequencing from like a reg is it a

1511
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:02,480
regulatory thing? Is it a financial

1512
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:03,599
thing where we could just go to our

1513
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:05,200
doctor's office like if I have an

1514
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:06,880
appointment tomorrow and just say hey

1515
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:08,640
I'd like to get sequenced I want to know

1516
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:12,880
what my risk is. I'm not a participant

1517
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:14,559
in a by I actually am but you know how

1518
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:16,400
can that just become sort of the

1519
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:18,240
standard part of the care that we all

1520
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:22,480
get whenever we see our PCP.

1521
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:25,200
>> Yeah. So I didn't get into it because

1522
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:27,680
it's a downer and also it would take too

1523
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:30,160
long and I'm not an expert. uh we have

1524
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:32,960
this issue of insurance certainly in

1525
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:35,920
this country and you know today

1526
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:38,400
increasingly insurance is covering

1527
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:41,200
genome sequencing certainly in childhood

1528
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:43,520
rare diseases in the NICU in cancers

1529
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:45,599
where there's clear sort of actions and

1530
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:47,760
and utility you know you don't have

1531
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:50,000
issues you know convincing insurance

1532
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:51,839
companies that you could sequence the

1533
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,920
genome on a healthy individual and have

1534
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:55,520
that information about their risks and

1535
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:57,920
do prevention and that would ultimately

1536
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:59,520
save them is a really tricky prospect

1537
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:01,200
the way that insurance works in this

1538
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:03,680
country because a company is not

1539
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:06,000
necessarily incentivized to kind of help

1540
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:08,160
you avoid a disease 10 years from now

1541
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:10,319
because most insurance companies have a

1542
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:12,400
an individual customer for like three

1543
00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:14,000
years. So they don't see the they pay

1544
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:16,559
for the test they don't see the benefit

1545
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:18,240
of the test is their thinking. So we got

1546
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:19,839
to change that thinking to say that

1547
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:21,680
actually preventing disease helps them

1548
00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:22,960
all. Whether it's they pay for it,

1549
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:24,160
somebody else pays for it, they get the

1550
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:26,400
benefit of the test that somebody else

1551
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:28,160
paid for. That's that's the morass that

1552
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:30,079
you know has to be addressed. And I

1553
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:31,839
think the other thing that I did not get

1554
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:33,760
into because it's a whole topic to be

1555
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:35,760
solved on its own is of course sort of

1556
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:37,119
genetic privacy. Do you want your

1557
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:38,559
insurance company knowing your risks of

1558
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:41,280
disease? What would they do with that

1559
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:42,720
information? Um so we have to have you

1560
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:44,240
know the ability I think again for

1561
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:46,400
individuals to control their own

1562
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:50,920
information. what's done with it. Um, so

1563
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:50,920
I, so there's a lot to address there.

1564
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:55,680
>> Question over here.

1565
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:57,599
>> Oh, sorry. Go right ahead. Sorry. Sorry.

1566
00:58:55,680 --> 00:59:00,400
>> Yeah, I I was really impressed by

1567
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:04,000
everything you said about uh how we're

1568
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:06,160
applying uh genetic variations

1569
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,720
especially to newborn infants in the

1570
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:11,440
clinic. But three areas you didn't

1571
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:15,040
mention is one sematic monitoring

1572
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:20,000
sematic changes in diseases like cancer.

1573
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:22,720
Two uh microbiome and tracing how that

1574
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:25,920
is related to health and disease and how

1575
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:28,400
that might vary even with an individual

1576
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:31,839
and then RNA expression levels

1577
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:35,760
transcripttoics of disease uh and with

1578
00:59:31,839 --> 00:59:38,079
testing back in less than a day. uh how

1579
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:41,200
how close are we to being able to use

1580
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:43,440
that kind of information to trace the

1581
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:45,520
projects the progress of diseases that

1582
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:46,400
give us feedback that would help in the

1583
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:49,440
clinic.

1584
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:51,119
>> Yeah, great question. So, so, so all of

1585
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:52,960
those things are happening. Um, so

1586
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:54,799
sematic changes in cancer are just the

1587
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:56,000
variants in the tumors that I described.

1588
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:57,440
So, I just didn't call them sematic

1589
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,599
variants, but that certainly is is part

1590
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:02,480
of this sequencing of tumors and liquid

1591
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:04,559
biopsy. Um microbiome is a fascinating

1592
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:06,079
uh absolutely fascinating um area and I

1593
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:09,359
was involved in the human microbiome

1594
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:10,960
project as well. Um and so there are

1595
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:14,799
lots of studies actually and one of you

1596
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:17,200
know we routinely um at our lab are

1597
01:00:14,799 --> 01:00:18,720
profiling gut microbiomes and and that

1598
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:20,480
is one of the big research areas that's

1599
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:22,240
happening at the road as well. We don't

1600
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:24,240
have a clinical test for microbiomes

1601
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:27,440
today, but there are companies locally.

1602
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:30,160
There are startups um who are looking at

1603
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:32,880
uh microbiome therapeutics for you know

1604
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:34,960
things like CIFF um and IBD. And so

1605
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:37,839
that's certainly an area it uses exactly

1606
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:40,720
the same technologies I've described um

1607
01:00:37,839 --> 01:00:42,799
and and RNA. Yes. So RNA so it is in

1608
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:44,480
this sort of field of again multiple

1609
01:00:42,799 --> 01:00:47,680
omics and so we do a tremendous amount

1610
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:49,839
of RNA transcrytoics um sequencing as

1611
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:53,520
well in the all of us cohort. We've just

1612
01:00:49,839 --> 01:00:55,520
actually um completed a pilot of 10,000

1613
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:57,520
participants within the Olivus cohort

1614
01:00:55,520 --> 01:01:00,160
adding to their existing genome

1615
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:03,040
sequencing, transcryto RNA sequencing

1616
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:06,559
and proteome like protein protein uh

1617
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:09,040
profiling as well um to build up that

1618
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:11,200
picture of you know what is the value of

1619
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:14,640
adding these other omix to this for

1620
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:17,359
research but also RNA sequencing is now

1621
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:19,599
you know often used in some of the rare

1622
01:01:17,359 --> 01:01:22,240
disease diagnostics because one way that

1623
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:24,240
you can understand if you find say two

1624
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:26,480
variants that might be causing the

1625
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:28,160
disease and say that you know the the

1626
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:30,720
way the disease shows up is a muscle

1627
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:32,640
disease or muscle wasting um one thing

1628
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:34,880
you can look at is in the RNA knowledge

1629
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:37,040
bases that we have um and these are

1630
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:39,040
other large public initiatives we've

1631
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:41,119
been involved in GTEx is the genome

1632
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:42,880
genotype tissue expression project so

1633
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:45,040
looking at RNA levels in different

1634
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:46,559
tissues you could look at that patient

1635
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:48,880
and say I found two variants in the

1636
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:50,000
genome let's look in the RNA level and

1637
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:51,359
say, well, of these two variants, which

1638
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,960
one of them is highly expressed in

1639
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:54,960
muscle? Because if that's the one that

1640
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:56,799
has the variant that and the disease

1641
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:58,559
shows up as a muscle wasting disease,

1642
01:01:56,799 --> 01:02:00,640
that's helps us kind of get to those

1643
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:04,160
positive variants. So, yes, all of those

1644
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:05,599
things are certainly happening. Um,

1645
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:07,040
uh, in our hands at least, the

1646
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:08,559
microbiome and the RNA are not yet

1647
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:12,480
clinical tests, but there are clinical

1648
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:15,720
tests that use RNA and microbiomes in in

1649
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:15,720
other groups.

1650
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:23,040
Thank you for this amazing talk um and

1651
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:27,119
summarizing the last 20 years of

1652
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:29,680
genomics in one hour. Um I'm also an

1653
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:33,040
exrody and I started 20 years ago at the

1654
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:36,079
broad that was my first job. So big fan

1655
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:38,240
of the broad institute obviously. Um my

1656
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:43,280
question is

1657
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:46,319
if those programs become

1658
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:48,400
possible where everybody's sequenced in

1659
01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:52,319
all the states,

1660
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:55,839
do we have the infrastructure for it?

1661
01:02:52,319 --> 01:02:58,720
Where will the samples go? Where will

1662
01:02:55,839 --> 01:03:02,000
they get processed? Right?

1663
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:04,640
>> How will the reporting be managed? What

1664
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:07,280
recommendation do you have if somebody

1665
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:08,640
were to ask you how to do that?

1666
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:09,440
>> Yep.

1667
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:11,680
>> An hour.

1668
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:12,799
>> Yeah. Well, well, so that is exactly the

1669
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:14,720
kind of thing. So, if you think about

1670
01:03:12,799 --> 01:03:17,119
the newborn sequencing program, that's

1671
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:18,799
that beacons program. That is exactly

1672
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:21,520
part of this implementation science,

1673
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:22,880
right? It's not we technically know how

1674
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:25,440
to do it, but it's all of those

1675
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:26,880
logistics, right? It's the how yeah,

1676
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:28,880
where did the sample get processed? How

1677
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:30,640
do we store the sample? It turns out

1678
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:32,319
that actually one of the big costs now

1679
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:34,559
because the cost of sequencing genomes

1680
01:03:32,319 --> 01:03:36,480
has become so low

1681
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:37,680
storing the data you know create when

1682
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:39,599
you when you sequence a genome you

1683
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:41,440
create a lot of data like more than you

1684
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:42,960
can keep on a laptop and so actually

1685
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:44,720
storing all of that data becomes quite

1686
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:48,000
expensive. So there's data management

1687
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:49,920
becomes a legitimate um issue and also

1688
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:52,720
just again this we have to be so careful

1689
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:53,920
about data security right and and one of

1690
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:55,760
the actually interesting things about

1691
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:59,039
the way the all of us bio bank program

1692
01:03:55,760 --> 01:04:02,400
was set up is that um sort of in a

1693
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:04,400
precient way was that when it was set up

1694
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:05,680
many years ago

1695
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:07,920
participants who have their genome

1696
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:10,720
sequence as part of all of us the data

1697
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:12,400
is stored in a cloud environment in a

1698
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:14,319
secure environment but it's actually

1699
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:16,880
even though the The project is funded by

1700
01:04:14,319 --> 01:04:18,799
the NIH. The government does not own the

1701
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:21,520
data. The government doesn't have access

1702
01:04:18,799 --> 01:04:22,799
to the data. The data is stored by an

1703
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:24,720
awardee. Actually, it turns out to be

1704
01:04:22,799 --> 01:04:26,640
Vanderbilt University is the curator of

1705
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:28,799
the data. So, they're responsible for

1706
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:30,559
keeping it safe and access to it. And

1707
01:04:28,799 --> 01:04:32,079
actually, they have what's called a

1708
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:34,160
certificate of confidentiality, which

1709
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:36,160
means the government cannot access that

1710
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:37,920
data for law enforcement purposes, for

1711
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:39,760
other things like that. So that's those

1712
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:43,039
kinds of things are very those walls are

1713
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:45,760
very important to um create to build

1714
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:47,440
confidence, privacy, security. So all of

1715
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:49,359
that logistical things do have to be

1716
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:51,440
worked out. That is what programs like

1717
01:04:49,359 --> 01:04:53,200
beacons and others are trying to do. And

1718
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:54,640
there's lots of companies who are also

1719
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:55,839
trying to do this. And it will be

1720
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:57,520
interesting to see of course there's a

1721
01:04:55,839 --> 01:04:59,280
lot of public effort. There's also a

1722
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:03,039
bunch of private effort and so there's

1723
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:04,880
there's a lot of models out there where

1724
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:07,200
you could go to a company and get your

1725
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:08,799
genome sequenced and one model is and

1726
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:10,400
then likely again this is for people who

1727
01:05:08,799 --> 01:05:11,920
can pay for it. there is sort of the

1728
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:13,760
subscription model. you would have your

1729
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:16,400
genome sequenced and have it accessible

1730
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:18,000
whenever you need to access it or look

1731
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:19,760
you know something happens and you you

1732
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,920
want to have someone interrogate it you

1733
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:23,200
could do that on demand right so so

1734
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:25,119
different models are showing up whether

1735
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:29,039
in the public system the health care

1736
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:31,039
system or in sort of private companies

1737
01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:32,160
and actually that segus nicely to a

1738
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:34,160
question that we actually had somebody

1739
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:36,160
ask on YouTube was you know you

1740
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:38,400
mentioned that a researcher comes to the

1741
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:40,880
road and they can get their samples

1742
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:43,680
sequenced for around $350 I mentioned

1743
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:45,760
That depends on volume or scale, but you

1744
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:47,280
know, if your average person off the

1745
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:49,119
street wanted to get their genome

1746
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:50,160
sequenced, what would that what would

1747
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:52,559
that run though?

1748
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:54,319
>> Yeah. So again, so we don't sort of do

1749
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:56,240
this sort of, you know, this is kind of

1750
01:05:54,319 --> 01:05:58,400
like the direct to consumer model,

1751
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:59,760
right, of just sort of people coming and

1752
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:01,599
paying for their genome to be sequenced.

1753
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:03,039
That's not what we do. Uh, you know,

1754
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:04,559
genomes that we sequence are usually

1755
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:06,319
part again of these larger research

1756
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:07,680
studies that we describe. in the

1757
01:06:06,319 --> 01:06:09,760
clinical world where we do clinical

1758
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:11,280
whole genome sequencing. It it's like

1759
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:14,000
any other clinical test. It comes from

1760
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:15,920
an order from a healthcare provider. Um

1761
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,440
so individuals can't sort of just send

1762
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:19,119
us their sample and ask us to sequence

1763
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:20,960
their genome. But there are companies

1764
01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:23,200
who will do that, right? So there's lots

1765
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:25,599
now of direct to consumer companies who

1766
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:27,839
offer you know the same kind of health

1767
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:30,079
risks whether it's monogenic polygenic

1768
01:06:27,839 --> 01:06:31,599
reports back to consumers and you can

1769
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:34,400
actually just go and have a company do

1770
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:37,920
it and they're typically running about

1771
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:39,920
$500 to start different models but yeah

1772
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:41,520
>> okay question here and then we had

1773
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:42,799
somebody up in the middle as well so

1774
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:45,200
start with you.

1775
01:06:42,799 --> 01:06:47,839
>> Thank you. Hi Dr. N. I'm Yin. I'm

1776
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:50,640
currently a student from HMS and I'm

1777
01:06:47,839 --> 01:06:54,319
aspiring founder. So I have a two-part

1778
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:56,160
question. Uh first question is on the um

1779
01:06:54,319 --> 01:06:59,760
I want I want you to kind of walk us

1780
01:06:56,160 --> 01:07:01,599
through like uh uh patient process uh uh

1781
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:04,480
for somebody who wants to get for

1782
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:06,640
example the cardiovascular genomic risk

1783
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:09,200
assessment. Uh I know we had a

1784
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:11,839
breakthrough now of very fast under

1785
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:13,920
4hour genome sequencing but I can't help

1786
01:07:11,839 --> 01:07:15,920
but to think the genome interpretation

1787
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:18,319
part of it is still catching up. So

1788
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:21,359
could that be a potential bottleneck in

1789
01:07:18,319 --> 01:07:24,319
the future of having like red red you

1790
01:07:21,359 --> 01:07:27,359
know readly uh write out of your genomic

1791
01:07:24,319 --> 01:07:29,280
assessment risks. Um so that's my first

1792
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:31,760
part of question. Second is on the

1793
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:34,160
genomic uh genetic privacy that you

1794
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:37,200
mentioned. In the future, could there be

1795
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:39,839
possibly uh this centralized model where

1796
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:43,520
patient will have control of their own

1797
01:07:39,839 --> 01:07:46,480
genetic uh information and they have the

1798
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:48,400
power to monetize it themselves rather

1799
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:51,039
than having some company startup

1800
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:53,359
monetizing on their data in fine prints

1801
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:55,599
right when you sign up sign a paper with

1802
01:07:53,359 --> 01:07:57,760
them. So that's my question. Thank you.

1803
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:59,039
>> Yep. Um so so on the first part I think

1804
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:00,640
uh if I understand the question it was

1805
01:07:59,039 --> 01:08:04,319
sort of the you know even if we can

1806
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:05,839
sequence the genome faster um

1807
01:08:04,319 --> 01:08:07,599
assessing the genomic risk is going to

1808
01:08:05,839 --> 01:08:09,520
be slower and that's a bottling that's

1809
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:11,760
going to be true and I would say for the

1810
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:13,359
most part

1811
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:15,280
you know unless you're in the NICU and

1812
01:08:13,359 --> 01:08:16,719
some other settings we don't necessarily

1813
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:17,839
need to sequence your genome in four

1814
01:08:16,719 --> 01:08:20,319
hours right if you're going to do a

1815
01:08:17,839 --> 01:08:22,239
genomic risk assessment your risk we're

1816
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:24,319
talking about years of like lifetime

1817
01:08:22,239 --> 01:08:26,400
risk right and so you're really if that

1818
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:28,239
report takes three weeks or six weeks to

1819
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:30,239
get back to you. It's unlikely, you

1820
01:08:28,239 --> 01:08:31,759
know, a a major chronic disease will

1821
01:08:30,239 --> 01:08:34,080
have sort of magically shown up in that

1822
01:08:31,759 --> 01:08:36,000
time frame. So, I think matching the the

1823
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:39,520
technology capability with the sort of

1824
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:41,199
the clinical need um you know will

1825
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:42,960
happen naturally and I think some things

1826
01:08:41,199 --> 01:08:45,759
don't need to be massively fast, some

1827
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:48,880
things do. Um I think on the second

1828
01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:50,159
part, so the question being um you know,

1829
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:51,679
do you think there's a future where

1830
01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:53,759
people will be able to have their genome

1831
01:08:51,679 --> 01:08:56,239
sequence and sort of control it or

1832
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:58,239
monetize it themselves? It's an it is an

1833
01:08:56,239 --> 01:09:01,759
interesting idea and lots of folks have

1834
01:08:58,239 --> 01:09:04,880
been thinking about ways to enable that.

1835
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:06,719
I think again those are going to be

1836
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:08,560
companies pro somebody has to actually

1837
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:11,440
create the entity that allows you to do

1838
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:12,880
that right um it's not clear whether a

1839
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:15,600
health care system is going to be set up

1840
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:16,640
to do it insurance companies are not

1841
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:19,040
necessarily going to be the ones to do

1842
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:21,759
it so I think it will end up being some

1843
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:23,440
version of sort of you know public

1844
01:09:21,759 --> 01:09:25,839
private startup or something else that

1845
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:27,199
would maybe create a a model that allows

1846
01:09:25,839 --> 01:09:29,120
you to have your genome sequenced you

1847
01:09:27,199 --> 01:09:31,600
might have to pay them some nominal fee

1848
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:33,920
but then I didn't really touch on it But

1849
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:36,719
one of the very interesting things about

1850
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:38,319
strat about calculating lifetime risk of

1851
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:40,560
disease, one of the other use cases

1852
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:42,960
could be um what's known as patient

1853
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:44,560
stratification which essentially if you

1854
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:47,199
do a if you want to do a clinical trial

1855
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:49,359
today as a pharmaceutical company on a

1856
01:09:47,199 --> 01:09:52,640
drug that you know might avoid help you

1857
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:54,719
avoid getting a cardiovascular disease.

1858
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:56,640
to get the statistical power to decide

1859
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:58,800
has your drug done something, you need

1860
01:09:56,640 --> 01:10:00,640
to enroll like tens of thousands of

1861
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:02,000
people and then you got to wait for a

1862
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:03,679
really long time and say, well, how many

1863
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,360
people got a heart attack and how many

1864
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:07,280
people didn't? It takes a really long

1865
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:08,960
time and are massively expensive

1866
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:10,159
clinical trials and then it might not

1867
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:12,400
work. So, this is like the cost of

1868
01:10:10,159 --> 01:10:15,199
developing drugs. If you were to take a

1869
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:17,520
whole bunch of people, run a really in a

1870
01:10:15,199 --> 01:10:19,360
really powerful risk model and say,

1871
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:21,679
well, actually these are all the people

1872
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:23,360
who are at like 5x risk of having a

1873
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:25,840
heart attack in the next 10 years. Let's

1874
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:27,920
enroll them. Then we have to we actually

1875
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:30,480
have to like we can stratify, you know,

1876
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:32,640
the the trial and have a much smaller

1877
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:33,679
trial and have it be more powerful and

1878
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:35,040
actually be able to see if there's an

1879
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:36,960
effect sooner. So that's the kind of

1880
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:38,880
idea of the promise of also being able

1881
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:41,440
to model risk. And so there could be

1882
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:43,600
models where in bio banks through this

1883
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:45,120
information that people could get

1884
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:47,280
identified as being important to enroll

1885
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:48,640
or try to enroll in a clinical trial.

1886
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:50,880
And then there are companies who've

1887
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:52,880
talked about this idea of like well if

1888
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:54,719
you do get you know pharmaceutical

1889
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:56,800
companies will pay to have to find

1890
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:58,159
people who who can be in their trial. So

1891
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:00,480
there could be this idea that people

1892
01:10:58,159 --> 01:11:02,080
could sort of through a tokenized way

1893
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:03,520
have their data available and if

1894
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:04,800
somebody wants to enroll them in a trial

1895
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:06,800
that they have the ability to sort of

1896
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:08,719
benefit from that as well. I I would say

1897
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:10,239
it's not a mature system yet though, but

1898
01:11:08,719 --> 01:11:11,120
people certainly have been considering

1899
01:11:10,239 --> 01:11:12,480
that.

1900
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:14,320
>> Think we just found a new use for the

1901
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:16,080
blockchain.

1902
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:16,719
>> Uh, last question from the gentleman in

1903
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:19,679
the middle.

1904
01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:21,760
>> Right. I am not a Broaddy and I'm not

1905
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:24,880
living in a genomic world based on my

1906
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:27,360
own scientific education, but it appears

1907
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:31,679
that we're in a political environment

1908
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:34,880
where public support of science is

1909
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:38,800
changing or perhaps changing. Do you in

1910
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:41,280
your opinion see uh private or a

1911
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:45,840
commercial ground swell or investment

1912
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:48,320
that might grow or to equal or overtake

1913
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:50,800
that so that all these things you're

1914
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:53,600
talking about that that individuals

1915
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:56,239
might hope for to increase their own and

1916
01:11:53,600 --> 01:12:00,080
be involved in in a more fullome level

1917
01:11:56,239 --> 01:12:03,760
in their own medicine? Do you see there

1918
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:06,719
a a possibility of uh individuals and

1919
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:10,560
and the people being able to take over

1920
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:15,280
and fund this so we're not relying on uh

1921
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:18,960
um a changing uh public support system?

1922
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:21,280
>> Yeah, that's a it's a it's a really

1923
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:25,360
important question and there's no easy

1924
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:27,360
answer. I think it is. So, a couple of

1925
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:28,960
things have happened. I would say I

1926
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:30,640
think you're right and I think certainly

1927
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:33,600
us you those of us who've been working

1928
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:34,960
in in this area you know we didn't

1929
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:36,719
really mention it here but during the

1930
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:39,440
pandemic you know the broad and broad

1931
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:41,679
clin clinicals lab broad roads clinical

1932
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:43,040
lab did actually do a lot of the co

1933
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:44,800
testing that happened in New England

1934
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:47,440
that was happening in our clinical lab

1935
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:50,400
um we did 37 million tests and so we've

1936
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:52,640
you know we felt like this great energy

1937
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:54,320
that we were able to contribute I think

1938
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:56,400
what we've seen or at least what I've

1939
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:59,280
observed post pandemic because there has

1940
01:12:56,400 --> 01:13:01,360
been a little bit of sort of

1941
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:04,719
separation in the population of people

1942
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:06,239
who believe that how we as a country

1943
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:08,159
handled the pandemic was completely

1944
01:13:06,239 --> 01:13:10,800
wrong and people who believe we did what

1945
01:13:08,159 --> 01:13:12,400
we could do. Um and that has sort of I

1946
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:15,199
think undermined a little bit of the

1947
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:17,840
belief in science in some sections of

1948
01:13:15,199 --> 01:13:19,600
the population. I think unfortunately it

1949
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:21,920
also

1950
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:23,440
sort of conflates science with public

1951
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:25,199
health policy which is a totally

1952
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:27,120
different field. I would not want to be

1953
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:30,400
in in setting public health policy for

1954
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:32,159
anybody. But um so I think that's right

1955
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:33,760
there. You know I think those of us who

1956
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:38,080
work in science do worry that that has

1957
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:40,800
been a reality. I think

1958
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:42,560
and as

1959
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:44,800
you know the current um climate has

1960
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:48,080
rolled out we have certainly seen

1961
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:50,560
funding challenges in areas uh like NIH

1962
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:53,840
and CDC and others and that's been a

1963
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:56,480
concern. Um there has been groups who

1964
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:57,760
have stepped up and certainly as I

1965
01:13:56,480 --> 01:14:00,159
mentioned earlier a lot of the projects

1966
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:02,080
we do um you know they have federal

1967
01:14:00,159 --> 01:14:04,640
funding they have philanthropic funding

1968
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:07,040
pharma um and so those other sources of

1969
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:12,000
funding have certainly continue to exist

1970
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:14,560
and in some cases have increased um

1971
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:16,320
however you know I use the sort of the

1972
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:18,239
shuttle launch and the human genome as

1973
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:19,920
as examples. I think it's very unlikely

1974
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:21,600
that we'll find another source as

1975
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:23,199
powerful as the federal government. The

1976
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:24,800
federal government is the aggregate of

1977
01:14:23,199 --> 01:14:26,640
all of the funds that we sort of pay

1978
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:28,800
through our taxes. They have the deepest

1979
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:30,719
possible pockets. No one company is

1980
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:33,920
going to step up and fill that gap. And

1981
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:37,440
so we do need to continue to advocate

1982
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:40,719
that we as a country sort of invest in

1983
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:42,239
science and I you know and we at Broad

1984
01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:43,760
have now a really talented sort of

1985
01:14:42,239 --> 01:14:45,280
government relations team. And I think

1986
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:47,840
what we're finding is that, you know,

1987
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:50,880
you hear a lot of stuff in the news, but

1988
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:53,040
people in red states and people in blue

1989
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:54,880
states get sick. They have sick

1990
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:58,480
children. They have rare diseases. They

1991
01:14:54,880 --> 01:15:01,040
get cancer. Um, health care, everyone

1992
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:03,280
feels the pain. And everyone would

1993
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:04,800
prefer not to get sick, to have a better

1994
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:09,120
treatment for their family if they get

1995
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:11,440
sick. So there is by and large, I think,

1996
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:13,199
bipartisan support for continuing to

1997
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:15,120
invest as a country in science. It may

1998
01:15:13,199 --> 01:15:16,960
not show up on the news, but I think

1999
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:19,199
what we're hearing is that there is

2000
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:21,679
support for that and that people believe

2001
01:15:19,199 --> 01:15:24,000
that things like biioanks are important

2002
01:15:21,679 --> 01:15:27,360
and that there might be support across

2003
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:28,800
the aisles in that. So, I think I I I'm

2004
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:30,480
not a you know, I'm certainly not a

2005
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:33,280
political expert and I try to avoid the

2006
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:35,040
news as much as possible. Um, but I've

2007
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:36,880
got to I've got to believe that the

2008
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:39,199
stuff that we talked about tonight is

2009
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:42,239
important to everybody regardless of

2010
01:15:39,199 --> 01:15:44,719
their uh political affiliation. and and

2011
01:15:42,239 --> 01:15:47,440
we're going to continue to look at ways

2012
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:49,360
to, you know, bridge the gaps that we

2013
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:52,159
think hopefully will be short-term in

2014
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:53,760
any funding with these other sources to

2015
01:15:52,159 --> 01:15:56,239
get us to the point where we can keep

2016
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:57,760
proving the benefit of what's happening

2017
01:15:56,239 --> 01:16:01,520
and that it actually is in all of our

2018
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:04,080
benefits to to see these things through.

2019
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:05,760
>> And I think that is the perfect note on

2020
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:07,280
which to end the evening. Thank you to

2021
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:09,040
all of you for joining us tonight. Thank

2022
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:12,360
you for everybody watching online. And

2023
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:12,360
thank you, Nile.
