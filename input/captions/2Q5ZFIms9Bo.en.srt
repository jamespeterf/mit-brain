1
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:19,560
okay so wel come back from uh spring

2
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:30,080
break

3
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:33,120
oh we're still talking about mixtures

4
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:37,719
we spoke about mixing and uh separation

5
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:40,160
and uh we are going to talk today about

6
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:43,920
stratification but uh I want to spend

7
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:47,039
the first uh few minutes uh answering a

8
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:50,000
question that I had from a colleague who

9
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:54,079
is following the lectures online and

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:59,000
uh um asked me a nice question

11
00:00:54,079 --> 00:01:01,199
about uh how can how can we do um

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,159
separation at constant temperature and

13
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:07,680
pressure you remember that we did the

14
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:10,040
the entropy of mixing by mixing gases

15
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,920
and we we obtain this formula for the

16
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:16,560
entropy of mixing then we also uh spoke

17
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,680
about the fact that uh we could have

18
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:23,560
done the mixing in a better way in terms

19
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,799
of U thermodynamics I could we could

20
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,360
have done it

21
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:31,280
reversibly and therefore extract the

22
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:38,200
adiabatic availability of this situation

23
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:42,479
or this state with respect to this mixed

24
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:45,159
state we also spoke about uh computed

25
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:50,159
the minimum work of complete separation

26
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:52,759
of a mixture when in mutual equilibrium

27
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,039
with a reservoir which keeps it at the

28
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:58,920
same

29
00:01:55,039 --> 00:02:01,479
tnp and we found that the minimum work

30
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:06,039
is equal to the difference in the Gibs

31
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:12,479
free energy of the separated final

32
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:12,479
State uh from the uh initial mixture uh

33
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,480
state so this

34
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:21,879
diagram uh

35
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:25,400
shows graphically what what the problem

36
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:28,519
is so we have a

37
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:32,840
mixture and we want to separate

38
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:34,480
it and if the mixture is uh in um and we

39
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,760
want to separate it at at fixed the

40
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,640
temperature and pressure so that uh in

41
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:41,280
the end it will remain in mutual

42
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,560
equilibrium with the thermal Reservoir

43
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:48,040
which is at this same

44
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:50,959
temperature now if uh the mixture is an

45
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:53,560
ideal mixture of Ideal gases we have

46
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:56,000
found that the initial State and the

47
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,560
final State they have the same

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,560
temperature and also they have the same

49
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,560
energy

50
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:07,680
but of course they don't have the same

51
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,159
entropy so the separated State we call

52
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,959
it B

53
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:15,640
here uh has lesser entropy than the

54
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:20,040
mixed state so in order to separate we

55
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:23,200
have to remove at constant energy this

56
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:27,280
entropy to go from here to

57
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:29,200
here so removing entropy from a system

58
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,560
requires another system that picks up

59
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,200
that entropy

60
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,799
and that's why we need the reservoir but

61
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:39,120
the reservoir which starts at this state

62
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:42,000
here cannot just pick up the entropy in

63
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,599
order to pick up some entropy it also we

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,319
need to give it also some

65
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:53,640
energy and so to pick up this amount of

66
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:55,799
entropy this is the amount TR times that

67
00:03:53,640 --> 00:04:00,799
entropy is the amount of energy that we

68
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:03,920
must give to the reservoir

69
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,840
of course these are minimal amounts uh

70
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,840
because we we considering the reversible

71
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,840
process which is the

72
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:16,959
optimal so the question is how can we go

73
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:19,479
can we can we do this okay one

74
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,240
possibility it's on the next slide so I

75
00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:23,479
I'll I'll switch back and forth between

76
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:28,160
this and the

77
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:30,479
next uh is to make a a process like this

78
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:34,560
we we take first the mixture

79
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:37,560
and cool it down to this state

80
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:40,960
C of course we have to do it reversibly

81
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:44,840
so we will use a Machinery to do that

82
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,960
and uh so in order to cool it down we

83
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:49,160
change the

84
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:53,120
state we need the Machinery to

85
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:54,680
consume some work which is equal to the

86
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,120
available

87
00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:00,840
energy of this state C which is colder

88
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:03,120
than the reservoir but as you remember

89
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:05,880
the graphic representation of available

90
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,199
energy is given by this segment from

91
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,720
here to here with respect to this

92
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:13,800
Reservoir so even if it is colder than

93
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,280
the reservoir it has a positive

94
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:20,080
available

95
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:21,960
energy and uh finally then we will do a

96
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,280
an adiabatic a

97
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:28,600
work only so a weight process that takes

98
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,319
us from here to here and this is the

99
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,120
sequence so here is the

100
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:35,520
is a

101
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:37,199
Machinery which cools down the mixture

102
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,960
from the initial temperature to that

103
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:44,000
temperature T

104
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:47,520
TC and in order to do that a Machinery

105
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,680
needs to consume work which is equal to

106
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:53,280
the available energy of State C and

107
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:57,120
while doing that it will

108
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:59,160
transfer that an amount of heat to the

109
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,600
thermal Reservoir which is equal to this

110
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:05,039
work because the mixt no sorry uh take

111
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:08,160
it back which uh is going to be

112
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:10,120
different uh to be given by this much so

113
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:14,759
it's not equal to that work

114
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:17,639
sorry and once we have the mixture

115
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:21,680
prepared in that state then we can

116
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:25,039
perform our uh workon

117
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,080
process like weight process using semi-

118
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:30,400
perable

119
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:31,960
membranes that will uh

120
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,440
for example this membrane which is

121
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:39,639
perable only to particles to the black

122
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:44,360
particles is initially uh here then uh

123
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:47,360
by it's pulled down by the weight so it

124
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:49,880
compresses the gray particles to their

125
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,599
say half of the of the

126
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:56,800
volume and then also this other membrane

127
00:06:52,599 --> 00:07:00,800
which is perable to the uh gray uh

128
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:04,400
particles only it's on this uh side here

129
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:09,240
and then the weight going down here so

130
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:12,120
consuming work will push the black uh

131
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:16,199
particles to their half so it will do

132
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:19,800
sort of a partial compression of those

133
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:22,319
in doing that we go from here to here so

134
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:26,720
we spend the the weight the sum of the

135
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:29,639
weights uh uh energies of the weights is

136
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:32,960
the adiabatic availability of these

137
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:36,280
State here so this is a possibility to

138
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:39,080
perform of course it requires membranes

139
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,680
it requires uh reversible processes so

140
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:45,639
it's not very

141
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:47,240
practical uh so uh many times in

142
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:51,759
practice when you need to really

143
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:56,039
separate things you can also use um

144
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:59,759
chemistry so chemical engineering in uh

145
00:07:56,039 --> 00:08:02,560
solvents that would extract this sub

146
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:07,840
you're interested in from your mixture

147
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,840
and then uh once it has been

148
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:12,599
separated then you have to recover your

149
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:14,240
solvent so that it it's not consuming

150
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:15,879
the solvent

151
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:20,440
or

152
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:22,879
uh which could be a a physical solvent

153
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:25,919
so or but could also be a chemical

154
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:28,039
solvent maybe not it's not a proper word

155
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:30,039
but to give to give the idea something

156
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:31,880
that would prefer

157
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:36,560
entially

158
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:38,519
um interact and um react chemically with

159
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,200
one of the components and then you have

160
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:44,080
to uh reverse that reaction in order to

161
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:48,480
recover your solvent after you're

162
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:52,000
separated okay but even if you do it uh

163
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:55,600
chemically uh and if the final states

164
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,399
are these ones and your solvent is a is

165
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,560
a dummy variable so to speak of the

166
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:03,040
process in the sense that you it's a Cy

167
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:05,160
it goes back to its initial State uh and

168
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:10,160
and and remains therefore pure at the

169
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:12,800
end uh then this still represents the

170
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,560
minimum work of

171
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:18,800
separation and so it is refer reference

172
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:21,120
also in order to compute the uh second

173
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,279
low efficiency of that separ actual

174
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,200
separation

175
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:27,680
process

176
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:30,839
okay so let's go now to this uh problem

177
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,839
of stratification

178
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:41,800
and we are interested for example in the

179
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:46,640
stratification of gases in the

180
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:49,600
atmosphere like oxygen nitrogen

181
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:53,680
CO2 so remember that we started by

182
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:57,760
saying that uh for this kind of uh of of

183
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:59,880
problems uh we model uh like in the bulk

184
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:04,399
flow uh

185
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:07,320
State um model we we model the the

186
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:12,360
energy of the substance as given

187
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:14,640
by uh the energy which is proper of uh

188
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:17,680
the stable equilibrium State for the

189
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:21,000
given entropy volume and amounts of the

190
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:23,560
substance plus a potential energy which

191
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,600
in the case of gravitational uh uniform

192
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,399
gravitational field is uh as we all know

193
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,360
uh

194
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:33,720
mgz okay

195
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:37,240
and the mass of course depends on the

196
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:39,320
composition so the the local mass of the

197
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:42,680
uh fluid

198
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:46,519
Parcels uh changes with elevation due to

199
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:46,519
changes in

200
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,639
composition the chem the the chemical

201
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,880
Potentials in this situation are

202
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:56,000
substituted by the role of the chemical

203
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,880
potential is played by the total

204
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,360
potentials which is still the derivative

205
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:02,240
of the energy with respect to the

206
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,560
amounts but now the amounts appear not

207
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:08,680
only here but also in the in the

208
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:11,360
mass and that gives rise to a contribut

209
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:13,519
additional contribution to the potential

210
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,519
so we have the chemical potential plus

211
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,519
the gravitational

212
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:22,959
potential and so we have the sum of the

213
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:24,440
two is the total potential that is what

214
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:27,720
enters in the conditions for Mutual

215
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:31,839
stable equilibrium between uh fluid

216
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:34,839
parcels and therefore also between uh

217
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:37,600
layers of fluids Parcels of fluids that

218
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:39,959
find themselves at different elevation

219
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:43,040
in the gravity

220
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:46,440
field so in order to

221
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:50,000
impose uh Mutual stable equilibrium we

222
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:52,720
will impose equality of chemical

223
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,320
potential I'm sorry total potentials

224
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:58,920
between two layers at different

225
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:02,160
elevation we will assume instead as an

226
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:04,959
approx ination that uh although we not

227
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:09,720
going to assume that the temperature is

228
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:12,839
is completely uh um uniform so we're not

229
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:15,240
uh we want to go beyond the model of a

230
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:17,440
of an isothermal atmosphere we we will

231
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:20,040
assume that the temperature changes but

232
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:23,560
that the local changes are

233
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:24,839
irrelevant or can be say neglected for

234
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:28,440
this

235
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:31,160
uh computation of the chemical

236
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,160
equilibrium

237
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,800
so in order to apply this we have to

238
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:39,880
write this chemical these total

239
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:43,320
potentials and the total potentials are

240
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:47,680
written one at elevation Z Plus DZ and

241
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,680
the other times at elevation

242
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:56,800
Z and uh of course we need to use this

243
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:59,720
double contribution chemical plus

244
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:02,560
gravitational for the chemical part we

245
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:04,519
will assume ideal mixture Behavior so

246
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:08,360
the chemical potential is given by the

247
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:10,560
pure component uh chemical potential at

248
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:14,399
the same temperature and pressure plus

249
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:16,800
RT log of the mole fraction of that

250
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,199
component and then here we have the

251
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,639
gravitational

252
00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:22,800
contribution and the line above has the

253
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,399
Z Plus DZ

254
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,000
contribution

255
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:29,480
so in order since these two must be

256
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,440
equal

257
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:35,000
you do some uh manipulation you also

258
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:36,440
remember that uh since here we have the

259
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,120
difference between the chemical

260
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:43,720
potential at Z Plus DZ at the

261
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:44,959
pressure that belongs at at Z Plus DZ

262
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:50,000
and

263
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:51,759
that at elevation Z here enters the D

264
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,240
the partial derivative of mu with

265
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:58,199
respect to the pressure which is the

266
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:59,839
specific volume and that's why in the in

267
00:13:58,199 --> 00:14:02,880
the end

268
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:05,320
this is what we are left is the specific

269
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:10,560
volume

270
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:15,600
DP plus RT uh the derivative of the

271
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:19,240
logarithm of the mole fraction plus the

272
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:22,160
Mi gdz and Mi of course as the are the

273
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:24,839
molecular uh masses of the various

274
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:27,399
components so we have one equation like

275
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:29,800
this for each component because all

276
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:32,160
components can be exchanged

277
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,160
between

278
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:38,880
layers and

279
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:41,160
uh this is actually true also for the

280
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:44,680
pure substance so if you have a pure

281
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:47,199
substance so just one component this

282
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:49,920
equation becomes this

283
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:53,480
one and if you recognize that the

284
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:56,120
specific that the molar mass divided the

285
00:14:53,480 --> 00:15:02,199
spe specific volume and remember this is

286
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:03,720
specific volume uh molar uh so m / V is

287
00:15:02,199 --> 00:15:06,720
the uh

288
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:11,000
density so this equation becomes

289
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:13,399
dpals minus the density time G * DZ

290
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:18,880
which is which leads when you integrate

291
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:21,040
to the uh verul equation of static fluid

292
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,880
mechanics but you can also apply it for

293
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,839
example for a gas so for a gas

294
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:28,000
specifically volume is not constant so

295
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:31,199
you shouldn't put the you should

296
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,000
remember that V is RT over

297
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:37,959
p and therefore you can

298
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:41,199
integrate uh you can integrate you can

299
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:45,920
RT over P so you get DP over p on this

300
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:49,240
side and you have uh mg over RT on the

301
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:51,920
other side you can integrate so this

302
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:54,199
becomes the derivative of the logarithm

303
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,120
that's why the exponential here and on

304
00:15:54,199 --> 00:15:58,120
the right hand side depending on whether

305
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:01,160
your temperature is fixed or not if it

306
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:04,040
is not fixed you have to integrate in DZ

307
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,040
the inverse of the

308
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:11,040
temperature so this is the equivalent of

309
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:14,560
of of the berulia equation for for a gas

310
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:18,519
which gives you uh the the the the the

311
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:22,759
exponential pressure uh uh Decay with

312
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:25,759
height uh for an ideal gas in the

313
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:29,240
gravity field if you have a mixture

314
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:32,720
instead and the mixture is of gases

315
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:36,800
we can play the same uh and here is a

316
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:40,079
similar expression but it's um it is you

317
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,079
get one expression like

318
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:47,480
this uh for every

319
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:49,920
constituent and uh this is the partial

320
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:53,959
pressure so you compute these partial

321
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:56,880
pressures which also go down

322
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:59,440
exponentially with

323
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:02,440
Z but there is a coefficient icient of

324
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:07,360
the exponential that depends on that

325
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:10,000
depends on the uh molar masses so the

326
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:13,039
heavier uh particles the heavier

327
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,400
molecules go down faster than the the

328
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:16,760
lighter

329
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,640
molecules and so their partial pressures

330
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,640
go down

331
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:27,240
faster for

332
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:30,960
example oxygen is molecular weight

333
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:34,799
32 molecular oxygen and

334
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:37,919
nitrogen molecular nitrogen is 28 so

335
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:40,520
that difference 28 versus 32 makes it

336
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:43,679
makes it so that the partial pressure of

337
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:45,679
oxygen goes down more rapidly than that

338
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:50,080
of

339
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:52,360
uh nitrogen with elevation and

340
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,960
therefore as you go

341
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:57,440
high the

342
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,559
percentage mole I mean the mole fraction

343
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:04,360
of of oxygen uh

344
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:10,080
diminishes from the about 21% at the sea

345
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:13,679
level to uh to lower levels uh at higher

346
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:16,280
elevations we'll we'll see a graph in a

347
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:18,080
moment once you have the partial

348
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:20,919
pressures of course since this is a

349
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:24,080
mixture of Ideal gases we can use

350
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:25,960
Dalton's law and by adding them you get

351
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,919
the total pressure so you see how also

352
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:31,240
the total you can compute also how the

353
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,240
total pressure goes down in the

354
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:38,159
atmosphere you can also uh like uh here

355
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:41,240
we did it for a liquid uh for a pure

356
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:43,320
liquid you could also do it for a uh for

357
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:45,960
a mixture of

358
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:47,679
liquids it's the same you start from the

359
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,880
same equation only that now for the

360
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:52,960
liquid the specific volume is

361
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:55,320
constant if if you can apply the

362
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,600
incompressible fluid

363
00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:02,720
model and so

364
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,720
you uh this is the equation to be

365
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:08,919
integrated and you can combine these two

366
00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:11,799
because you have to one equation for

367
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:15,360
each uh constituent you can combine them

368
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:17,600
into this equation here and integrate

369
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:20,320
and here's the result of the

370
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:23,000
integral this is a mole

371
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:25,559
fraction of constituent

372
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,960
one at elevation

373
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:31,559
Z of course the other constituent as a

374
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:34,320
mo fraction one minus

375
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:36,559
y1 this is the ratio of the specific

376
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,840
volumes of the pure

377
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:41,360
components these are the difference in

378
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:42,919
the densities in the pure components

379
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,480
this is molecular weight of one

380
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:48,760
component and this

381
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:50,280
again is Z over the temperature or or or

382
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:53,159
if the temperature is

383
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:56,799
varying it's the it's the contribution

384
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:56,799
of the bearing temperature

385
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:09,360
now in the in canvas you will find a an

386
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:11,559
Excel file that I am sharing where I do

387
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,559
this

388
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:19,480
calculation where I made uh these

389
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:21,559
prots so I'm considering

390
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:25,919
air and I'm

391
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:31,600
using uh an air made of only four

392
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:31,600
constituents nitrogen oxygen argon and

393
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:42,240
CO2 and I assume that at the elevation

394
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:44,520
of the MAA laa laboratory which is at

395
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,159
3400

396
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:49,559
MERS

397
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:52,440
uh this is the composition I express

398
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:57,559
them in ppms parts per

399
00:20:52,440 --> 00:21:01,760
Millions so today uh the PPM of CO2 is

400
00:20:57,559 --> 00:21:01,760
420 ft 25 up

401
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:12,679
there okay using of course the the the

402
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:14,120
the mole fractions are 32 and so on 44

403
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:18,440
for

404
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:22,200
CO2 and um this is the expression that

405
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:25,240
we use in order to compute the partial

406
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:27,600
pressures and this CZ is that

407
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:29,360
integral or actually actually it is a

408
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:32,360
non-dimensional

409
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:35,559
non-dimensionalized integral of the

410
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:38,600
temperature and for the temperature I am

411
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:40,360
assuming the

412
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:44,000
actual

413
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:47,400
uh measure temp there is something fishy

414
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:50,640
here because it should be 1 minus a z

415
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:53,320
here uh so there is something wrong in

416
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:56,559
this denominator in the integral but

417
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:59,200
that's the that's the

418
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:02,520
um The Temper the the temperature

419
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:06,880
distribution that I'm assuming which is

420
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:10,799
the average measured temperature uh that

421
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:13,240
is find is found in the books of uh the

422
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:15,320
handbooks of chemical physics people

423
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:19,320
have have measured the average

424
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:24,159
temperature in the atmosphere it goes

425
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:29,039
down uh about six and half degrees

426
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:32,720
Kelvin per kilometer of elevation

427
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:35,120
people have also measured the uh

428
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:38,640
pressure as a function of elevation and

429
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:40,200
this is the correlation p p not is the C

430
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,960
Level

431
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:46,760
pressure and Z is the elevation in

432
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:51,760
kilometers and that's we are not using

433
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:56,559
this we just use it as a check for our

434
00:22:51,760 --> 00:23:00,000
calculation so this formula here is

435
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:04,120
these triangles on the spot

436
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,760
here which as you already see match

437
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:11,440
pretty well almost

438
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:15,520
exactly our uh estimate based on this

439
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:19,080
calculation here so uh by substituting

440
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:23,279
that by doing this integral which can be

441
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:25,000
done and then Computing the function CZ

442
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:28,080
and using the mole fraction I mean the

443
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:31,039
mole molecular weights you find the

444
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:33,440
partial pressures for example uh8 this

445
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:35,080
is the partial pressure of

446
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:39,320
nitrogen

447
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:39,320
zero elevation is a sea

448
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:46,000
level uh 3.4 is

449
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:50,400
manua and this is the top of Mount

450
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:57,600
Everest 8 point

451
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:59,880
uh uh forget now uh 8500 something uh uh

452
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:02,000
meters

453
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:05,640
so you see the pressure the partial

454
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:10,320
pressure of nitrogen goes down this is

455
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:10,320
oxygen it also goes

456
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:18,120
down and of course the sum of the two

457
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:21,200
plus the sum also of the others the

458
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:23,240
others argon and co2 have such low

459
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,480
partial pressures that they might in

460
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:29,480
order to visualize them I multiply them

461
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:31,919
by 60 for a factor of 60 for argon and a

462
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:34,399
factor of a th000 for

463
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:36,919
CO2 so this one is

464
00:24:34,399 --> 00:24:38,600
CO2 the green no I'm sorry this is the

465
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:45,320
green is

466
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:45,320
argon and the blue one is the uh is

467
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:53,279
CO2 this is the

468
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:57,039
value uh measured at U

469
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:59,440
manua but as you see at sea level the

470
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:02,520
value is much higher and that Mount

471
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,919
Everest is much lower these is these are

472
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,919
the mole

473
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:11,840
fractions but before we go to the mole

474
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,799
fractions you sum up the partial

475
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:16,440
pressures and you get the total pressure

476
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:19,320
which is this other

477
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:23,240
curve so the reason why at the top of

478
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:27,919
Mount Everest the air is

479
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:34,440
thin is twofold one is that U the main

480
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:34,440
one is that the pressure is about uh

481
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,159
um

482
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:43,240
three

483
00:25:39,159 --> 00:25:47,960
32 so it's 32% so every time you breathe

484
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:50,279
you you take in only uh in the volume of

485
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:54,440
of the lungs are more or less the same

486
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:56,760
so you take in one3 of the

487
00:25:54,440 --> 00:26:00,039
air

488
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:02,279
plus there is this the second order

489
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:06,200
effect which is has to do with the

490
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:09,720
molecular uh the the composition that is

491
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:14,960
you see the mole fraction of nitrogen

492
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:18,320
goes uh up and that of oxygen goes down

493
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:22,440
but see it goes down very

494
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:29,520
slightly and uh so you get instead of

495
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:29,520
21% you get maybe 20 or 19%

496
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:37,559
the effect is more important for CO2 the

497
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:40,320
mole fraction changes quite a bit with

498
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:43,720
elevation so if you measure

499
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:49,760
425 ppms at

500
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:49,760
manua at sea level it's over

501
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,279
500

502
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:59,640
okay now this uh

503
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:06,240
is just the beginning of course of

504
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:10,399
things that you can calculate along

505
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:13,480
these lines and so I wanted to point to

506
00:27:10,399 --> 00:27:17,960
you this website which is called climate

507
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:20,960
for you which contains a lot of um

508
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:22,760
measurements historical measurements of

509
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,640
CO2

510
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:28,159
temperatures uh all sorts of uh

511
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:31,880
comparisons so I'm not going to deta

512
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:34,640
dets of these plots only to show you

513
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:38,880
that I'm sure you've you've seen this

514
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:41,000
many times this is the CO2 going up

515
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,279
along the years this is from

516
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:50,480
19

517
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:55,480
55 to to the last month this is what

518
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:57,440
January and uh this is the uh various

519
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:59,240
ways to measure the the average

520
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,760
temperature

521
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:05,039
many Labs many universities have their

522
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:09,120
own ways of a averaging over six months

523
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:13,159
one one one month one year and so on so

524
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:16,760
you get uh smoothed lines or peaks in

525
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:19,880
any way this gives the the idea that the

526
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:22,399
temperature is indeed uh going

527
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:28,080
up

528
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:28,080
uh and of course uh um

529
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:37,679
not only the atmospheric temperature but

530
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:42,919
also this is the temperature of the

531
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:44,600
upper layers say the first 100 m of uh

532
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:47,120
the

533
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:50,799
oceans which is the layer in which there

534
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:56,519
is a lot of mixing due to

535
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:58,559
turbulence so it's an average um L where

536
00:28:56,519 --> 00:29:01,760
where of course

537
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:05,720
the reason I'm bringing this up is that

538
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:08,240
um between that layer and the

539
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:09,440
atmosphere there is a tendency to reach

540
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,600
Mutual

541
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:14,159
equilibrium for the various gases

542
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:19,720
including CO2 because

543
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:21,960
CO2 uh gets um dissolved in

544
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:26,240
water and

545
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:28,679
uh and then also CO2 being a higher

546
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:32,799
molecular weight molecule

547
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:35,159
has the tendency to go down so once it

548
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:38,120
uh reaches

549
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:41,159
uh the first the modeling of the first

550
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:44,559
layers are are are sort of Complicated

551
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:47,440
by the by the chemistry because CO2

552
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:51,159
gets gets um

553
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:53,880
ionized uh solvated in

554
00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:56,080
into bicarbonates and then carbonates

555
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:57,399
and so you you also need a chemical

556
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:02,200
equilibrium which is something that we

557
00:29:57,399 --> 00:30:07,840
have not done yet uh um but eventually

558
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:09,360
when you go at about 450 M of

559
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:15,279
depth

560
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:18,640
um CO2 becomes um Al liquid also so you

561
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:20,720
get a liquid liquid mixture and from

562
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:24,159
that point

563
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:26,240
on that uh

564
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:28,919
stratification uh formula that we

565
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:32,640
derived for liquids could be applied in

566
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:35,399
order to see how this the the CO2 uh

567
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:39,159
concentrates in the bottom layers of the

568
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:43,640
oceans where in fact there are literally

569
00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:48,120
uh Lakes of U of super critical

570
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:53,080
CO2 uh and it's actually a major place

571
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:56,000
where a lot of of the carbon in the in

572
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:56,000
the planet is

573
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:03,360
stored these other

574
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:08,840
uh plots represent U

575
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:08,840
compare uh this CO2

576
00:31:09,399 --> 00:31:14,320
oscillations uh with temperature of the

577
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:19,679
oceans and of the

578
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:23,080
atmosphere they also tend to um

579
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:27,320
show a sort of a

580
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:32,240
delay from the peaks in the uh

581
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:36,960
temperatures of the uh ocean and

582
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:39,000
atmosphere and the peaks in the CO2 so

583
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:43,320
many people are speculating about the

584
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,320
origin of this uh

585
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:50,720
um because as you know we of course by

586
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:54,080
burning uh fossil fuels we produce uh um

587
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:57,480
CO2 that goes into the atmosphere and a

588
00:31:54,080 --> 00:32:02,080
good part of that maybe half or almost I

589
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:05,760
let's say 40% of it goes uh into the

590
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,760
ocean through this

591
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:10,039
equilibrium

592
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:12,240
uh but of course we are concerned about

593
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:14,840
the amount that stays uh because it's a

594
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,840
greenhouse

595
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:22,880
gas actually just to mention that just

596
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:26,200
the other day there was a an article on

597
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:28,399
MIT u tech talk

598
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:30,880
or about

599
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:35,960
people concerned about this

600
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:37,320
new uh or or little mentioned gas which

601
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:40,919
is

602
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:45,240
24,000 uh times uh more powerful than

603
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:49,360
CO2 in terms of greenhouse gases which

604
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:54,120
is uh I think some sulfur as a fluoride

605
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:56,480
okay uh now that molecule though I I I

606
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:58,360
tried to to read quickly through that

607
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:01,080
article I couldn't find

608
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:03,399
uh they mention how much it's produced

609
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:06,919
by the various countries but it doesn't

610
00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:10,000
mention um the the concentrations how

611
00:33:06,919 --> 00:33:12,519
many ppms we have in the

612
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,320
atmosphere uh they also say that it is

613
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:20,000
very stable in the atmosphere I'm sure

614
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:23,960
uh they have U the reasons to to say

615
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:27,960
that on the other hand a heavy

616
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:30,679
molecule by gravity tends to go down so

617
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:34,200
so I haven't found yet I don't think

618
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:37,799
these people of the um the climate for

619
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:40,559
you website have already uh done

620
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:43,360
collected data about that particular

621
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:46,159
molecule but I'm sure that soon they

622
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:49,559
will because they're very they are very

623
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:51,320
keen at uh keeping updated with all the

624
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:53,399
various

625
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:58,760
news and

626
00:33:53,399 --> 00:34:03,440
also this graph or reports the uh solar

627
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:06,880
activity is measured by the sun spots

628
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:12,079
solar spots and

629
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:15,320
um uh there is a cyclic activity and uh

630
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:17,040
uh this activity is related to some

631
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:22,280
effects on the cosmic rays and the

632
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:24,480
formation of clouds so this also um a

633
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:29,000
lot of people

634
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:32,480
who uh study uh climate change

635
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,599
uh are are studing the connection

636
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:37,760
between

637
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:40,240
this kind of solar activity and uh the

638
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:43,720
clouds because the clouds as you know

639
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:46,560
are uh this the the source for cooling

640
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:48,399
in the of of the planet via the albo

641
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:51,240
because they reflect some of the light

642
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:54,720
away so by controlling

643
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:56,200
clouds uh cloud formation you could also

644
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:59,320
uh

645
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:02,560
control uh

646
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:04,920
global warming okay so enough for the

647
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,680
advertisement of this website which of

648
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:09,200
course it's not an advertisement but

649
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:13,359
it's simply uh mentioning because it's a

650
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:16,200
good source of uh uh scientific

651
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:18,520
data back to

652
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:20,320
stratification uh here's another problem

653
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:22,880
which is very similar to the one that

654
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:27,920
we've done with with

655
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:31,200
gravity which is uh centrifugal force

656
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:34,200
so if you have a fluid which is uh

657
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:36,640
static with respect to a rotating

658
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,640
reference

659
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:45,680
frame H you know that uh uh there is a a

660
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:48,839
force like gravity that uh that pushes

661
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:52,119
you uh pushes uh the heavy particles

662
00:35:48,839 --> 00:35:54,440
towards the the exterior

663
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:57,480
no and

664
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:59,520
U well it turns out that you can model

665
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:03,359
the this kind of U it's not really a

666
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:07,560
force it's it's a it is a

667
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:10,160
fictitious uh an apparent Force so

668
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:11,839
apparent force can be represented by a

669
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:15,520
negative potential

670
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:20,880
energy so if we assume an energy like

671
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:23,000
this and instead of mgz we use

672
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:26,920
um the mass

673
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:30,599
times the angular velocity times the r

674
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:33,560
squar this is the negative potential

675
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:36,040
energy we get a total potential which is

676
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:38,079
this negative

677
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:42,560
contribution and

678
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:44,560
then if we consider the uh Mutual

679
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:47,680
equilibrium between two layers at

680
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:50,599
different uh uh distance from the center

681
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:52,920
of uh the the axis of

682
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:55,720
rotation so you impose that the chemical

683
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:57,920
potential here and there are equal again

684
00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:00,520
we assume

685
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:05,400
um the mild effect of temperature but

686
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:05,400
not completely U uniform

687
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,760
temperature uh okay so we

688
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:20,000
do yeah we you go over the same

689
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:22,000
steps and here there's an error

690
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,839
definitely here because there should be

691
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:30,319
like

692
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:33,319
a 12 M Omega squar the RDR here I

693
00:37:30,319 --> 00:37:35,040
think so I need to correct that yeah

694
00:37:33,319 --> 00:37:38,079
it's something like

695
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:40,200
this uh so this is the the general one

696
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:44,400
that applies for all substance for all

697
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:46,560
for each substance of the mixture if you

698
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,599
don't have a mixture but a pure

699
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:51,160
substance you get an equivalent of the

700
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:54,160
beroni equation for the Statics for the

701
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:54,160
fluid Statics

702
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:59,000
here so here the pressure

703
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:05,000
goes again

704
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:06,520
exponentially as you go um down the

705
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,079
centrifugal

706
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:11,000
force there is no minus sign here so the

707
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:14,599
pressure goes

708
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:18,160
up it's opposite than the gravity

709
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:21,800
field for a gas and for a

710
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:28,880
liquid it goes up exponentially for the

711
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:31,319
gas and uh parabolically uh for a

712
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,760
liquid and then again you can apply the

713
00:38:31,319 --> 00:38:38,119
same formula to find the partial

714
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:41,440
pressures in gas mixtures or the or the

715
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:43,880
mole fractions in liquid mixtures I skip

716
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:48,200
the details because they are exactly

717
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:51,280
parallel and uh with with the case of

718
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:55,359
gravity I mention this because it's it

719
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:58,319
is an in energy uh in the energy

720
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:59,640
um uh business uh

721
00:38:58,319 --> 00:39:04,240
um

722
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:08,240
centrifuge are important um because they

723
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:11,880
are used for example to separate to

724
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:16,000
enrich uh the uranium from the natural

725
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:19,720
concentration in the isotop

726
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,839
233 which is the

727
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:27,440
file

728
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:30,000
nucleus which is 7 71 uh% you need to

729
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:33,520
take it up to three or three and a half%

730
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,040
depending on the reactors and uh and in

731
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:41,599
order to do

732
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:41,599
that you make this uh react with an exal

733
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:48,680
fluoride

734
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:51,000
um and then you you put them into these

735
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:54,440
U

736
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:57,200
centrifuges which separate the small

737
00:39:54,440 --> 00:40:02,440
difference between the molecular weight

738
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:04,720
of the 238 and the 238 35 and 38

739
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:06,880
isotopes that minute difference is

740
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:11,040
enough to separate the gas so you'll

741
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:16,480
find more of the 238 towards the uh

742
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:19,000
outside and uh and then uh of course

743
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:21,920
this is not completely static otherwise

744
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:24,880
uh you wouldn't have any you wouldn't

745
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:26,960
have any yield in the in the process so

746
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:29,319
you need to do the extraction and the

747
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:33,000
extraction ction complicates things

748
00:40:29,319 --> 00:40:35,240
because of secondary flows and so on so

749
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:39,160
these are just details but there is this

750
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:42,440
nice uh article in Scientific American

751
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:44,319
if you're interested that does all that

752
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:47,680
very well

753
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:50,400
explained and then you of course so you

754
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:53,839
have to

755
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:56,160
run one centrifug from one you get

756
00:40:53,839 --> 00:41:00,240
slightly enriched you put it in the next

757
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:02,599
uh uh uh stage and so on and this is how

758
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:06,440
many stages you need in order to OB

759
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:12,280
obtain a correct uh Cascade so that you

760
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:17,160
get 3% uranium uh 235 up here you can

761
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:20,440
you get depleted uranium just 2% from a

762
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:22,280
feed which is the natural uh

763
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:25,319
composition and then of course you'll

764
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:29,079
read about the fact that also these

765
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:32,400
depleted uranium uh as is problematic

766
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:36,839
because it's uh kept in some cylinders

767
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:40,880
somewhere near nearby this uh these uh

768
00:41:36,839 --> 00:41:42,839
separation plans and uh they sometimes

769
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:46,000
there are accidents also there because

770
00:41:42,839 --> 00:41:48,800
uh uh because these contain the steel

771
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,720
containers get rusted and so there is a

772
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:54,160
lot

773
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:58,000
of cost associated with uh not only the

774
00:41:54,160 --> 00:42:03,000
separation which is energy consuming

775
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,000
but also the keeping the sites

776
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:11,800
safe in spite of all these costs uh uh

777
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:15,319
the costs of nuclear energy is still

778
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:20,800
competitive very competitive and so many

779
00:42:15,319 --> 00:42:23,559
countries are uh using it and uh and of

780
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:26,119
course a good part of the investment is

781
00:42:23,559 --> 00:42:30,160
also into

782
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:32,880
uh doing some kind of control of the

783
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:35,880
management of the waste and the

784
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,880
byproducts and so

785
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:43,839
on uh and this cost can be huge just

786
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:48,920
mentioned for example that in in in

787
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:48,920
Italy uh we had a referendum in

788
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:56,599
1989 that banned all the nuclear power

789
00:42:52,680 --> 00:43:00,839
plants we had a few and one was already

790
00:42:56,599 --> 00:43:02,920
uh what just built and that one in order

791
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:07,119
to keep it uh

792
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:08,160
closed you it's cannot just close and

793
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:12,119
get

794
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:13,839
away it it still has after 40 years no

795
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:17,920
35

796
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:22,559
years it I think it is has about 200

797
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:22,559
people working there just to keep it

798
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:30,839
uh how do you say stopped I mean not

799
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:30,839
working okay

800
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:36,000
offline

801
00:43:33,559 --> 00:43:39,280
okay yeah there is

802
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:42,480
another very

803
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:45,200
similar uh problem that can be can then

804
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:49,920
be done with exactly the same logic that

805
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:53,119
we've done for gravity and uh um and

806
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:56,760
centrifugal uh field now this is for an

807
00:43:53,119 --> 00:44:00,079
electric field so and this is also gives

808
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:01,800
us the a a chance to introduce the

809
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:03,680
electrochemical potential

810
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:06,119
electrochemical potential is one in

811
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:08,680
which you have that

812
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:12,240
your uh fluid

813
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:15,040
Parcels uh also contain charged

814
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:17,680
particles so if we denote the partic the

815
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:23,079
charge by

816
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:27,559
Q okay the the Q the charge is given

817
00:44:23,079 --> 00:44:32,559
by how many particles of you have

818
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:35,079
times the charge per particle so Z is in

819
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:38,599
terms of the charge of the electron so

820
00:44:35,079 --> 00:44:38,599
for example

821
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:49,599
uh sodium plus is an ion that

822
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:53,040
has Z equal to + one because it has the

823
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:55,960
charge of an electron but of the

824
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:58,599
opposite sign so it's a plus one the the

825
00:44:55,960 --> 00:45:01,359
an electron as a

826
00:44:58,599 --> 00:45:05,480
charge uh minus

827
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:07,079
one Z is minus one for the electron and

828
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:10,480
F this

829
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:12,839
F is called the farad

830
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:17,119
constant and it is the

831
00:45:12,839 --> 00:45:19,119
charge of a mole of electrons so each

832
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:23,079
electron has a charge which is given by

833
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:25,839
this Ive reported the all these digits

834
00:45:23,079 --> 00:45:29,200
because um

835
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:31,440
uh uh a couple of years ago it has been

836
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:36,000
decided by the International System of

837
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:40,079
Units I I think by somebody uh that um

838
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:44,480
these are the digits to be used so there

839
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:48,520
is no uh Dots Dots Dots as they used to

840
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:51,599
be so and also for the avocados number

841
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:51,599
that's the number you should

842
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:58,400
use and this is also for for a Bossman

843
00:45:55,119 --> 00:46:02,280
constant all right so if you take uh an

844
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:06,319
Avogadro number of so multiply this

845
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:11,280
times this you get the farad constant

846
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:12,839
and the product is something like um

847
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,520
90

848
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:19,040
906

849
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:21,240
500 kums per mole something like

850
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:23,480
that uh

851
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:25,720
okay whereas of course you know that

852
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:27,760
remember that if you multiply avad

853
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:31,680
number times boltzman constant you get

854
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:31,680
the uh the gas

855
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:41,960
constant so it it should be it shouldn't

856
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:43,800
be it shouldn't be confused by the fact

857
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:45,440
that we call it the gas constant and

858
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:48,200
then then you apply it to liquids and

859
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:49,800
solids because after all it's just the

860
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:54,520
boltman

861
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:56,480
constant uh it also happens to play an

862
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:58,319
important role in gases but not only in

863
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:01,800
gases

864
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:07,119
so so quity calling it the gas constant

865
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:07,119
is a bit misleading and perhaps

866
00:47:07,319 --> 00:47:14,400
confusing anyway so this is the

867
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:18,280
charge of uh a

868
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:21,319
mixture with these many with these many

869
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:24,359
constituents and each one of them having

870
00:47:21,319 --> 00:47:27,640
a certain uh

871
00:47:24,359 --> 00:47:31,280
um uh partial char

872
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:33,119
charge okay and the energy that you have

873
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:36,680
to

874
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:41,760
add to the energy proper of the stable

875
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:45,040
equilibrium state of the uh non charged

876
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:47,200
components is equal to the charge times

877
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:51,440
the value of the

878
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:55,000
electrostatic field so Fe is the

879
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:57,319
field and as you remember from your

880
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:59,680
physics once you have a field

881
00:47:57,319 --> 00:48:03,160
conservative Fields you take the

882
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:04,559
gradient minus the gradient of the field

883
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:08,200
it gives you a vector because the

884
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:10,880
gradient is a vector operator and uh so

885
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:13,319
you apply it on on a field which varies

886
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:15,640
with with

887
00:48:13,319 --> 00:48:20,599
position and minus the gradient is

888
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:20,599
called the electric field it's

889
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:30,599
Vector so the Bold uh X is here so X

890
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:34,240
bold means XYZ it's a location in

891
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:37,040
space and and the Bold in these symbols

892
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:37,040
means that they are

893
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:43,640
vectors it's true that also these ns are

894
00:48:41,079 --> 00:48:46,559
also vectors but they are not vectors in

895
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:49,720
XYZ but it's simply a list of numbers so

896
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:52,520
yeah but I hope you not get confused by

897
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:52,520
these uh

898
00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:00,839
details okay

899
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:02,359
so when you do when you compute

900
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:05,280
conditions for Mutual

901
00:49:02,359 --> 00:49:07,520
equilibrium as usual we have this

902
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:10,640
derivative of energy with respect to the

903
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:13,839
amounts but also here the amounts now

904
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:15,079
are not only in this stable equilibrium

905
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:18,440
State

906
00:49:15,079 --> 00:49:22,040
non-charged part of the energy

907
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:24,880
of of your of your fluid Parcels but

908
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:27,720
it's also on this side and the charge

909
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:29,599
depends on the ends

910
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:31,680
so that's when you do the partial

911
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:32,720
derivative with respect to n you pick up

912
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:36,880
from

913
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:41,000
here as Z and

914
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:43,440
F which is then multiplied by the value

915
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:47,559
of the electrostatic

916
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:49,839
field and so this is the electrostatic

917
00:49:47,559 --> 00:49:53,599
contribution and this is the chemical

918
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:56,720
contribution and that's the total which

919
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:59,400
is in this business called Electro

920
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:02,760
chemical

921
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:04,240
potential all right so the an the the

922
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:07,680
analog of the problem that we've

923
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:08,720
considered so is that now you have an

924
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:12,119
electric

925
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:15,760
field so suppose you have some charges

926
00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:18,160
or charged um a mixture of

927
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:21,160
charges or charged

928
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:23,440
particles for example a solution in

929
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:28,640
which you have electrolytes

930
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:28,640
or and U in an electric field

931
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:35,799
okay so the electric field is directed I

932
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:38,640
made it for analogy like like a gravity

933
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:41,520
like the same direction of gravity so

934
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,520
that this is

935
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:48,559
X all right same logic apply the

936
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:51,280
equality of chemical potential between

937
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:51,280
these two

938
00:50:51,319 --> 00:50:57,319
layers using now this formula for the uh

939
00:50:55,079 --> 00:51:00,240
total potentials sorry I said chemical

940
00:50:57,319 --> 00:51:00,240
but it should be total

941
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:08,359
potentials and um after the details this

942
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:13,799
is what you obtain this is the

943
00:51:08,359 --> 00:51:15,520
expression specific volume DP RT times

944
00:51:13,799 --> 00:51:19,960
the derivative of the logarithm of the

945
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:22,119
mole fraction and here's a uh

946
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:25,760
contribution of

947
00:51:22,119 --> 00:51:28,640
the uh gradient of the electrostatic

948
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:32,720
field so this is uh minus the electric

949
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:32,720
field uh dotted into

950
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:41,599
DX this is true also for the pure

951
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:44,160
substance so you could you

952
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:47,799
have if you have a pure substance or

953
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:51,720
just one uh

954
00:51:47,799 --> 00:51:54,680
say charge in some electric field a

955
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:58,119
charge charge particles in electric

956
00:51:54,680 --> 00:52:00,680
field uh you get a equations which are

957
00:51:58,119 --> 00:52:03,160
similar to the ones we obtain for

958
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:07,000
Gravity but of course typically you

959
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:11,480
don't have only charges of one kind uh

960
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:14,079
you have mixtures of charges and uh so

961
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:17,960
this is the expression for the partial

962
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:20,720
pressures if they are in the uh gas uh

963
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:25,160
phase or if you are in

964
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:27,480
solution so if your charges are in in an

965
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:31,079
electro chemical

966
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:33,440
solution and you want to compute how the

967
00:52:31,079 --> 00:52:36,680
uh concentration

968
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:39,640
changes uh as you move along the

969
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:46,079
electric the direction of the electric

970
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:46,079
field uh this is the how this formula

971
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:53,119
integrates you can also do it for a

972
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,119
variable

973
00:52:54,040 --> 00:53:01,559
temperature okay for the simplest

974
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:05,520
example here U suppose you have uh the

975
00:53:01,559 --> 00:53:05,520
plates of

976
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:12,960
condenser or say an anode and a cathode

977
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:17,400
and you

978
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:19,319
have some charge carriers so particles

979
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:23,160
with charge that

980
00:53:19,319 --> 00:53:25,720
are uh between these two so if the

981
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:28,599
plates of the condenser are close enough

982
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:31,280
the electric field varies linearly from

983
00:53:28,599 --> 00:53:33,799
the values of the field in one plate and

984
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:38,200
the values on the other plate so you get

985
00:53:33,799 --> 00:53:40,200
a linear uh Fe so the electric field

986
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:42,599
which is the derivative the gradient is

987
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:44,680
the the X direction is the derivative

988
00:53:42,599 --> 00:53:47,960
with respect to

989
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,960
X is

990
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:54,599
constant

991
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:58,440
okay and uh and if you apply those

992
00:53:54,599 --> 00:53:58,440
formulas for for the liquid

993
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:03,480
case um the mole

994
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:14,640
fraction comes out to be

995
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:17,040
exponential so the the plus the positive

996
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:20,400
charges we have a concentration that

997
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:22,880
decays as you get uh far from the

998
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:25,400
negative uh

999
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:29,760
electrode because they like to stay near

1000
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:31,640
the negative and and the negative

1001
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:34,760
charges

1002
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:37,640
Decay uh exponentially as you go far

1003
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:42,119
from the positive

1004
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:42,119
electron okay all

1005
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:53,440
right so now we can move

1006
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:01,599
to another interesting topic that is the

1007
00:55:00,599 --> 00:55:05,640
one

1008
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:09,920
of uh what happens when

1009
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:09,920
mixtures of various

1010
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:18,160
components uh boil or

1011
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:18,160
condense or

1012
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,480
freeze

1013
00:55:21,799 --> 00:55:27,160
so we first going to do something with a

1014
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:29,680
ideal

1015
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:34,480
uh models and then we'll say something

1016
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:34,480
about um non ideal

1017
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:44,720
models you remember we talked about the

1018
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:47,720
lonard Jones potential I'm not spending

1019
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:50,039
much time on this again

1020
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:52,960
uh this can

1021
00:55:50,039 --> 00:55:56,359
be through molecular Dynamics or Monte

1022
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:57,720
Carlo uh numerical simulations

1023
00:55:56,359 --> 00:56:00,680
a way to

1024
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:02,960
model

1025
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:05,920
substances in

1026
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:09,680
fact you can model a pure

1027
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:14,400
substance with those just those

1028
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:18,400
parameters uh there are uh I

1029
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:21,200
think if not thousands of maybe hundreds

1030
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:24,240
of articles that have played this

1031
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:27,960
game in recent years because of of the

1032
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:30,680
advances in molecular Dynamics

1033
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:36,480
uh and um

1034
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:40,200
so you people have developed uh um this

1035
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:44,000
pseudo substance that is called lard

1036
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:45,039
jum okay so so it's the Leonard Jon's

1037
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:49,480
pure

1038
00:56:45,039 --> 00:56:53,799
substance where you you play with

1039
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:53,799
non-dimensionalized um

1040
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:58,920
properties for example this is the

1041
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:02,880
non-dimensionalized

1042
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:07,200
density uh it's number density so

1043
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:09,680
particles um per unit

1044
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:13,920
volume this is the

1045
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:13,920
non-dimensionalized uh

1046
00:57:17,839 --> 00:57:22,880
temperature

1047
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:25,160
and there has been a dispute for a while

1048
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:28,960
about what this

1049
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:31,640
um for example with the critical point

1050
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:34,160
is characterized but now if there is a

1051
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:36,839
very nice article in Wikipedia under

1052
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:40,640
this title so that's where I also took

1053
00:57:36,839 --> 00:57:44,119
these plots because they're very nice

1054
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:48,319
um which uh summarizes and

1055
00:57:44,119 --> 00:57:51,880
explains uh the details of these

1056
00:57:48,319 --> 00:57:55,799
calculations so the critical

1057
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:58,880
point uh of this fluid is given by it's

1058
00:57:55,799 --> 00:58:02,280
like a Universal fluid no so it's given

1059
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:06,319
by this U um these

1060
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:07,799
values so once you fix you take your

1061
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:10,079
substance and you think that your

1062
00:58:07,799 --> 00:58:13,520
substance is correctly described by a

1063
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:16,520
value of Epsilon and the value of

1064
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,520
Sigma

1065
00:58:16,599 --> 00:58:22,359
then uh you know that that substance

1066
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:24,960
will have this critical temperature this

1067
00:58:22,359 --> 00:58:27,839
critical pressure this critical volume

1068
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:31,359
so that means also that this is an a a

1069
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:34,359
way in which you can infer the

1070
00:58:31,359 --> 00:58:35,319
values of those epsilons and sigma for a

1071
00:58:34,359 --> 00:58:38,000
given

1072
00:58:35,319 --> 00:58:40,640
substance if you know the

1073
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:44,240
substance and uh

1074
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:45,839
you therefore know because people have

1075
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:47,359
measured the critical pressure and

1076
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:49,799
critical

1077
00:58:47,359 --> 00:58:53,319
temperature you can make a system of

1078
00:58:49,799 --> 00:58:55,760
these two equations and obtain uh the

1079
00:58:53,319 --> 00:58:57,280
Epsilon and the sigma that properly

1080
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:58,440
correct

1081
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:01,880
the

1082
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:05,039
properly get you to the critical values

1083
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:07,079
of t&p unfortunately these these there

1084
00:59:05,039 --> 00:59:10,480
are only two

1085
00:59:07,079 --> 00:59:14,400
parameters the Epsilon and sigma in this

1086
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:14,400
model so

1087
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:21,599
um they are not enough to make the model

1088
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:25,079
Universal

1089
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:28,440
because the most difficult one to to to

1090
00:59:25,079 --> 00:59:31,119
model is the is the volume the critical

1091
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:34,160
volume so if you match temperature and

1092
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:38,599
pressure then you're going to be likely

1093
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:38,599
of the critical volume in

1094
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:43,760
fact

1095
00:59:41,079 --> 00:59:46,079
uh for example if

1096
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:51,200
you if you

1097
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:53,920
compute PV over RT like the ratio the

1098
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:53,920
ideal gas

1099
00:59:54,319 --> 01:00:01,520
ratio uh at the critical

1100
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:06,039
point since these values are

1101
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:08,480
fixed uh you take this ratio it becomes

1102
01:00:06,039 --> 01:00:10,599
dimensionless this is called the

1103
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:13,720
compressibility uh

1104
01:00:10,599 --> 01:00:16,599
Factor typically denoted by

1105
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:22,920
z uh and

1106
01:00:16,599 --> 01:00:24,440
um for the lerum uh it's this is the

1107
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:28,520
number

1108
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:30,799
if this model was Universal it all

1109
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:34,319
substances would have this

1110
01:00:30,799 --> 01:00:36,960
number for the critical uh this critical

1111
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:41,000
ratio that's not really true because for

1112
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:44,480
example if you go uh water it's pretty

1113
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:49,720
off it's it's .23 instead of

1114
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:51,200
31 helium 4 it's 31 so it's pretty good

1115
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:54,440
argon

1116
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:58,280
also CO2 is

1117
01:00:54,440 --> 01:01:02,599
off okay so there is missing it this

1118
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:05,280
says that uh the Leonard Jones uh model

1119
01:01:02,599 --> 01:01:08,640
is incomplete it's a very good uh

1120
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:12,160
starting uh place but it's

1121
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:14,720
incomplete uh possibly due to the fact

1122
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:17,839
that especially when you get to the

1123
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:21,960
liquid phase the lard Jones considers

1124
01:01:17,839 --> 01:01:24,599
only pairwise interactions and uh

1125
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:27,160
instead when the molecules get close to

1126
01:01:24,599 --> 01:01:29,680
one another also three body interactions

1127
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:33,440
may become may may have a role and

1128
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:33,440
they're not accounted for in this

1129
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:41,680
model but you can predict uh uh

1130
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:44,760
condensation and boiling You can predict

1131
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:45,480
the fact that the the substance below

1132
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:49,079
the

1133
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:54,039
critical temperature doesn't like to

1134
01:01:49,079 --> 01:01:56,640
stay in certain uh in certain uh regions

1135
01:01:54,039 --> 01:02:00,200
so it it prefers to separate

1136
01:01:56,640 --> 01:02:03,640
into a liquid and the and a vapor

1137
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:05,599
phase and also it

1138
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:07,200
predicts pretty

1139
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:10,279
well

1140
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:12,559
uh the surface tension so you can

1141
01:02:10,279 --> 01:02:16,279
measure the surface

1142
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:19,480
tension for example here as a it shows

1143
01:02:16,279 --> 01:02:21,520
it as a function of temperature this is

1144
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:26,440
the interfacial

1145
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:30,240
energy uh of the molecules that live in

1146
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:33,240
between uh the liquid and the vapor on

1147
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:35,599
the other side so they are in a they in

1148
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:39,279
order to stay there which is a more

1149
01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:42,520
uncomfortable location to be uh they

1150
01:02:39,279 --> 01:02:44,920
have more energy so this is surface

1151
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:47,799
energy can be interpreted as the extra

1152
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:51,319
energy that the molecule needs to stay

1153
01:02:47,799 --> 01:02:51,319
in on the uh

1154
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:57,839
interface and which uh

1155
01:02:54,599 --> 01:02:57,839
therefore um

1156
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:09,279
okay uh also the triple

1157
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:12,599
point the triple point can be uh

1158
01:03:09,279 --> 01:03:16,200
computed and uh you um you can compute

1159
01:03:12,599 --> 01:03:20,279
the volumes at the triple point is you

1160
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:23,760
get the solid the liquid and the vapor

1161
01:03:20,279 --> 01:03:25,440
coexisting so you can compute at what

1162
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:26,640
what is the specific volume that they

1163
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:29,640
have

1164
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:29,640
is the volume of the

1165
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:35,599
solid you can compare the volume of the

1166
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:36,520
solid because these are after all it's a

1167
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:40,520
model

1168
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:43,640
of some kind of soft

1169
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:48,119
spheres and you want to compare how they

1170
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:52,319
fill uh the volume you know if you take

1171
01:03:48,119 --> 01:03:54,279
spheres and you try to pack them in a

1172
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:56,400
given

1173
01:03:54,279 --> 01:03:58,240
volume you're not going to fill the

1174
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:01,359
entire volume because of course there is

1175
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:06,079
a the void between one and the other so

1176
01:04:01,359 --> 01:04:10,279
you can you can do um perfect

1177
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:13,440
packing uh and the perfect packing has

1178
01:04:10,279 --> 01:04:13,440
uh let's see where is

1179
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:24,599
that I didn't write it

1180
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:27,440
here yeah here the the volume of a

1181
01:04:24,599 --> 01:04:31,480
completely packed sphere spheres is this

1182
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:34,079
one is 1/ the < TK of two time the

1183
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:34,079
volume of the

1184
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:42,599
particles so it means that the other 30%

1185
01:04:40,119 --> 01:04:45,319
of the volume is is the empty space

1186
01:04:42,599 --> 01:04:48,839
between the various spheres

1187
01:04:45,319 --> 01:04:53,240
okay so here the triple

1188
01:04:48,839 --> 01:04:59,279
point the model predicts that the

1189
01:04:53,240 --> 01:05:03,760
solid has is not completely packed is

1190
01:04:59,279 --> 01:05:05,480
1.5 the completely packed volume the

1191
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:11,920
liquid is

1192
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:11,920
1.7 is better packed than the uh than

1193
01:05:14,039 --> 01:05:21,240
the uh than the solid and of course in

1194
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:24,400
the

1195
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:28,599
vapor the vapor

1196
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:31,599
is as much higher volume per

1197
01:05:28,599 --> 01:05:31,599
particle

1198
01:05:33,079 --> 01:05:38,559
800 okay

1199
01:05:35,279 --> 01:05:43,079
here if you

1200
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:46,960
compute uh the compressibility

1201
01:05:43,079 --> 01:05:49,839
factor for the vapor at the triple point

1202
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:52,160
you find that it is approximately one

1203
01:05:49,839 --> 01:05:56,799
very close to one that means that

1204
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:59,920
already there that there uh the the the

1205
01:05:56,799 --> 01:06:04,960
the vapor behaves pretty much as a as a

1206
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:04,960
an ideal gas because you see PV equals

1207
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:08,720
RT

1208
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:18,200
okay and then by

1209
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:21,720
um these are plots that show uh

1210
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:25,880
what what other parameters you can play

1211
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:28,720
with in order to adjust but also to make

1212
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:32,839
the numerical calculation let less uh

1213
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:35,960
heavy for example by uh

1214
01:06:32,839 --> 01:06:40,000
truncating uh the

1215
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:42,920
um the potential and saying well beyond

1216
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:45,640
a certain distance instead of having

1217
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:48,440
small digits I just put it zero okay

1218
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:53,119
that that makes that induces some errors

1219
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:56,440
and this kind of er maybe errors but may

1220
01:06:53,119 --> 01:06:56,440
also be

1221
01:06:56,559 --> 01:07:02,760
uh considered as

1222
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:05,839
a as an additional tool with which you

1223
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:11,079
you can have you can gain that extra

1224
01:07:05,839 --> 01:07:16,160
parameters to play so as to fit also the

1225
01:07:11,079 --> 01:07:19,799
volume okay all right so this is one um

1226
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:19,799
this is the numerical uh

1227
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:27,520
world in

1228
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:27,520
the in the old time

1229
01:07:28,599 --> 01:07:33,279
uh

1230
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:38,799
the

1231
01:07:33,279 --> 01:07:42,000
physics U couldn't enjoy these numerical

1232
01:07:38,799 --> 01:07:46,039
possibilities and so there was a lot of

1233
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:48,520
uh of physical thinking and wonderer

1234
01:07:46,039 --> 01:07:52,279
WS in his PhD

1235
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:53,680
thesis for which he got the Nobel Prize

1236
01:07:52,279 --> 01:07:57,760
in

1237
01:07:53,680 --> 01:08:00,279
1910 uh developed this simple model with

1238
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:00,279
again two

1239
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:05,680
parameters only two parameters like lner

1240
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:13,799
Jones

1241
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:16,559
B is the co volume so it's related to

1242
01:08:13,799 --> 01:08:16,559
Sigma

1243
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:24,600
say and uh a is related to the force of

1244
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:26,159
attraction so it's related to the

1245
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:28,799
Epsilon

1246
01:08:26,159 --> 01:08:28,799
of the Leonard

1247
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:37,560
jnes and this is the two ways of writing

1248
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:40,920
the Vander vals equation of state which

1249
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:44,359
is a an improvement with respect to uh

1250
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:48,480
the ideal gas law if you set a equals z

1251
01:08:44,359 --> 01:08:48,480
and b equals z you get PV equals

1252
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:54,920
RT which accounts also for the

1253
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:56,920
attractive forces and for the fact that

1254
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:59,679
the volume of available to the molecules

1255
01:08:56,920 --> 01:09:03,080
and is not the entire volume because

1256
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:05,000
especially in the liquid phase uh the

1257
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:08,440
volumes them themselves I mean the

1258
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:10,239
particles themselves U occupy some

1259
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:13,279
volume and so that's not volume

1260
01:09:10,239 --> 01:09:13,279
available for the other

1261
01:09:13,839 --> 01:09:20,400
particles so that's the physical

1262
01:09:16,199 --> 01:09:22,600
intuition behind this once you have an

1263
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:25,719
an expression like this which is an

1264
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:29,480
equation of state so we have a function

1265
01:09:25,719 --> 01:09:31,799
of volume between volume pressure and

1266
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:34,520
temperature as you remember from the

1267
01:09:31,799 --> 01:09:36,480
pre-initial lectures you can compute the

1268
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:40,040
compressibilities

1269
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:44,359
uh the coefficient of the this is

1270
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:48,359
isothermal compressibility the isobaric

1271
01:09:44,359 --> 01:09:51,080
expansion uh you which enter also in the

1272
01:09:48,359 --> 01:09:53,960
Meer relation which gives you the

1273
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:56,840
difference between the spec specific

1274
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:59,719
heat at constant pressure and constant

1275
01:09:56,840 --> 01:10:02,679
volume so by doing those

1276
01:09:59,719 --> 01:10:05,840
derivatives with this equation of

1277
01:10:02,679 --> 01:10:09,560
State here is what you

1278
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:14,159
get for example in a limit uh for Vapor

1279
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:17,600
states in the limit not the ideal gas

1280
01:10:14,159 --> 01:10:19,320
limit Min the limit of

1281
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:23,960
uh

1282
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:26,480
vapor in such a way that um the the co

1283
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:28,600
volume is the so the volume available to

1284
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:33,520
the particles is much greater than the

1285
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:33,520
co volume and also the particles

1286
01:10:33,719 --> 01:10:39,199
leave far away from from each other so

1287
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:41,000
that the attraction is also

1288
01:10:39,199 --> 01:10:42,719
small

1289
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:44,360
then

1290
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:47,920
this

1291
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:51,360
approximate you get an ideal equation of

1292
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:56,640
State you get CP minus CV equals R so

1293
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:56,640
that's the Maya relation for ideal gases

1294
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:02,480
uh you don't get exactly zero for these

1295
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:05,920
things so you get

1296
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:10,440
Corrections which are useful to to

1297
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:12,400
represent non ideal gas

1298
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:14,600
behavior for

1299
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:16,520
example this is the jewel Thompson

1300
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:18,480
coefficient which is the derivative of

1301
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:21,679
temperature with respect to pressure at

1302
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:25,320
constant enthalpy which is useful when

1303
01:11:21,679 --> 01:11:28,480
you expand a gas in a throttle to

1304
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:30,960
compute whether it is going to heat up

1305
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:30,960
or cool

1306
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:41,040
down well or you can

1307
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:46,080
also

1308
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:46,080
compute um the critical

1309
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:52,360
point because as I will show in a moment

1310
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:53,840
or actually let me show it now if you

1311
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:56,199
draw the

1312
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:59,679
isoterm for example at constant temps

1313
01:11:56,199 --> 01:12:02,280
this is a pressure versus volume diagram

1314
01:11:59,679 --> 01:12:07,080
and these are the

1315
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:10,040
isoterm so in the ideal gas uh uh State

1316
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:12,480
PV equals RT so if T is constant PV

1317
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:14,239
equals constant so this is would be an

1318
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:18,400
equation of a

1319
01:12:14,239 --> 01:12:22,280
hyperbola okay as you see as you go uh

1320
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:27,600
lower in in temperature and also in

1321
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:27,600
pressure these isotherms get

1322
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:34,480
distorted and uh at one stage there is

1323
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:38,280
one isoterm which we call the critical

1324
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:41,239
isotherm in which there is a

1325
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:45,320
um in which the the first order

1326
01:12:41,239 --> 01:12:45,320
derivative goes to zero and you have a a

1327
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:55,679
flex but you can apply the model also

1328
01:12:51,719 --> 01:13:00,560
below that so this is what theand Val

1329
01:12:55,679 --> 01:13:03,320
isotherms would would look like okay it

1330
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:03,320
goes up and

1331
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:10,320
down now if you remember when we did the

1332
01:13:07,159 --> 01:13:10,320
the chatelier brown

1333
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:16,600
principle we found that

1334
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:19,280
the compressibility one of the one of

1335
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:22,560
the stability conditions

1336
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:24,679
were uh that the his compressibility is

1337
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:26,880
greater than zero and therefore the the

1338
01:13:24,679 --> 01:13:29,159
derivative the first derivative along an

1339
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:32,400
isoterm so constant

1340
01:13:29,159 --> 01:13:34,679
T the derivative of p with respect to V

1341
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:37,480
which is the slope of these

1342
01:13:34,679 --> 01:13:40,560
curves should be

1343
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:44,199
negative so here yeah it goes down it's

1344
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:46,560
negative here it goes down it's negative

1345
01:13:44,199 --> 01:13:49,960
negative here it goes to

1346
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:52,199
zero and then the derivative goes up

1347
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:55,320
positive positive positive until here

1348
01:13:52,199 --> 01:13:56,960
and then it keeps going down so the this

1349
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:59,800
region here where the

1350
01:13:56,960 --> 01:14:03,639
derivative of the isoterm is where the

1351
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:07,920
slope is negative does not satisfy this

1352
01:14:03,639 --> 01:14:11,520
uh stability Condition it's an unstable

1353
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:14,400
situation that's the situation in which

1354
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:17,440
your particles don't like to stay and

1355
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:19,080
they prefer to separate into a dense

1356
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:21,639
phase and

1357
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:24,639
into a non-dense phase which is the

1358
01:14:21,639 --> 01:14:24,639
vapor

1359
01:14:27,239 --> 01:14:32,600
Now using going back to the previous

1360
01:14:29,239 --> 01:14:35,080
slide using

1361
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:38,120
the

1362
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:40,560
uh the model we can also compute the

1363
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:40,560
chemical

1364
01:14:42,239 --> 01:14:47,280
potential chemical potential is

1365
01:14:45,159 --> 01:14:51,480
important

1366
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:54,000
because for example when we have uh

1367
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:56,440
Mutual equilibrium between

1368
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:59,239
phases we need the quality of chemical

1369
01:14:56,440 --> 01:15:00,840
potential so even for the pure substance

1370
01:14:59,239 --> 01:15:02,639
if you have the liquid and the vapor in

1371
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:05,080
mutual equilibrium they have to have the

1372
01:15:02,639 --> 01:15:09,239
the chemical potential equality of

1373
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:09,239
chemical potential not only temperature

1374
01:15:09,679 --> 01:15:16,600
pressure so you can compute the chemical

1375
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:18,920
potential with the Vander vales

1376
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:22,159
model by

1377
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:26,000
integrating the usual derivative that we

1378
01:15:22,159 --> 01:15:28,440
use often the derivative of mu to P is

1379
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:33,120
equal to the specific

1380
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:36,840
volume so mu is equal to you integrate

1381
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:39,520
over over um over pressure

1382
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:42,600
so you have an integration constant

1383
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:43,520
which depends on temperature only and

1384
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:49,960
then an

1385
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:53,040
integral from uh of of V uh in

1386
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:55,960
DP then you can inte do this integral by

1387
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:57,960
part so this could be also PV minus

1388
01:15:55,960 --> 01:16:01,080
integral of p in

1389
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:04,840
DV and since

1390
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:07,639
p is given here by the V vales equation

1391
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:07,639
you can do that

1392
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:13,800
integral and the result is that the

1393
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:17,360
chemical potential is a constant of

1394
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:22,080
integration times a function of T and

1395
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:22,080
V this function of tnv

1396
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:33,440
we don't know that

1397
01:16:28,639 --> 01:16:38,000
constant C of T but we can reason even

1398
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:38,000
without knowing knowing it

1399
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:45,280
uh

1400
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:48,199
by using the fact that we know that when

1401
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:49,880
you have liquid and Vapor in equilibrium

1402
01:16:48,199 --> 01:16:51,520
the chemical potentials of the two

1403
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:55,239
phases must be

1404
01:16:51,520 --> 01:17:00,320
equal not only but also the pressure and

1405
01:16:55,239 --> 01:17:02,600
the temperature so if I have a uh so I

1406
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:07,000
have two conditions equality of

1407
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:07,000
pressure so PF is equal to

1408
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:15,159
PG and that's the saturation pressure

1409
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:17,679
that's what we call the saturation

1410
01:17:15,159 --> 01:17:19,400
pressure when we have a liquid and a

1411
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:22,000
vapor in

1412
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:25,800
equilibrium so that gives us by

1413
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:29,120
substituting here PD p vdv v with w

1414
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:30,520
means substituting this expression here

1415
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:34,679
for the

1416
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:34,679
pressure uh so we get one

1417
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:42,960
equation where the unknowns are two uh

1418
01:17:39,159 --> 01:17:46,560
it's the volume of the uh liquid phase

1419
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:51,199
and the volume of the vapor

1420
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:51,199
phase the temperature is a

1421
01:17:52,159 --> 01:17:58,239
given okay so that's condition one

1422
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:59,840
equation that derives from the condition

1423
01:17:58,239 --> 01:18:03,440
of equality of

1424
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:06,719
pressures then equality of chemical

1425
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:09,360
potentials says that the chemical

1426
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:14,080
potential at of the liquid is equal to

1427
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:15,360
that of the vapor so you see the the

1428
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:19,320
constant of

1429
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:20,920
integration uh goes away and you have

1430
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:23,360
this

1431
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:26,520
equality where the function f is this

1432
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:29,520
function here so now I have a system of

1433
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:32,199
two equations for a given temperature

1434
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:37,080
from which we can solve for the specific

1435
01:18:32,199 --> 01:18:37,080
volumes of the two phases in mutual

1436
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:49,040
equilibrium and so once I have uh

1437
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:54,480
computed that volume either VG or VF I

1438
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:54,480
can you I can compute this function f

1439
01:18:55,120 --> 01:19:00,800
and I can express the chemical

1440
01:19:01,239 --> 01:19:05,040
potential or actually the difference

1441
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:08,120
between the chemical potential and the

1442
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:08,120
chemical potential at

1443
01:19:08,159 --> 01:19:14,679
saturation as F minus so in other words

1444
01:19:12,239 --> 01:19:17,239
I'm using I'm using the chemical

1445
01:19:14,679 --> 01:19:19,920
potential as saturation to express this

1446
01:19:17,239 --> 01:19:23,159
integration Conant constant see so this

1447
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:27,239
is what is done on this other

1448
01:19:23,159 --> 01:19:30,080
graph we plot mu minus

1449
01:19:27,239 --> 01:19:36,480
muat so essentially that it is that

1450
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:39,120
function f TV minus F at T

1451
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:42,840
VG okay it is a

1452
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:45,960
function of

1453
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:49,920
temperature and

1454
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:53,239
uh and volume and so on so for an

1455
01:19:49,920 --> 01:20:01,199
isoterm here's how they

1456
01:19:53,239 --> 01:20:01,199
look if I am above uh the critical

1457
01:20:01,239 --> 01:20:08,840
point it's uh it's a continuous uh

1458
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:08,840
monotone

1459
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:17,480
function but when we get to the critical

1460
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:22,719
point we get to uh the beginning of

1461
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:22,719
something that is uh uh kind of a

1462
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:28,400
discontinuity let's look at it

1463
01:20:25,199 --> 01:20:33,760
uh far away from the from the critical

1464
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:37,000
point so let's look at it for this

1465
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:37,000
isotherm this

1466
01:20:37,239 --> 01:20:46,400
one okay so the chemical

1467
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:49,280
potential goes like that it gets to this

1468
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:51,920
point where it crosses the chemical

1469
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:55,239
potential for the vapor so it's the one

1470
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:57,239
computed from the other side

1471
01:20:55,239 --> 01:20:59,639
at this point here the two chemical

1472
01:20:57,239 --> 01:21:01,280
potentials are equal the pressures are

1473
01:20:59,639 --> 01:21:04,920
equal the temperature are equal so that

1474
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:04,920
is the stable equilibrium

1475
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:11,320
State and it corresponds to having vapor

1476
01:21:09,159 --> 01:21:13,760
in these conditions with this specific

1477
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:16,679
volume and liquid in that condition

1478
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:21,040
that's the saturated

1479
01:21:16,679 --> 01:21:24,320
liquid okay that's how the mixture likes

1480
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:26,440
to separate this is the stable situation

1481
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:28,639
our however you see that this Vander

1482
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:30,480
vales curve

1483
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:32,120
curves

1484
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:34,400
continue

1485
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:39,199
down continue

1486
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:41,920
down without violating the stability

1487
01:21:39,199 --> 01:21:44,639
condition the derivative this derivative

1488
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:47,800
here is still

1489
01:21:44,639 --> 01:21:51,480
negative so these are

1490
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:54,199
still somewhat stable they're not fully

1491
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:56,520
stable but they are somewhat stable

1492
01:21:54,199 --> 01:21:56,520
they're

1493
01:21:57,440 --> 01:22:03,920
stable and also on this other side here

1494
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:06,120
the derivative is negative and they

1495
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:09,159
corresponds to this branch of the

1496
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:10,679
chemical potentials that goes up

1497
01:22:09,159 --> 01:22:15,840
there

1498
01:22:10,679 --> 01:22:18,840
then you get a switch in which the uh

1499
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:22,040
the derivatives of the pressure the

1500
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:25,239
stability condition gets violated and it

1501
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:27,880
corresponds to this

1502
01:22:25,239 --> 01:22:31,280
this is what happens to the chemical

1503
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:34,960
potentials so for example if I wanted to

1504
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:37,760
if I plot that um the thing a bit

1505
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:37,760
enlarged

1506
01:22:40,679 --> 01:22:45,560
here

1507
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:50,199
okay and let me

1508
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:50,199
consider this value of pressure I have

1509
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:55,400
three three chemical three values of the

1510
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:59,239
chemical po potential so the chemical

1511
01:22:55,400 --> 01:23:02,280
potential for the Vander vales has three

1512
01:22:59,239 --> 01:23:02,280
uh has three

1513
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:13,880
values and uh notice that

1514
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:16,239
we here we're plotting mu minus mu

1515
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:18,159
sat and remember that for a pure

1516
01:23:16,239 --> 01:23:20,639
substance the chemical potential is the

1517
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:20,639
Gibs free

1518
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:28,960
energy

1519
01:23:23,239 --> 01:23:31,080
so uh this one is of the three uh points

1520
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:33,520
is the one that has the minimum GS free

1521
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:37,920
energy that

1522
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:37,920
corresponds to the stable equilibrium

1523
01:23:42,639 --> 01:23:50,040
State and the stability condition is met

1524
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:55,199
by first of all having that the the

1525
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:56,679
derivative of thep DV constant T is

1526
01:23:55,199 --> 01:24:01,480
uh

1527
01:23:56,679 --> 01:24:03,560
negative and second the condition of

1528
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:08,840
equality

1529
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:08,840
of mutual equilibrium between the two

1530
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:19,040
phases this other one the intermediate

1531
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:19,040
stage State uh is a metast

1532
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:28,639
stable it satisfy is only the condition

1533
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:28,639
that the

1534
01:24:28,719 --> 01:24:35,760
pdv is less than zero but not the

1535
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:38,040
equality of chemical

1536
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:40,280
potentials and this one this other one

1537
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:40,280
is

1538
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:49,159
unstable because it doesn't satisfy

1539
01:24:46,199 --> 01:24:52,000
that so what's the what's the meta

1540
01:24:49,159 --> 01:24:56,119
stable what what's the meta stable

1541
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:58,480
situation somewhere here

1542
01:24:56,119 --> 01:25:01,920
if I'm somewhere

1543
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:01,920
here I have a

1544
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:05,880
liquid

1545
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:09,600
that

1546
01:25:11,159 --> 01:25:20,280
uh doesn't real doesn't realize yet that

1547
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:20,280
it would be more stable by

1548
01:25:22,159 --> 01:25:26,320
evaporating or maybe a liquid

1549
01:25:26,360 --> 01:25:34,840
that in order to

1550
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:37,840
evaporate needs to form the first little

1551
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:39,760
bubble and forming a

1552
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:42,560
bubble in a

1553
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:44,800
liquid requires energy because you

1554
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:48,280
require the surface energy the

1555
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:50,960
interfacial energy so you need you need

1556
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:50,960
energy to do

1557
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:58,119
that uh and that is why

1558
01:25:55,159 --> 01:25:59,800
these meta stable states are feasible in

1559
01:25:58,119 --> 01:26:04,480
practicing

1560
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:09,520
experimentally if you manage to

1561
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:10,960
U for example here you you have a liquid

1562
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:14,040
which is

1563
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:16,679
um in stable conditions at the given

1564
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:20,719
temperature and then you lower the

1565
01:26:16,679 --> 01:26:25,800
pressure so you decrease the

1566
01:26:20,719 --> 01:26:27,880
pressure uh suddenly uh then you your

1567
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:30,600
liquid finds itself at the lower

1568
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:34,040
pressure the same temperature down

1569
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:36,840
here it it is super heated with respect

1570
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:40,280
to that uh

1571
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:44,440
pressure and uh therefore its stable

1572
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:46,600
situation would be to uh U to become to

1573
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:48,800
evaporate but in order to evaporate it

1574
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:52,679
needs some some energy to form that

1575
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:55,679
interfacial that that that initial uh

1576
01:26:52,679 --> 01:26:55,679
bubble

1577
01:26:56,880 --> 01:27:03,400
ER and in fact the moment it uh it gets

1578
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:06,920
that energy maybe from some noise from

1579
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:11,280
some vibration from some uh cosmic ray

1580
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:14,960
or or particle that uh uh provides that

1581
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:18,880
uh energy to to form that

1582
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:23,400
surface what happens you

1583
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:25,520
see consider it again a a a plot having

1584
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:28,560
to do with

1585
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:31,800
uh gives free energy this state here

1586
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:34,320
with respect to the stable state has

1587
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:36,280
this much

1588
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:39,719
extra free

1589
01:27:36,280 --> 01:27:42,159
energy because because uh that's uh

1590
01:27:39,719 --> 01:27:44,880
that's the metastable state so this

1591
01:27:42,159 --> 01:27:44,880
extra free

1592
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:52,000
energy is there

1593
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:54,840
uh the moment you have provided the

1594
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:59,159
initial trigger to nuclear the first

1595
01:27:54,840 --> 01:28:03,480
bubble then uh it becomes an explosive

1596
01:27:59,159 --> 01:28:08,119
uh process the the the collapse

1597
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:13,400
from uh from the liquid to the vapor

1598
01:28:08,119 --> 01:28:16,719
because uh all this free energy is there

1599
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:19,600
available is made available to form

1600
01:28:16,719 --> 01:28:23,040
additional uh surface additional Bubbles

1601
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:26,119
and and all that so you only need to

1602
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:28,560
tell the the the the liquid that it is

1603
01:28:26,119 --> 01:28:33,400
in in that metastable state and it will

1604
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:36,080
start uh and burst into so and the same

1605
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:36,080
is on the other

1606
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:40,960
side on the other side if you are

1607
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:50,480
here okay so this because this was a

1608
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:56,760
liquid and this is the

1609
01:28:57,280 --> 01:29:01,800
vapor the same

1610
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:05,360
here here is the metast stable this is

1611
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:05,360
the unstable and this is the

1612
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:14,920
stable see you get this

1613
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:18,360
much free energy as soon as you have uh

1614
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:21,199
uh actually I think I I

1615
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:24,560
misspoke you have to to turn around all

1616
01:29:21,199 --> 01:29:26,320
what I said because when I'm here

1617
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:29,840
this was the

1618
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:32,440
vapor this is the vapor up to here so

1619
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:34,679
this is the metastable vapor and the

1620
01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:36,639
what I said before had to do with the

1621
01:29:34,679 --> 01:29:38,480
liquid so the liquid is here so this is

1622
01:29:36,639 --> 01:29:43,760
the metastable

1623
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:48,760
liquid let me write the metastable

1624
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:48,760
paper and this is instead

1625
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:55,119
metastable uh liquid

1626
01:29:56,239 --> 01:30:04,239
also here so this is the unstable also

1627
01:29:59,679 --> 01:30:05,920
here you get um so so for the vapor you

1628
01:30:04,239 --> 01:30:09,239
get again

1629
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:11,960
the now uh for the vapor of course the

1630
01:30:09,239 --> 01:30:15,320
energy is not needed to form the the

1631
01:30:11,960 --> 01:30:15,320
first bubble but the first

1632
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:22,960
drop and as soon as you form the first

1633
01:30:18,719 --> 01:30:25,639
one and the the the the system realizes

1634
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:27,360
that there is a a more stable state it

1635
01:30:25,639 --> 01:30:30,119
will use all the free energy to

1636
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:33,440
redistribute fast the the the that free

1637
01:30:30,119 --> 01:30:39,040
energy in order to form the the surface

1638
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:39,040
that is needed to form those uh um those

1639
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:44,520
um those drops in order to

1640
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:54,239
condense now

1641
01:30:50,239 --> 01:30:54,239
this phenomena

1642
01:30:55,520 --> 01:31:02,639
have been worth uh another two Nobel

1643
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:03,880
prizes so one is the the one by Wilson

1644
01:31:02,639 --> 01:31:06,960
who

1645
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:10,679
invented this method it's called the

1646
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:13,280
cloud chamber and the other two Glazer

1647
01:31:10,679 --> 01:31:17,840
the bubble chamber these are

1648
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:17,840
both um ways

1649
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:24,080
to uh

1650
01:31:21,480 --> 01:31:25,880
detect uh

1651
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:28,480
Elementary

1652
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:32,600
particles these were the initial ways in

1653
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:36,639
which you could I think also somehow

1654
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:38,719
similar um ideas are used today in more

1655
01:31:36,639 --> 01:31:43,760
modern

1656
01:31:38,719 --> 01:31:47,520
um detectors but uh uh see what what

1657
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:47,520
happens is that you in the cloud

1658
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:52,080
chamber

1659
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:56,480
you you form a

1660
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:58,679
subcooled metast stable Vaper so you you

1661
01:31:56,480 --> 01:32:00,800
form something like

1662
01:31:58,679 --> 01:32:04,960
that and in

1663
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:08,880
the um bubble chamber instead you form a

1664
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:11,440
a superheated uh liquid so they are sort

1665
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:13,159
of

1666
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:16,520
symmetrical

1667
01:32:13,159 --> 01:32:16,520
um uh

1668
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:24,320
devices and then you

1669
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:28,239
wait for the

1670
01:32:24,320 --> 01:32:30,239
particles that uh um you want to measure

1671
01:32:28,239 --> 01:32:34,199
you want to

1672
01:32:30,239 --> 01:32:35,440
visualize these particles deposit energy

1673
01:32:34,199 --> 01:32:38,360
typically they

1674
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:42,080
ionize uh the the liquid or the vapor in

1675
01:32:38,360 --> 01:32:45,760
which they they they travel and that

1676
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:49,520
ionization energy is what triggers the

1677
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:55,639
formation of either the uh

1678
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:58,400
um the the the bubbles or the the um of

1679
01:32:55,639 --> 01:33:03,239
the vapor um or the

1680
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:07,280
drops so in this case you form little

1681
01:33:03,239 --> 01:33:10,920
drops uh like the drops that you see in

1682
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:11,719
in the clouds in fact this is the the

1683
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:15,600
same

1684
01:33:11,719 --> 01:33:18,880
phenomenon whereby Cloud some part of

1685
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:22,560
cloud formation is triggered by cosmic

1686
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:24,320
rays we are as you know the Earth is

1687
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:25,400
continuously uh

1688
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:31,880
hit

1689
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:34,000
by flux of cosmic rays these are Char

1690
01:33:31,880 --> 01:33:36,080
particles with a lot of energy that come

1691
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:38,719
and when they hit the atmosphere they

1692
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:39,880
provide the atmosphere is has some water

1693
01:33:38,719 --> 01:33:42,920
vapor in

1694
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:49,159
it but that water vapor didn't have

1695
01:33:42,920 --> 01:33:50,760
enough uh um energy to um form uh the

1696
01:33:49,159 --> 01:33:54,639
the droplets that

1697
01:33:50,760 --> 01:33:56,639
to the cosmic race provide the that uh

1698
01:33:54,639 --> 01:34:01,679
uh energy and that triggers the

1699
01:33:56,639 --> 01:34:01,679
formation of of of the clouds in that

1700
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:07,639
neighborhoods and here it is the same

1701
01:34:06,520 --> 01:34:11,080
then

1702
01:34:07,639 --> 01:34:14,440
after of course this um you then you

1703
01:34:11,080 --> 01:34:17,159
have to to light to put the light in a

1704
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:20,840
in particular way so that you you you

1705
01:34:17,159 --> 01:34:25,719
visualize these traces these um uh

1706
01:34:20,840 --> 01:34:25,719
trains of uh uh uh

1707
01:34:25,960 --> 01:34:34,840
of droplets that have formed

1708
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:34,840
okay

1709
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:39,480
okay

1710
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:42,400
okay so

1711
01:34:39,480 --> 01:34:47,840
the the last thing on the Vander valves

1712
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:49,960
uh is well okay then what happens if we

1713
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:54,360
instead

1714
01:34:49,960 --> 01:34:54,360
are in the unstable

1715
01:34:55,239 --> 01:34:58,159
so suppose you

1716
01:34:59,639 --> 01:35:08,880
start from an unstable suppose you you

1717
01:35:02,840 --> 01:35:08,880
manage to uh so how can you how can

1718
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:12,880
you do this

1719
01:35:11,239 --> 01:35:17,920
U

1720
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:17,920
prepare a sample in a state which is

1721
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:24,800
unstable well you have to do it

1722
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:28,880
quickly for example

1723
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:33,679
uh you remember this is the pressure so

1724
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:33,679
you can go uh very quickly down in

1725
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:40,239
pressure and therefore you're uh so from

1726
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:44,159
Super critical or from above the

1727
01:35:40,239 --> 01:35:47,920
saturation curve you just uh

1728
01:35:44,159 --> 01:35:49,159
quench or you cool down quickly although

1729
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:52,199
cooling is more difficult because

1730
01:35:49,159 --> 01:35:56,920
cooling requires uh extracting uh heat

1731
01:35:52,199 --> 01:36:00,040
and heat uh it's kind of a slow thing to

1732
01:35:56,920 --> 01:36:06,760
to do in in experimentally

1733
01:36:00,040 --> 01:36:10,560
so but uh you can do it in in thin uh

1734
01:36:06,760 --> 01:36:13,960
samples like between two

1735
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:18,040
um two glasses two small glasses like

1736
01:36:13,960 --> 01:36:21,639
the chemistry labs and therefore by uh

1737
01:36:18,040 --> 01:36:24,639
by cooling that the the by by cooling

1738
01:36:21,639 --> 01:36:26,639
that somehow it cools in mediately the

1739
01:36:24,639 --> 01:36:28,360
entire surface of the fluid it doesn't

1740
01:36:26,639 --> 01:36:31,320
require too much time because it's a

1741
01:36:28,360 --> 01:36:33,880
thin layer of fluid in any case suppose

1742
01:36:31,320 --> 01:36:36,480
you have these are

1743
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:41,000
numerical uh

1744
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:45,000
simulations uh very nice

1745
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:50,239
uh and there are three cases one is uh

1746
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:54,520
the middle one is when you you drop into

1747
01:36:50,239 --> 01:36:56,639
this region here the unstable region

1748
01:36:54,520 --> 01:36:59,280
uh with the

1749
01:36:56,639 --> 01:37:02,520
critical with the critical specific

1750
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:05,719
volume so you this is the critical point

1751
01:37:02,520 --> 01:37:08,679
you you cross the critical

1752
01:37:05,719 --> 01:37:12,119
point and then you have a s development

1753
01:37:08,679 --> 01:37:12,119
of uh of

1754
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:21,560
um how do you say a

1755
01:37:18,360 --> 01:37:24,239
pattern first

1756
01:37:21,560 --> 01:37:27,119
initially uh the

1757
01:37:24,239 --> 01:37:29,800
the mixture I mean not the mixture the

1758
01:37:27,119 --> 01:37:31,119
your substance is homogeneous then it

1759
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:33,320
begins to

1760
01:37:31,119 --> 01:37:38,000
separate the

1761
01:37:33,320 --> 01:37:40,639
separation is in terms of a b continuous

1762
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:42,800
so you see the blue particles are all

1763
01:37:40,639 --> 01:37:45,239
connected to the blue particles the red

1764
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:48,920
part the red particles and the red

1765
01:37:45,239 --> 01:37:54,320
regions whereas if you are off

1766
01:37:48,920 --> 01:37:56,360
critical you form either um bubbles

1767
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:58,800
the red things are

1768
01:37:56,360 --> 01:38:02,639
bubbles or

1769
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:07,920
drops okay but what is most important is

1770
01:38:02,639 --> 01:38:13,920
that this phenomenon occurs very quickly

1771
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:17,280
because again of this uh important free

1772
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:21,040
energy that is there uh in order and is

1773
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:25,520
available to form all these

1774
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:31,040
interfacial regions in initially small

1775
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:34,000
and then after a while uh uh once you

1776
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:39,199
have formed all that then um the system

1777
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:40,639
will try to coales in order to uh reduce

1778
01:38:39,199 --> 01:38:44,280
the surface

1779
01:38:40,639 --> 01:38:47,920
tension reduce the surface area uh and

1780
01:38:44,280 --> 01:38:50,360
so you the two bubbles will form a

1781
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:54,080
bigger bubble so that the the surface

1782
01:38:50,360 --> 01:38:58,080
area goes down and that is a way to uh

1783
01:38:54,080 --> 01:39:01,159
go down in in free uh in free

1784
01:38:58,080 --> 01:39:04,520
energy and yeah time is up I think I

1785
01:39:01,159 --> 01:39:07,719
forgot to say but the word

1786
01:39:04,520 --> 01:39:09,719
spinodal appears all over that this

1787
01:39:07,719 --> 01:39:14,199
curve here that is the locus of the

1788
01:39:09,719 --> 01:39:19,760
points inside that separate the region

1789
01:39:14,199 --> 01:39:21,119
between oops between unstable and stable

1790
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:25,760
is called a

1791
01:39:21,119 --> 01:39:28,599
spinodal curve SP noal curve and for

1792
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:30,960
Vander vales you can even compute its

1793
01:39:28,599 --> 01:39:37,119
equation which is this

1794
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:37,119
one okay yeah enough for today
