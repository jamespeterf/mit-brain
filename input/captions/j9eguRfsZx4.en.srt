1
00:00:01,319 --> 00:00:08,040
okay so um our last speaker for today's

2
00:00:04,359 --> 00:00:11,639
Symposium is Professor Jen tan uh he's a

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:13,599
associate professor at Mila and at um uh

4
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:15,839
Montreal um he has done a lot of

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,279
exciting work on drug Discovery and

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,359
proin design um due to he couldn't come

7
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:23,480
in person today due to Visa difficulty

8
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:26,359
so he will present on Zoom uh so without

9
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:29,480
further Ado um J please take it

10
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:32,640
away okay uh so thank you thanks very

11
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:34,879
much uh W for the invitation and also

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,280
the introduction uh it's great pleasure

13
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:39,200
to be here uh unfortunately I cannot

14
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,920
come in person due to Visa issues

15
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,640
hopefully we can meet in person next

16
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,719
time um so in today's talk I'm going to

17
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,680
talk about geometric deep learning for

18
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:50,840
protein design uh I'm going to quickly

19
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:53,480
introduce the background of proteins so

20
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:55,879
as we know proteins are the work hes in

21
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:58,559
living cells so in our living cells most

22
00:00:55,879 --> 00:01:00,559
of the functions actually carry out by

23
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,239
proteins right and that's why understand

24
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:05,640
the functions or proteins also designing

25
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:07,799
proteins of new functions is going to be

26
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,720
important in many different areas for

27
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:13,400
example Therapeutics anible design and

28
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,840
also enzy design in synthetic biology

29
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,840
okay and then so nowaday we actually see

30
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,360
a huge opportunities uh for machine

31
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,720
learning uh for protein design because a

32
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:25,119
huge amount of data set is generated in

33
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,159
btic domain like like for example we

34
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:30,439
have like tens of billions put in

35
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:33,439
sequence available we also have like U

36
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:36,200
uh uh hundreds of thousands protein

37
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,640
structure available in the pdb database

38
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,759
okay so a lot of different machine

39
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,399
learning techniques have been uh

40
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,600
developed for uh for party modeling so

41
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:47,320
these approaches are mainly uh divided

42
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,880
into two Tech two categories so the

43
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:51,600
first category is basically sequence

44
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,439
based approach so we we just represent

45
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,479
proteins as am sequence and then we can

46
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:59,119
use models like language models

47
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:01,240
Transformers to to model Ament acid

48
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,880
sequence so this one type approach so

49
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:05,079
another type approach is okay we can

50
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,840
represent proteins as 3D structures

51
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:09,039
right and then we can use approaches

52
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,360
like geometric de approach to model 3D

53
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:13,319
structures okay so in our approach in

54
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,920
our group so we have been take um we

55
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:18,000
have been taking the structure Centric

56
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:20,120
approach to model uh uh 3D structures

57
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,920
with geomet de learning okay so in

58
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,760
particular so we mainly trying to

59
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,920
address three research questions the

60
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,680
first research question is okay so once

61
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,120
we are we are given a 3D planting

62
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:33,000
structure how do we represent this 3D uh

63
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,160
this uh 3D protein structures right how

64
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,680
can we learn features out of these 3D

65
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,640
prot structures so this the first

66
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,720
research question the second one is okay

67
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,480
how can we as we know for most of the

68
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,400
proteins we don't know we don't know

69
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:48,120
there 3D uh protein structures right how

70
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,640
can we predict the 3D protein structures

71
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,680
uh from the am acid sequence this the

72
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,720
first the second research question of

73
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,760
course at end our end go is always we

74
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,319
want to generate we want to design new

75
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,760
proteins with gener models so I'm going

76
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:03,239
to focus mainly focus on the first

77
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:05,360
research question okay so in this in

78
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:09,519
this work so what we do is we actually

79
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:12,640
develop new um uh new uh 3D protein uh

80
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:15,560
geometry encoder to encode proteins into

81
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:18,360
continuous rep repetitions so our input

82
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:21,319
is a 3D protein structure and then given

83
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:24,480
this uh uh 3D uh protein structure we

84
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:25,959
first construct a graph out of this 3D

85
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,959
putting structure so what kind of graph

86
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:30,560
we are constructing here so this is

87
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:33,599
actually um a reso graph

88
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,200
so every node here is a resio okay and

89
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,599
then how do we Define the edges between

90
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,040
the resos so we we mainly make use of

91
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:41,640
two kinds of information so first is

92
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,519
structure information and and the second

93
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:46,080
is sequence information so for structure

94
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:48,000
information so essentially what we do

95
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,120
here we just construct The KES nebor

96
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,120
graph uh from the spatial uh information

97
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,680
of of of the protein structure to define

98
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,280
the the spatial relationship between the

99
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,560
residual so this is from the structur

100
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,400
information and then we also make use of

101
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,400
the sequential orders between the regos

102
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,920
in the protein sequence to Define

103
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:08,480
another type of like edges between the

104
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:12,000
between the uh between the regos okay

105
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:14,480
but anyway so here we will end up with a

106
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,320
resio graph and this graph is directed

107
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,919
and then the problem of learning protein

108
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,320
structure uh translate to learning the

109
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:24,000
repetition of the entire resue graph

110
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:26,720
okay so here we actually propose two

111
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,160
type of graph new networks to learn this

112
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,520
repetition the first uh approach is is

113
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:35,120
quite straightforward so we just do

114
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,840
massive passing between the reses okay

115
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,400
of course when we do massive passing

116
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,960
between the reses since there are

117
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,160
different type of edges between the

118
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:45,320
residues so we will also uh uh take the

119
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,240
edge type into consideration when we do

120
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,320
the mass passing okay so once we do the

121
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,160
mass passing so we can have a repetition

122
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:53,880
for all the different reses and then we

123
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,639
Su up all the res reputations to get the

124
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,479
repetition of the entire graph or the

125
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:00,120
entire protein structures so this are

126
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:02,400
first type of like architecture we

127
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,840
propose and and for the second type

128
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,199
approach okay we actually not not doing

129
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:09,160
massive passing between the Ros so

130
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,240
instead so what we do here is we

131
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,120
actually doing massive passing between

132
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,960
the edges okay for example we can do

133
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,120
massive passing between neighboring

134
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,319
edges uh two and two uh two 4 and 47

135
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,919
okay and then when we do Massy passing

136
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:25,280
between the edges 2 4 and 47 so we also

137
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:26,840
make use of the angle information

138
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,080
between the edges into into

139
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:31,199
consideration so by making use of the

140
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,960
angle information so we actually Bas

141
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:37,039
basically we we are basically better

142
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:38,560
able to make use of the 3D geomet

143
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,039
geometric structure of the proteins

144
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,039
right and then once we do the edge

145
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:43,680
massive passing so every Edge can have

146
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:45,039
repetition and then we can aggregate all

147
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,400
the edge repetition to get the

148
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:51,039
repetition of the whole proteins okay so

149
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:53,560
that's another type of like a which we

150
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:55,280
call gonet Edge okay and for both type

151
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,000
of approaches we actually train the

152
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,240
model in a superv fashion which means

153
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,479
we're going to train the new network

154
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,600
right from some label data uh

155
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:05,880
inding task so this is like superon okay

156
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,840
and then so we also prend the 3D

157
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:10,080
geometry encoder from some un labored

158
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:14,919
proteins so here the idea is very

159
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:17,560
similar to what we do um in um in uh in

160
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:19,919
uh image representation learning uh with

161
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,880
uh with like self learning so the basic

162
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,520
assump assumption here is okay we use

163
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:26,080
contrast learning we basically assume

164
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,039
that okay for two structure motives if

165
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,440
they are from the same proteins so then

166
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:33,360
their repetitions should similar

167
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:35,400
otherwise their repetition should be uh

168
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,960
dissimilar so that's the high level idea

169
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:40,280
okay and then so we evalu the mods on

170
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,639
some Downstream uh task like for example

171
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:45,680
enzyme commission number predictions for

172
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,479
the ction these are some classical um

173
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,440
protein understanding task and then in

174
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:52,599
terms of pring dat so we actually try

175
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:55,720
different the pring uh um protein

176
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:59,039
structure database one is the pdb uh

177
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,840
experimental uh um uh um uh structures

178
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:03,280
and another one the predicted structures

179
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,800
by Alpha 42 okay so here we can quickly

180
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,960
look at the results of the super

181
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,520
learning um uh uh uh performance so we

182
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,160
compare our approaches with some like

183
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,879
sequence base and also graph base so our

184
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,599
approaches is able to outperform both

185
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:16,960
the sequence and graph base approach

186
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,039
which is not surprising because we make

187
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,080
use of the 3D structures right and then

188
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:23,360
in particular if you compare the gear

189
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:25,879
net and also the gear net Edge so gear

190
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,560
net only makes use of the no the the

191
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:30,599
which do mass pass between the resid but

192
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,400
for gear net and Ed we actually make use

193
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:34,800
of we do Mass passing between the

194
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,280
between the edges which is B basically

195
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,599
better uh able to better make use of the

196
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,840
edge uh the the 3D geometric code so you

197
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,960
can see the performance is actually

198
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:45,479
significantly improved uh compared to

199
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,960
the gonet and then so after doing PR

200
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:48,919
training you can see the performance is

201
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,440
further improved compared to the super

202
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:53,360
wi like training so you see PR train is

203
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,960
is is indeed able to improve the

204
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,199
performance okay and then so we also

205
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:01,039
like do some aeration study on the

206
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:02,919
preing so we actually try different

207
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,960
pre-training database is the pdb

208
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:07,319
database which are experimental

209
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,960
structures and also the other four to uh

210
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:11,120
predict the protein structures so we

211
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,759
actually see that our prity model is

212
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,800
actually quite robust is a trend on the

213
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,919
experimental structures and also maybe

214
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:21,120
also the predictive prot structures by

215
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:23,879
Al too okay so this so so this is the

216
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,759
the first work and then we apply this

217
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:29,520
kind of like a structure pring and the

218
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:31,759
fine tuning idea to a real world problem

219
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,039
which is antibody optimization so as we

220
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,640
know in practice sometimes the

221
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,039
antibodies like like for example the

222
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,479
antibodies of turn through anyal

223
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,279
immunizations so we usually sometimes we

224
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:43,599
we need to do lead optimization right so

225
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,480
we need we need to do some mutations to

226
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,440
improve the Bing Affinity so in

227
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:50,320
particular for for this problem so what

228
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,880
we what we have is okay we have antibody

229
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,360
uh binding to a specific antigen right

230
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:58,079
and then we want to make some mutations

231
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:01,000
in the interface to improve the B

232
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:03,399
Infinity so m mathmatically what we want

233
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,600
to do is we actually want to build a

234
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:09,120
binding Affinity change predicted models

235
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,800
so we want to we want to predict okay if

236
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,839
we make some mut mutations on the

237
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,399
interface so what's going to be the by

238
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,279
Infinity change right so we want to

239
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:19,959
build this this Delta Del G uh predict

240
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:22,640
model so which is the difference between

241
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:25,440
the Bing free energy of the mutant and

242
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,839
also and and the Bing free the Bing free

243
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,760
energ of the the Y type okay and so so

244
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,480
this is the goal okay so you know Bing

245
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,880
affinities essentially most the the The

246
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,920
Binding Infinity most of the time we

247
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:38,839
mainly actually look at the interface

248
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,959
between the two uh protein structure to

249
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:43,240
two proteins right so you see for this

250
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:45,600
model Al also we also trying to model

251
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,560
the protein structures but for this for

252
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,839
this problem so we want to model the

253
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:52,800
interactions between two proteins

254
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:55,200
instead of like a single protein okay so

255
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,000
here we also uh so this a new work we

256
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,839
publish in this is like natural

257
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,640
Communications so this a new uh Al

258
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:05,839
so this for this uh work we also uh

259
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:09,240
adopt the pring and also fine tuning

260
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:11,720
framework so we first prend the model on

261
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,279
a huge number of like unlabeled protein

262
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,360
protein complex structure so that the

263
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,680
model is able to understand how

264
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,839
different proteins interact okay and

265
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,040
then we fine tune the model based on

266
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,680
some experimental data to build this

267
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:26,519
like by the infinity um uh change

268
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:29,079
predict model and then we can apply this

269
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:32,040
model to to real what the uh scenarios

270
00:10:29,079 --> 00:10:34,120
we can can do in cical um screening and

271
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:37,279
identify some mutants which could lead

272
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:40,000
to higher Bing Infinity okay so this is

273
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:42,399
the main idea so we can start from the

274
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,760
pre turnning stage as as I just said so

275
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,760
for pre turnning so we're going to we're

276
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,680
going to pre return the model on protein

277
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:50,360
protein complex structure because our

278
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,800
goal is trying to understand how

279
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,320
different proteins interact okay so so

280
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,360
that's why we prend the model on protein

281
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:00,360
protein comp structure and then so uh we

282
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,959
also use like um uh contrast learning

283
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:05,320
idea okay so what we do here is okay we

284
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:07,279
take a natural protein protein complex

285
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:09,240
structure we mainly take the interface

286
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,200
so these are so this a posit pair right

287
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,639
so this a natural interface and then

288
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,959
what we do is we also make some

289
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:17,440
mutations on the interface and this this

290
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:20,680
is basically netive pair right so we we

291
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,720
we we do some mutations on the interface

292
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,920
okay we mutate the residues we change

293
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,560
one residue to another reg but then for

294
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:30,240
the mutated reg we also quickly um

295
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:32,120
update the structure with some efficient

296
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,120
siton structure predict model for

297
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:36,920
example we can sample from R Library we

298
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:39,320
can also optimize with some physic based

299
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:41,000
approaches right but then now we have

300
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:43,000
this like two two different structures

301
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,760
and now now we want to distinguish

302
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,399
whether this is a natural structure a

303
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:49,800
natural complex natural interface or a

304
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:52,279
mutated ones right so we use the graph

305
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:54,760
new networks or geomet planing to encode

306
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:56,639
the two different 3D structures right

307
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:58,200
and then we build the classify to to to

308
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,519
to to distinguish the two right so this

309
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,399
is the preing stage okay and then in the

310
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:04,200
F tuning stage as we just said we

311
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,839
essentially we just want to predict uh

312
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,079
build the predict model to predict the

313
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,079
Bing Infinity change so here we actually

314
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,959
find to the model with some experimental

315
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,240
data so in the experiment data like a

316
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:16,560
scan pie so we have a protein protein

317
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,760
comp structure and then we are given

318
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,000
some mutations and people already have

319
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,959
test the B Infinity changed for

320
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,399
different mutations right so that's the

321
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:27,279
the the data we use to to find the model

322
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:29,720
so we here we do do a similar things

323
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,920
right so we have the Y type protein

324
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:33,760
protein structures or antigen antibody

325
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,160
structures right and then we have some

326
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,680
mutations we take the two structure as

327
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,800
input and then you can get the

328
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,240
reputations of the two two comple

329
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:44,279
structures but at end here we are not

330
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,760
trying to do binary cation because here

331
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:49,240
we are actually trying to predict the B

332
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:51,399
Infinity change which is d d g okay and

333
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,720
so this model is is uh we're going to

334
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:56,160
find tun this model based on the uh

335
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:58,079
experimental Del theology data okay by

336
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,560
doing this so we are able to build a

337
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:02,720
predict model to by Infinity change

338
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,079
given any mutations on the interface

339
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,880
okay so once we have this model okay

340
00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:09,240
we're going we're going to do some like

341
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,639
evaluations in cations so here we do

342
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,760
cross validations on the scampa data set

343
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:16,600
so we compare with some traditional

344
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,240
physic based methods like f x f CDG and

345
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,560
also some recent deep running Bas based

346
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,199
methods so you can see our G gyte can

347
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,240
aeve better performance compared to

348
00:13:22,199 --> 00:13:26,240
transition approaches and then after

349
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,720
doing pre-training so our model actually

350
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,199
achieve the best performance among all

351
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:32,440
these methods so this is some in cical

352
00:13:30,199 --> 00:13:34,800
evation okay and then you may Wonder

353
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:36,639
okay can this model be applied to real

354
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,360
world problems yes so we actually

355
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:41,880
collaborate with some biologist uh for

356
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,760
like antibody optimization so here's a

357
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:47,279
case like we have so our like

358
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:49,959
collaborator has a um sasco 2 antibody

359
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:52,880
actually this is not sasco 2 this is a

360
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:55,759
antibody um collected actually Harvest

361
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:58,079
from sasc one patient and then they want

362
00:13:55,759 --> 00:14:02,320
to optimize this antibod so that it can

363
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:04,920
Target uh against the uh the Omicron

364
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:10,800
variant so they already have this like

365
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:13,079
um antibody and also sasco 2 um um uh uh

366
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,920
antigen uh complex and then we use our

367
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:18,320
models to do some in cical screening so

368
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:20,639
in the first round so we identify some

369
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,759
single mutations we pretty much identify

370
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:26,399
like I think s or eight uh single

371
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:28,639
mutations and also the best uh double

372
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:31,519
mutations and then we test them in the

373
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:34,000
we laap okay and and then once we finish

374
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:37,079
the first round we experiments okay we

375
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,040
can identify a few good single mutations

376
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:42,000
and then in the second round we just do

377
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:44,199
comori mutations we we mainly test like

378
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,600
uh double mutations and also triple

379
00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:49,199
mutations so as end we are able to

380
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:51,079
identify a good mutant with three

381
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:53,120
mutations and this these mutants

382
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:55,399
actually by Infinity has improved at 77

383
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,639
F and actually this problem is quite

384
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:59,680
challenging because for the or antibody

385
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:01,959
uh the Bing Affinity is is already like

386
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:04,759
one Nal and now we able to improve to

387
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:06,399
like 0.06 Nal so so this actually the

388
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:07,680
problem is quite quite challenged so

389
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:11,160
this is the

390
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,959
first case study we we did with our a

391
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,160
okay and then we actually also

392
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:17,880
collaborate with another group which has

393
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:20,560
a similar problem so they also have like

394
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:23,000
sasco 2 antibody and then they want to

395
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:25,839
optimize this antibody to uh to to

396
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,480
neutralize against the new variant gm1

397
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:30,600
so we did a similar SC so in the first

398
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:34,639
mutation in the first round we we we we

399
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:37,720
we do uh inal screening so we

400
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:39,759
identify some good single mutations and

401
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:42,279
in the second round we combine them to

402
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:46,319
do double or triple mutations eventually

403
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:48,600
so we actually identify a good mutant U

404
00:15:46,319 --> 00:15:51,399
which the the B Infinity has uh improved

405
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:53,680
over 300 FS compared to the the white

406
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:56,480
type okay and this paper now is actually

407
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:59,319
um in Revision in pen so so this a

408
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,360
second case study okay

409
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:03,480
and then so I probably do not have time

410
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:06,160
to to cover the uh the details of the

411
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:08,319
other uh work we have done so for for 3D

412
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,639
putting structures and also denov design

413
00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:12,800
I'm going to quickly uh uh summarize

414
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:15,160
some work we have done in in in in these

415
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:18,959
two directions okay so for the first

416
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:20,680
work div pack uh so we mainly work on S

417
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:23,040
and structure predictions so you guys

418
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:25,120
probably all know like U uh uh models

419
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,440
like Ava fold to esm fold right but

420
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:30,040
remember that for Ava fold to esm fold

421
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,560
so they they main need work on

422
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:35,040
uh uh predicting the backbone backbone

423
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:38,079
structures of proteins right uh so

424
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:40,480
actually the cyons predicted by a v to

425
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:42,040
and and yes yes V so they're not

426
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,199
accurate so that's why in this

427
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:47,480
particular work so what we did is we

428
00:16:44,199 --> 00:16:50,519
actually proposed diffusion models um to

429
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:52,360
accurately uh predict the cyon structure

430
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:54,920
as a protein so you know cyon structure

431
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:57,040
prediction is very important like uh for

432
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:59,120
drug design because you know for for for

433
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,920
either for small molecule or or protein

434
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,560
right so so so interactions between two

435
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:05,839
molecules is actually mainly happened

436
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:07,360
through through through the Cain

437
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,160
interaction so that's why citon

438
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,600
structure prediction is is very very

439
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:15,199
important problem so what we did in this

440
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:20,120
work we actually proposed a defusion

441
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:23,319
model to to to to generate or or predict

442
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:25,079
the the the S structures of the of the C

443
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:27,319
so essentially just generate the 3D

444
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:32,360
coordinates of the of the

445
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:35,000
atom uh as you because for uh siton um

446
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:37,720
uh so uh so their degree of freedom is

447
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,799
not the 3D coordinates of the Aton so

448
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,679
actually made controlled by the uh

449
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:43,799
different the four toal angles and

450
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:47,720
that's why in this new work uh in this

451
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:49,960
work U we actually didn't uh do

452
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,799
diffusion in the cardan space so instead

453
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,840
of what we do is we actually did a

454
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:55,960
diffusion we propos a diffusion model in

455
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,000
the torsion space so that's the main

456
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:01,360
idea of this work so I'm not going into

457
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,760
the details okay and then for the second

458
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,880
work this is also Rel to protein

459
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:07,799
structure prediction as we know like for

460
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:10,919
Alpha 42 and also yes F they only

461
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:13,600
predict a single structure for each uh

462
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:15,159
protein sequence but but we know like

463
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,080
each protein can take multiple

464
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:19,280
confirmations right and that's why here

465
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:21,799
we actually try to predict multiple

466
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:25,200
confirmations for given

467
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:27,360
the amino acid sequence right so the the

468
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,720
high idea is we got some inspiration

469
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,640
from traditional like a mole Dynamic

470
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:35,120
approaches especially the the approach

471
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:37,360
collect simulated okay and then we CH

472
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:40,120
joint models essential of diffusion

473
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:43,840
models uh to to to generate multiple

474
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:46,280
confirmations given the uh given given a

475
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,480
single M&S sequence so I'm not going to

476
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:51,640
details so this paper is accept in dcsi

477
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,320
clear okay and so this is the second one

478
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,400
and then finally for the diffusion

479
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:58,360
models and this is very latest work we

480
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,320
did like U just we just put uh put it on

481
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:02,440
I on

482
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:04,440
on arive so for this problem we want to

483
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:07,360
given a small molecule we want to design

484
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:09,200
a a protein Bing into this small

485
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:12,200
molecule okay so here we actually

486
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:14,080
propose a model to uh based on the flow

487
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,240
matching framework to model The Joint

488
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,919
distribution of the protein nen complex

489
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,360
and then given uh the the the chemical

490
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:23,320
graph so we can uh we can use flow

491
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,760
magion to S

492
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:28,559
simultaneously uh generate the protein

493
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:31,720
lant 3D comp structure okay so that we

494
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:34,679
can eventually we can go like proteins

495
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:38,960
binding to the 3D molecule B binding to

496
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:41,840
the the the the given Lian okay so I

497
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:45,120
will WRA WRA here so essentially

498
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:48,280
so in our group so we have been taking a

499
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:50,400
structure Centric approach to model 3D

500
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:53,000
uh structures of proteins so we mainly

501
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,000
make use techniques like geomet deep

502
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,240
learning and also diffusion models for

503
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,960
Manion to to model different kinds of

504
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:02,880
props in proteins in particular how to

505
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:05,360
represent 3D protein structures how to

506
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:08,360
how to better predict um uh protein

507
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,919
structures like citr the Dynamics and

508
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,799
also protein protein comp structure

509
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,400
prediction of course at end we care

510
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:17,799
about how can we design new proteins

511
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:20,240
with diffusion models with FR with

512
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:23,600
models like frion so that's all I want

513
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,600
to show thank you very much

514
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:33,440
okay great thank you d for your

515
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,440
wonderful talk uh any questions

516
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:39,919
um uh I actually have questions about um

517
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:41,640
your uh uh design part which you

518
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:44,200
couldn't really um go into too much

519
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:46,320
detail but uh how are you are you

520
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:48,840
generating both the Li and protein

521
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,600
simultaneously or your the given the

522
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:53,360
Lian confirmation is actually

523
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:56,400
given oh that's a good question so I

524
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:59,880
think so for many of a recent work the

525
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:03,000
the 3D lean structure is given so so um

526
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:07,280
in all this latest work we actually only

527
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,840
um give the the the 2D chemical graph as

528
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,559
input so the 3D confirmation of the Lian

529
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:14,240
is not given

530
00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:17,760
okay and do you know the binding pocket

531
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:19,520
location or you are just gener okay we

532
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,400
we don't we don't assume the Bing pocket

533
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:25,600
is is given just the input is just

534
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:28,320
arbitary so just a like Lian so only the

535
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:31,559
sequence or the chemic graph is given

536
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:34,880
and then we want to generate a protein

537
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:37,200
which is able to bind to the the the the

538
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:40,279
LI but but but you're right so so we

539
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:43,200
also now doing some testing

540
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:45,440
or proposing some new varant so okay

541
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,799
maybe we know that we are The Binding

542
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,559
positions of the lean okay so in that

543
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:51,960
case we can also do some more

544
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:54,600
controllable uh protein design okay you

545
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:57,000
want to design proteins bind into

546
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:59,440
specific regions of the of the the small

547
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,240
molecule yeah

548
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,520
great uh so since we are already over

549
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,960
time so let's give our speaker one more

550
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:10,480
round of

551
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:10,480
applause thank you very much
