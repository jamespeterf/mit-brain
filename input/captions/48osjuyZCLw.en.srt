1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:10,639
Let me see if I can Okay. Um, hello

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:14,960
everybody. My name is Shar. Uh, I got my

3
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:17,760
masters in PhD from MIT a long time ago

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:20,400
and now I am the founder and CEO of

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,560
Notch where we develop smart

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,400
metamaterials for nextgen wireless

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,640
comms.

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:31,439
Um so last year the Russians in the

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,440
Russian Ukrainian war uh ditched all

10
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,320
their sophisticated wireless

11
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,840
communication equipment and uh for for

12
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,440
controlling their drones and started

13
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:44,559
using this uh this is a drone um it's

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:47,600
got a fiber optic reel and it gets its

15
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:49,440
entire C2 and GPS link through that

16
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,640
fiber optic reel. It's essentially

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,480
unjammable. Um, and this this sort of uh

18
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,760
I mean this is a still a current problem

19
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,680
for the Ukrainians. Um, but it

20
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,640
highlights a problem with wireless,

21
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:05,199
right? Wireless technologies. You got

22
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,000
radio and then you have antenna. And uh

23
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:10,960
the focus has always been on the radio.

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,439
Um because the antenna is kind of, you

25
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,760
know, this weird rod-like device,

26
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,640
uninteresting, unintelligent,

27
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:21,439
uh no directionality. it it uh

28
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,799
susceptible to interference. Um and the

29
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,119
current state-of-the-art when it comes

30
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,400
to antenna technologies are phased

31
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:31,280
arrays which are you know militaryra N

32
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,360
squared antenna elements um a lot of

33
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:38,159
power you got parabolic dish which is

34
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:40,400
large slow uh heavy um and at what we

35
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,960
are doing at notch is we're putting the

36
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:46,079
antenna first so that's what we believe

37
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:49,200
the future of comms is going to be um

38
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:52,240
and the way to do it is with something

39
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,159
that we invented called a metamaterial.

40
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,439
Now this is an engineered material. It

41
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:59,040
acts like a filter. It uh is you know

42
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:02,000
electronically controllable to be

43
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,079
transparent or reflective. Um and then

44
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,479
you can use it as a building block and

45
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,399
you can take your unintelligent antenna

46
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,399
and you can create a new kind of antenna

47
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,560
system by you know surrounding it with

48
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:15,599
these meta materials and then you can

49
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,920
block against jammers in any direction.

50
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:20,879
You can block against multiple jammers.

51
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,879
You can then use it to steer a beam,

52
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:26,640
concentrate energy in one direction or

53
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:29,200
multiple directions um 360 degrees. You

54
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,959
can tilt up and down.

55
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,560
And we have developed something called

56
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,480
the magic series of antennas. You can

57
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:39,599
see over here this is the wizard and

58
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,080
it's you know you can get 9 dBi of gain

59
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,720
fully steerable 360°.

60
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:48,800
You can form two beams, you can form

61
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:51,599
three beams. Um you can form six beams.

62
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,319
You can form any antenna pattern. Uh we

63
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:56,480
have a butterfly here. Uh this is all

64
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:59,519
just a reminder like one antenna

65
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:02,560
element. You cannot no phase array here.

66
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,720
So and we use AI to develop all these

67
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,879
antenna patterns.

68
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:11,040
Uh we've tested this. So we have the

69
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:12,720
magic wizard on a car over here. This is

70
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,360
in Alaska because you can't test

71
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:18,560
anywhere else anymore. Um, so this is in

72
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,120
a denied environment and it's used to uh

73
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,000
track our freefly astro carrying the

74
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,400
elf. The wizard can double the range

75
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,480
compared to an omni in any direction and

76
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,319
the elf can get you know eight times

77
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:35,360
closer to a jammer. Um so we believe

78
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:38,239
like I said antennas first that's the

79
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:41,680
future. Uh we can make now with

80
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:44,480
metamaterials uh 360 degrees steerable

81
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:48,080
phased array tilt up and down double

82
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:50,560
your range interference proof. Uh it can

83
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,280
reconfigure its antenna patterns 100

84
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:56,560
times faster than a blink of an eye. Um

85
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,720
it's lighter than your phone. It uses uh

86
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,879
less power than your smartwatch. It's

87
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:04,000
fully software defined so you can add

88
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:06,799
any other functionality to it. And um

89
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,480
you know like most technologies they

90
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,959
start new technologies they start in

91
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:14,080
defense. So we're seeking partnerships

92
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:16,479
with defense companies but also we are

93
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,959
because it's an antenna system um we're

94
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:21,199
seeking early customers with anyone

95
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,919
making radios or onman systems or

96
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:27,680
communication equipment. Um I will say

97
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:30,000
that this technology started like metam

98
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,160
materials is about 50 years old. If it

99
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:37,068
existed back then, all antennas would be

100
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:39,088
built like this. So, I'll end with that

101
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:39,088
[applause]

102
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:45,639
>> questions. Anyone?

103
00:04:46,238 --> 00:04:51,040
[clears throat] Well, I've got some

104
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:53,040
questions. Um, sorry. Uh, can you, uh,

105
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,400
can your antennas also do elevating

106
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,520
steering?

107
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,360
>> Yeah, we can do elevation and, uh,

108
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,520
elevation steering as well. Yeah. And

109
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,199
and as a model,

110
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,280
>> thank you. And to follow up, can your

111
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,800
antennas tune across different bands?

112
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,280
How would how would they work with a

113
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,680
softwaredefined radio?

114
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:15,520
>> Yeah. So the metamaterial that forms the

115
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:19,919
building block is um tunable across

116
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:22,160
multiple frequencies. So then uh you can

117
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,919
use it with uh software defined radio

118
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,600
that can hop along with the

119
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,080
metamaterial.

120
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,080
>> Yeah.

121
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,400
>> Thank you. Anyone else in the audience?

122
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:28,720
question.

123
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,520
>> Yeah.

124
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,120
>> Yeah.

125
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,120
>> Uh,

126
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,120
>> sure.

127
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:42,080
>> Have you set up any tools so that an end

128
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:44,400
user can uh

129
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,840
set up the patterns and the frequency

130
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:52,160
ranges that they need on their own.

131
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:55,919
um the patterns are derived through very

132
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:59,039
you know intensive um

133
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:01,360
machine learning and then uh but you can

134
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,440
then access them. So we have an API you

135
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,680
can call up a pattern you can point

136
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,919
wherever you want. So we have an API to

137
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,080
do that but doing it by yourself is

138
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,440
something that we would not like to a

139
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,800
customer we would not do.

140
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,240
>> Okay. So a customer would come to you

141
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,560
and you could you could fine tune

142
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,000
something.

143
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,240
>> Yeah. they can come and ask us what

144
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,720
pattern they want and we can develop for

145
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,360
that.

146
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,199
>> Okay. Awesome. I by the way I love it.

147
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,479
>> Yeah. Great. [snorts]

148
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,880
>> Yeah.

149
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,120
>> Great.

150
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,560
>> Thank you Shakriar. Uh I want to remind

151
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,000
there will be an exhibit after this

152
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,840
these presentation. So if you didn't

153
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,080
have a chance to ask more question or

154
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,720
you like to see some demos please see

155
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,240
after this presentation. Thank you. I

156
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,560
>> have one of the antennas out there so

157
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,560
you can

158
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,560
>> Excellent.
