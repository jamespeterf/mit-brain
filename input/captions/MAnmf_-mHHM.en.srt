1
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:17,920
Problems are not catastrophes.

2
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,840
We humans have a penchant for drama.

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,600
We love to present problems as if they

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,000
were catastrophes and talk about them as

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,119
if there was only one way to solve them.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,880
Some silver bullet or some magic pill.

7
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,800
Let me give you some examples of what I

8
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,640
mean. A few years ago, students in an

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,880
MIT dorm came up with a system to grow

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,559
lettuce in a closet. Soon, they were

11
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,000
persuaded to present their invention as

12
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:39,920
the start of a movement that would yield

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,399
a solution to food distribution,

14
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,360
obesity, chemical runoff, climate

15
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:47,200
change. Even by the same logic in 2025,

16
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,520
if you were concerned about say

17
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,120
declining math literacy, you might be

18
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,879
tempted to talk about a more grandio

19
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,120
problem like soon even computers will

20
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,559
start making addition mistakes or AI

21
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,960
will kill us all unless we learn to

22
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,879
divide by zero or something involving

23
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,480
climate change. These last examples are

24
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,239
a bit silly, but they help me make my

25
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,519
point. The drama distracts you from

26
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,280
actually understanding the problem

27
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,119
you're solving. You may be inclined to

28
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,360
talk about problems this way so they'll

29
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,119
be taken seriously enough to solve. But

30
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,520
this isn't how you solve them. Real

31
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,680
world problems are more interesting. So

32
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,920
let's talk about what are real problems

33
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,560
and how to solve them. It's not what you

34
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,240
did in math class. Love them or hate

35
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,320
them. Those math class problems had a

36
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,640
readymade problem statement and the

37
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,960
variables were all spelled out, all

38
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:34,000
handed to you by the teacher. One thing

39
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,720
was clear, there was just one solution.

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,439
This was pretend play problem solving.

41
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,360
Problems in the real world that matter.

42
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,280
Problems you are truly motivated to take

43
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,439
on. And maybe that's why you are

44
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,240
watching these videos. They don't have

45
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:50,079
readymade problem statements. Not until

46
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,000
you produce them. You do not need

47
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,920
clarity about the problem. Scratch that.

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,720
You can't have clarity unless you commit

49
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,159
to explore the actual problem. At first,

50
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,119
real world problems might look like a

51
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:03,040
nuisance, an obstacle, an impediment, or

52
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,200
a collection of symptoms that is hard to

53
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,799
diagnose. In the new mindset, we

54
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,800
appreciate that solving the problem and

55
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,399
understanding it are the same thing. No

56
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,920
matter the problem, you can come up with

57
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,920
a technology that makes it easier to

58
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,440
understand. You can take that as a new

59
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,599
definition for what we mean by

60
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,920
technology. Technology helps us reach

61
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,599
further. It removes obstacles. It solves

62
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,040
problems. And just like technology

63
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,720
creates options, what makes real

64
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,360
problems interesting is that there are

65
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,879
many ways to chip at them. If you

66
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,160
remember only one thing about this

67
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:34,560
video, let this be it. You have options.

68
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,560
Here's an example of what I mean. At the

69
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,000
start of my career, I worked on a system

70
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,400
to locate cell phones in case of

71
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
emergency. The regulator, the Federal

72
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,680
Communications Commission, was worried

73
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,280
that as cell phones replace landlines,

74
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,440
they would lose the ability to locate a

75
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,120
call to emergency services. Landlines

76
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,440
were easy to locate. Each number was

77
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,959
associated with an address already. But

78
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,879
how to get a location estimate for a

79
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,519
mobile phone. In fact, there are many

80
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,959
options. One could install GPS in all

81
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,040
phones or find ways to triangulate

82
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:04,080
signals. We found yet another way using

83
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,440
AI and found that Polar is wireless. But

84
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,120
there were other parts of the problem

85
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,720
too, like supplying emergency services

86
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,120
with a medical record so emergency

87
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,560
respondents could be readier. The

88
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,920
problem was not limited to locating

89
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,159
phones. Rather, it was fielding

90
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,720
emergency response calls placed from a

91
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,400
cell phone timely. Each of those ways to

92
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,879
chip at the problem led to at least one

93
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,640
company. Your first task in doing

94
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,080
genuine innovation is not solving the

95
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,480
problem. It isn't guessing a single

96
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,360
solution either. It is figuring out what

97
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,680
the problem actually is. There's a way

98
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,239
to do this systematically. It's called

99
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,720
prototyping a problem. the subject of

100
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,720
the next video.
