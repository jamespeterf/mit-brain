Episode

00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,560
10. Go combinatorial.

3
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:19,359
What if the technologies we need to

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,439
solve the big challenges we face ahead

5
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,840
already been invented? How would you

6
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,000
know? I open this series of videos with

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,400
one idea. There are about 40 years of

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,160
technology sitting in the shelf waiting

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,640
to be discovered by a new breed of

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,800
innovators. We are sitting on a gold

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,800
mine of underutilized technologies. That

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,800
is scores of technologies conceived with

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,520
some purpose in mind that did not

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:44,079
materialize as impact in time and now

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,360
languish on the metaphorical shelf. Let

16
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:49,039
me tell you how I came to appreciate

17
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,800
these using an analogy with grilling.

18
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,320
Do you grill your burgers or your

19
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,039
vegetables with the lid of the grill

20
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,360
open or closed? There's a difference

21
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,120
between those two options. Do you close

22
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,520
the lid and wait about 5 minutes until

23
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,520
they're just a turn away from done? Or

24
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,320
do you leave the lid open and admire the

25
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,159
cooking for 15 minutes? Closing the lid

26
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,960
makes all the difference. It recycles

27
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,600
and recombines the heat. Engineers call

28
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,200
that a feedback loop. The more heat you

29
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,159
reuse, the sooner you'll get to enjoy

30
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,880
the juicy burger or vegetable. and the

31
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,320
less energy you will waste. Now that you

32
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,600
have seen the rest of these videos, you

33
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,600
probably know where I'm going with this

34
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,080
analogy. In the old mindset, each

35
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:31,200
technology had one use and problems

36
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,920
could only be solved one way. Then they

37
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,680
were discarded. Discarding ideas is like

38
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,360
cooking with the lid open. Most of the

39
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,000
potential innovations like the heat in

40
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,240
the analogy go to waste. In the new

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
mindset, we have options. You can

42
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,399
repurpose technologies. It is like

43
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,159
cooking with the lid closed. We recycle

44
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,000
and recombine technologies and we stand

45
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,720
to accelerate the rate at which we

46
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,320
explore and understand problems. I first

47
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,920
hinted at some of these ideas in a

48
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,079
concept paper published in epsilon

49
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,520
theory and more recently in a response

50
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,759
to the National Science Foundation

51
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,280
request for information. This has

52
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,360
important implications for how you run

53
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,160
an innovation department for science and

54
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,319
technology agencies for investment firms

55
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,760
and for up andcoming innovators and

56
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:15,920
tinkerers. Imagine if we could bring

57
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,080
this same thinking to solve the

58
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,200
challenges we care about. Climate

59
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,680
change, inequality, education. It's

60
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,640
easy. The cooker is like a problem

61
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,200
solved. The more we ready technology for

62
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,760
reuse, the likelier it is to be employed

63
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,200
usefully to solve problems. And the more

64
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,800
we make those technologies available,

65
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,760
the more we stand to take advantage of

66
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,400
our own diversity of purpose. We are

67
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,080
sitting at top a gold mine. We've barely

68
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,560
scratched the surface of how to usefully

69
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:49,729
employ technologies already invented.
