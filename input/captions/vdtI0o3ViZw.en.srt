00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Episode

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:16,400
one. Congratulations. You are a terrible

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,480
robot. You may already know a lot about

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,080
innovation. Even if you're an expert or

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,600
you have already made millions, for the

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,080
next hour or so, which is what this

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,359
series of videos is meant to last, I ask

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,199
you to open your mind to a new

9
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,199
possibility while I take you through

10
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,279
what we have learned as we have

11
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:35,360
developed and practiced what has become

12
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:37,440
the MIT way to do innovation. Why? There

13
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,280
are well over 40 years worth of

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,840
technology sitting out there on the

15
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,600
proverbial shelf waiting for a new

16
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,160
generation of hands-on innovators,

17
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:49,600
someone like you, to put them to use to

18
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:52,640
make a real problem go away sustainably.

19
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,879
That is for good. It just takes another

20
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,360
innovation mindset. To be clear, I am

21
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,520
not talking about another app or another

22
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,719
social media scheme or yet another

23
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,239
startup pitch. I am inviting you to get

24
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,040
real and to believe there are

25
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,200
technologies out there you can master to

26
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,799
make the problem you care about go away

27
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,280
even if you do not think you have the

28
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,600
right background. Flying cars to solve

29
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,920
traffic local manufacturing to address

30
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,320
inequality. The question isn't whether

31
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,560
the problem you care for can be solved.

32
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,560
Rather the question is how you're going

33
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,200
to do it and which technologies you will

34
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,840
bring together to do it sustainably. You

35
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,520
have plenty of options. We have created

36
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,840
this free video course to share with you

37
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,280
the MIT way of thinking about and doing

38
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,880
innovation. You'll learn about the

39
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,200
mindset we've instilled for nearly two

40
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,799
decades in hundreds of MIT students. It

41
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,520
is based on concepts in the course I

42
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,680
lead called innovation teams or it teams

43
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,840
for short. ITM students learn how to

44
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,240
solve problems with technology and move

45
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,079
technology from lab to impact. Let me

46
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,920
tell you a little about these students.

47
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,280
You might see yourself in them. They

48
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,520
come from all backgrounds and life

49
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,479
experiences ranging from humanities and

50
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,479
business to engineering. Some have been

51
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,719
in industry for years. Some are

52
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:07,200
self-made professionals or entrepreneurs

53
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:09,840
or investors. Some are pursuing a

54
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,480
master's or PhD degree and some have

55
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,800
just started college. When they first

56
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,520
come to IT teams, most have thought and

57
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,720
read about innovation, sometimes a lot.

58
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,000
Through their readings, they've been

59
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,560
trained to think that they are limited

60
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,840
to ideas that fit their background. They

61
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,120
have been told that when it comes to

62
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,959
innovation, they have to find a

63
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:31,040
disruptive idea or to follow recipes

64
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:33,599
with steps like robots do.

65
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,239
Chances are, you have thought or read a

66
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,680
lot about innovation, too. That's fine.

67
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,280
If you're anything like our MIT

68
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,360
students, you will soon discover that

69
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,239
you have been looking at a rather narrow

70
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:48,239
view of innovation, and you're missing

71
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:50,959
out on about 95% of what you can do.

72
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,879
Here's what I mean. If you two have been

73
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,440
thinking about finding the disruptive

74
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:58,319
idea or about applying some step-by-step

75
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,400
innovation recipe like try, fail, rinse,

76
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:03,120
repeat, that sounds like something we

77
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,800
may ask a robot to do. You are missing

78
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:09,040
out. There is more you can do. Humans

79
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,680
make for terrible robots, but we make

80
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,959
great Leonardo da Vinces. Leonardo did

81
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,560
not seem to pay attention to some

82
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,360
difference between the humanities, the

83
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,720
arts, engineering. He treated the world

84
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:23,040
around him as his lab and he invented

85
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,280
technologies, water pumps, flying

86
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,239
machines, painting techniques to make

87
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,159
that world work another way. These

88
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,239
videos present a whole new way to think

89
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,000
about innovation. Innovation understood

90
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,239
as making problems go away with

91
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,080
technology as a tool. To get you there,

92
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,760
we'll give you tips for how to imagine

93
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,200
and make ideas tangible the way

94
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:45,440
generations of creative engineers have.

95
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,760
In the videos, you learn that one

96
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,920
technology can lead to many ventures.

97
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,400
That you do not need to paint every

98
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,480
problem as a catastrophe. That ideas

99
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,480
look different at the start. The best

100
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,720
ideas look rather bad. You learn that

101
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,439
what the real garage culture looks like.

102
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:04,000
How to fund innovation for impact. To

103
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:06,319
prototype problems, not products, and to

104
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,879
progress by being wrong. It may feel

105
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,560
counterintuitive at first. Some of my

106
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,040
students start out thinking the content

107
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,720
is a bit contrarian. But as you watch

108
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,479
it, you'll see it is easy and

109
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,079
straightforward. It only feels

110
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:19,759
counterintuitive because we train our

111
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,840
entire lives to carry out jobs

112
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:25,120
robotically and to try to be right at

113
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,880
every step. You are not a robot. This

114
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,280
mindset for innovating has helped many

115
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,600
of my students start new, highly

116
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,360
innovative companies. Our MIT class and

117
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,240
program has proven quite successful at

118
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,320
moving technology into the world. You

119
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,320
are in the company of thousands of MIT

120
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,320
students.
