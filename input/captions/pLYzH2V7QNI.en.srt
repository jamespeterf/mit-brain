00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,919
One of my favorites, this was my first

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,080
result in this field is the folding cut

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,880
problem. You start with a rectangle of

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,000
paper and you fold it flat. I'm not

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,480
going to make a lot of cuts. I'm just

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,400
going to make one complete straight cut.

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,920
In this case, I get a little swan. And

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,520
general theorem is you can make any

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,520
polygon you want. In fact, you can make

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,519
one cut and make any collection of

11
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,199
polygons you want. So, like on my

12
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,039
website, you can make the MIT logo with

13
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,439
all the little rectangles with one

14
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,279
complete straight cut and the the

15
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,880
outside shape will have holes exactly

16
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,480
where you want them. And uh you can

17
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,640
download this too if you want to impress

18
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,920
all your friends. Especially recommended

19
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,520
for like kids. Um it's a good good magic

20
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,680
trick. In fact, Harry Houdini used to do

21
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,840
this trick in the 20s before he was an

22
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,800
escape artist. He did general magic. Not

23
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,160
this trick. He made stars and we thought

24
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,600
about it and we proved you can make

25
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:57,520
anything. For more MIT moments from MIT
