48
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:16,040
that thank you all right so today I'm

49
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:18,519
GNA cover I'm gonna um span upon our

50
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:21,280
recent efforts on researching

51
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:22,959
differentiable physical sers uh there

52
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,280
lies at the intersection between physic

53
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:28,120
sers automatic differentiation and

54
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,040
flexible software design uh there are

55
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:33,800
several applications that can benefit

56
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:36,519
from in design um particular those that

57
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:39,239
are close to my research interest are

58
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:41,879
pertains to pertain to theral energy

59
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:44,879
harvesting for example we can Harvest

60
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:48,120
our body's here through the soal

61
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:50,480
materials or we can even manage heat in

62
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,000
batteries in electrical vehicle or heat

63
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:56,879
Management in microprocessors or even

64
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,599
designing different layers in AC now

65
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:02,599
what do this uh applications I said uh

66
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:05,159
do this uh

67
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:08,760
physical well uh or what do they need

68
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:11,680
right uh so the starting point is uh

69
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:14,000
given by the plora of popular uh

70
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,879
software for uh for machine learn you're

71
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,400
only aware there are several their like

72
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:22,760
Bor or the whole scientific ml ecosystem

73
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,879
in Julia and Ja more recently and they

74
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,120
all they all have one thing they are

75
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,480
based on automatic differentiation which

76
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:33,360
is the the Cornerstone I would say the

77
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:35,840
king ingredients uh for B propagation uh

78
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,640
which is also call it also

79
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,920
reversible so now I'm going to give a

80
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:42,280
little bit of an introduction to

81
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:45,599
a so let's say we want to define a

82
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:48,879
function FX that takes an input X and it

83
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:51,560
just the sign of it so same X okay

84
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:54,400
automatic differentiation not only

85
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,959
comput this uh this function but also

86
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,640
the gradient of this function and in

87
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,400
particular if you're working on this say

88
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:04,400
a reverse mode automatic differentiation

89
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:07,280
the software also compute the derivative

90
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,200
of c x okay and multiplies by in this

91
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,760
case scaler which comes from the F that

92
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,519
maybe we are composing different

93
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:17,079
functions so we have to use the soal

94
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:19,280
chain rules in particular uh uh strictly

95
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:21,560
speaking what we are working here with

96
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,600
is called Vector products but I don't

97
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:27,440
want to go to technical here um so but

98
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,800
the key the key Point here is that the F

99
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,680
ofx can be really any anything

100
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,840
differentiable right so what if we have

101
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,240
a linear system that we are inverting so

102
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,919
let's say we have a function that invert

103
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,160
a matrix that depends on some parameters

104
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:44,199
and multiplies by this Vector B so this

105
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:46,680
is why right now is the solution of a

106
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:50,919
linear system and why do we care about

107
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:53,120
it it's because most linear systems are

108
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:56,240
they dig the represent of a partial

109
00:04:53,120 --> 00:05:00,240
differential equation and PDS

110
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:03,960
are I would say uh govern the majority

111
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:07,199
of of the physics of okay so if you are

112
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:10,880
able to I would say hijack this machine

113
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:13,919
learning software for Inver sign then we

114
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:16,759
can rely on automatic differentiation to

115
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:20,600
let's say propagate sensitivity from

116
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:23,360
let's say a user defin uh a user def

117
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:26,360
cause function all the way to the of

118
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,600
they going to go through that very quick

119
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:32,680
all right so in this case uh we have as

120
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:36,360
a scen the case above uh the system also

121
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:39,479
the gradient along ra of why and this is

122
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:41,199
done without using this is the key the

123
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:45,120
key

124
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:46,400
Point all right so uh let's make make a

125
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,120
particular case so let's say we have a

126
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,720
material that is described by aous

127
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,319
density raw okay so let's say we have a

128
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:57,639
picture here okay so raw equal to one is

129
00:05:54,319 --> 00:06:00,240
equal that corresponds to a solid phase

130
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:01,919
and equal to zero is a void case

131
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,199
and then we have a solware broadly to

132
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,960
find that in this case a of sare

133
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:07,720
actually and then we compute the

134
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:11,520
effective term of conductivity so this

135
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:13,360
is what this is called forward model so

136
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,759
we have the material and then we compute

137
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,680
a property of

138
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:19,120
that but eventually ultimately we are

139
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,639
interested in going the other way around

140
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,280
let say we want a material that with a

141
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:25,400
prescribed effective th here could be

142
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:29,840
also linear

143
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:34,919
elasticity and so yeah um so what how we

144
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:37,599
do that well uh so let's say we um um we

145
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:40,160
have a so we begin with theti density

146
00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:42,199
raw and we Sol the linear system and

147
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,560
then we Define a cost function that

148
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:47,240
depends on those parameters raw of theal

149
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:50,639
density raw and the the solution of our

150
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:52,479
leing system now to do inverse design

151
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,400
what we need ultimately is the gradient

152
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:57,720
as I said along RW of G it turns out

153
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,639
that if you apply a reverse mode

154
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,599
automatic differentiation to a linear

155
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:05,800
system and so basically we are doing an

156
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:08,199
analytical derivative uh it turns out

157
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:11,240
that what we have to do is to just solve

158
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:13,400
an additional linear Sol and then we get

159
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:16,680
the sensitivity of the cost function

160
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:19,440
with respect to each pixel of our tises

161
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:23,720
density and I think this is a pretty

162
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:26,319
remarkable result imagine that the

163
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:28,039
thetive would be for example to comp the

164
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,680
this gradient with Planet differences

165
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:34,639
which of course scale scales very

166
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:37,319
badly and so this is not new uh the the

167
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:40,000
the method behind called Joint method

168
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:43,360
has been applied for decades mechanics

169
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,319
and also more recently in Optics from

170
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:50,159
group Stanford the group of Professor

171
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:52,360
Johnson here at but the key Innovation

172
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:55,960
brought by this machine learning

173
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:59,919
software uh uh the machine learning

174
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:04,520
packages that now we can uh compose uh

175
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:06,520
user Define uh cause functions with uh

176
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:08,960
you know arbitrary differentiable cost

177
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,919
functions with uh with our physics sare

178
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,599
so we can iterate research we can

179
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:15,080
research much quicker without doing the

180
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:17,159
derivative by hands all the time and

181
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:19,240
also there are also problems that are

182
00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:20,840
domain dependent for example we're GNA

183
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:24,280
see through this

184
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:27,319
talk talk about Nill transer where

185
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:30,560
inverted sign not only need the adjoint

186
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:33,120
me but also a mat

187
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:36,039
interpolation that correlates the the

188
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,760
links the physics of your problems with

189
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:40,240
with the with the St all right so this

190
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,120
just a little example just a quick

191
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,040
example of microscopic in transport so

192
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:48,080
say we want to Des an autop material

193
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:51,200
that meta material this Cas perodic in

194
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,880
all directions that differently along

195
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,959
all those three directions so here we

196
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:58,320
have for example the desire ter

197
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,920
conductivity here we Define this uh this

198
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,800
this cost function so you eventually

199
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:05,240
what you want to do is to G find draw

200
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:09,560
right the Min

201
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:13,360
G okay all right so and so this is the

202
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:17,880
evolution of the trajectory this is just

203
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:19,480
microscopy just an idea see here we have

204
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,640
the three values so here we have the

205
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:25,360
term of probity for those three values

206
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:27,959
the diagonal so the diagonal

207
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:31,360
Z if you want and we see the three

208
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:31,360
numbers converting

209
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:39,399
Des eventually the material you're here

210
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:43,760
on the left side has the desire effect

211
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:45,600
in all right so how do we use it uh how

212
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,240
do we use this framework for the

213
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,120
application about in this case th

214
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,360
Harvest so let's let me give you a

215
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:56,240
little introduction about thric so

216
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:59,640
thermetrics is it's a f not as known as

217
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,920
photo but um

218
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,959
the a are converting he directly into

219
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,760
electricity by using solid state

220
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:10,760
material so no flexible part no noise

221
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:12,920
and so on and uh materials have been uh

222
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:17,000
used very heavily in space craft for

223
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:19,720
example the Voyager space grab was byasa

224
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:23,560
two decades ago the outer space has been

225
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:24,959
Power by a generator where theour is

226
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,600
given

227
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:30,720
by that

228
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:35,000
case um but also reaching some materials

229
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:38,200
for converting our bod the issue that

230
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,079
this this technolog is not as wi spread

231
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:44,160
asv1 is that efficienc is very low

232
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:45,360
because in atic material we want a low

233
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,760
and high

234
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:52,279
electrical and unfortunately at a high C

235
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:54,560
which is a the temperature responds to

236
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:56,600
the water responds to navigation

237
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,040
different temperature and all those

238
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,440
parameters are interrelated one emerging

239
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,959
part is given by Nan structuring that

240
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,680
enables to destroy heat transport more

241
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:07,600
effectively than he does with electronic

242
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,279
transort so if we have a a

243
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,680
characteristic size of a nanomaterial

244
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,959
let say about 100 nanometers heat heat

245
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,480
carriers in this case given by phom are

246
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:17,920
destroyed much more than electrical

247
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,600
electrical

248
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,720
carers whose me path for example is much

249
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:27,000
smaller than the

250
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:29,639
characteristics sides so power El high

251
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,880
it's about

252
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:35,160
just the average distance between two

253
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:38,079
consecutive conditions so by properly

254
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:43,279
engineering a material we can suppress

255
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:46,680
he byly by not suppressing trans as so

256
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:48,839
this the called zp that eventually goes

257
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:52,600
into the expression of the

258
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:55,440
system uh is is is the one that we need

259
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:59,639
to um boost and and

260
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:01,760
maximize um so this uh so as you can

261
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:04,480
imagine shape here is very important the

262
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:07,720
shape really detes the stand of boundary

263
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,839
scattering the stand of scattering B at

264
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:12,680
the boundaries of our our materials and

265
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:15,639
in fact the key Point here is that at

266
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:20,760
the Nanos scales he transport does not

267
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:24,480
obey food is food is not any um so there

268
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:27,920
is an incre there is a a dominant uh

269
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:30,320
there is I would say um a significant

270
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:33,040
contribution given by

271
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:36,920
thatat clearly by this law so we have to

272
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:38,760
use another model talk about very very

273
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:41,079
soon so here you can see that by just

274
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:43,800
changing the arrangement of of pores in

275
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:47,639
se you have a wide range of effect in

276
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:50,880
ter this is new to microscopic f for

277
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:53,399
sure because we have different different

278
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:56,760
uh geometries and different material and

279
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:58,880
let's say different fori here but also

280
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:02,079
uh this is due to the different strength

281
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:04,079
of of of scattering components and at

282
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,320
the boundaries all right so here in this

283
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:08,120
design is to go the other way around is

284
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,399
to find the perfect shape or an idea

285
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:13,480
shape or one of the optimal shapes that

286
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:15,399
can minimize the Thal conductivity while

287
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:17,079
keeping the electrical conductivity

288
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:20,800
above a certain

289
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:23,519
pressure and just yesterday a very nice

290
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,839
paper came out in science showing

291
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:28,839
corroborating the fact that indeed food

292
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:31,279
is lo and anos is violated here is the

293
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:33,320
Cor responding to this law for

294
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:37,079
electrical currents here the researcher

295
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:40,639
from eth measure uh vortices electrical

296
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:43,959
vertices at the nanoscale in graphy um

297
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:46,839
of course vertices is an hamic is not

298
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:49,440
covered by F law however it is covered

299
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:51,959
by a more fundamental law that is called

300
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,399
that is given by the bation so it turns

301
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:56,959
out that if you work with the B transp

302
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:59,880
equation and you comp the moments of it

303
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:02,000
you can end up with some terms that

304
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:04,480
resemble

305
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,360
the all right so if you buy a license

306
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,800
from conso you're going to get this

307
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:11,040
equation which is PR SL but over the

308
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:15,639
past I would say a decade I've been uh

309
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:17,600
involved in developing uh models and and

310
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:21,839
software for

311
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:23,959
the way more complex I'm not going go

312
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,000
the details but one thing I want to say

313
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:28,240
that the input parameters here are given

314
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,720
by first for calculations for example

315
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,880
computed by

316
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:34,279
here so for the remaining of this talk

317
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,360
I'm going to I'm going to solve this

318
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:38,839
equation here but very simpli for for

319
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:43,240
this we fure this equation in the more

320
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:45,199
complex uh form that eventually can also

321
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:48,720
include

322
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:51,800
the but for the propos a very simplified

323
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:55,399
version this all right so here we have

324
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:59,199
some not clearly clear s hamic signature

325
00:14:55,399 --> 00:15:01,720
of Transport so we have FL here that

326
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,839
possible flux in fields and here finally

327
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,839
we are able

328
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:10,360
toes in the structure that is similar to

329
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:11,920
those computed by uh measure from the

330
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:16,920
that I just shown so it means that the

331
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:19,759
model is doing the job inting non K

332
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:22,800
signature all right U and this is the

333
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:24,680
code of open BT that uh the Implements

334
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,480
of these models and also be used for

335
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:30,120
predicting material properties but also

336
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,120
for regarding experiments

337
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,639
going so let's see how can Inver sign

338
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:37,040
help us here so in this case the

339
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:39,680
optimization problem so here on on the

340
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,160
left side we have the Baseline okay and

341
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,959
to with an

342
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:47,839
Associated uh electrical conductivity

343
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:51,240
here called f chance just diffusive and

344
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:53,639
here we have 0.31 this normalized values

345
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,759
and the goal here is to minimize the

346
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:58,319
thermal conductivity computed by the BP

347
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:00,199
while keeping this thres above the one

348
00:15:58,319 --> 00:16:02,199
of the Bas so essentially the question

349
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:03,519
is we have a material so the problem

350
00:16:02,199 --> 00:16:05,759
that we trying to solve here is we have

351
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:08,079
a material with the given electrical

352
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,399
conductivity and th conductivity how

353
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,560
long can you go with the termal

354
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:12,759
conductivity while keeping the

355
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,360
electrical conductivity above a c fure

356
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:17,279
this is uh this can be nicely FR in a

357
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,399
constraint ofation problem where both

358
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:21,880
the F diffusive and the bers are

359
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:24,199
differenti in a way that I just shown so

360
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,199
we can

361
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:31,680
use all right so this is the evolution

362
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,680
uh

363
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:37,600
the evolution the

364
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:40,880
optimization um and then after say 100

365
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:43,639
iterations we end up with a structure

366
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:46,440
that is made by Islands connected by

367
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:48,519
Bridges and now in a in a hand side is

368
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:51,720
okay this makes sense because if you

369
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:54,759
have a bridge the f f transport the F

370
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:57,360
transport is not is not as affected as

371
00:16:54,759 --> 00:17:00,279
the B so the ratio between the two vales

372
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,759
goes goes out okay so this probably

373
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:03,839
something that intuition might have come

374
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,880
up with but I mean I haven't before

375
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:08,160
doing this this problem you know it's

376
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:10,000
it's very easy to say after we say oh

377
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,880
okay that makes sense right but but

378
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,079
thankfully than this large scale inter

379
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:19,600
design problem we can uh outour some of

380
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:23,760
the ination say computer all right so

381
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:26,520
and and we fabricate this m ning Focus I

382
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:29,919
this are our collaboration uh with

383
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:32,720
Professor can professor

384
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:35,480
Johnson here and and

385
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:38,480
also from now

386
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:41,480
profess so essentially here uh we have a

387
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:46,000
two N 200 nanom Big silicon membrane

388
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:51,039
bombarded by ions and uh and uh using

389
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:55,360
the the feed from M here the the um the

390
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:58,280
purose distance is about

391
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:02,000
100 and so now the next step will be

392
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:05,520
just to evaluate or to measure

393
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:09,919
the experiment and the the prediction it

394
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:11,640
turns out that we are close to the so

395
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,000
there is a a qualitative agreement

396
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,799
between experiments and Theory here as

397
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,640
you can see a part

398
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:21,480
two is there and the reason we suspected

399
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:24,679
the reason this this little discrepancy

400
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:27,200
I mean this discrepancy is due uh to

401
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:29,559
some numerical issues uh some numerical

402
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,720
this even is due to the numerical

403
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:34,360
distrib in the reci space that we are

404
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,360
trying out

405
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:40,919
to okay but but at least here we have

406
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:43,360
very nice so this the trend is is

407
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:45,320
respected and and and so we're very

408
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,600
excited about this and that's what we

409
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,559
are moving forward now to the next

410
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,559
challenge the next challenge is the

411
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:55,080
minimum length scale con straint so as

412
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:56,919
we noticed yes we got four I I I didn't

413
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:59,840
say that actually we have a fourfold

414
00:18:56,919 --> 00:19:03,880
increase in ZT here however it expands

415
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:06,320
at a smaller at at a smaller P size so

416
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:09,080
feature L however it would be desirable

417
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:12,159
to actually have some degree of control

418
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:14,520
of that fion left and it turns out that

419
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:16,640
Um this can be nicely framed in a

420
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,360
constraint optimization problem where

421
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,799
the constraints the inquality

422
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:22,799
constraints depend of functions called

423
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:24,360
indicator function that measure your

424
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:26,559
characteristic

425
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:29,559
L and and this has been applied in

426
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:32,240
mechanics again in Optics and now we are

427
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:36,320
doing it in in N

428
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:40,520
scale um so uh so the next challenge was

429
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:42,360
to uh design in a material with a given

430
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:45,840
uh manufacturable constraints in that

431
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:48,360
case we uh were able uh to get 60

432
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,840
nanometers by the way this is this work

433
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:53,440
has is

434
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:56,440
really has been so the the measurements

435
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:59,320
the the Fabrications be driven by by y

436
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:01,640
from from right that is managing reion

437
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,640
and we have a post iteration and it was

438
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,159
very nice you know was very nice

439
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,480
interuption you would say okay you can

440
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:08,679
get a manufacturable constraint down to

441
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,600
6 nanometers that we get this we would

442
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:14,400
put this number in our Sol and we come

443
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:16,240
up with a with a a new structure um so

444
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,520
16 nanometers are the thickness now the

445
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:22,200
membrane is 50 and

446
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:24,240
here can maximize directly this ratio

447
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:27,200
you know the El conductivity over there

448
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:29,400
thermal condu and we obtain stres like

449
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,240
this and this is indeed 69 so the

450
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,600
manufactur strain is being fully

451
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:37,880
respected and now we are measuring and

452
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:40,919
here we obtain even larger um even

453
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:43,919
larger thermal conductivity boost in in

454
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:47,000
Z so we're very excited about this and

455
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:50,679
and measurements are ongoing right now

456
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:54,240
much we can have a better match in this

457
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:57,200
case all right so um yes so let's talk

458
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,720
about uh the second uh application case

459
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,720
so I would say the the the the the

460
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,280
titles are not the slides are associated

461
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,720
this uh titles are not uniformly uh

462
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,720
spaced so don't worry so Chip is going

463
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,400
to be four

464
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:12,480
slides and that's it all right so how

465
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:17,080
can we use um lingers design and terat

466
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:19,360
for to make our micros so uh our chips

467
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:21,919
get less C okay so there is a new

468
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:25,320
paradigm emerging recently based on

469
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:27,520
chiplet instead of having a a monol chip

470
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:31,200
we can uh just

471
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:33,440
integrate chiplets that are chips that

472
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:36,600
but there are task optimized so we have

473
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,840
a chiplet for Io a chiplet for for for

474
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,880
memory and so on and for Compu right so

475
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:43,200
and then those can come from different

476
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,200
uh manufactur

477
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,840
manufacturers and so they have to agree

478
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:51,440
to S of standard standard in terms of of

479
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:53,720
communication and this has great uh

480
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,960
benefits in terms of modularity of

481
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:57,679
course cost efficiency and so on and

482
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:00,200
another benefit is that we can move them

483
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:01,960
around now in order to minimize the max

484
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:04,760
temperature so what we want is that when

485
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:06,919
the chip is operating the maximum uh

486
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:09,120
operational speed so they get very H we

487
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:10,720
want to move them around of course we

488
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,679
move them around only once when we do

489
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:17,400
that when when when we make the chip uh

490
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:19,480
and and and in order to minimize the max

491
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:22,600
how do we do this Wells out that we can

492
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:25,159
use what I just uh

493
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:28,760
describe so let's PR the problem so

494
00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:32,400
let's say uh the fundry um in this case

495
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:36,159
we C with IBM so let's say the IBM

496
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:38,520
found tell that they have a set of

497
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:43,279
chiplets that are connected through this

498
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:45,440
agency M Matrix AJ so say chip in this

499
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:49,520
case chiplet Zero is connected to chip

500
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:54,400
one and each shiplet adds as their own

501
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:57,400
as its own sites LX and L Y and very

502
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:59,320
importantly each uh chiplet is assigned

503
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:03,720
a a power

504
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:08,080
uh a power generator okay by je C so the

505
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:09,400
problem here is to to minimize the

506
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,520
maximum temperature unfortunately

507
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,320
maximum temperature is not

508
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:16,559
differentiable but there are many tricks

509
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:19,240
one of them is is using the P so

510
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:21,080
essentially if you take this let's say

511
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:23,240
the the temperature vector and you

512
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:25,440
elevate each element to a very high

513
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:28,120
number and then you do the square root

514
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,640
of that high number I would say Okay um

515
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:33,520
or one over Alpha be more more more

516
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:36,320
precise you get the max approximately

517
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:38,960
the Max and this is different this is a

518
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:41,720
concept that I borrow from another work

519
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:44,080
based on connectivity constraint and and

520
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:46,440
so all right so this is

521
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:48,279
differentiable another problem that we

522
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:50,200
wanted to uh there are other two

523
00:23:48,279 --> 00:23:52,480
problems here how do how do we account

524
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:56,159
for heat dissipation to the substrate

525
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:59,799
while keep it simulation domain to uh

526
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:01,480
like after some simple algebra and and

527
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:04,400
consideration it turns out that we can

528
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:08,880
use an effective heat syn here is given

529
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:12,159
by L gamma T gamma isent that we can CH

530
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:14,400
and depends on the

531
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,840
substrate property in fact if I mean if

532
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,400
you move this on the other side has a

533
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:20,720
minus sign so it is an effect sync and

534
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,039
here okay so that part is taking into

535
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,120
account here on the right hand side we

536
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:27,520
have a smed version of the heat SCE so

537
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:29,320
we can just have step like heat SCE

538
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:32,399
given by chip let what we smoo them out

539
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:35,679
with 2 the function given by

540
00:24:32,399 --> 00:24:37,279
H and um so now the problem is end to

541
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:40,080
end differential so we have the degree

542
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:43,320
of Freedom the position reach cheap this

543
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:47,279
right side is differentiable once we get

544
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:50,080
T and T with respect to P is uh is this

545
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:53,159
is even easier than PR sign because the

546
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,720
MX a Now does not even depend on on the

547
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:56,960
degree of Freedom we can just invert it

548
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:59,360
once and reduceing our reducing it

549
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:03,000
during our optimization all right let's

550
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:05,840
go to the by no another thing um we also

551
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:10,159
have to make sure that the cheaps do not

552
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:11,399
overlap we uh we use this uh inequality

553
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,880
constraint I'm not going to go into

554
00:25:11,399 --> 00:25:17,840
details but also we have to Ure that the

555
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:20,159
uh the maximum wirelength doesn't exceed

556
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:22,600
that so those are two in constraints

557
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:25,480
that we take in in our optimization

558
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:27,520
problem so let's say uh this is a design

559
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:29,240
given by intuition where they hit the

560
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,120
maximum Peak is

561
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:34,200
166

562
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:36,440
k h from from from environmental

563
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:40,080
temperature if we don't use the wildel

564
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:43,399
constraint we have uh this design uh

565
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:46,559
where actually we got a a peak that is

566
00:25:43,399 --> 00:25:48,640
40 degre uh smaller and if we had to

567
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:50,240
compromise a little bit because take we

568
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,360
want to take into account the max left

569
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:56,120
constraint we have this other scenario

570
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:58,760
where we have a little bit other harder

571
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:01,360
uh maximum harder environment

572
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:04,080
um for chip sorry but you know at least

573
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,559
here we are respecting the mass V so

574
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:13,039
it's kind of we have to play these

575
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:16,200
numbers and all right so um all right so

576
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:17,760
um all right so we have I'm not going to

577
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,520
go into details but we have some future

578
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,480
directions that I would like to talk

579
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:26,039
about so one uh uh that direction is

580
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:28,080
given by uh transformation Optics um so

581
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:29,880
essentially this is a very nice result

582
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,480
uh

583
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:34,000
where where where let's say you want

584
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:35,919
heat FL not going in certain directions

585
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,080
and you can change the metric of your

586
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,559
system it turns out that once you do

587
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,320
that your the functional form of your

588
00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:43,840
equation for Optics and therat Remains

589
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,840
the Same so we can use the same solver

590
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,679
on a

591
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:50,360
different with the space dependent space

592
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:53,520
dependent uh in this case therac so we

593
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:54,799
are using we are now the issue is that

594
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,640
though to find the space dependent

595
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:59,600
thermal conductivity you had to compute

596
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,799
a lot of many ja and so on so we like to

597
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:04,919
do it with automatic differentiation so

598
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:06,559
so here um this is one type of one line

599
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:08,880
of research and second line of research

600
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:11,520
here is that to do topology

601
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,320
timization so we we don't use

602
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:16,200
transformation Optics but we do topology

603
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:17,679
ofation in order to have in this case we

604
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:20,279
have a thermac clock so we want to have

605
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:22,919
external temperature equal to the case

606
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:25,760
where the the obstacle were there this

607
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:28,600
is too much now I just wanted to throw

608
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:30,120
it out there um so this is where

609
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,520
automatic differentiation can have in

610
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:35,279
two

611
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:38,200
ways another another case uh another

612
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:41,200
project that that we are working on is

613
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,880
to extend ass sign from a pure space

614
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,960
mulated material a case where the

615
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,360
materials are mulated in space and time

616
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,320
for example we can modulate the local th

617
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,120
contivity time just by shining it and

618
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:53,000
there are many papers coming up now

619
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:56,600
where damun

620
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,919
ter and what do we care about well there

621
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:01,480
are some uh recent studies is shown that

622
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:03,840
you can really uh en the physics that

623
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:05,240
you want to to to give your metam

624
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,240
material for example instead of having a

625
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:11,279
space interface you can have a Time

626
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:13,679
interface okay so so it's a it's a Well

627
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:17,000
we have a material that abruptly change

628
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:18,600
time um so the question is natural uh so

629
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,559
the natural question here is how to

630
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:23,919
extend the you know invers design space

631
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:26,600
and time so here we have a simple case

632
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:30,080
let's say we have a a material where we

633
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:32,799
want to state state temper pressure

634
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,799
here part a certain number so let's say

635
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:38,000
we are keeping this material at just at

636
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:41,120
the beginning and we want to have a uh

637
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,039
the final temperature equal to uh a

638
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:46,200
given number and here we have the time

639
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:48,840
dependent n that we designed in to

640
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:51,799
shrink the the channel and to keep the

641
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:54,200
material at a given temperature okay

642
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:57,840
this is a Time depend problem and then

643
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:58,840
the last SL all right I think you're one

644
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:02,000
minut

645
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:03,720
um a software all right so all those

646
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,919
applications share the same software

647
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:08,840
infrastructures uh

648
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:10,799
infrastructure uh uh which turns out

649
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:13,279
very useful if you want to extend it for

650
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:15,600
to M problem so and then the software

651
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:17,519
now is called is that M inverse so

652
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:20,200
essentially takes an inut manufactural

653
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:24,480
constraint and and it and it

654
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:27,159
orchestrates different solers uh that uh

655
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:29,000
each of them influenced by depend

656
00:29:27,159 --> 00:29:31,600
influenced by the parameter the raw in

657
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:35,279
this case which is the material density

658
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:37,120
and and uh so from this is and from the

659
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:39,159
user point of view what they have to do

660
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:41,559
is just to write arbitary differentiable

661
00:29:39,159 --> 00:29:43,480
cost function uh that depends on the

662
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:46,480
output of those sers in this case for

663
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:49,799
example we want to miniz the norm or Dem

664
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:51,480
contivity with respect yes okay the norm

665
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:53,640
of the difference theity with the

666
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,480
desired this only thing that the user

667
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:58,919
has

668
00:29:54,480 --> 00:30:02,240
to and uh in fact M inverse uh has been

669
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:04,600
uh now used for all these applications

670
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:09,880
uh that I I talked about and now we also

671
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:13,240
breaking uh data to to M to to benefit

672
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:16,799
all the routines that the ma is offering

673
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:19,559
um so um I I would like to uh conclude

674
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:23,320
by saying that essentially here we using

675
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:27,000
uh software like jacks or or scientific

676
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:30,240
ml uh from from Julia for example right

677
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:34,399
so that originally okay for example Jack

678
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:36,679
or or pych or or tensor that originally

679
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:38,679
been designed from neet for machine

680
00:30:36,679 --> 00:30:42,360
learning and we are we are hijacking

681
00:30:38,679 --> 00:30:44,480
that okay to use it for for for physics

682
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:48,880
if you notice there was no NE Network

683
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:52,600
here right just using the auto automatic

684
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:56,120
differentiation and and and but you know

685
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:58,799
as our sers are are differentiable we

686
00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:00,840
can compose them with networks to

687
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:03,720
supplement with the lack of knowledge

688
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:04,960
let's say we don't have part of uh uh we

689
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,639
know everything about the system except

690
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,960
for few things and then we can

691
00:31:06,639 --> 00:31:11,679
supplement those few things with a

692
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:14,240
surate so uh based on your so this class

693
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:17,519
of sers then can be composed and can

694
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:19,519
bearm existing sugar all right thank you

695
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:23,559
very

696
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:25,240
much thank you jepe so I I think we have

697
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:27,279
a few minutes 10 minutes now for

698
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:32,039
questions if people have uh questions I

699
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:34,679
don't see any in the in the chat uh yet

700
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:38,000
or the Q&A you can type them or you can

701
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:41,760
also click the raise hand button uh if

702
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,760
you want to ask a question uh

703
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:49,519
verbally so well people are thinking let

704
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:51,159
me ask a question so you know the ad

705
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:52,760
Frameworks a lot of them they were

706
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:54,519
designed a lot of them are designed

707
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:56,159
right now primarily for machine learning

708
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:59,480
applications of people using for the

709
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:02,519
things and for so for for doing them for

710
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:04,120
scientific Computing are there places

711
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:06,279
where they fall down where you have to

712
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:10,760
you know supplement them with manually

713
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:12,279
written uh chain rules uh I mean what's

714
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:14,360
what's the main weakness of those things

715
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:15,960
when you apply them to to to these these

716
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:17,960
kind of very non-neural Network like

717
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:20,120
competions yeah yeah this is very

718
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:23,279
question yes uh you had to supplement

719
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:26,760
with with custom in this case cting

720
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:29,360
product certain for example in this case

721
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:32,120
in in one case uh for example the the

722
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:35,880
the whole join meth the whole thing that

723
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:38,080
has to be hardcoded in as we speak uh in

724
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:41,840
some cases you can rely on the

725
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:44,159
infrastructure itself but uh for example

726
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:47,320
in my case as we speak I had to come out

727
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:50,799
with my for example if we have a a l

728
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:53,159
system that we want to Sol right um so

729
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:54,760
it might happen that the first guess

730
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:56,080
that we want in the back pass is

731
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:58,039
different from the first guess that we

732
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:01,760
want from the forward pass so we can can

733
00:32:58,039 --> 00:33:04,480
just use uh the the the iterative

734
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:06,679
solware even if they use the AJ method

735
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,240
underneath you just can use it directly

736
00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:10,639
because we have different for gases in

737
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:15,519
that case we have to we have to include

738
00:33:10,639 --> 00:33:17,480
our own our own custom back produ

739
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:18,760
another point I wanted to say is that

740
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,880
sometimes we don't even have the the

741
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:22,679
problem is SE joint so we don't have to

742
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:26,200
compute The Joint but the system does

743
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:27,799
not recognize it so uh so we had to do

744
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:31,440
for example when I was when we actually

745
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:36,440
we were working on N for couple years

746
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:38,440
ago for for for um periodic materials uh

747
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:40,760
at some point I realized that they joint

748
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:44,279
with just some slight manipulation of

749
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:48,240
the over model and so I didn't have to

750
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:50,960
compute it again um but if we just use

751
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,840
plain machine learning uh automatic

752
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,159
differentiation framework the system

753
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:59,720
would not realize that that we just

754
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:59,720
waste so there are few things that

755
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,320
all right are there any other

756
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:14,079
questions you can raise your hand or or

757
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,079
type them in and I'll read them out

758
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:40,000
okay so then um I think I we'll close

759
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:43,720
the uh the webinar now uh so I want to

760
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:46,040
mention there is a um an an upcoming

761
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:47,240
talk on June 11th is the next talk by

762
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:50,280

769
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:07,720
exploration speaker back on March 31st

770
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:09,000

771
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:12,400
now he's going to give a Reflections

772
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,079

a PhD candidate to now being a CTO of

775
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:23,280

776
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:26,040
will be the last seminar uh of this

777
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:28,480
