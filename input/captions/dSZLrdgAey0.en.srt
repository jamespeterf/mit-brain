5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,359
I started off by being a CIRC scholar

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,359
last year and decided that I would want

7
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,920
to do it again this year. And the reason

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,359
was I originally came to MIT just

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,119
knowing that there were really big

10
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,080
pressing challenges within the space of

11
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,760
computing, artificial intelligence and

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,079
all kinds of developments in society

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,000
that we need to really have a pulse on.

14
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,399
I found that being a circ scholar has

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,680
really given me the opportunity to work

16
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,680
with some of the brightest minds here on

17
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,600
campus and really advance a bit of

18
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,239
research in whatever way possible.

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,160
>> I thought that the mandate of CIRC was

20
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,520
so interesting and unique. The idea of

21
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,760
blending like social and ethical

22
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,360
responsibility with the accelerating

23
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,199
amount of computing work that we're

24
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,879
doing in the area was really exciting.

25
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,719
Um, and I also like the mentorship

26
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,719
aspect. You got a lot of one-on-one time

27
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,160
with your research adviser and got to

28
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,359
work in a group setting. And I thought

29
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,719
both of those were things I really

30
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,879
enjoyed this semester.

31
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:08,720
>> CIRC offers one of the few opportunities

32
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:11,439
at MIT to think very seriously about how

33
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:14,640
scientific research can be used um on

34
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:17,360
the plane of ethics and the public good.

35
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,600
Um so we spent you know an entire year

36
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,119
thinking hard about how are these

37
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,720
technologies that you know people are

38
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,479
working on very hard at universities

39
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:29,200
like MIT how can we use them responsibly

40
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:32,079
well um in a way that promotes values

41
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,320
like democracy and good decision-m um so

42
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,759
I think it really is where you can bring

43
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,920
some of those more fundamental human

44
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:41,079
questions um onto the science that we do

45
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,079
so well.

46
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,079
Oh, it's been wonderful. Um, every

47
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:51,360
single week we get to meet with our um,

48
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:53,920
CIRC fellow and we get to, you know,

49
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,320
have great conversations, read read

50
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,320
journal articles. Um, and and we got to

51
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,320
conduct our own study, design it, um,

52
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,920
see it through to the end and that's not

53
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,079
an opportunity you get so often as an

54
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,320
undergraduate to really um, study

55
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,360
exactly what you care about. So, it was

56
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,840
wonderful.

57
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:13,280
>> I thought it was amazing. I was lucky

58
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,360
that my adviser was like very very

59
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,879
dedicated to helping us understand every

60
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,840
single step. So he walked us through

61
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:21,280
papers. He had us run code ourselves and

62
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,800
then when we went into the part where we

63
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,879
started doing our independent projects,

64
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,879
he was there every step of the way. So I

65
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,640
think it's a great way to learn really

66
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,800
quickly and rigorously but also feel

67
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:34,200
like you're truly understanding the work

68
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,200
that you're doing.

69
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:42,239
[Music]

70
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,480
I think I would say to be open. Uh all

71
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,239
of the different project areas are so

72
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,080
different. Um and I picked one that

73
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,920
wasn't really a huge intersection with

74
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,440
the work that I do, but I feel like I

75
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,840
was able to grow a lot as a researcher

76
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,680
and do work that I'm proud of. So I

77
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,879
think what CIRC is about is trying new

78
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,480
things and trying to make the world a

79
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,160
better place. So I think that is

80
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,159
something I would recommend. I would say

81
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,840
for future scholars definitely

82
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,400
understand that coming in with a

83
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,239
research question is very valid but also

84
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,319
understand that the world changes a lot

85
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,720
faster than us coming in with just one

86
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,319
idea. Read as much as you can. Talk to

87
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,840
people who work in the field currently.

88
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,599
It's really good that you're at MIT so

89
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,000
you have a lot of resources available

90
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,159
and definitely just reflect on what you

91
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,760
learn. Apply that forward and really try

92
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,760
to see how things will evolve in the

93
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,760
future.
