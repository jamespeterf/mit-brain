1
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:11,400
I will introduce the next faculty

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:15,279
speaker Dr Stacy Springs is exact

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:19,039
director at MIT Center for biomedical

4
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:21,279
Innovation St Stacy studied in Japan

5
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:24,720
during the summer in

6
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:28,080
2095 and this is her first time back to

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:31,119
Japan since then Stacy we talk about

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,920
innovation in manufacturing biom

9
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:36,760
and uh also uh friendly reminder to use

10
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,680
a pigon horse during her presentation

11
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:43,680
for if you have any questions so please

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,680
join me welcoming Stacy on the

13
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:55,760
stage uh hi gas it's really wonderful to

14
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:58,239
be here thank you so much uh for the

15
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:01,000
invitation uh it's my pleasure to tell

16
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:03,600
you a little bit about the It Center for

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,840
biomedical Innovation specifically we're

18
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,720
going to be talking about uh the

19
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,680
manufacturing or production of

20
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,439
biopharmaceuticals and innovation in

21
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:16,960
doing that uh in the next 30 minutes or

22
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:19,560
so and um I want

23
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,439
to just give you a little bit of a a

24
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,600
heads up on what we're going to talk

25
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,240
about so I'll first just introduce you

26
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,520
to the center and its

27
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:29,920
activities then we'll talk a little bit

28
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,680
about uh the challenges of man

29
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,840
manufacturing biologic medicines and

30
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:37,040
then we will go through as much as time

31
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:40,159
will allow some of cbi's

32
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,520
biomanufacturing research which includes

33
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:46,360
quite a bit of uh modeling including

34
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:49,880
mechanistic modeling to inform our

35
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:52,759
approaches to being able to intensify

36
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:55,200
the process of manufacturing

37
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:58,000
biopharmaceuticals uh the development of

38
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,840
of Novel process analytical Technologies

39
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,840
and also rapid safety testing

40
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:11,599
so the CBI has been at at MIT since

41
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:14,280
2005 and the uh the center was really

42
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:17,640
formed um with the idea of bringing

43
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:20,000
together uh investigators both internal

44
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:22,080
to MIT and external to MIT and

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,959
collaborative Innovation

46
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,519
initiatives over time um what we've

47
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,959
become I think is a collaboration engine

48
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:33,720
at MIT where we are developing V in and

49
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,360
adopting uh and moving toward adoption

50
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,319
Advanced biomanufacturing approaches

51
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,319
through both uh development and

52
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,640
demonstration of new technologies that

53
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,360
are fit for purpose and poised for

54
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,480
translation into industry practice as

55
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:51,480
well as working with industry to

56
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:54,400
establish consensus positions uh across

57
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,319
biomanufacturing approaches uh that can

58
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,560
AC you know accelerate the uptake of new

59
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:02,000
technologies across organizations or in

60
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,680
some cases uh can provide new ways of

61
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,680
drugs being

62
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:10,720
regulated so uh this is just another way

63
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,799
to look at our Center we are working to

64
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,920
implement Implement and improve Global

65
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:16,319
Health by overcoming obstacles to

66
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:19,720
development and implementation of

67
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:23,440
biomedical Innovation we primarily work

68
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:26,560
uh in the let's see if I can make this

69
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,439
yeah in this space of uh development and

70
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,400
Manufacturing distribution and Global

71
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:32,920
delivery and a little bit on the

72
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,680
downstream activities but primarily in

73
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:38,640
coming up with ways to improve our

74
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,640
ability to do drug safety

75
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:46,760
surveillance so um I would say that we

76
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,120
are primarily focused on

77
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:51,959
biomanufacturing Innovation data

78
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,319
analytics and Regulatory science and

79
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:57,799
everything we do we have an eye toward

80
00:03:54,319 --> 00:04:01,519
trying to improve the access to biologic

81
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:05,280
medicines which are uh expensive to make

82
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:07,439
and uh difficult for um all all persons

83
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,280
to have access to so we want to be able

84
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:13,200
to lower the cost while increasing or

85
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:16,040
maintaining the quality of these

86
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:19,000
medicines we do this through three sets

87
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:22,040
of activities uh pre-competitive

88
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,280
collaboration with industry partners and

89
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:27,720
sometimes with the regulatory Community

90
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:30,600
through a portfolio of educational

91
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:33,680
opportunities uh for practitioners as

92
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,320
well as resident Learners at MIT and

93
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,240
then through our research portfolio so

94
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,919
I'll give you a brief overview of what

95
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,639
we're doing in the pre-competitive space

96
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:42,039
and educationwise and then we'll spend

97
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,520
most of our time talking about the

98
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:44,520
research

99
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:56,800
portfolio so pre-competitive

100
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:59,960
collaboration we have two uh industry

101
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:04,479
Academia consorti sorry about that that

102
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:06,400
we are um working on at CBI one is

103
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,960
called the bioman Consortium one is

104
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:12,320
called the Consortium on adventitious

105
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:15,039
agent contamination and biomanufacturing

106
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,039
in other words how do we work together

107
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,840
to mitigate the risk of viral

108
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,240
contamination and other types of

109
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:24,360
contamination in our biomanufacturing

110
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:27,000
processes and really the core to these

111
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:30,240
uh activities is pulling both industry

112
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
expertise and data uh and

113
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:36,560
um leveraging MIT as a as a neutral

114
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:40,199
third party that can uh collect analyze

115
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,880
anonymize data and learn things that uh

116
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:45,199
collectively can be useful to the

117
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:49,560
industry that an individual organization

118
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:52,479
is not able to uh to tackle on its own

119
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:55,800
we focus as you can see on the bioman is

120
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:58,039
more on manufacturing Innovation um

121
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,400
including data analytics and

122
00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:03,400
biomanufacturing sell therapy

123
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:07,080
manufacturing vaccine manufacturing and

124
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:10,080
product quality control while the cacb

125
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:13,400
focuses on uh risk assessment and

126
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,599
management um so creating tools for the

127
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,880
Consortium to use and assessing their

128
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:21,199
risk of a viral contamination as an

129
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:23,319
example also looking at new technologies

130
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:26,560
uh and new challenges for adventitious

131
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:29,759
agent uh control and developing new

132
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,800
technologies in that regard as well so

133
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:35,120
we have 10 members uh member companies

134
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,759
in the bioman and and 24 in the cacb and

135
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,840
if that's of interest to you you can

136
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:41,599
find me later and I can tell you more

137
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:45,120
about how to

138
00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:48,039
participate typically uh the activities

139
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:52,520
are around sharing experiences uh

140
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:55,280
datadriven uh presentations in a uh a

141
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:57,879
forum where the companies can share

142
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,400
information about what they're doing uh

143
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:02,840
to network identify best industry

144
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,680
practices provide opportunities to

145
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:09,440
Benchmark uh we do have collab uh you

146
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:12,520
know collaborative initiatives and also

147
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:16,240
um we provide members early access to

148
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:17,960
data and participation in the analysis

149
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:22,280
so just to give you an example of

150
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:25,319
outputs um you know we have collected

151
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:27,479
the viral contamination experience from

152
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:30,680
uh all of our member organizations and

153
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:33,720
publish this as you can see to together

154
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:36,560
uh in a nature biotech uh article

155
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:39,360
several years ago now but we continue

156
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,840
also to work on topics such as looking

157
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:45,240
at the promise of Next Generation

158
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:49,319
sequencing and potentially replacing the

159
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:52,520
adventitious uh uh virus test and animal

160
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:54,000
testing uh that is currently required

161
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:57,840
and you know what would it what would it

162
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,680
require to do this um uh and and

163
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:03,080
validate that for next generation uh

164
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,120
sequencing as a as a method and we've

165
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:08,199
published on that as well with our

166
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:11,159
Consortium members providing data uh on

167
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:13,879
both their uh inviva virus test results

168
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:17,720
and comparatively to the Next Generation

169
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:19,479
sequencing that they did in housee so um

170
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:22,720
with that I'm going to switch gears and

171
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:25,720
tell you just a little bit more about

172
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:29,680
our educational

173
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:32,080
portfolio and here we are really um

174
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,760
developing a lot of online and

175
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:38,120
collaboratively online and Hands-On

176
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:41,640
content for practitioners primarily but

177
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:44,000
also we do um some residential teaching

178
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:47,080
as well so you can see here that there

179
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,640
is a course that runs um

180
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,440
continuously uh on basically principles

181
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,640
of

182
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,120
biomanufacturing and we'll teach you

183
00:08:53,640 --> 00:09:00,519
about the you know manufacturer of a

184
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:02,279
monoclonal antibody and a um insulin

185
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:04,079
we run a short course every year on

186
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:06,279
vaccine bioprocess development and

187
00:09:04,079 --> 00:09:08,240
commercialization that'll be June 3rd to

188
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:10,800
5th this summer we have residential

189
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,920
courses we have courses on Cell Therapy

190
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,680
manufacturing and we're developing a

191
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:19,680
course now that'll run uh I think for

192
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:23,000
the first time in May time frame on

193
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:25,640
vaccine development and our first uh

194
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,160
thre day just like this but in July

195
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:31,360
first course on Cell Therapy

196
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,360
manufacturing will be coming this summer

197
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,000
okay so let's move into the research

198
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:41,120
portfolio so uh this is just an overview

199
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,640
slide to give you an example of the

200
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:46,040
types of things that we are working on

201
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:49,160
in our sponsored collaborative research

202
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:52,040
activities we're looking at multiple uh

203
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:54,320
biopharmaceutical modalities including

204
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:57,720
um you know monocolonal antibodies

205
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,920
vaccines Cell Therapy gene therapy

206
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,720
exosomes and so on

207
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,839
we are also looking at postmarket drug

208
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,760
safety surveillance in the sense that we

209
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:11,600
are working to uh develop predictive

210
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:14,120
signal detection and analytical tools we

211
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,160
work with a wide variety of Faculty from

212
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:18,720
across the Institute that's one of the

213
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,320
key features as I mentioned of CBI is

214
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,800
that we work both internally facing uh

215
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:26,000
across the school of science engineering

216
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,360
the Sloan School of Management and the

217
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,480
College of

218
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,839
computing and externally with uh

219
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,920
industry and regulators and this is just

220
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:37,920
a sample of some of the faculty from

221
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:41,480
across the Institute that uh we work

222
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:44,440
with and uh I will give you examples

223
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:47,040
from uh some of the work that I do

224
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:49,240
personally as well as Richard BRZ here

225
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,399
in chemical engineering Professor Scott

226
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,560
manales in

227
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,200
bioengineering uh a little bit from Rie

228
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:58,920
Ram uh in electrical engineering and

229
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,839
computer science uh and Jan over here uh

230
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:03,519
in electrical engineering and also

231
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:05,839
biological engineering

232
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,120
today all right so just let me set a

233
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,560
little bit of context as to why

234
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:13,959
biopharmaceutical manufacturing is

235
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:17,000
important um so as we you know

236
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:19,560
increasingly uh get larger with the

237
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,279
biologic medicines that we're making so

238
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,839
you know moving from small molecules

239
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:26,240
which have very well- defined structure

240
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:29,800
uh you know organic synthesis you can

241
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:32,000
analytically characterize them fully to

242
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:34,839
proteins monoclonal antibodies and then

243
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,079
now on to viral vectors for delivering

244
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:40,680
Gene therapies uh large vaccines and

245
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:42,639
cells as the therapies themselves you

246
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:45,120
have increasing size of the product

247
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:48,000
increasing variety or variability and

248
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:50,000
complexity of the product uh and so you

249
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,880
know we really need more analytical

250
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:57,000
tools and uh frankly more data to really

251
00:11:53,880 --> 00:12:00,320
inform our understanding of both the

252
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,600
product and the process and uh to inform

253
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,920
process control strategies and safety of

254
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,920
these

255
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,519
products so this slide is kind ofit

256
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,760
there's I've got a couple of busy slides

257
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:14,320
here but this slide is really meant to

258
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,959
um you know introduce those who may not

259
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:20,079
be as familiar with

260
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:22,480
biopharmaceuticals to some of the uh

261
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:25,639
various types of approved products that

262
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:28,120
are out there um particularly the number

263
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:30,880
and type of emerging biological medicine

264
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:34,000
modalities so this timeline runs from

265
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:36,560
2011 if you can't see it to

266
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,120
2024 showing the approval of eight new

267
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:42,040
drug modalities so antibody drug

268
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:45,880
conjugates Gene modified cell therapies

269
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:49,519
crisper Gene edited cell therapies mRNA

270
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:53,320
RNA antisens oligonucleotides and

271
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:56,320
bispecific antibodies um so you know we

272
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:59,240
have all these new uh new innovations

273
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,839
that require essentially Innovation and

274
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:04,600
manufacturing and analytical and in

275
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,320
contrast the initial FDA approvals of

276
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,480
recombinant proteins and antibodies

277
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:12,560
occurred years ago in the 1980s and

278
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:15,440
1990s with biosimilar versions of these

279
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,880
drugs being approved later as shown here

280
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:21,000
in you know 2015 and

281
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:24,040
16 so it's important to note that these

282
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,560
earlier products such as small proteins

283
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:28,279
and and monoclinal

284
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:30,839
antibodies um have become somewhat

285
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:33,680
platformization in their manufacturing

286
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:35,519
over the last 20 to 30 years which means

287
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,880
that the the standard processes for

288
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:40,680
making these are pretty well defined um

289
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,680
and a lot of the Innovation is more in

290
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:45,440
moving to different modes such as

291
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:48,279
continuous manufacturing or in Pat that

292
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:53,920
can be used in line or at

293
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:56,240
line by contrast um the complexity of

294
00:13:53,920 --> 00:14:00,720
some of the newer therapies such as a

295
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:03,079
cell gene therapy um you know really as

296
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,199
in the different types of cinge

297
00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:06,959
therapies that are on the market today

298
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:09,279
and the sources of those starting

299
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:11,360
materials so on the left here you can

300
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:13,920
see different types of cell therapies

301
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,959
such as autologous cell therapies which

302
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,720
start from the tissue of a patient uh

303
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,959
who will be receiving the manufactured

304
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,839
drug product and and then is returned to

305
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:25,880
that that same patient and so it has to

306
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,360
be manufactured for each patient being

307
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:30,120
treated whereas an allogenic Cell

308
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:33,000
Therapy could start with the tissue of a

309
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:37,480
donor and be administered to unrelated

310
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:39,279
patients um but that also means that um

311
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:42,040
you know because the limits of the

312
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:44,880
ability of primary cells to retain their

313
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:46,680
functionality um upon expansion

314
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,399
typically this is you know used for

315
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:51,800
maybe 200 patients or less so it's not a

316
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:54,759
Panacea and then you have xenographic

317
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:57,079
xenogeneic rather uh therapies that are

318
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:59,600
basically manufactured using uh tissue

319
00:14:57,079 --> 00:15:02,880
obtained from nonhuman sources

320
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,600
on the right um we call you know Gene

321
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:08,440
therapies

322
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:10,480
um can be basically describe describing

323
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:14,000
two different essentially approaches to

324
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:17,160
delivering a gene one the X Vivo um

325
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:21,399
which is on on the left hand side of the

326
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:23,759
right graph um that essentially is

327
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:27,480
really to you know you take the the

328
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:29,319
material the genetic material and uh

329
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,560
administer it into the cells that have

330
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:34,000
been removed from the patient and then

331
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:36,079
return them to the patient and these are

332
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,399
you know also called Gene modified cell

333
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:41,480
therapies and something like a CTE cell

334
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:43,839
therapy might be a good example of that

335
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:47,319
whereas on the right you have examples

336
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:49,680
of delivering the um genetic material

337
00:15:47,319 --> 00:15:52,319
material in Vivo where essentially the

338
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,800
modified Gene is directly added to the

339
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:58,399
patient using either a viral or nonviral

340
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,399
vector approach

341
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:04,120
so going back to this idea of

342
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,680
platforms

343
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:08,880
um this is a very busy slide but what

344
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,880
what it does is it shows you essentially

345
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:13,519
key features of a monoclonal antibody

346
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:16,160
manufacturing process and some of the

347
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,639
key things that I want to point out here

348
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,560
um you know are that you have very

349
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:23,079
well-characterized raw

350
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:25,600
materials um you know basically that you

351
00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:29,680
start with including the cells

352
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:32,480
themselves you are essentially um using

353
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:34,360
a a well-characterized cell bank and

354
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,959
materials that are going to be re you

355
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,839
know reproducible you go through a

356
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:41,600
series of you know expansion steps and

357
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:44,240
into you know your n equals zero

358
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,040
bioreactor and then your desired product

359
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,000
end up ends up being secreted from the

360
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:51,079
cells and can be harvested from the cell

361
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,319
Mass you do a filtration to clarify the

362
00:16:51,079 --> 00:16:55,399
Harvest and then you know some

363
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:57,240
filtration steps land you in the

364
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:59,160
downstream over here where you can

365
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,480
usually use a St really stand standard

366
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,760
at this point Affinity column which is

367
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:06,600
protein a typically for a monoclonal

368
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:09,000
antibody to uh recover the desired

369
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:12,319
product from other Harvest fluids that

370
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,880
that uh pass through and then you can do

371
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:18,199
viral clearance steps to ensure product

372
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:20,959
safety followed by polishing columns um

373
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:23,880
usually ion exchange or multimodal uh

374
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:26,679
chromatography columns here and then you

375
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:28,559
know on to the bulk um drug substance

376
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:31,240
which can then either be formulated or

377
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:33,799
St stored and you know you're basically

378
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:37,559
producing lots of drugs that are tens of

379
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:42,080
thousands to hundreds of thousands of

380
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:45,160
doses in contrast cell and Gene modified

381
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:48,440
Cell Therapy um really you have wide

382
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:51,720
variety of the starting material um and

383
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:53,760
you have uh variability and you know the

384
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,960
material sometimes cells grow well

385
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,480
sometimes they don't you have uh

386
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,919
manufacturing that includes clinical

387
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,159
site

388
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:07,480
coordination and um you have a fragile

389
00:18:03,159 --> 00:18:10,799
essentially product uh that has low um

390
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:12,400
shelf life typically and you basically

391
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,480
are you know taking something and

392
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,480
shipping it you know to a manufacturing

393
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:20,760
plant you have usually another another

394
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:24,000
manufacturing process to create the

395
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:27,880
vector that's going to deliver

396
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,880
essentially uh the uh the the the

397
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:32,440
genetic information you need in order to

398
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:34,039
modify those cells and then eventually

399
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,159
you're going to ship it back uh and

400
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:38,919
administer it in a clinical environment

401
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:42,280
so um some key things are that because

402
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:44,600
of this the cells themselves being the

403
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:48,159
therapy there's no opportunity for viral

404
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:50,760
clearance um again short shelf life and

405
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:53,520
temperature sensitive products as well

406
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:56,360
as difficulty in characterizing these

407
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:58,919
products so this gets us back to the old

408
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:01,640
dogma of the product is the process

409
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:04,840
which um we have for many years moved

410
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:07,520
away from that to trying to create

411
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:09,880
well-characterized biologic products but

412
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,360
for cell therapies you know really right

413
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:14,039
now where we're at is the product

414
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,039
product is the

415
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:21,960
process okay so uh more challenges in

416
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:25,440
gene uh in in these types of products uh

417
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:28,120
and I'll just give one example for the

418
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,280
uh gene therapy manufacturing and here

419
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:32,159
we're showing

420
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:35,480
using viral vectors to deliver the Gene

421
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:37,600
and the two platforms that are currently

422
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:40,799
uh most used today which is the triple

423
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:44,400
transection of hk293 cells where you

424
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:47,520
take your Gene of interest you take the

425
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,200
genes that um basic the trans Gene is

426
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,679
here then you take the the the

427
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:54,400
replication Gene uh rep and cap and

428
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:56,520
those are made on one plasma and then

429
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,400
you have a helper uh protein on another

430
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:01,919
you transfect all those and then let

431
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:05,880
them assemble essentially capsids that

432
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:08,559
then uh the the DNA is packaged into and

433
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:12,159
what you get out is essentially fully

434
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:15,440
packaged uh uh capsids partially and

435
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:17,799
then empties and unfortunately um we

436
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,760
make a lot of empty capsids these days

437
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:22,799
so typically you get this uh mixture you

438
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:25,760
have to separate it typically there's

439
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:28,720
multiple Downstream purification steps

440
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,960
required and you lose you know if each

441
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,240
step you're only getting 70% by the time

442
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,120
you've done multiple final yields can be

443
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:37,679
as low as less than

444
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:40,760
20% um so we're really not where we need

445
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:43,000
to be to meet the need of

446
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:45,880
patients um and so there's a lot of

447
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:49,120
innovation both in how we you know

448
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:51,880
manufacture these um and how we purify

449
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:54,240
them that and how and how we measure

450
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:56,520
them uh that is

451
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:59,120
needed um as I mentioned furthermore

452
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:02,440
there's a wide range of applications uh

453
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:05,000
for Gene therapies that require

454
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:07,760
different dose sizes um so here you're

455
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,400
just seeing uh an example of Li's

456
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:13,520
congenital amoros which is localized

457
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:16,679
small numbers of patients shown in red

458
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:19,360
total production scale shown in uh blue

459
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:21,279
and then uh in in green the total number

460
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,120
of patients so you don't need very much

461
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:25,840
you don't need big manufacturing

462
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:29,120
platforms for it see if I can get rid of

463
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:31,520
that um sometimes you have small number

464
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,840
of patients but you need big doses and

465
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,679
sometimes you have a large patient

466
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:37,320
population such as vericle cell anemia

467
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:40,360
so we need different scales of

468
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:43,120
manufacturing for aav as

469
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:45,919
well so I'm going to go into in the next

470
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:48,080
15 minutes um just talking with you

471
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:52,360
about uh some of the Innovation that we

472
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:57,520
are pursuing um at the CBI to address

473
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:59,640
these needs and I'll jump back to um you

474
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,120
know first the monoclonal antibody

475
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:04,919
example and then into the viral Vector

476
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:07,039
manufacturing example but in general

477
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:09,960
what we what I want to share with you is

478
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:12,080
essentially our approach um which

479
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:14,640
involves four different Focus areas

480
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:17,480
first mechanistic modeling and that

481
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:19,960
includes both numerical as well as um

482
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:22,440
you know other types of modeling of the

483
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:25,480
biological processes which are very

484
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:27,320
complex and lack a lot of fundamental

485
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:31,080
knowledge which is a key barrier in

486
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:33,640
being able to actually innovate uh and

487
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:35,520
uh we are trying to create these models

488
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:37,120
that can basically Drive our

489
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:41,159
understanding and what the key levers

490
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:43,520
are for uh improving drug production and

491
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:45,440
then we can use that fundamental

492
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:48,520
understanding uh that we get from our

493
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:51,039
models to optimize the manufacturing

494
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:53,240
processes uh in fit forp purpose and

495
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:55,919
scalable

496
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:57,600
manufacturing pardon me and then uh and

497
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,799
then we're also developing the novel

498
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:03,720
process analytical tools um which are

499
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:06,559
needed for monitoring and control

500
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:08,640
especially for the new drug modalities

501
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,760
um often which often require measurement

502
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,960
of Novel product quality attributes or

503
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:14,679
sometimes we don't even know what they

504
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:16,080
are yet and so we need to determine that

505
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:17,840
and finally and I don't know if we'll

506
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:20,360
get there today if we have time I'll

507
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,520
tell you about some of our approaches to

508
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:25,000
developing rapid safety testing

509
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:27,960
particularly sterility testing where

510
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,840
today you know it requires at least 14

511
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:32,000
days for the compendial methods to be

512
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,799
able to releasee your product and really

513
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,520
for the cell Therapies in particular

514
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:38,600
that's just not fast enough some of

515
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:40,600
these patients are um you know receiving

516
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,960
last line therapy and may only have

517
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:45,840
months um to live without these

518
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,799
potentially life-saving uh therapies so

519
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,919
we want to shrink that time down to less

520
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:53,120
than a

521
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:54,880
day okay so um I'm want to talk a little

522
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:59,440
bit about what we've been doing in the

523
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:03,120
area of uh smart data analytics so we

524
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:07,600
had a program that was sponsored by the

525
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:10,799
usfda that essentially um looked at

526
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:14,080
developing a number of tools um both at

527
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:16,640
the manufacturing process level um at

528
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,600
the manufacturing plant level and then

529
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,679
looking at ecosystem data to ask you

530
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:24,360
know how can we use all the available

531
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:27,559
data to ensure re reliable supply of

532
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:29,440
safe and effective medicines and so um

533
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:32,799
in order to do this we created some

534
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:35,039
tools we applied them um both inhouse in

535
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:37,120
a on a test bed that we've set up for

536
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:39,840
continuous manufacturing of monoclonal

537
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:43,159
antibodies we worked with several

538
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:45,720
industrial uh companies to utilize their

539
00:24:43,159 --> 00:24:48,880
plantwide data both numerical and text

540
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:51,679
uh textual to optimize uh manufacturing

541
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:54,799
operational models and then we created

542
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:58,399
some uh drug safety surveillance tools

543
00:24:54,799 --> 00:25:01,520
that can interrogate um postmarket

544
00:24:58,399 --> 00:25:04,600
surveillance data to uh inform you when

545
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:06,159
you have essentially uh considerations

546
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:10,360
in either your manufacturing or your

547
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:12,960
supply chain um for postmarket um uh

548
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,960
drug safety

549
00:25:13,159 --> 00:25:18,039
signals okay so just really quickly

550
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,520
these are this is just an example of

551
00:25:18,039 --> 00:25:24,000
what we call Smart process analytical or

552
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:27,039
Spa tools uh Professor Richard Bratz de

553
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,960
developed these tools um and really you

554
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:32,279
know the challenge in using models in

555
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:34,159
biomanufacturing is that you have a wide

556
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:36,520
variety of data and some of it

557
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,960
especially in biom manufacturing is

558
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:42,600
sparse compared to say like Google or

559
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:46,480
Amazon scale data um and so you want to

560
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:49,159
make sure that you're not using models

561
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,880
inappropriately and um that data you

562
00:25:49,159 --> 00:25:52,840
know scientists when they approach this

563
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,960
problem of what model should I use to

564
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:56,399
fit my data they you know don't fall

565
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,440
back on techniques that are just

566
00:25:56,399 --> 00:26:01,399
familiar to them but they fully

567
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:03,520
interrogate the data um and select the

568
00:26:01,399 --> 00:26:05,600
best model and so that's essentially

569
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,679
what Spa does is it it basically

570
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:11,000
automatically interrogates the data set

571
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:12,720
to ascertain its characteristics um so

572
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,880
you know if you have nonlinearity

573
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,840
Dynamics or multicolinearity then based

574
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:20,279
on the degree of the characteristics you

575
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:22,960
select a best-in-class analytical tool

576
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:25,559
from you know the pre-selected candidate

577
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,240
models that we offer um and that they

578
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:29,399
built based on literature review and

579
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,600
case studies and then finally you

580
00:26:29,399 --> 00:26:33,360
construct the final model and a you and

581
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:36,000
using automated selection of rigorous

582
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,520
cross validation procedures um based on

583
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
the data attributes so that's kind of

584
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:44,360
shown on on the

585
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:47,840
right so an example of this um where we

586
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:50,679
worked with um we worked with actually

587
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:53,399
Amgen to utilize the spa tools and

588
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:57,480
develop a a model that could use process

589
00:26:53,399 --> 00:26:58,799
variability variables to predict the uh

590
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:01,159
the product quality

591
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:04,039
attributes and this was for two

592
00:27:01,159 --> 00:27:06,760
different u m monoclonal antibody

593
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:10,520
products um where we had multiple years

594
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:12,799
of data provided to us and the results

595
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:15,399
here are visualized in the form of these

596
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:19,480
violin plots where the model um

597
00:27:15,399 --> 00:27:22,520
predicted that Alvin and uh also RF

598
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:25,200
might be uh the best performing uh

599
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:28,799
algorithms um and this is likely due to

600
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:32,720
the significant nonlinearity of the data

601
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:34,799
um however you know you basically if you

602
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:37,760
look closer at this as uh Richard and

603
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:40,279
his team did um you know the RF models

604
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:42,240
are somewhat harder to interpret which

605
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:44,480
means it's harder to you know identify

606
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:47,159
what the levers are using it um to

607
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:49,320
change the process and for that and a

608
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:52,000
variety of other reasons um you

609
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:55,480
know related to overfitting as it it

610
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,720
says here Alum was selected as the best

611
00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:03,279
candidate they went on to

612
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:05,039
um show that you can leverage um when

613
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:06,840
you're when you're doing this you know

614
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:08,320
you would think that each batch might be

615
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:11,200
independent but there's actually strong

616
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:13,600
batto batch effects um or

617
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,480
autocorrelation which you can model with

618
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,760
tensorial approaches and then combine

619
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:19,960
that with the you know time series data

620
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:22,679
as shown here and that gives you

621
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:24,559
significant prediction Improvement um

622
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:27,279
that can be achieved as you can see here

623
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:30,720
for alum where the um the the root mean

624
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:33,480
square error is much lower for uh Alvin

625
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:36,279
after this Pro

626
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:39,440
procedure so as I mentioned we in

627
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:41,919
addition to um that type of modeling

628
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,880
that was done under this program we

629
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:45,440
built an endtoend

630
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:49,640
continuous

631
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:53,399
manufacturing uh platform at MIT to

632
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:56,760
allow us to uh collect and interrogate

633
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:58,600
um continuous manufacturing data uh in

634
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:02,519
an effort to develop model

635
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:05,000
that um can look at the gly

636
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:06,960
glycosilation uh of monoclonal

637
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,080
antibodies and and what's important for

638
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:12,919
that genetic stability as well as um uh

639
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:15,000
probar model selection tools and so what

640
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:16,080
you see here is that we have like four

641
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,120
three ler

642
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:21,840
bioreactors um a filtration device a

643
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:26,679
capture chromatography a housebuilt uh

644
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:28,880
low PH um inactivation skid and then uh

645
00:29:26,679 --> 00:29:32,799
polishing chromatography

646
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:35,039
um that is shown here everything is sent

647
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:38,760
by a masked Auto sampler to different

648
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:42,360
analytical tools for atline and offline

649
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:46,080
analysis um in this

650
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:49,000
system and so shown here you know we are

651
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:51,840
um really interested in for monoclonal

652
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,840
antibodies and sorry this is a little

653
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:58,440
obuse but but but what this is is

654
00:29:53,840 --> 00:30:01,720
essentially a um a map of glycosilation

655
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:03,399
uh through the ER that occurs where you

656
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:06,519
have multiple

657
00:30:03,399 --> 00:30:09,919
reactions um that uh with each of these

658
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:12,760
being each of these little colorcoded um

659
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:14,559
shapes is essentially a sugar that as

660
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:16,720
you go through the ER gets you know

661
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:18,880
added and so you end up with all these

662
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,559
different glyco forms on on your

663
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,760
monoclonal antibody and you want to be

664
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:26,120
able to describe and control those and

665
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:28,799
so you know basically um what Richard

666
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:31,600
br's team does is he's he's created

667
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:35,399
essentially descriptions of all of these

668
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:37,320
and then the model um can be used to

669
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:40,080
understand the state sensitivity to key

670
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:42,120
manipulated variables so shown here is

671
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:44,519
you know how how the model is is

672
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:46,640
essentially performing in terms of the

673
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:49,200
measure glycans that we measured in the

674
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:51,799
lab versus his predictions and then on

675
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,840
the top you can see when we um the

676
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:56,039
sensitivity uh there's a significant

677
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:58,200
sensitivity to the galactose

678
00:30:56,039 --> 00:31:00,399
concentration as you would expect but

679
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:02,919
essentially it allows us to probe when

680
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:06,120
we you know make changes during the

681
00:31:02,919 --> 00:31:08,360
continuous process to different uh you

682
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:10,080
know additives essentially whether or

683
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:13,120
not there's a sensitivity and and the

684
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:15,399
model performs quite well in that way um

685
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:18,679
and also you can show you know this is

686
00:31:15,399 --> 00:31:22,360
essentially the model performance um for

687
00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:24,519
glycosilation index um that is uh

688
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:27,600
showing you know heart perfusion rate

689
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:30,600
and other factors that we can uh that we

690
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:32,960
can follow um and and model in terms of

691
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:34,760
predictive control of

692
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,159
glycosilation and then the last thing

693
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:39,080
that I'll talk about under this

694
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:43,000
particular um effort was essentially how

695
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:45,840
we incorporated ecosystem data um for

696
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:49,080
you know looking at Adverse Events so

697
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:52,000
here um what you're seeing here is

698
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:54,880
essentially our interrogation of whether

699
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:58,600
or not adverse adverse event profiles of

700
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:00,000
commercialized drugs could um be used to

701
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:03,279
indicate whether there was a

702
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,039
manufacturing or supply chain issue so

703
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:09,440
this was a collaboration with a company

704
00:32:06,039 --> 00:32:12,279
that provided um this data as well as

705
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:14,320
data that we extracted from the fda's

706
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:16,679
adverse event report database and the

707
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:19,639
vaccine adverse event report database

708
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:22,399
for 26 biologic medicines a number of

709
00:32:19,639 --> 00:32:24,880
vaccines and what you see in the top is

710
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:27,919
just that you know basically we've you

711
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:30,519
know found that the um Adverse Events

712
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:33,799
are definitely not uh distributed evenly

713
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:37,039
across lots and then what we did on the

714
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:39,960
on the lower is to develop a tool um

715
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:42,960
that basically uh interrogates this it's

716
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:46,440
a hidden marov model and identifies

717
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:48,559
hidden risk States and state transition

718
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:51,880
probabilities and then when that was

719
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:54,080
applied um you know to the when the Tool

720
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:56,080
was applied to see if it could detect

721
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,960
lot to lot variability in an actual

722
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:01,760
commercial product that had three dosage

723
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,519
forms um in one there didn't seem to be

724
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:06,399
any you know anything interesting but in

725
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:09,120
two of these dosage form A and B we were

726
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:14,440
able to you know find these most likely

727
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:17,519
uh sets of um uh you know states that

728
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:20,000
you can also see over here basically um

729
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:22,399
are are predicted to be higher risk and

730
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,000
then in dosage form one you can you can

731
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:27,480
basically look at those um out over time

732
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:30,480
as well in terms of the uh rate and see

733
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:32,720
that over time you you the rate is

734
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:36,240
reduced in both of these dosage forms

735
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:38,240
but you have more in dosage form a so

736
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:41,120
again just examples of the different

737
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:44,360
ways that we're using data um and a

738
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:47,480
smart way to apply it to different

739
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:50,120
problems in biopharmaceutical

740
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:52,360
manufacturing so next I just want to

741
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:55,880
briefly touch on the mechanistic

742
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:58,279
modeling and here um you know again why

743
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:00,159
do we want to do this we need increased

744
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:02,440
knowledge and understanding to improve

745
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:04,720
the process development and so this

746
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:06,919
knowledge pyramid just shows you know as

747
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:09,040
you go up the pyramid you have more

748
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:11,000
increasing knowledge the more that you

749
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:13,919
can work toward first principles or

750
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:19,159
mechanistic understanding and so for the

751
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:22,679
Triple transection of hk293 cells um to

752
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:25,639
uh make aav Rec combinant aav

753
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:27,440
essentially um we actually modeled this

754
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:30,720
system and what you can you know see

755
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:33,919
here is building upon existing knowledge

756
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:37,040
of basically taking one Plasma in uh to

757
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:39,639
a nucleus um the team created a model

758
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:41,280
for basically moving all of them the

759
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:42,440
vector the helper and the packaging

760
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:46,599
plasmids

761
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:48,599
in and um modeled this entire process it

762
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:51,040
was adapted from the wild type A

763
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:53,359
synthesis and includes the rep protein

764
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:56,320
and viral protein synthesis rep protein

765
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:59,520
regulatory functions capsid assembly

766
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:03,320
viral DNA replication DNA packaging into

767
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:06,520
the capsid and capsid um secretion and

768
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:10,119
so um we took this model and we uh

769
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:13,320
validated it um and you know basically

770
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:15,280
were able to do parameter estimation uh

771
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:18,119
as shown here and I'll just move quickly

772
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:21,079
due to time um and then when you start

773
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:22,839
looking at um the species that are the

774
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:25,720
inter intermediate species you can start

775
00:35:22,839 --> 00:35:28,160
to see interesting things such as here

776
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:31,920
the discoordination between the the

777
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:34,640
production of the um capsid proteins

778
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:37,000
which happens early and the DNA that's

779
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,480
produced and replicated where you have a

780
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,680
lot of capsids around in the beginning

781
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:43,160
but you don't have much to package into

782
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:45,480
them which then informed you know some

783
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:47,920
of our strategies going forward about

784
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:50,400
how to uh improve that

785
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:52,880
situation including extending the capsu

786
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:55,560
production timeline uh to improve the

787
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:58,880
full to empty ratio of these we did the

788
00:35:55,560 --> 00:36:02,640
same thing for the uh bacular Virus

789
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:06,040
Infection of uh insect cells of sf9

790
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:09,160
cells again the model was created and

791
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:12,079
indicates uh that the production of rep

792
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:15,319
78 or transcription of it um is what

793
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:17,640
controls the production rate of the full

794
00:36:15,319 --> 00:36:19,920
capsids uh and we also looked at two

795
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:23,000
different constructs one is called two

796
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:25,680
back the other three back and because um

797
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:30,240
rep 78 is under a stronger promoter for

798
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:32,520
tuac uh we um um we we predict that that

799
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:36,119
that is actually the better um system in

800
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:38,520
terms of making uh recombinate a and

801
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:41,560
that turns out to be

802
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:45,599
true yeah okay so I'm going to wrap up

803
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:48,480
there um and uh happy to talk with you

804
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:51,319
about these other areas as Mak sense in

805
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:53,880
terms of uh if you have interest in

806
00:36:51,319 --> 00:36:56,319
process analytical Technologies or rapid

807
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:58,720
sterility methods please catch me uh at

808
00:36:56,319 --> 00:37:00,079
the break and I'll be happy to talk more

809
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,770
with you about those types of

810
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:04,920
Innovations thank

811
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:07,920
[Applause]

812
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,920
you

813
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:16,480
okay okay so the first question is any

814
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:19,240
example of startups to commercialize the

815
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:21,400
Innovations from CBI by collaborating

816
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:24,520
with industry so yes there are

817
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:27,040
definitely startups um including a

818
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:31,079
mechanistic modeling company called bio

819
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:33,560
cury that is um offering

820
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:36,240
essentially a service to collaborate

821
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:40,520
with people to do uh apply mechanistic

822
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:44,960
modeling uh tools to um improve your

823
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:46,560
manufacturing processes many of the um

824
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:49,400
analytical tools that we've developed

825
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:52,200
the process analytical tools have been

826
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:56,119
uh you know put into startup companies

827
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:58,079
that uh various you know uh postdocs or

828
00:37:56,119 --> 00:38:02,040
graduate students started after they

829
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:04,240
worked on on some of them um some of the

830
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:07,480
tools that Scott manal's lab has made

831
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:10,800
for instance have um been uh

832
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:15,280
commercialized as well as um some of the

833
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:18,599
work that uh Jon has done so yes the ex

834
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:19,960
the a resounding yes um okay the second

835
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:21,400
question is do you think that the

836
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:23,400
approach you described could be applied

837
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:25,560
to the man to the manufacturer of

838
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:28,720
genetic modifications that amplify the

839
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:31,880
function of existing genes or cells

840
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:35,119
other than for treatment or uh

841
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:39,520
prevention so

842
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:41,040
um yes so I do think that you could um

843
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,520
if if I understand your question which

844
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:46,040
I'm not 100% sure I I do but if you're

845
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:48,359
asking could you apply this to say Gene

846
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:51,280
editing Technologies for instance then I

847
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:53,319
think you know certainly the answer is

848
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,640
yes you would be able to extend those

849
00:38:53,319 --> 00:38:56,040
models but it might be a lot more

850
00:38:54,640 --> 00:39:00,400
challenging right because those are

851
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:02,920
happening um you know sometimes X Vivo

852
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,560
which would be easier to model versus

853
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:08,160
something that you know you want to try

854
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:09,520
to um describe that is happening where

855
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,200
you deliver the Gene and then you want

856
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:14,560
to model what's happening in a in a

857
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:16,880
human um so I do think if that's your

858
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:19,560
question and please approach me if if

859
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:22,400
it's not if I didn't answer it correctly

860
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,400
uh or understand it

861
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:28,880
correctly oh so we are engaged and

862
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:30,839
committed in education so the question

863
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:33,960
is how is CBI engaged with and committed

864
00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:37,599
in Education and Training a nextg uh

865
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:41,359
Next Generation teachers I think and uh

866
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:45,240
so we are so we we offer as I mentioned

867
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:47,119
the um different courses that are for

868
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:50,040
practitioners and that would include you

869
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:52,119
know teachers uh who are trying to you

870
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:55,119
know build their their Knowledge and

871
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:58,319
Skills around this type of manufacturing

872
00:39:55,119 --> 00:40:00,440
so those courses that I cribed or either

873
00:39:58,319 --> 00:40:03,560
available online and you can get

874
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:05,880
certificates or you can come to MIT for

875
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:07,800
the inperson courses and they're they're

876
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:12,400
quite open and available for anyone who

877
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:12,400
wants to um wants to take

878
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:19,839
them okay so how do you handle address

879
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:21,640
analyzing sensitive Health Care data

880
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:23,960
from your collaborators assume it is

881
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:26,319
very valuable for your collaborators

882
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:29,480
once they overcome this question

883
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:33,960
challenge yeah so um the the healthc

884
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:36,680
care data that we described um uh that I

885
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:39,440
described in the hmm tool and I have

886
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:44,240
another example that I didn't get to

887
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:46,839
describe um where we partnered with um

888
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:50,480
another company and we were looking at

889
00:40:46,839 --> 00:40:54,839
actually their drug safety adverse event

890
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:57,800
data to come up with tools that would um

891
00:40:54,839 --> 00:40:59,599
not only compare their data not only

892
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:03,359
look at their data but also compare

893
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:05,680
other uh data from companies that are

894
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:08,760
making uh molecules in the same

895
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:11,599
mechanistic class um and you're right it

896
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:14,280
is sensitive data but actually MIT in

897
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:17,880
that particular case um that was a a

898
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:21,160
project with um teada through basically

899
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:24,839
the MIT teada program where they put in

900
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:28,240
place um a platform for MIT researchers

901
00:41:24,839 --> 00:41:32,119
to be able to work uh quite closely with

902
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:35,200
teada and have access to data from teada

903
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:38,280
so I think if you if you work um closely

904
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:41,760
with the organizations you can put in

905
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:45,240
place the um security needed to work

906
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:47,839
with some of this and then we uh publish

907
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:50,839
the Articles you know together and the

908
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:53,440
companies always have the opportunity to

909
00:41:50,839 --> 00:41:54,880
review that for any you know confident

910
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,800
confidential information that they

911
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:59,160
wouldn't want to appear in a research

912
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:01,160
article so I think you know in general

913
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:04,680
what I would say is it's important to

914
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:07,160
set expectations beginning and at the

915
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:10,359
very beginning of a collaboration to

916
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:11,960
make sure that everyone understands that

917
00:42:10,359 --> 00:42:15,480
you know in our case that we need to

918
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:17,240
publish research and uh and that we also

919
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:19,400
understand the various sensitivities to

920
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:21,640
any data but in general we haven't found

921
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:23,520
it to be a data be a be a barrier as I

922
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:25,119
said we've been able to get you know

923
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:27,960
essentially adverse event data we've

924
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:30,520
been able to get plants worth of

925
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:33,599
manufacturing data um and collaborate

926
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:35,880
with our uh members and collaborators on

927
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:40,920
that

928
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:40,920
so okay thank you
