1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,080
I want to distinguish comparative

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:05,680
advantage from just the term advantage

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,040
or what we call absolute advantage.

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,880
Let's think about LeBron James mowing

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,800
his lawn. Let's assert LeBron James is

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,639
the best person at both mowing his lawn

7
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,120
and playing basketball. He has an

8
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:17,840
absolute advantage in both activities,

9
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,320
but he has a comparative advantage in

10
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,279
playing basketball. A billion to one

11
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,359
comparative advantage in playing

12
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,119
basketball. Mowing lawns, he's maybe

13
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,560
five to one. He's certainly better than

14
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,000
me at mowing a lawn, but is he more than

15
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,000
five times? Could he do it five times

16
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,640
faster than me? Probably not. So LeBron

17
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,040
James has an absolute advantage over me

18
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,280
in basketball and lawnmowing, but his

19
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,800
comparative advantage is basketball.

20
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,040
LeBron James should specialize in

21
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,879
basketball. Let me mow the lawn. It's

22
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,360
all about comparative advantage. It's

23
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:48,079
what are you relatively better at. For

24
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,200
more MIT moments from MIT Open Learning,
