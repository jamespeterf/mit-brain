1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,960
Hello everyone. I'm John Hart from the

2
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,679
mechanical engineering department and I

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,560
have the privilege of chairing this next

4
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,720
session on manufacturing. And as I was

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,320
sitting at the back preparing, I

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,119
realized this is a bit of a full- circle

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,039
moment because uh while I was doing my

8
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,760
masters and PhD in mechanical

9
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:31,760
engineering here, I transitioned between

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:33,920
degrees from focusing on machine design,

11
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,239
precision engineering to an unexpected

12
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,960
focus on nanomaterials, which led me to

13
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:42,480
spend long days with a first generation

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:46,480
iPod hidden in my clean room suit uh in

15
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,320
the MTL, the precursor to MIT Nano. and

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,239
the convergence of those two topics

17
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,680
shaped the first decade or so of my

18
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:56,000
faculty career. Uh so after I give some

19
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,559
introductory remarks uh I'll introduce

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,199
our outstanding speakers who will also

21
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,520
span the spectrum of manufacturing

22
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,840
uh in some ways from the inside MIT

23
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,320
perspective and also from the outside

24
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,720
MIT perspective or what we like to see

25
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,760
MIT's impact in manufacturing to be

26
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,760
beyond the borders of our campus.

27
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,479
I

28
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,960
came to MIT about

29
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,840
12 years ago. There we go. And and since

30
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,600
then, I've seen an incredible growth in

31
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,759
manufacturing across campus. We've

32
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,520
already heard some outstanding remarks

33
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,680
connecting manufacturing to health and

34
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,880
life sciences and in the opening by

35
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,520
Vladimir and Sally before that. Uh but

36
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,600
along with the growth of manufacturing

37
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:43,280
across disciplines at MIT, it really is

38
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,280
in MIT's DNA. We have manufacturing in

39
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,280
all engineering departments in

40
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,560
humanities and social sciences of course

41
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:53,680
in management and operations. And MIT's

42
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,840
dedication to manufacturing part of its

43
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:59,840
industrial inspiration and mind and hand

44
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,920
ethos uh is not only about

45
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,520
technology

46
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,360
research and education but it's also

47
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,840
about understanding the landscape of

48
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,239
manufacturing domestically and globally.

49
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,920
And it's about getting people out of

50
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,959
campus,

51
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,879
our graduates who are budding

52
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,560
enthusiasts of manufacturing and when

53
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:21,360
the opportunity presents itself,

54
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:24,879
starting and scaling new companies.

55
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:29,640
So collecting these like terms so to

56
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,640
say, we're very proud that alongside

57
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,599
I'm sorry I don't think the the remote

58
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,239
is working but if you can advance next

59
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,400
slide. alongside heels and the other

60
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,319
strategic initiatives we launched MIT

61
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,319
launched in May the MIT initiative for

62
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,680
new manufacturing or INM uh and uh I'm

63
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,280
have the privilege of being one of the

64
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,879
faculty co-directors along with

65
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,640
professor Suzanne Berger and professor

66
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,319
Chris Love Suzanne an institute

67
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,319
professor of political science and Chris

68
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:58,160
a professor of chemical engineering an

69
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:59,760
expert in biio manufacturing and

70
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,519
Rick Lockach dean of the Sloan school

71
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,959
and Paula Hammond institute professor

72
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:07,040
and executive vice prohost are the

73
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,959
co-chairs of our steering committee. And

74
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,200
the INM by definition is one of these

75
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,680
strategic initiatives has broad goals.

76
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,040
Goals to unite MIT in manufacturing and

77
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,560
support research, education, and

78
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:21,200
partnerships to improve manufacturing in

79
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,680
the US and across the world. Uh we're

80
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,560
just getting started. We've only uh been

81
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,640
live for about six months. Uh but we uh

82
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,040
have defined four crosscutting themes

83
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,120
that define MIT's work across campus and

84
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,680
with its partners. Reimagining

85
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,200
manufacturing technologies and systems.

86
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,720
Elevating the productivity and

87
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,480
experience of manufacturing, which

88
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,200
really speaks to the human nature of

89
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,440
manufacturing and how work and worker

90
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,519
productivity are key to the frontier.

91
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,120
Scaling new manufacturing, working

92
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,280
internally and externally with young

93
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,000
companies and old companies to uh

94
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,480
understand and help them go from one to

95
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,680
many, the true beauty of of what makes

96
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,360
manufacturing magical and mysterious and

97
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,599
transforming the manufacturing base.

98
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,519
speaking to working with uh not just big

99
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,280
companies but small and medium

100
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,920
enterprises particularly from the

101
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,760
workforce uh education side as as John

102
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,040
Lou will speak in particular in a little

103
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:18,400
while we've identified several program

104
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,639
areas uh areas of focus activity

105
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,680
supporting research in manufacturing

106
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:26,720
across MIT both in technology domains

107
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:30,080
and crosscutting themes focusing on

108
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,960
deployment uh uh taking MIT's work

109
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,800
outside of campus us through workforce

110
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,840
training through visiting small and

111
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,680
medium enterprises and so on. uh

112
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,080
alongside of those a deep focus on

113
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,120
education and workforce uh on campus and

114
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,600
beyond supporting new laboratories as we

115
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,280
raise funding and build programs uh

116
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,120
around campus including a partnership

117
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,120
we've already established with MIT nano

118
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,800
in the area of 3D printing we're

119
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,199
engaging industry through a consortium

120
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,120
of large companies and we are uh

121
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,880
ideulating programs in collaboration

122
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,880
with the trust center despond center and

123
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,400
others to focus on manufacturing

124
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,440
entrepreneurship

125
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,360
the INM started by an organic process a

126
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,960
community that we gathered to say, "Hey,

127
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,360
hey, how broad and how important is

128
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,080
manufacturing? How exciting is is it to

129
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,639
our community?" And this has included uh

130
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,560
early efforts on workforce training like

131
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,960
manufacturing academy piloted in the

132
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,960
Birkers in Western Massachusetts. A

133
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,919
series of amazing distinguished speakers

134
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,400
like Mo Morris Chang uh October of two

135
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:32,000
years ago uh who filled 10250 and has

136
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,440
such an incredible story to tell about

137
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,759
his career in the semiconductor

138
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,840
industry. And as I mentioned, uh,

139
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,320
efforts, uh, particularly here supported

140
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,479
by the Masttec collaborative, uh, to,

141
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,680
uh, put new manufacturing equipment at

142
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:47,759
MIT, uh, specifically in a in a lab

143
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,520
provided in partnership with MIT Nano on

144
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,199
the fifth floor and some space in

145
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,320
mechanical engineering aside of our

146
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:56,000
other manufacturing courses. And we're

147
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,400
also proud to have seven founding

148
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,400
industry members of our consortium. The

149
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,639
uh, industry consortium is only one part

150
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,479
of the initiative, but a key part. uh

151
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,560
and we're engaging closely with those

152
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,880
companies and open to uh new

153
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,039
introductions at at any time. Uh and

154
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:14,479
last but not least, more of a note for

155
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:16,960
our onampus audience. Uh we have just

156
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:19,360
opened up a call for INM's first set of

157
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,680
seed research projects here focused on

158
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,759
AI and automation for manufacturing.

159
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,440
It's a top interest of our industry

160
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,360
members, which is the source of funding

161
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,960
supporting this seed call. And while

162
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,520
we'll have hopefully many calls for

163
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,440
proposals that stretch across all the

164
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,720
different domains I highlighted, this

165
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:39,280
one is focused on a set of topics uh uh

166
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,280
related to AI and automation. Uh if you

167
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,400
uh are interested, please see our

168
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,400
website or go to inm.edu edu and and

169
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,160
click the tab on request for proposals

170
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,960
and we'll be about to we'll be able to

171
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,199
fund seven to 10 projects uh both as

172
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,280
research projects and demonstration

173
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,120
projects to help translate capabilities

174
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,160
already developed on campus into

175
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:03,599
industry contexts. So with that let me

176
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,680
transition to our uh set of speakers uh

177
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,919
leading off uh will be Dan Orurin who's

178
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,680
a MIT PhD. I first met him when he was

179
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:12,000
finishing up his PhD and thinking about

180
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,639
starting the company that is incredibly

181
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,520
exciting called Radiant Technologies. Uh

182
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,759
after Dan, we'll hear from Professor Liz

183
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,120
Reynolds, a professor of practice in uh

184
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,639
the department of urban studies and

185
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,319
planning, but her expertise stretches

186
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,960
far beyond just being a professor at

187
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:29,199
MIT, including a key role in the in the

188
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,800
White House in the Biden administration.

189
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,560
uh and John Louu, principal research

190
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,720
scientist in mechanical engineering who

191
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,960
will speak about uh his innovative work

192
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,520
and innovative deployment of new

193
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,000
pedagogy for manufacturing workforce

194
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,680
education. Uh each will have a a brief

195
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,039
presentation with some slides and then I

196
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,120
think we'll have time for a panel

197
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,960
discussion and any questions that you

198
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,759
submit through the pigeon hole back

199
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,759
there. So Dan, please uh please come on

200
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,759
up.

201
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,759
So, I'm here to tell you a little bit

202
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,840
about Ardiant Technologies. And just to

203
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:12,319
give you a little bit of context here,

204
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:13,840
what we're all about is that we think 3D

205
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,240
nanop fabrication is what's going to

206
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,160
fully unlock the potential of optics and

207
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:22,000
photonics.

208
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:23,599
And you know that all started with some

209
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,680
very simple questions quite some time

210
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:30,479
ago about what actually is necessary in

211
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,640
order to do first principles 3D nanop

212
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:36,080
fabrication that is not just practical

213
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:38,479
but pragmatic and which can scale.

214
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,919
So this has brought us to where we are

215
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,479
now where we're building the world's

216
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:45,760
first 3D 3D nanoptics and photonics

217
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:48,560
foundry. And we're able to pattern any

218
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,640
arbitrary geometry. We're able to do

219
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:54,000
that with deeply subwavelength

220
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,760
resolution. And not only that, but we

221
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,120
can control gradients of material and

222
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,320
achieve things like gradients of

223
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,680
refractive index. And most importantly,

224
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,959
we're able to do it with materials that

225
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:07,680
are compatible with existing foundry

226
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:09,839
technologies.

227
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,160
Now, further into the future, you can

228
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,600
even imagine using this technique to do

229
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,360
multimaterial. We've shown it's possible

230
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,160
to do conductors, semiconductors, and

231
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,839
dialectrics all at once. But in

232
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,640
practice, none of this actually matters

233
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:25,600
because there did not exist a way to do

234
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:28,000
3D nanop fabrication fast enough. So of

235
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:31,040
course uh we also had to go and invent

236
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,200
that um here at MIT with Peter so

237
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,880
something called uh line scan temporally

238
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,279
focused to photon lithography which is a

239
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,279
big mouthful but the point is here that

240
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,920
this allows you to instead of scanning a

241
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:43,839
single point pattern entire planes and

242
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,360
that means you can go fast enough for

243
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,120
this to be economically feasible and

244
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,200
make millions of components per year per

245
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,800
customer.

246
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,560
And with that we've shown we can make

247
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,839
everything from lenses for coupling

248
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:59,040
imaging and relaying to things like

249
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:02,080
filters for MX demox and compute as well

250
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:05,120
as 3D wave guides and reflectors for

251
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,640
routing as well as MX and demox.

252
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,120
But that's just these subcomponents

253
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,880
really. This is a transition one that

254
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,360
looks a lot like what happened with the

255
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,680
transistor where we went from soldering

256
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,000
these parts together to then creating

257
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,000
entire integrated systems out of them.

258
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,959
But being able to do that for free space

259
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,720
optics and photonics.

260
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:27,440
So that's a little bit about the

261
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:30,160
company. But you know it wasn't such a

262
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,600
simple path to get here. I actually

263
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,920
started out as an artist and

264
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,760
photographer. Um I ran a printmaking

265
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,240
business and an art business sort of

266
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:41,760
exploring what's possible with sculpting

267
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,519
light. And it just so happened that one

268
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,000
of my best friends had started here at

269
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,079
MIT. And over some beers at the miracle

270
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,640
of science, we realized we could combine

271
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:52,399
these very old photographic printmaking

272
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,040
technologies with new tools from

273
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:57,120
neuroscience. And that's where this all

274
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,839
started essentially. You know, we tried

275
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,320
some stuff in lab. We got adopt I got

276
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:03,839
adopted by a professor at Bdon became a

277
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,079
technician, a master student and then

278
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:09,440
got a PhD, published in science

279
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:11,600
magazine. uh then spun this out uh via

280
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,880
the activate fellowship which supports

281
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:18,480
uh scientists to bring their ideas and

282
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:20,079
research to market. Uh and then even

283
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,320
then you know it was still early there

284
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:24,320
was scientific risk left to be dealt

285
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:28,000
with. So we raised money from the

286
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,680
government through SBIRS. We then took

287
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
that and we showed we could make

288
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,519
highquality optical materials. And with

289
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,480
that out of the way we were able to go

290
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:39,040
raise our seed round. We won a DARPA

291
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,279
program and with that DARPA program

292
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,200
we've been able to grow to now 30

293
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:45,200
people. We have a facility here in

294
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,760
Waltham where we're now building the

295
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:52,000
world's first 3D

296
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:54,880
fabrication foundry. And that's where we

297
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,640
are today. And finally, customers are

298
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,320
taking us seriously. We're doing

299
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,920
development deals with them. And

300
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,760
hopefully in a few years we'll have a

301
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,320
scaled manufacturing facility that'll

302
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,720
allow us to make millions of components

303
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,560
for AI hyperscalers. Specifically, the

304
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,320
beach head that we found is in

305
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:13,120
connectors for data centers. This is a

306
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,120
major issue just shifting from using

307
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,760
copper to connect chips and things

308
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,680
within racks together to using light.

309
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,760
But further in the future, what we

310
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,480
imagine is actually being able to shift

311
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:27,680
the substrate for computation completely

312
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:31,120
away or partially away from electrons to

313
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:33,600
photons and enable new kinds of sensors

314
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,920
that allow embodied intelligence to

315
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:39,360
essentially navigate and understand our

316
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:41,600
world. So with that, I'll uh let the

317
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,600
other folks come up and thank you very

318
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,600
much.

319
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,240
Great. Um well, good morning everyone.

320
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,959
It's a real pleasure to be here and

321
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,800
particularly with uh uh old and dear

322
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:05,200
colleagues from many years working on

323
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,920
the topic of advanced manufacturing and

324
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:11,279
um and policy etc. My name is Liz

325
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,720
Reynolds and um as John alluded, I have

326
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,839
been involved in advanced manufacturing

327
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:18,240
topics at MIT for uh over a decade now.

328
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:22,000
But what's been interesting in the last

329
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:25,040
five years or so is to um see how much

330
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,360
this topic has become uh critical not

331
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,440
just in the US but around the world and

332
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,839
uh the the movement the sort of

333
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:35,440
headwinds and tailwinds that are working

334
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,800
right now in rebuilding uh advanced

335
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,200
manufacturing bases and

336
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,440
re-industrializing is really quite

337
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:43,760
fascinating. And I think we could all

338
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,920
probably say the next 5 to 10 years will

339
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:48,639
be the most dynamic time that we've been

340
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,800
in uh when it comes to thinking about

341
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,480
advanced manufacturing and society more

342
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,720
broadly. So I'm just going to take I'm

343
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,040
just sort of doing a third a 60,000 ft

344
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,959
view on what's been going on. And I

345
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,360
apologize for this parochial view which

346
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:03,680
is a US- ccentric view. uh I did work

347
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,600
for the Biden administration and I am uh

348
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,040
you know grounded in in in some of the

349
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,839
views on that front but they are

350
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,440
evolving as I'll I'll talk about and um

351
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,000
and hopefully this also sets the stage

352
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,680
for what John is going to say. So let me

353
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,839
first by just talking about what what

354
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,839
are the motivators behind this movement

355
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:22,800
in what many have been calling sort of

356
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,480
the next industrial revolution. And I

357
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,000
think I'm I'm going to list four here

358
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,800
and we'll talk more broadly I think

359
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,279
about others uh throughout the day but

360
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,560
um people can first uh first and

361
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:35,040
foremost I think it was the global

362
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,720
pandemic that essentially uh highlighted

363
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,680
all the vulnerabilities in the US

364
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,199
economy visav manufacturing and

365
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,839
resilience in our supply chains

366
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:46,639
domestically uh and even uh and also

367
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,000
globally um but whether it was from um

368
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,920
personal protective equipment to

369
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,480
semiconductors everyone's quite aware of

370
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,920
that we had significant challenges for

371
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,160
the country and they affected not just

372
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,839
national security but economic security

373
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,440
which now it's really hard to say where

374
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,920
does one start and where does one finish

375
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,240
but for semiconductors uh many will

376
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:07,680
remember that when we had the shortage

377
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:10,240
um of semiconductors at the in 2021 uh

378
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:13,040
the auto industry uh essentially shut

379
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,279
down and that directly affected uh

380
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,040
inflation that year by a third and so

381
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:19,199
you're seeing this inter interaction of

382
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,880
the of the issues that were both for

383
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,800
national security purposes but also

384
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:26,160
economic security purpose is a real

385
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:28,320
problem. um climate change uh we you

386
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,880
know climate change now tends to be

387
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,680
discussed in in terms of economic sec uh

388
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:36,800
sorry energy security uh but we have

389
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:39,519
increasing threats um uh due to climate

390
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:42,079
change but we're also seeing as the

391
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,480
demands from AI increase and from

392
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,399
increasing manufacturing centers as well

393
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,040
that companies are thinking about energy

394
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,880
security in a different way and that

395
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,199
requires integrating both their

396
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:56,000
manufacturing and their uh data

397
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:58,560
requirements in space in sort of uh

398
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,440
places. Do we have enough uh energy? Do

399
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:04,480
we have enough water? Do we have enough

400
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:07,759
uh you know uh capabilities re basically

401
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,680
to drive our industrial um industrial or

402
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,600
re-industrialization.

403
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,839
Third, the geopolitical landscape. Of

404
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,399
course, we've seen with uh Russia's

405
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,240
invasion of Ukraine and other conflicts

406
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,560
first and foremost a real stress on the

407
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,720
US defense industrial base. you know,

408
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:25,440
challenges to actually supplying enough

409
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,120
ammunition, uh, legacy systems that are

410
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,959
not, uh, you know, rising to the

411
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,360
challenge. And then, of course, the

412
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:34,160
tension that's been growing with China

413
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,320
over both military, uh, challenges, but

414
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,560
also technological challenges. And, and

415
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,720
there's data now to suggest that the US

416
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:44,560
has fallen behind China in many critical

417
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:47,120
areas. Um, finally, inequality. This is

418
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:49,600
I think at the core of a lot of our um

419
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,959
challenges sort of socially around uh

420
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,560
democracy. It's not just happening in

421
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,880
the US, it's happening everywhere. But

422
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:58,320
economic populism is often grounded in

423
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:00,160
economic insecurity. And so the advance

424
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,920
the manufacturing agenda actually has

425
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,079
been you know an area where people feel

426
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,319
there is an opportunity for expanding

427
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,400
middle class jobs etc. But that's that

428
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:11,280
in in my mind is also a motivator for a

429
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,199
lot of the policy we've been seeing.

430
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,439
So, I want to talk a little bit about uh

431
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,880
MIT's response. Um, I don't know if I'd

432
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,720
call it a I I think I'd call it a

433
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:22,799
response to a lot of what's going on,

434
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:24,799
which is we um uh Simon Johnson and I a

435
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:27,360
couple years ago started a priority

436
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:30,240
technologies uh seminar and the idea

437
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:32,559
here was that what we see is a real

438
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,200
convergence of um technological

439
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:38,480
development uh you know frontier

440
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:41,120
technology uh innovation going on uh

441
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:44,240
both at the firm and national level and

442
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:46,240
policy uh interests and these are

443
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,720
converging to sort of try and meet this

444
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,280
moment of national and economic security

445
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,880
challenges for the US. And so we've

446
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,679
developed a seminar. We've had a number

447
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:58,480
of our faculty present on areas where

448
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:00,160
they are leaning in to a tech the

449
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,240
technology development but also where

450
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,440
there's significant policy implications.

451
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:07,919
What does it mean for the country for uh

452
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:11,360
the US and also um you know around the

453
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:12,960
world to move forward and to advance in

454
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,720
these particular areas. Of course,

455
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,840
semiconductor is one of the key areas

456
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,520
since we've seen um uh the challenge and

457
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,200
then the introduction of the chips act

458
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:24,160
by the bid administration a few years

459
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:27,039
ago. Um and I think they also these

460
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:29,520
these six areas which reflect in some

461
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:31,760
ways foundational technologies like uh

462
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:34,000
critical minerals and semiconductors or

463
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,559
foundational areas really in the

464
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,640
upstream value chain to frontier

465
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:41,360
technologies biio manufacturing quantum

466
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,360
to some of the downstream um important

467
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:46,080
work in advanced manufacturing and and

468
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:49,520
drones really as a case study. This is

469
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:52,000
not of course a exhaustive list but a a

470
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,440
list that is evocative of what the

471
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,080
challenges are for the country in

472
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:59,039
combining both our innovation ecosystem

473
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,720
with our industrial ecosystem uh and how

474
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,960
do those two interact. I think drones

475
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:06,000
are a great example of that where

476
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:09,039
obviously uh very dependent on uh

477
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,360
critical mineral supply on um

478
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:14,559
semiconductors on advanced manufacturing

479
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,799
technologies and on the ability to

480
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,880
actually make drones at scale. Uh right

481
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:21,039
now in the US we make about 100,000 a

482
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,520
year that needs to be expanded to about

483
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,559
a million plus a year. And how are we

484
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,000
going to do that? Where are we going to

485
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,000
do that? Th those are important

486
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,520
questions right now. And just to

487
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,919
highlight a couple of the crosscutting

488
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,200
themes, uh workforce, which John will be

489
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,880
talking about, comes up all the time

490
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,880
across each one of these critical areas

491
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,400
about does the US have both at a

492
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,960
technician level and at a higher

493
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,440
education level the workforce it needs.

494
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,760
Um and I feel Vlad has been leading the

495
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,160
charge on what universities need to be

496
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,720
doing uh and could be doing to help uh

497
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,640
educate the next generation. uh supply

498
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:56,240
chains and manufacturing as I mentioned

499
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:58,400
without a supply uh secure supply chain

500
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,760
uh we the US is really vulnerable in a

501
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,440
lot of these areas and we have to be

502
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,880
looking ahead in that area we're we're

503
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,960
quite behind of course in critical

504
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,679
minerals uh but as you look at quantum

505
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,840
for example how do we build in uh

506
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:12,880
resilience across not just the country

507
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:15,200
but uh with allies and partners scale up

508
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,640
and demand pull this issue of uh and we

509
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,679
heard it earlier with some of the

510
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,200
panelists but how are companies um like

511
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:25,039
Dan's

512
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:27,120
making the move from the lab to and

513
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,559
prototypes to the pilot you know

514
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,880
production to demonstration to

515
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:32,640
commercialization uh the US capital

516
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,240
markets has not historically been well

517
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,240
organized for that kind of support

518
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,840
particularly in growth in growth capital

519
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,520
so what are we seeing there and what's

520
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,880
the role of government uh and the

521
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:44,400
federal government to provide some of

522
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:46,320
that demand uh early on small and

523
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,720
mediumsiz firms we have a challenge with

524
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,799
adopting new technology uh not just the

525
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,240
invention of the technology but the

526
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:54,559
adoption of the technology which has

527
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:57,200
always been a challenge or is perhaps

528
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:59,440
part of the the technology life cycle

529
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,480
which uh you know often takes about 30

530
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,480
years for to to really play out and then

531
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,919
finally R&D and I think this is

532
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,159
particularly important given what we see

533
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:10,799
in the country right now is without that

534
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:13,200
continued support by uh the federal

535
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:16,640
government which goes to universities

536
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,320
and elsewhere um we will have challenges

537
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,559
breaking through uh into new

538
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:23,120
technologies ies will have challenges uh

539
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:25,919
leapfrogging in existing places. So the

540
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:28,159
R&D is a critical part of the US

541
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,799
innovation ecosystem. So this is a book

542
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:33,280
coming out next spring. Um and I think

543
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:35,520
that the it's really helpful uh and the

544
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,760
lessons that come out of this can can

545
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:40,240
really inform directions going forward

546
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,760
for the US and and beyond. But let me

547
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,760
just take a quick moment to talk about

548
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:47,120
this industrial strategy that I think we

549
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:49,200
are now fully part of in the US. And

550
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,280
again, as I mentioned before, what we

551
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,120
see is that industrial strategy and

552
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,840
policy usually steps in when we see

553
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:57,440
markets are not responding to what we

554
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,760
need sort of through a national security

555
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,039
lens or an economic security lens. Um

556
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:04,480
that became clear with the B

557
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:05,840
administration with on semiconductors on

558
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,400
critical minerals on our defense

559
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,000
industrial base places where we need a

560
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,280
government to step in. And what's

561
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,799
interesting is to see that in this

562
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,360
current administration, we're seeing

563
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:17,360
likewise uh an agreement and a an

564
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,440
investment in some of these areas. A a

565
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:22,559
focus on resilience, a focus on

566
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:25,200
re-industrialization, a focus on uh

567
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:28,000
foreign direct investment as a priority.

568
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:30,400
Um but also some a focus on America

569
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,919
first, which brings its own um you know

570
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,679
challenges.

571
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,280
And I just wanted to highlight I think

572
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:37,039
people may be familiar but some of these

573
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,960
are really kind of interesting new

574
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:41,919
directions that the US government is

575
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:44,720
taking which is very active steps in um

576
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:47,200
investing in companies to uh strengthen

577
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,039
our supply chains and perhaps you know

578
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,600
create what some might call national

579
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:53,600
champions which has pros and cons. Uh

580
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,280
but the MP materials deal where the

581
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:58,159
Biden administration had invested in MP

582
00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:00,880
materials now you know DoD uh largest

583
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:03,600
stakeholder uh very actively trying to

584
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,840
build and create um opportunities or CA

585
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:08,080
capabilities and magnet manufacturing.

586
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,840
the Intel deal, uh, grants that were

587
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,480
given by the B administration, now

588
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:15,760
equity investments, um, now an equity

589
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:18,880
stake, um, and, uh, the the deal with

590
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:20,559
Nvidia, which, um, you know, which was,

591
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,080
uh, counter to the national security

592
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:24,720
interest that the B administration had

593
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,480
outlined, uh, also just very novel ways

594
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,880
in which the co the government is moving

595
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:32,000
forward. Nepon steel again trying to

596
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:34,000
secure domestic production capabilities

597
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,080
uh, long term.

598
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,520
So continuity and divergence. I'm just

599
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:41,120
going to talk um a bit uh in terms of

600
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,799
the continuity between the last

601
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:45,840
administration and this administration.

602
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:48,000
US policy very a lot of similarities in

603
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,559
terms of the focus on industries again

604
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,640
critical minerals semiconductors uh and

605
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:54,400
I'll I'll the semiconductor piece I

606
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,159
think for this group might be uh

607
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,520
particularly interesting as we know

608
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,919
there's been a lot of investment in

609
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,480
building cap capabilities for frontier

610
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,919
manufacturing in the country but uh but

611
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,360
right now what we're seeing also is a

612
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:08,400
pulling back on some of the R&D

613
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:10,400
investments uh some of the uh

614
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:13,919
investments in packaging capabilities

615
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,840
and creating more of a broad uh fund for

616
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:18,960
supporting you know many different types

617
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:21,120
of projects and companies. Um there's a

618
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,200
an agreement that really internationally

619
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,200
the World Trade Organization policies

620
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,279
have not served the country well. Uh

621
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,760
unfair trade practices that that people

622
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:32,720
want to you know change that that model.

623
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:34,880
Um and then the response to China, we

624
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,559
can debate about the use of tariffs and

625
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,159
how they're used, but certainly this

626
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:40,159
idea that the US needs to be

627
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:42,559
strengthening its relationship visav

628
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:44,720
technological development with China.

629
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:46,080
And then differences uh I won't go into

630
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,840
these in great detail, but I think

631
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:51,120
people probably, you know, are aware of

632
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:52,799
the tariff um tariffs now that are

633
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,960
broad-based and I think are creating a

634
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:56,960
headwind for US manufacturing right now

635
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,600
in terms of increasing the intermediate

636
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,960
costs of a lot of manufacturing. uh the

637
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,640
administration is sort of picking

638
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,720
winners. It's not to say that these

639
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,480
companies aren't worthy of investment,

640
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,919
but it's not ha doesn't have the

641
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,080
competitive process that you might see

642
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:13,039
to help you know build industries uh

643
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:16,240
that are globally competitive. Um it's

644
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:17,520
also focused on FDI. And then um I think

645
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,600
it's fair to say that there is an

646
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,279
undermining given the UN investment uh

647
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,880
challenges that we're seeing or the

648
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:25,360
pulling back of investment from a lot of

649
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,799
the national agencies in science and

650
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,840
technology that will have challenges for

651
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:31,760
the country uh long term. So to that let

652
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,440
me just say um the broader implications

653
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,840
I'll just close on a couple thoughts uh

654
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:39,039
that hopefully are food for discussion.

655
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:41,600
Um I think that there we have concerns

656
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:43,679
now about what are the long-term um

657
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:46,559
impacts on US leadership and technology

658
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:48,400
and science if our R&D engine is

659
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:50,240
compromised. That was discussed I think

660
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,960
maybe touched upon in the last panel but

661
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:55,440
a real issue there. Um we are also

662
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,360
seeing uh I think allies and partners

663
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,400
turning in other directions in terms of

664
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,240
their investments and their

665
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,679
partnerships. uh a risk of US

666
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,799
isolationism and and greater

667
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:07,600
protectionism that will be a problematic

668
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:11,120
limited state capacity and that uh we

669
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:14,480
are seeing both a reduction in in um in

670
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:16,480
workforce today uh particularly um in

671
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,640
the federal government lack of capacity

672
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,480
really to deliver on some of the agenda

673
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,600
items that I mentioned earlier for the

674
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,120
for manufacturing um and more of a focus

675
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,440
on deals, one-on-one deals with

676
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,880
different companies. Um, and I like to

677
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,600
say everything's on the table all the

678
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:34,559
time that there's a lot of uh dynamic

679
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:36,159
engagement right now in um in all that's

680
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:38,320
going on in trying to rebuild the

681
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:40,159
industrial base in the US. Uh I'm happy

682
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:43,440
I would say in the semiconductor space I

683
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:46,159
think there has there's more uh there's

684
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,520
more continuity. There's less uh um

685
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,760
pulling back on some of the investments

686
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,600
that have been made. But uh investing in

687
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,279
the R&D piece is critical and it's

688
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,120
unclear what that's going to look like

689
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,720
going forward. So with that, I'll uh

690
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,720
I'll stop and hand over to John. Thank

691
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,720
you.

692
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,039
Okay.

693
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:14,720
Hello everyone. I'm John Leu. Uh I teach

694
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:16,559
in uh the mechanical engineering

695
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,880
department here and I lead a group in

696
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:20,480
learning engineering. Uh so what I want

697
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,240
to talk about is you know these are the

698
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,760
kinds of headlines that certainly catch

699
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,919
might have caught your eyes certainly

700
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,840
catch my eyes. For example, Apple about

701
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,159
half a year ago announced 500 billion

702
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:32,080
dollars to expand manufacturing

703
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:35,039
operations in the US and then last month

704
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:36,640
changed that number to 600. Uh usually

705
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:38,720
these numbers are across you know one

706
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,200
two decades. This number is across four

707
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,840
years. Um GNOVA is making huge

708
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,200
investments. Uh Rivian just announced

709
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,440
last week that they're breaking ground

710
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,440
in their $5 billion plant. These are not

711
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,840
just one-offs as well. There's actually

712
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,120
a ton of different $1 billion projects.

713
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,840
This graphic just came out a few months

714
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:58,000
ago. Uh all the $1 billion projects

715
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:00,080
happening uh breaking ground across the

716
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,880
US and they all come of course with

717
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:05,440
hundreds and thousands of of jobs. Uh

718
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:09,039
also not just one you know sites here

719
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:11,520
and there. Uh if you take a look um at

720
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:13,360
uh um what are manufacturing firms

721
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,039
actually struggling with though? I mean

722
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:18,640
certainly a lot of very positive

723
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:21,120
investment into it. Uh this is these are

724
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,960
quarterly surveys uh done by National

725
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,880
Association of Manufacturing. Basically

726
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,279
what's your top pain point? Is it you

727
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:29,039
know business? Is it uh uh you know the

728
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:30,960
economy and sales what I want to point

729
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:33,120
out is that the gray has been rising and

730
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,039
in fact other than a slow small gap in

731
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,679
COVID it's really been at the top for

732
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:39,120
the past few years. What's gray? Uh gray

733
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,880
is attracting and retaining a quality

734
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,960
workforce and so gray has been king for

735
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,960
the past four or five years.

736
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,279
And it's not just showing up in employer

737
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,880
perceptions. Uh it's also in our

738
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:51,600
demographic data as well. So what you're

739
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:53,039
seeing in the red is demographics of the

740
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,279
manufacturing workforce about 20 years

741
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:57,279
ago. Uh and what you're seeing on the

742
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:59,919
horizontal axis again is age. So there's

743
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:02,320
been a massive shift of age to the

744
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:04,080
right. Right? So blue is where we're at

745
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,919
now in the recent years. Manufacturing

746
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,399
workforce now uh Bureau of Labor of

747
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:11,600
Statistics uh basically estimates about

748
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:12,960
25% over 55 and above. So essentially

749
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,840
what we're seeing is a very very large

750
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:18,240
that that peak there a huge wave of

751
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:21,039
retirements in the next decade. Um and

752
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:23,600
so uh this story in the US is not just a

753
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:25,840
US uh story. You'll hear this and I was

754
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,600
just in Europe uh recently. They're also

755
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,480
struggling with a similar issue. India

756
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,679
also wants to grow out their

757
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,919
manufacturing workforce. We have

758
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:32,960
projects there as well. And so uh these

759
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,799
are some of the questions I'm really

760
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,399
interested in asking. Possibilities for

761
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:37,679
new good jobs. How are requirements

762
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,679
changing? How do we prepare industries

763
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:42,000
and people for them? uh new systems and

764
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:44,080
tools to develop how we and transform

765
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,679
how we learn and how we work in STEM and

766
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,440
then finally what kinds of fundamental

767
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:49,520
knowledge do we have to uncover about

768
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:52,240
how humans work and learn uh in these

769
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:54,080
kinds of industries. Uh so uh you know

770
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,159
two years two years ago we were three

771
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:58,640
people uh now this is a picture just

772
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:00,240
from a few weeks ago really people from

773
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,240
the background three kinds of

774
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,640
backgrounds in my group human machine

775
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:07,039
computer interaction XR um learning

776
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,640
sciences education uh and then straight

777
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:11,120
up mechanical engineering manufacturing

778
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,559
that's kind of the three uh kind of

779
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:15,200
buckets of knowledge that we generally

780
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:17,120
draw from. Uh so what I want to do now

781
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,679
is kind of look through or kind of give

782
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:21,200
you a survey of some of the projects uh

783
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,399
that we've been able to do and and

784
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,159
hopefully they'll be relevant to this

785
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:26,080
audience. The first one is all all the

786
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:28,880
way on the system side. So we when we

787
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:30,720
think about advanced manufacturing uh I

788
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,000
have a premise or a hypothesis that hey

789
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,080
we believe there's something that's

790
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,320
holding people back in the workforce and

791
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,240
that is there's a kind of a a gap

792
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,840
between what technicians do and know and

793
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,360
what engineers do and know. In fact,

794
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,039
when we've interviewed now scores of

795
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,799
firms, we kind of hear a mantra like,

796
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:46,559
"Hey, I wish engineers had hands-on

797
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:48,559
skills." Ah, but I wish technicians had

798
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:50,159
analytical skills. And we believe that

799
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:52,559
in order to adopt and integrate new

800
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:55,039
technologies, these new technologies are

801
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:57,600
are all connected. So, you can't just

802
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:59,520
bring in uh a new machine and expect

803
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,760
that to work. It has upstream and

804
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:04,720
downstream effects. Uh technologies like

805
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:06,240
IoT or robotics or many of the digital

806
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,760
technologies as well. And so the

807
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,120
question is, you know, what kind of

808
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,880
worker really needs to be able to do

809
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,320
this? We started to ask a few years ago,

810
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,559
maybe we're thinking about this in this

811
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,799
wrong way. Perhaps we really need a new

812
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:19,039
worker type. And so this project, which

813
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:22,000
we've now published uh last year in

814
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:24,000
National Academyy's policyfacing journal

815
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,159
uh is about proposing a new type of

816
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,240
worker for to help firms move into

817
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:30,240
advanced manufacturing. I'm calling this

818
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,159
worker the technologist. uh and what

819
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,760
we're doing essentially is creating a

820
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:36,399
bridge to collaborate both with the

821
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:38,640
technicians who know the uh processes

822
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:40,320
and the equipment very well and the uh

823
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:43,279
engineers who are making decisions on

824
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:45,760
the level of of of design all the way to

825
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:47,440
systems and operations. And so this is

826
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,960
uh essentially we're taking and drawing

827
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,960
from the core of curriculum that we

828
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,399
teach here at MIT, the masters of

829
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,320
engineering and advanced manufacturing

830
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:55,760
design and adapting it for a new

831
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,679
audience. folks without university

832
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:59,360
degrees, folks who are assemblers,

833
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:02,000
operators, technicians on the factory

834
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:03,600
floor. Uh so far we've been targeting

835
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,519
aerospace defense, marine industrial

836
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,600
base, but now we're in conversations

837
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:10,080
with applied material, Samsung uh

838
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:12,399
thinking about how do we uh bridge over

839
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,760
to the semiconductor industry. Um, I'm

840
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:15,760
pleased to share we're just about to

841
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:17,919
finish round one, uh, phase one funding

842
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:20,399
from the DoD and we just were awarded a

843
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:22,720
$5.5 million grant to disseminate to six

844
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:24,480
sites in New England targeting against

845
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,960
the aerospace defense marine industrial

846
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,399
base. Uh so uh the six sites, you know,

847
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,360
two in Rhode Island, three in

848
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:32,799
Massachusetts, uh uh one in Connecticut,

849
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,399
even though the numbers are small, we're

850
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:36,320
just looking, we're promising to educate

851
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:38,159
about 180 technologists over the next

852
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:40,000
few years, but we ended up receiving

853
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,240
letters of support from senators from

854
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,159
all three states primarily because of

855
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,760
the potential economic impact that it

856
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:47,840
would have on states and helping

857
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,519
industries regain competitiveness. So

858
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,679
that's an example of the kinds of work

859
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:53,519
that we do on whole manufacturing

860
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:55,120
workforce systems or workforce training

861
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:57,200
systems. Now I want to spend a little

862
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,880
bit of time just highlighting uh some of

863
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,840
the kind of individual when we think

864
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:03,279
about individuals learning how kind what

865
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,880
kinds of technologies might we be able

866
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:06,960
to develop to support that kind of

867
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,279
learning as well. Okay, so here's an

868
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,880
example. Obviously, a lot of work in VR

869
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:12,640
training these days. We have a paper

870
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,240
coming out where we're benchmarking. Uh,

871
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,760
a lot of that VR training, especially

872
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,799
targeting towards manufacturing, turns

873
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:20,640
out. Uh, I can I can I can say kind of

874
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:21,919
one of the key takeaways. We don't

875
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,039
believe that a lot of this is informed

876
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:24,720
by learning theories and learning

877
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:26,559
sciences. So, what we're trying to do is

878
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,320
to try to push up against the space.

879
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:30,880
Hey, how do the learning theories and

880
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,240
learning sciences from education inform

881
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,320
the design of these environments? So,

882
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,880
we've now developed a kind of a demo

883
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:38,640
environment where now you can learn by

884
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,399
making mistakes and making meaning of

885
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,240
your decisions and choices where the

886
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:43,360
environment is open-ended instead of a

887
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,279
lot of what we see in the commercial

888
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,600
space which is scripted and linear and

889
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:49,360
doesn't allow for errors. Once you're

890
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,519
able to do that, then of course it

891
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:54,159
brings up the questions of okay, how do

892
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:56,640
systems work with humans to make meaning

893
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,919
uh or to make best the the errors and

894
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,519
mistakes that we all know are really

895
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:01,519
important to learning. And the second

896
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:04,000
part is I believe you know one of the

897
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:05,919
largest uh barriers to adoption for XR

898
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,079
is the just the high cost of developing

899
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:10,480
these experiences. And so how do we make

900
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:12,399
developing XR like using PowerPoint so

901
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,800
that teachers can make their own

902
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:17,760
experiences in the future. Um another

903
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,760
example of uh a project that we have is

904
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:23,440
hey we teach engineering design and

905
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,960
manufacturing DFM in mech by having

906
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,720
students take up our products all the

907
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,399
time. That's great, but you know, how do

908
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,839
we actually scale that kind of pedagogy?

909
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,599
Augmented reality is a really

910
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:33,599
interesting way because it's physically

911
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:35,280
in contextualized. It's also scalable

912
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:37,200
and you know, you can publish it on

913
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,200
things like Apple Store and Google Play.

914
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:41,280
So, we've now been able to do that uh

915
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:43,040
over a number of different uh iterations

916
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,720
of an online course. And now we're

917
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,639
moving towards how do we gamify the

918
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:49,200
learning? How do we bring in game- based

919
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:51,520
analytics to hopefully identify, hey,

920
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:53,359
are there patterns that noviceses might

921
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,679
approach disassembly and making, you

922
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:56,879
know, sense uh sensemaking of these

923
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:59,040
different features and connecting them

924
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:02,160
to design principles versus how experts

925
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:04,480
might approach uh that kind of activity.

926
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:06,640
Uh and then this is one of the newer uh

927
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,960
lines of work and given that I know we

928
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,640
have mastec folks in the in the audience

929
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,400
uh part part of this was funded by the

930
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,720
mastc grant uh for advanced

931
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,079
manufacturing where uh Hollywood has

932
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,599
been now in the space for about four or

933
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,200
five years where they're developing next

934
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:20,880
generation green screen technology. So

935
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,560
on the left what you're seeing is

936
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,160
snippets from behind the scenes of the

937
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:26,079
the production of Mandalorian. I don't

938
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:29,280
know raise of hands any any fans of Star

939
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:31,280
Wars here? Okay, good. Fantastic. So

940
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,800
that was the first iteration of virtual

941
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,200
what we call virtual production. Now

942
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,880
basically taking highdensity LED panels

943
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,640
and turning that into the actual

944
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,640
environment. So now when the talent

945
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,000
points at a mountain, it's really there.

946
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,240
It takes away a lot of the

947
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,240
post-production costs and it fronts it

948
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:48,400
up so that now you can engage with it in

949
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:50,320
a real-time way. It brings scalability

950
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,079
and photo realism at at a at a different

951
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,839
level. So what you're seeing here on the

952
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:56,240
right is we're finally developing the

953
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:58,000
space here at MIT. in building 35 again

954
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:00,640
partially enabled by support from

955
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,720
masttec and now what we can do is how do

956
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:05,760
we develop these beautiful videos and

957
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:07,040
enable next generation STEM learning so

958
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,560
if you're interested in that happy to

959
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,560
talk about it but that's that's a new

960
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,920
project in our group and then finally

961
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:14,240
we're really interested in like how do

962
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:16,800
we scale both the learning a lot of our

963
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:18,880
labs are incredibly expensive in the

964
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,640
equipment and also often underutilized

965
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,800
like maybe it's only being used one or

966
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:25,280
two hours in the day could we open that

967
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:27,040
kind of up so we have some work now in

968
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,720
enabling tele operations or developing

969
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,720
tele operations for students to be able

970
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:32,560
to access really really high-end

971
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,320
equipment from a distance and actually

972
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:36,640
we have now collaboration with

973
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:39,119
University of Cambridge and UK uh to do

974
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:41,520
some tele operations uh across different

975
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,720
tasks in manufacturing. So that just

976
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,240
gives you a sense of the kinds of work

977
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:46,560
that we're doing now in our in our group

978
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:48,160
to be able to enable uh uh next

979
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:51,160
generation learning and work in

980
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,160
manufacturing.

981
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,160
All right. Thank you.

982
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:16,880
Thank you, John, Liz, and Dan for your

983
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:20,400
remarks and s such an immense range of

984
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:22,079
topics that all connect to the substrate

985
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:25,440
of manufacturing and what it takes to

986
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:27,280
get ideas out of the lab or the early

987
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,599
stage

988
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:32,880
to scale and and all of the surrounding

989
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:34,640
factors. So we have some time for short

990
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,000
discussion and then the iPad we'll

991
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:38,480
probably have some some questions that

992
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,880
we'll try to tackle at the end. Let me

993
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:44,400
start with you Liz. I think at the start

994
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:47,280
of your remarks you said something like

995
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:49,599
the next 5 to 10 years will be the most

996
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,440
dynamic time in manufacturing. Can you

997
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:53,680
say more why why you feel that way?

998
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:56,320
>> You you want me

999
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:59,040
you want me to defend uh something I

1000
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:03,280
said? I I don't doubt it. But

1001
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:06,240
>> my assertion um well I think that that

1002
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:09,599
is uh I I say that for a couple reasons.

1003
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:12,240
one I think just technologically uh

1004
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:15,839
people who are if you look across uh

1005
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:18,000
every field um really that it's touching

1006
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:19,920
manufacturing that we're seeing these

1007
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,560
advances that were not even there you

1008
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:26,640
know 5 or 10 years ago whether that's in

1009
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:27,920
robotics or 3D printing or now with AI

1010
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,079
what the transformation is going to be

1011
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:32,880
there so there's a technological motion

1012
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:34,960
that now makes it possible to be doing

1013
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:37,520
things that we weren't actually

1014
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:39,119
potentially doing in the US before and

1015
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:41,119
now we're seeing that um and we're

1016
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:43,599
seeing it globally, right? Um it's not

1017
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:45,040
and and so that on top of some of the

1018
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:47,760
other things I said. So for example, now

1019
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:51,119
with supply chains, people are saying we

1020
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:53,599
invested in uh our primal our primary

1021
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:55,280
goal was efficiency in the last couple

1022
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:57,520
decades for a lot of the offshoring of

1023
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,800
manufacturing. Um and now people are

1024
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,720
stepping back and saying, you know, we

1025
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,400
have to also think about resilience on

1026
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:05,920
these supply chains. And so what does

1027
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:08,960
that look like? um uh and part of that

1028
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:10,240
is um some is domestic you know

1029
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,000
increased production but actually it's

1030
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,839
about strengthening global supply chains

1031
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,640
everywhere and it's redundancy and its

1032
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:19,599
regionalization and it's also AI with

1033
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:21,040
predictive um you know optimization and

1034
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:24,000
things like that so I think that's going

1035
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:26,160
on and then we have this uh world order

1036
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,640
shifting world order uh which we see

1037
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:31,599
happening in terms of uh manufacturing

1038
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:34,640
and priorities uh and sort of alliances

1039
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:36,000
a China US tension um and what does that

1040
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:39,599
mean? What are the implications for the

1041
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:42,480
rest of the world I think um are are are

1042
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:44,079
quite you know quite prevalent. Um and

1043
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,599
so I see like there and then you have a

1044
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:47,760
policy piece in which the government

1045
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:48,880
neoliberal models that said you know

1046
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,440
we're just going to leave it to the

1047
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:54,000
market are being pushed to the wayside.

1048
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:56,079
Uh and they have been for a long time in

1049
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,640
uh in other countries in Asia certainly

1050
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:00,800
but now we're seeing every country uh

1051
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:04,160
lean in to their investments in

1052
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:06,320
semiconductor uh production in uh more

1053
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,680
resilient critical u supply chains for

1054
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:10,560
critical minerals which will have a

1055
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:12,800
manufacturing implication. So that um

1056
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:14,960
you know that also just brings us into a

1057
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,960
time where that everything is it's a

1058
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,800
very dynamic time. We all of the models

1059
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:23,280
that we were built on in the last couple

1060
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:25,280
decades are really being um you know uh

1061
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:27,599
sort of upended I think.

1062
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:30,160
>> Thank you. And we certainly see in the

1063
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:32,320
the companies we work with uh the the

1064
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:34,800
interest in in rapid change and these

1065
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:37,119
kind of you know pressures internal

1066
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,640
external pressures that are causing

1067
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:41,599
reconsideration

1068
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:43,680
and and also an in my opinion an

1069
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:46,720
interesting ja position maybe not

1070
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:48,800
entirely that between the the companies

1071
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:51,200
you know that are building new capacity

1072
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:54,000
right take John you had a screenshot

1073
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,920
about Rivian and Rivian's new factory

1074
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,440
clean sheet right they and design it

1075
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,599
fully digitally from the bottom up

1076
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:01,680
versus say an established company that

1077
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:04,079
has to plum new technology into its

1078
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,680
existing operations. And some similar

1079
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:08,560
challenges, some some some different

1080
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:10,720
challenges. Uh and that leads me to you

1081
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:12,319
Dan. So when when we first met, I

1082
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,760
remember your technology is kind of

1083
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:16,560
magical, right? If I remember right,

1084
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:18,319
it's making something at, you know, a

1085
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,240
larger scale, not a huge scale, and then

1086
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:22,079
shrinking it down to achieve 3D

1087
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:23,359
patterning. Is that is that right?

1088
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:25,280
>> That was what we did.

1089
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:27,920
>> Okay. And that's a lot of what happened

1090
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,839
at MIT. But then, you know, you go out,

1091
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:32,800
you talk to the marketplace, and you

1092
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:35,680
hear what they actually need, right? Um,

1093
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:38,079
and what we learned when we did that is

1094
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:40,319
that actually some of the biggest issues

1095
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:42,240
in the semiconductor industry is just

1096
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:43,839
getting things in and out of the chip,

1097
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,839
right? And this is the case for

1098
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:48,240
electronics, but it's even more so the

1099
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:50,640
case for photonics. And so having a

1100
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:52,720
material that you could co-package with

1101
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:56,000
these things in order to connect stuff

1102
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:58,400
together had become and honestly always

1103
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,160
was, it's just worse now, the biggest

1104
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,000
pain point in the industry. So we

1105
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:04,640
actually switched to not shrinking

1106
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,599
things and using a scaffold material

1107
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:09,200
that is consisted of glass so that it

1108
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:10,480
was compatible with these semiconductor

1109
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,319
processes. And that was a really

1110
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,240
critical transition and a pivot that

1111
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:15,760
we're very happy to have made.

1112
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:18,000
>> Awesome. And building on that, can you

1113
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:20,480
talk more about the challenges you faced

1114
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,720
or you challenges you anticipate facing

1115
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,720
as you scale?

1116
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:27,680
>> Well, there's a long list of things. Uh,

1117
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:30,960
but you know, as a scientist, it's not

1118
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:32,640
sort of these really hard problems you

1119
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,319
think about in science that worry me.

1120
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:36,480
It's sort of these like fiddly

1121
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:39,760
engineering problems of how do you glue

1122
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:42,640
things together a million times? How do

1123
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:45,119
you position things with submicron

1124
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:47,599
tolerance over and over and over again?

1125
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:49,599
How do you make sure that your laser is

1126
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:52,560
stable and putting out what you think

1127
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:54,000
it's putting out day in and day out? So,

1128
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,200
I mean, these are the challenges you

1129
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,560
start to encounter when you're thinking

1130
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,720
about scaling up for manufacturing,

1131
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:01,599
which of course at these, you know,

1132
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:03,760
research stages are are not so critical.

1133
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:05,599
>> And I'm sure leading the company, you've

1134
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:07,599
thought about workforce and maybe the

1135
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:09,280
things beyond what you thought of doing

1136
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:11,359
your research. What are some of the

1137
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:12,079
workforce challenges or what talent have

1138
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:13,680
you had to find?

1139
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:17,119
>> The the technologist thing is something

1140
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:18,800
that um really speaks to me, right? Uh

1141
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:22,720
so when we're looking for talent, you

1142
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:24,800
know, the company is primarily not US

1143
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:26,480
citizens, right? That says something

1144
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,480
about the workforce that we have here.

1145
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:31,440
That's not by choice necessarily. That's

1146
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:33,440
just what talent we have access to. Uh

1147
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:35,599
but then you have to go out and you have

1148
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,880
to find people who you you know are

1149
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:38,640
willing to take on more of the

1150
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,319
technician type role and things in

1151
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:43,200
between like this technologist type

1152
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:45,040
role. And what we're finding is we don't

1153
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,960
find that in very many places. The way

1154
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:49,599
in which we've plumbed our educational

1155
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:52,079
system is just not fit to have both

1156
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:54,160
hands-on skills and this sort of

1157
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:56,400
analytical and creative thinking to

1158
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:58,640
solve these problems. Um

1159
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,240
>> you can send someone to my program.

1160
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:02,079
Well, but there are schools that are

1161
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:04,880
very good at this and we should be using

1162
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:07,760
those as uh examples um and maybe put

1163
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:11,760
trade programs together uh for that. Uh

1164
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:14,960
University of Wateroo is a crazy wealth

1165
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:17,520
of talent of people who have done co-ops

1166
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:19,920
at multiple different companies. So even

1167
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:23,920
in their second year in undergraduate

1168
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:25,920
they can come in and start essentially

1169
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:28,960
doing all the things that we would

1170
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:31,440
expect out of somebody quite frankly

1171
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:32,880
with who's doing a PhD here at MIT and

1172
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,560
oftentimes even better they have even

1173
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,160
more hands-on skills and that says

1174
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:38,720
something right there's something about

1175
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:42,160
the way we educate people where we have

1176
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:44,800
failed to really get them to do hands-on

1177
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:46,160
problem solving to an extent that is

1178
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:49,520
really important for these types of

1179
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:51,520
manufacturing. ing um problems.

1180
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:53,920
>> So, John, now I want to ask you this the

1181
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:55,599
scaling question in a in a couple ways.

1182
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:57,200
Incredible impact already with the

1183
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:59,920
technologist program. Like true

1184
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:04,400
congratulations, but

1185
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:05,920
180 in in a few years. What what if I

1186
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,440
come to you and say, "No, I want

1187
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:09,119
180,000."

1188
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:14,000
>> How would you do it?

1189
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:16,480
>> Uh so, we we designed this to scale. uh

1190
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,800
and and I would say this for on on a few

1191
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:20,560
levels. One is that the the content that

1192
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,400
we've developed, it's meant to be done

1193
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:24,079
in a hybrid fashion. So there's part of

1194
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:26,240
it that's online and then there's part

1195
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:28,640
of it that's meant to do on the in a

1196
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:30,400
hands-on lab. And so this is why we are

1197
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,160
partnering with schools as as you saw in

1198
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,520
the sites. You know, there's technology

1199
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:35,599
centers in New England, there's

1200
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:37,839
community colleges in the region that uh

1201
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:39,599
we're working with because not you know,

1202
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:41,760
skilled technical workforce and this is

1203
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:44,560
one of the big differences. they don't

1204
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,839
often uh relocate for a job like we

1205
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,119
knowledge workers do but skilled

1206
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:49,040
technical workforce don't they stay

1207
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:50,400
within the region so in order to upskill

1208
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:52,400
a region you really have to work with

1209
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,839
the regional partners there and so in

1210
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,000
order to get a rural Massachusetts we

1211
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:58,160
need an education site there and so in

1212
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,839
terms of John's uh question I'd answer

1213
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,200
this on on two levels one the

1214
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:03,839
technologist program if we're talking

1215
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:05,920
about that it is uh meant to scale

1216
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:08,000
broadly uh right so once we have this

1217
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:10,800
blueprint with the six sites now we have

1218
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,960
a full package where any education site

1219
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,960
uh in the US or really outside who wants

1220
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:17,119
to be able to do it can take up this

1221
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:18,560
package, send their folks to us for

1222
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:19,839
their instructors to be trained and then

1223
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:22,400
they can launch techamp in their own

1224
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:24,240
site and and a lot of the the lectures

1225
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:26,079
and the the simulations are online

1226
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:27,680
already and so sites can pick that up.

1227
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:29,920
We don't want to move away from the site

1228
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:32,079
nature though uh because of the regional

1229
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,839
uh connection uh a lot of these sites

1230
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:35,680
are embedded with real relationships

1231
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:38,000
with their employers many ofmemes for

1232
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:39,040
example that Liz was talking about. And

1233
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,319
then the second thing is, you know,

1234
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,760
these folks, they're really hands-on,

1235
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:43,839
right? So, we have to be able to offer

1236
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:45,359
those hands-on labs. The second part is,

1237
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:47,280
and this is why I'm so excited about the

1238
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:48,560
the XR work that some of you in the

1239
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,400
audience are engaged with, you know,

1240
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:52,480
that that we're certainly supporting,

1241
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,640
uh, is that, you know, I don't think the

1242
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:56,960
technology is there yet, but there's a

1243
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:58,319
lot of ways to scale hands-on learning

1244
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,920
in ways that are scalable and

1245
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:02,000
intelligent that I'm really excited

1246
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,760
about in the next 3 to 5 years that, you

1247
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,079
know, right now are still stuck in

1248
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:08,720
traditional modes of small cohorts, you

1249
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:11,040
know, one one instructor to 10. You have

1250
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:12,480
to be in the space uh, right now. And

1251
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,920
and this is why, you know, I have

1252
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:15,680
schools coming to me saying, you know,

1253
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,800
we have a weight list of 200 to 300

1254
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:18,640
students every single year. We're

1255
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:21,119
turning away students from the trades

1256
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:22,480
because we can't get the capacity up.

1257
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:24,400
And so, how do we work with those

1258
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:26,560
schools who are already in the space uh

1259
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:28,319
to be able to increase their capacity to

1260
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:30,400
get to the young folks or the incumbent

1261
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:31,839
workers or those who are undermployed

1262
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,599
who are interested in careers in

1263
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:36,560
manufacturing?

1264
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:39,040
Yeah, I would just add I know uh John

1265
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:41,599
speaks to this as well, but um the other

1266
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:43,440
part of this is uh is the pipeline is

1267
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:47,520
how we're attracting the next generation

1268
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:49,599
into this field because uh wages in

1269
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:51,599
manufacturing have not uh necessarily

1270
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:55,040
kept up. We've lost a lot of the wage

1271
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:56,720
premium we've had in the past. So for uh

1272
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:58,720
to attract the next generation, we're

1273
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:00,319
going to have to also see I think you

1274
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:02,160
know if we can increase the productivity

1275
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:05,200
of these firms, they can pay higher

1276
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:06,720
wages. They uh we hopefully can attract

1277
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,240
the next generation. But there's a lot

1278
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:10,720
of competition. If you look in

1279
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:12,720
Massachusetts, um you know, kids coming

1280
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:15,599
out of high school uh have a lot of

1281
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:17,839
options and it's um it's incumbent upon

1282
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:19,760
sort of the ecosystem broadly to to try

1283
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:21,680
and bring that next generation in. I

1284
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:23,760
think that's a a good example of the

1285
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:25,760
kind of the marriage between technology

1286
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,760
adoption, productivity, and workforce

1287
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:29,200
like with wages, right? All you really

1288
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:31,040
have to tackle this from a lot of

1289
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:32,319
different aspects otherwise firms can't

1290
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:34,000
pay enough, they can't get the right

1291
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:36,800
skills, they can't move into advanced

1292
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:39,119
modes of manufacturing. Absolutely.

1293
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:41,040
>> And John, I know you're thinking about

1294
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:42,880
AI these days and how AI can be

1295
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:45,040
incorporated meaningfully in in

1296
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:48,079
education and and learning. May maybe

1297
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:50,720
paint paint us a picture of 2030.

1298
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:52,960
How do you feel an MIT student will be

1299
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,640
using AI in learning or how a

1300
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:56,240
technologist a budding technologist

1301
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:58,319
might be interacting with the platform

1302
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:59,440
in a way that's you know not not yet

1303
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:01,599
possible.

1304
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:03,680
>> Yeah. So I I actually was just this

1305
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:05,440
morning talking to Sanjay I think a lot

1306
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:07,359
of us know Sanjay Sarma who's you know

1307
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:10,160
former VP of open learning and also in

1308
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:12,800
manufacturing about this. So uh I would

1309
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:15,040
be really interested uh you know if for

1310
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:16,720
even for the MIT student population if

1311
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:19,520
we could move towards you know what is

1312
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:21,839
the future of humanto human interaction

1313
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:23,920
for learning. Again I think even from a

1314
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:25,760
faculty perspective a lot of times we

1315
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,680
kind of delegate the teaching and

1316
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:30,319
learning to our TAs or to recitation

1317
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:32,480
courses. Um, I think there's potentially

1318
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:35,760
a real way to recapture the one-on-one

1319
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:38,160
tutoring that has still that still, you

1320
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:40,240
know, really is hard to compete against

1321
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:42,880
if you can think about a new paradigm,

1322
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:44,720
which is the teacher or the faculty as a

1323
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:46,480
high-end coach. Like if you think about

1324
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:49,280
you know an NBA athlete sitting down

1325
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:51,359
with their uh you know a coach or a

1326
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:53,520
trainer usually there's a session where

1327
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:55,680
they're bringing out highlevel analytics

1328
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:57,200
and covering the past week's performance

1329
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:59,599
and then thinking about a plan for the

1330
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:02,079
next week. Right now we not we don't do

1331
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:03,680
that in education because it's so kind

1332
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:05,760
of costly for a faculty to spend that

1333
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:08,079
time. Imagine, you know, another

1334
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:10,400
generation of AI plus analytics to be

1335
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:12,079
able to inform a faculty on, hey, what

1336
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:14,800
is the students progression in the past

1337
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:16,800
2 to three years and now in my 10-15

1338
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:18,319
minutes, we can really make that a very

1339
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,319
worthwhile experience when I'm crafting

1340
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:22,240
a a learning plan for you in the next

1341
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:24,400
week that we're working on together. And

1342
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:26,480
so that would obviously, you know,

1343
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:28,240
require a new generation of AI plus

1344
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:31,359
learning, but there we're not scaling

1345
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:34,000
out AI to become less personal. It's

1346
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:36,319
actually recapturing the human nature of

1347
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,079
uh humanto human learning.

1348
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:39,599
>> I also want to emphasize that a big part

1349
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:42,079
of it should always be getting people

1350
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:44,240
out of the classroom. So much learning

1351
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:45,680
does not happen in the classroom. And

1352
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:48,400
you know, you start to encounter the

1353
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:50,559
hairy problems in the real world, right?

1354
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:53,280
And that's the sooner you can get people

1355
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:57,839
doing that at a younger age, building,

1356
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:59,520
trying things, failing. And you know, in

1357
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:01,599
reality, this is kind of old as dirt,

1358
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:03,119
right? apprenticeships, we should take

1359
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:04,800
those types of things really really

1360
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:07,280
seriously and that's just a form of

1361
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:08,640
mentorship, right? Yeah. So, uh we

1362
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:10,880
should really think about how do we

1363
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:12,800
bring that in a more meaningful way into

1364
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,520
all of our educational institutions.

1365
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,880
>> It's a great point.

1366
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,760
>> Yeah, great point. And one hope I have

1367
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,440
is this

1368
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:18,880
>> kind of symbiosis between the digital

1369
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,800
and the physical can make learning more

1370
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:22,480
of a continuum and a par things in

1371
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,920
parallel rather than you know maybe

1372
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:26,480
spend four years at a university and

1373
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:27,839
then go work and and maybe like you

1374
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:29,680
mentioned Waterlue there'll be more

1375
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:31,200
universities with co-op programs. We see

1376
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:33,440
Northeastern, especially mechanical

1377
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:37,280
engineering across the river, incredible

1378
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:39,760
co-op program and such capable students

1379
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:42,000
graduating already as as experienced

1380
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:43,520
engineers. So, so to your point def

1381
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,119
definitely

1382
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:47,280
now I would take us in a totally

1383
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:50,319
different direction Dan

1384
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:52,880
foundaries vertical integration did you

1385
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:54,400
allude to you know and and share what

1386
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:57,599
you what what you're comfortable with

1387
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:58,880
like a radiant will will be the foundry

1388
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:00,000
of the future for these kinds of

1389
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,359
technologies or do you think of

1390
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,880
different how do you think of like that

1391
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:04,880
business model that

1392
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:07,359
>> this is a very complicated question you

1393
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:08,800
know the the semiconductor supply chain

1394
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:10,960
you know

1395
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:13,119
>> I hesitate to say I understand it right.

1396
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:15,119
I'm just learning even it takes years to

1397
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:16,800
even begin to get the map of what's

1398
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:18,880
really happening there. And more than

1399
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:21,119
that, different companies are vertically

1400
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:24,240
integrated to different amounts. So

1401
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:26,319
maybe some I'm talking to, you know,

1402
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:28,079
Google and they vertically integrate

1403
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:30,400
down to here, but they also work a with

1404
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:32,880
a supplier that's, you know, in this

1405
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:34,720
window and they work with an OSAT that's

1406
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:39,040
in this window and it's it's a real

1407
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:40,800
mess. Um but that's also an opportunity

1408
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:42,079
in a way to do this sort of vertical

1409
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:45,680
integration when you're going a little

1410
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:47,839
bit back to the drawing board. Uh

1411
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:50,240
and you sort of have to do this to some

1412
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:52,640
extent, right? You know, if you want to

1413
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:54,000
really do 3D nanop fabrication, you

1414
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:55,280
know, you have to solve the holistic

1415
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,880
problem. There's a chicken and egg

1416
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:58,640
problem there. You know, you need the

1417
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:00,800
materials platform, you need the

1418
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:02,880
lithography. You now have this design

1419
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:05,599
space that nobody has ever operated in.

1420
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:07,520
So you now need the tools to design and

1421
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:10,640
you then need to educate the market on

1422
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:13,280
what's possible in that space right and

1423
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:15,359
and that's very very complicated

1424
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:17,599
to give you a more concrete thing where

1425
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:20,000
things insert really really well it's

1426
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:21,680
actually in advanced packaging right so

1427
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,160
this is sort of one of the places we're

1428
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:27,040
finding there's a huge amount of pain

1429
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:28,800
right now and essentially you know when

1430
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:31,599
it's all inside the foundry that's well

1431
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:34,880
and good but then it starts to get very

1432
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:37,040
messy So as much as you can, if you can

1433
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:38,720
take those advanced packaging steps in

1434
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:40,720
the semiconductor industry and turn them

1435
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:43,119
into something that looks more like a

1436
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:46,319
foundry process, you get a really big

1437
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:48,640
win. Thank you. And I can imagine while

1438
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:50,400
there's big challenges, however much you

1439
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:51,440
decide to own, that also is a big part

1440
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,640
of the moat, right? This is why

1441
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,400
manufacturing is hard. It's the

1442
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:56,240
knowledge of how to convert the, you

1443
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:57,440
know, the design into the physical

1444
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:59,200
product.

1445
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:01,440
>> Absolutely. And I think business model

1446
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:03,200
is actually a big part of it, right? You

1447
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:04,960
know, if we were a tool company, we

1448
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:06,480
couldn't solve this problem. If we were

1449
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:08,640
a materials company, we couldn't solve

1450
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:10,720
this problem. If we were a fabulous

1451
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:12,319
company, we couldn't solve this problem.

1452
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:14,000
You know, you have to be all of these

1453
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:15,680
things when you're going from zero to

1454
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,160
one.

1455
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:19,359
>> Thank you. Well, we just have a few

1456
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,960
minutes left. I shouldn't ignore the

1457
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:24,240
iPad because we have some questions from

1458
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:26,720
from the audience. Uh,

1459
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:30,319
John, one of the audience members wants

1460
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:32,079
to hear about the Star Wars VR and how

1461
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:33,599
that relates to industrially relevant

1462
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:36,160
skills. It's not the highest votes, but

1463
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:39,599
I think it's a really cool question.

1464
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:43,599
>> Okay. Um, so, uh, uh, I'll give you an

1465
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:46,480
example. Um, so I would love to use this

1466
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:48,319
like, so, so I teach 8. I I don't know

1467
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:49,839
if this is an MIT person, uh, you know,

1468
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:51,839
I teach the yo-yo course, you know, kind

1469
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:53,200
of manufacturing for junior seniors. uh

1470
00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:55,680
this this term we were totally

1471
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:57,760
oversubscribed uh and one of the large

1472
00:54:55,680 --> 00:55:00,640
limitations that we have is factory

1473
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:02,319
tours like we're not able uh I can only

1474
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:04,319
fit one factory tour in because we have

1475
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:06,960
to fit it within you know class time and

1476
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:08,400
then how do we uh transport you know a

1477
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:10,800
whole bus load of folks and can

1478
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:12,000
factories even take 70 students everyone

1479
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:13,680
is telling me no they're only going to

1480
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,520
take 10 and then some of them you know

1481
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:17,040
have restrictions and and whatnot and

1482
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:19,760
then when we're there we're we're kind

1483
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:21,839
of at the uh kind of at the mercy of the

1484
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:23,839
host we might be seeing the process, you

1485
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:25,200
know, 20 ft away. Uh, and you know,

1486
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:26,880
we're kind of just listening to what the

1487
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:29,040
factory tour, you know, guide is saying.

1488
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:30,720
They might not even be an engineer and

1489
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:33,119
and then the process might not even be

1490
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:36,160
active at the time. I would love to be

1491
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:37,839
able to like imagine if I had a factory

1492
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:40,319
and I could take students around and

1493
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:42,800
show them a process and say, "Hey, you

1494
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:45,040
know, this part is incorrect. How do we

1495
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:46,559
do root cause analysis?" And like we can

1496
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:48,079
do anything we want to this factory. We

1497
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:49,920
can pause it. We can rewind it. We can

1498
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:51,760
go back to a particular place. Come with

1499
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:53,760
me. You know, all none of that is

1500
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:55,680
possible in a real factory. All of that

1501
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:57,760
is possible if I have a virtual factory

1502
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:59,119
that I can film myself walking around in

1503
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:01,119
a factory and do whatever I want with

1504
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:02,799
the factory. That's just one example. Uh

1505
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:04,400
I mean I think you know the mechanics

1506
00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:05,920
faculty are really interested in like

1507
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,920
hey stress strain fields are really

1508
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:09,760
complex 3D and when I'm lecturing I'm

1509
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:11,760
just like trying to take 2D uh

1510
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:13,040
cross-sections. How do I lecture around

1511
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:15,280
this? Well, I'd love to like walk

1512
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:16,960
through the field and do so. Or we have

1513
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:19,359
a physics faculty now working with us.

1514
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:22,319
Like she wants to rotate ENM fields for

1515
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:24,160
802. She wants to rotate and like rotate

1516
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:25,599
ENM fields and talk about it, zoom in

1517
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:27,119
and zoom out, walk through it kind of

1518
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:28,880
like I don't know if some of you grew up

1519
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:30,319
with the magic school bus, you know, but

1520
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:31,599
you're kind of like you're kind of going

1521
00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:33,040
through things and you're pointing out

1522
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:35,440
different features in a particular

1523
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:37,200
place. Um, that could all be possible

1524
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:38,319
now with lectures, video lectures that

1525
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:40,160
we could do. some of it for

1526
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:42,880
manufacturing but you know potentially

1527
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:43,680
for all STEM at MIT. So those are just

1528
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:45,599
some examples.

1529
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:46,319
>> Can we have a 3D virtual tour of MIT

1530
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:48,079
Nano?

1531
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:49,680
>> Yeah. Yeah. Vladimir, let's make it

1532
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:51,119
happen.

1533
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:52,559
>> Okay.

1534
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:54,640
>> Already in the future.

1535
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:56,559
>> I will say one thing. MIT used to have

1536
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:58,240
this amazing program called hacking

1537
00:56:56,559 --> 00:57:00,000
manufacturing where they took PhD

1538
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:02,319
students and dropped them in factories

1539
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,440
in China and then they messed around and

1540
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:05,520
saw what they could do with the

1541
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:06,640
manufacturing lines. And you know I

1542
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:08,079
would love to see more of that.

1543
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,400
>> I had no idea. I got to find out about

1544
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:09,200
that.

1545
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,400
>> Yeah, that's cool.

1546
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:12,240
>> All right, that's a great way to end.

1547
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:15,720
Thank you again so much and thanks

1548
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:15,720
everyone for listening.
