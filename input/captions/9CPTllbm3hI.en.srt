1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,359
Well, welcome back. Despite having

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,400
access to the same technology, some

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:10,800
organizations consistently realize value

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,519
more quickly than their competitors with

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,080
a smaller financial investment. In this

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,320
session, John Carrier will discuss the

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,240
technological, organizational, and

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,480
psychological factors behind this

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,960
phenomenon and how an understanding of

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,920
systems dynamics and lean operations

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,840
developed at MIT can help accelerate

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,559
your organization's successful

13
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:35,360
transition to a digital future through

14
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:38,680
organizational leverage. Please welcome

15
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,680
John Carrier.

16
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:53,159
[Music]

17
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:03,840
[Applause]

18
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,479
Good afternoon everyone. It is a

19
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,840
fantastic pleasure to be here and uh as

20
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,600
Randall said, I'm going to talk about

21
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,960
some of the more practical aspects when

22
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,280
you go to implement some of this

23
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,520
technology in your own organizations.

24
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,080
So, most important about my uh resume is

25
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,159
I do spend about half my time on the

26
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,119
factory floor. I am not taking off this

27
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,720
suit because I rarely get to wear it. Um

28
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,439
and the other thing I'd like to bring up

29
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,040
is I uh aside from uh being a control

30
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:31,600
engineer by training and going through

31
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,159
industry 3.0, zero. Uh I now teach the

32
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,560
lean operations course in our leaders

33
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,400
for global operations course. So uh

34
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,640
actually uh lean operations that term

35
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,439
actually comes from uh out MIT and it

36
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,320
was John Kraik under the uh guidance of

37
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,000
uh Jim Wulmarmac and John Shook uh was

38
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,159
really looking at in the auto industry

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,240
why does some organizations achieve

40
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,240
twice the results with half the input

41
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,399
and we heard Ben Armstrong allude to

42
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,520
that with the uh Numei example. And

43
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,520
while John uh Kraik was at MIT and doing

44
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,600
these studies in these factories, I was

45
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,920
at my desk at MIT doing lelass

46
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,680
transforms. So anyone who wants a lelass

47
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,319
transforms lecture, we can do that

48
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,840
later. Uh but the important point is uh

49
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,879
you have to get out of your desk to make

50
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,120
this happen. So, strangely enough, I

51
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:20,160
here I am teaching the course at MIT

52
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,480
that John Crafts really initiated and I

53
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,920
wanted to draw uh out of some of those

54
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,319
uh higher level lessons from the

55
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,840
automotive industry to basically uh any

56
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,000
group and you know that what those

57
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,440
companies do they think differently,

58
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,200
they act differently and they

59
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,959
communicate differently. But I want to

60
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,040
make one other point is there's actually

61
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,720
a middle layer within the organization

62
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,280
that we often forget. It's many of the

63
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,200
roles that you and I do and we are so

64
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,480
important to driving this part of the

65
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,000
organization yet it's not always

66
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,760
recognized. Okay, just to warm us up

67
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,200
with a quiz. Uh does anyone uh you're

68
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,280
driving down the road, you look out your

69
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,879
rearview mirror, you see a car like this

70
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,519
driving on the highway. Does anyone know

71
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,760
where you

72
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:01,440
are? Could be in Italy. Yeah, you could

73
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,879
be in a like a city like you could have

74
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,879
been in Stoutgart. You could have been

75
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,360
like in Milan. This is actually taken in

76
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,680
Detroit, right? And what that means, my

77
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,120
hometown by the way. Um, and what that

78
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,319
means is, does anyone know what that

79
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,319
means and why that car is like that?

80
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,840
Pardon?

81
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,519
Yeah. It's a um it's a it's a new design

82
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,800
that they're testing on the road, right?

83
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,599
So, they don't want anyone to see it.

84
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,120
That's camouflage, right? And uh I want

85
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,319
to tell you why that's camouflage. So,

86
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,360
this is that that's actually if you look

87
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,000
really close, that's a Lincoln

88
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,640
Navigator. But um what happens is if

89
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,360
you're a GM or or or a Ford and you

90
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,480
design this new uh car, it's going to be

91
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,000
three years till you get it into

92
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:44,239
production. Now the issue is Toyota can

93
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,400
get it into production in two years. So

94
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,879
if they see your car, they will have it

95
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,400
out on the market before you do. And the

96
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,000
reason I raise that point is there's a

97
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,599
lot of misconceptions about what lean

98
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,760
operations is and it's about being more

99
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,439
efficient. That's merely a part of it.

100
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,760
When you look at lean operation or you

101
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,760
go back to TaiichiOo from Toyota, it's

102
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,560
really about I want to go from customer

103
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:07,040
order to customer cash as quickly as

104
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,120
possible. Now for existing products and

105
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,200
services, that's a lot of efficiency,

106
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,879
but for new products and services,

107
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,239
that's about actually tuning up and

108
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,880
finding your new customers and getting

109
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,239
there much more quickly. So, um, just

110
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,919
really understand that when you think

111
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:21,519
about this production system, we're

112
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,759
always trying we're running a race from

113
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,440
start to finish, right? And whoever gets

114
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,000
the customer first and takes their cash

115
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,280
first wins. And if you satisfy that

116
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,040
customer, they'll come

117
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,880
back. So, um I do want to show you a

118
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:39,040
lesson from my MIT students. So, I teach

119
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,800
a course and uh what I did was I hear so

120
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,800
much talking about the new technology,

121
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,360
but we rarely spend time looking at our

122
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,520
own systems. So, I asked my students to

123
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,639
make a threeinut video of something they

124
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,880
do every day and actually find out where

125
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,639
all the waste was. And then finally, if

126
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,960
there's a technology, apply it and see

127
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,720
it. And I've got some amazing examples,

128
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,840
but I just want to talk through one.

129
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,440
This was um about three years ago, and

130
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,360
they shot the three-minute video. I just

131
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,759
took a screenshot from that. And what

132
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,400
happens that uh when you come to class,

133
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,759
you need to uh uh you're teaching, this

134
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,360
is for another professor I was helping.

135
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:16,720
Um you have to get four or five computer

136
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,800
programs to be running so you can

137
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,080
participate in the class. Well, how well

138
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,680
do you think that works when you're

139
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,080
asking everyone to get their computers

140
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,680
up and get all on the same page? Um, so

141
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,240
they decided to fix that problem. A lot

142
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,759
of variation. And what they found out

143
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:34,240
was when they uh did it manually, um, it

144
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,080
took 113 seconds. And this is if you did

145
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,759
everything correctly to basically start

146
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,919
up your computer and be ready to go for

147
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,680
class. Right now, you will notice one

148
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:44,160
thing that's interesting. A Windows

149
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,320
machine took twice as long as a Mac.

150
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,880
Right? And that you can trace that back

151
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,560
30 years which is just fascinating. And

152
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,240
then uh what the team did is uh and

153
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,680
there's a threeminute video and I'll

154
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,919
post it online so you can watch it at

155
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,960
high speed. They got it down from uh

156
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:01,199
basically to 18 or 12 seconds. So now

157
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,600
when you come into class students are

158
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,280
all ready to go and uh everyone's on the

159
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,800
same page and no one gets ahead and

160
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,880
behind. And the reason that's so

161
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,120
important is because uh I think the

162
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,520
number one complaint I'll ever get from

163
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,440
uh teaching is I didn't finish on time.

164
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,120
Right. content does not matter if you

165
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,800
don't finish on time. And then I figured

166
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,639
out why there's a really important

167
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,280
professor teaching after me and they

168
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:26,720
need to get to their class. So you must

169
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,319
uh uh first is finishing uh really

170
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,400
looking at your existing system before

171
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,560
you start applying this technology. Now

172
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,319
did we all talk about value? So what's

173
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,639
the value to this? So I asked the

174
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,319
students to calculate this and

175
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,039
essentially you know it probably comes

176
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:44,479
out to about two hours of teaching out

177
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:47,080
of a uh you know 20 session class. So

178
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,919
does that seem like it's

179
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:51,440
uh

180
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:53,280
important? The student like yeah what if

181
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,360
you did for all your classes? Oh what if

182
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,039
you took it to your job? And so before

183
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,639
they'd be like this isn't important but

184
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:01,280
now the question I get couldn't you have

185
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:04,720
just done that with Genai? So I can

186
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,319
never win. However, my point is there's

187
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,240
there's not a lot of thousand dollar

188
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,680
bills lying around, but there's a lot of

189
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,599
pennies lying around. And if you can

190
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,919
sweep those pennies up and save little

191
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,599
time here and there, all of a sudden it

192
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,960
starts adding to something that impacts

193
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,160
the customer. So, just a uh and this is

194
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,000
really for this group, a system

195
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,160
perspective of management. This is from

196
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,639
Russell Akoff, uh the famous uh

197
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,560
management theorist. There's uh really

198
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:32,080
we do deal with three things in

199
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,840
business. puzzles, problems, and messes.

200
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,360
Now, puzzles are are are basically

201
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,960
homework problems. It's a well-

202
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,880
definfined problem, and because it's in

203
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,039
a textbook, you know there's an answer,

204
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,039
right? Then the next level, when you get

205
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:45,039
into business, you start doing projects.

206
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:47,120
We have a well-defined problem. We just

207
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,880
don't know the answer. I would say that

208
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,720
90% of what this group deals with here

209
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,919
is what he calls messes. It's not a

210
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,960
really well- definfined problem. We

211
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,319
don't know if it's going to work, right?

212
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:58,479
So, and if we don't have this

213
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,160
coordination layer, nothing will get

214
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,840
done. No new technologies will get

215
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:06,160
adopted. No new customers will be

216
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,520
served. So, uh I just want to say, you

217
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,039
know, you really got to strike at

218
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,840
people's feelings and emotions if you

219
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,360
want to get them to uh uh uh connect and

220
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,720
head in the same direction. And this to

221
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,639
me feels like the challenge of the

222
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,919
modern organization. You know, you're

223
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,000
stepping up, you're trying to do

224
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:23,919
something, and there's a thousand little

225
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,919
things tied tying you down. And first,

226
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,360
uh the sea level doesn't fix this.

227
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:29,360
That's not what they're interested in.

228
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,839
they have other things to do. So that's

229
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:35,200
left to this this other second layer to

230
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:37,360
fix. And so I think it's really helpful

231
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,440
to look at a very simple diagram. Since

232
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,560
we've been talking about management

233
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,640
stacks and uh financial capital stacks,

234
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,080
this is kind of the management stack. At

235
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,839
the top level, you call that the

236
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,000
strategy, the C level, the direction

237
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,200
level. and they set the direction for

238
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,880
what the organization is going to do,

239
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,720
the customers are going to serve, what

240
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,480
they're going to invest, and then they'd

241
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:00,000
like to send that message down to the

242
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,440
execution layer to execute these jobs on

243
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,399
our our our excellent direction

244
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:07,760
strategy. And uh so when they send that

245
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,680
message down, they don't send that

246
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,320
message directly. They send it to a

247
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,480
group like this. and we are are

248
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,440
responsible for matching that high level

249
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,959
direction to what uh is going to be

250
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,560
executed on the daily work and that

251
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:24,320
basis. Now you notice uh we're really

252
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,640
developing a feedback loop here. So this

253
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,480
is the control signal, right? This is

254
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,120
the top down signal. There's also

255
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:34,000
another signal, right? There's the

256
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,519
corrective feedback signal. So uh the

257
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,160
execution layer, they'd like to send

258
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,680
messages up to the to the uh CEO level,

259
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,680
but they don't normally get there,

260
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,600
right? they go through our layer and

261
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,720
then we

262
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:49,040
normally filter it so that's uh it's uh

263
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,279
acceptable to both of those layers. Now

264
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,279
the issue is are we actually filtering

265
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:56,240
out the important information that needs

266
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:58,640
to be known or are we actually using it

267
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,240
to solve problems so that that we

268
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,080
actually can synchronize the direction

269
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,720
of the organization to what actually

270
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:07,519
gets done on the factory

271
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:09,519
floor. And sometimes it's not being

272
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,760
about being thinking better or smarter.

273
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:14,640
we actually need to think differently.

274
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:17,760
So this is Carl Dunker uh the famous uh

275
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:20,320
um uh European uh psychologist who spent

276
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,000
his last years in Massachusetts and he

277
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,720
came up with this great idea around if

278
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,040
you can't solve the problem make it okay

279
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,560
not to right reframe it right that's

280
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,640
been a popular notion but it goes all

281
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:34,320
the way back to Carl Dunker and I want

282
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:36,399
to show you um uh a very amazing

283
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,800
reframing that you might not be aware of

284
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,800
so first is let's talk about remember in

285
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,000
the early days late 90s they they're

286
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,480
starting these things called online

287
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,399
bookstores and there's many of them. We

288
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,320
I think we all know who survived. But

289
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,000
does anyone know what the worst part

290
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:54,160
about owning a bookstore

291
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,079
is? Books. Yeah. Inventory. Right. So

292
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,680
that's right. The books. The inventory

293
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:00,000
is the worst thing you can own. And and

294
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,399
uh why I'm showing that photograph is

295
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,040
because um that is a book that's unsold.

296
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,720
They they tore the the uh book seller

297
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,839
tore the cover off and had to send it

298
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:12,160
back to the uh uh uh publisher to get

299
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,600
their money back. So, in the old days, I

300
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,959
mean, the number of books that were

301
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,680
never read and the covers were sent back

302
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:19,680
was awful. So, okay, you're a company,

303
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,200
you're Amazon, you want to sell books

304
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,519
online, but you don't want to own books.

305
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,959
So, what do you do? One, you moved to

306
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,040
Seattle. Does anyone know why they moved

307
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,800
to Seattle? It was one of the two

308
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,760
largest book warehouses in the United

309
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,279
States. So, uh, what they would do is

310
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,519
you would order from Amazon and then

311
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,040
Amazon would

312
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:38,480
order from this large warehouse. So, now

313
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,839
they don't have to hold any books, but

314
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:44,000
they're selling books. One problem. This

315
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:46,079
uh warehouse wouldn't take orders less

316
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,720
than 10 books. So can you imagine if you

317
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,240
order one book and Amazon had to order

318
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,519
10 and wait for someone to buy the other

319
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,279
nine. So what did they do? Well, they

320
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,360
found out that if you ordered a book

321
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,839
that was very rare and not published,

322
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,680
they would basically uh put it on hold.

323
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,240
So what they do is they order 10 books

324
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,160
that no one would that were out of print

325
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,440
and the book they wanted and then the

326
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,079
company would ship the book they wanted

327
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,000
and then they cancel the other order. So

328
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,000
and the reason that's important is maybe

329
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,160
that seems tactical but these are the

330
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,240
type of tactical decisions that survive

331
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,639
while these other startup companies

332
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:23,200
capture books and uh thank you for your

333
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,519
lecture before using venture capital to

334
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,519
buy book inventory just seems like a bad

335
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:30,639
idea. Okay. So, we've got to think

336
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:32,240
differently. Um, I want to talk about

337
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,480
installing sensors. So, this is uh

338
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:38,399
actually a factory. I was on the factory

339
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:40,240
floor a few months ago and um uh I was

340
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,600
first of all, I'm always on the floor

341
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,240
watching what people do, right? Because

342
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,560
that tends to be neglected. So, it's an

343
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,800
easy first way to show advantage, help

344
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,800
the people on the floor and build your

345
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,720
trust and relationships. So after we

346
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,000
finished doing some of that work, uh

347
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,760
they said, "Hey, let's uh look at our

348
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,760
digital digitalization of the plant."

349
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,720
And they said, "Uh, oh, we just

350
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,839
installed 300 sensors." And I said, "Uh,

351
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,000
what do you what have we learned from

352
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,079
those 300

353
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:11,240
sensors?" Pause. We haven't had time to

354
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:14,399
look at the data yet. Okay.

355
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,839
Um, first of all, I like making bets. So

356
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,880
I go, "First of all, can we look at it

357
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,560
now?" And they're like, "Yeah, it's all

358
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,560
online." I go, "Okay, let's look at it."

359
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,000
So I go, I bet you that 20% of those

360
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,160
sensors aren't even reading anything

361
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,760
useful information. So they went and did

362
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:29,680
it. They won. By the way, 17.8% were

363
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,560
reading nothing. Okay, that's pretty

364
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:35,000
good. Okay. Um, but the second question

365
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:38,000
I asked

366
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,800
is why don't we just why don't you just

367
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,160
put in 30 and the most pieces of

368
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,279
equipment and just done that. And then

369
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,959
there was a pause, right? They're like,

370
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,480
yeah, we probably should have done that.

371
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,160
And then we thought about well why

372
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,399
didn't you do why didn't we do that

373
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,320
right uh because we're given this high

374
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,839
level message to make a big digital

375
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,000
transformation and just putting 30

376
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:02,880
sensors doesn't seem like a big

377
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,240
deal and and then um uh and remember

378
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,639
these are you know we were taking these

379
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,880
and this is a very good organization and

380
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,399
uh so one of the things I wanted to the

381
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,880
next thing I wanted to ask is you know

382
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,560
the question you want to ask is um a

383
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,800
classic paro principle if you're a new

384
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,120
plant manager and this uh person was

385
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,720
relatively new in the role. Um, and he

386
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,399
was thinking, I'm going to just expand

387
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:26,240
this and be the best digital

388
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:28,079
transformation in our whole uh uh

389
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,480
footprint of plants in Latin America.

390
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,000
Like, you know what? I'm I' I've been 30

391
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,720
years. That's if you do that, you will

392
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,560
be amazing. So, let me give you a

393
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,639
recommendation. Make a list. List the

394
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,320
five piece of equipment in this plant

395
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,399
that if they break, you're going to get

396
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,639
in trouble. And send that to the send

397
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:48,720
that to this VP of operations. and if

398
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:51,199
the plant goes down because uh uh uh

399
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,839
equipment piece 11, we'll just take that

400
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:55,519
and learn. So, that's a great idea. So,

401
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,800
then they left and then they didn't need

402
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,760
to engage me anymore because I gave them

403
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:02,720
the answer. Um but we're always talking

404
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:05,519
about balancing investment with return.

405
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,360
And if we sequence things properly, the

406
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,560
first round is basically getting it's

407
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,920
more about getting to know our own

408
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,480
system than it is actually the new

409
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,880
technology. And then once we start to

410
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,600
clean up our system and understand it,

411
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:20,240
we're going to be much better users and

412
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,920
and and and purchasers of technology,

413
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,880
that actually makes life easier for the

414
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,880
vendors, too.

415
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,880
Okay?

416
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:30,240
So, if you ever want to end a meeting

417
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,240
and you there's a project you don't want

418
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,440
to work on, you all know this, but we'll

419
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,360
just say it anyway. Just raise your

420
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:39,240
hand, say, "What's the ROI of this

421
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:43,199
project?" It'll just stop, right?

422
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:44,399
So, um, if you, uh, if you're in North

423
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:47,199
America, you probably have the same

424
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,880
thing in Europe, too. Is I, I I all want

425
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:51,279
you to know, you're all making

426
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,759
investments that have negative ROIs that

427
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:56,560
you will continue that you never hope to

428
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:58,399
use, right? All right. You all do,

429
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,639
right? And I'm going to give you a hint.

430
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:03,440
At least in North America, if you're

431
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:05,199
watching television, they show you all

432
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,560
these commercials with these animals in

433
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:10,320
it, like a duck, an emu, or a gecko,

434
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,440
right? Like, what are these things?

435
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:15,839
Well, they're all uh uh mascots of

436
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,279
insurance companies, right? So, I don't

437
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,120
know about you, I pay a lot for life

438
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:21,360
insurance or health insurance, and I

439
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,839
never ever want to use it. Right? That's

440
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,160
lesson number one about ROI. The lesson

441
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,720
number two about ROI which uh we just

442
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:31,040
touched about the sensors is uh think

443
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,199
about payback period right it has the on

444
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,480
the numerator it has here's all the

445
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,399
benefits we're going to get here's the

446
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,800
cash value but there's also a

447
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:42,320
denominator which is how much we invest

448
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:44,399
say why don't we cut that down to 20%.

449
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,680
We never really thought about that and

450
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,880
the reason we don't thought about that

451
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,720
is we got this mix between uh big change

452
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,199
has to require big investments and I

453
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:56,240
think maybe it does but you can sequence

454
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:58,079
it in pieces so that you can actually uh

455
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,839
start to get your returns while you're

456
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:02,000
actually making the investment and like

457
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,240
I said second good investments are

458
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,919
driven by good information every time

459
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,240
you implement the next incremental

460
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:10,640
technology and and actually propagate it

461
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,480
through your facility you have a much

462
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,480
better idea of what your plant needs,

463
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,039
how your how your uh people solve

464
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,919
problems and uh your your investment

465
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:21,520
will drop and your returns will get

466
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:22,559
better. Now I want to uh uh then so

467
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,240
that's really around thinking

468
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,679
differently. I want to show you another

469
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,280
example around once you think

470
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,120
differently when you go and actually

471
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,919
start implementing these technologies

472
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:35,360
you act differently. So this facility is

473
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:37,520
a um they make power uh uh distribution

474
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,640
boxes. It's a midsize company in the

475
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:43,120
United States. Um, so if uh any sort of

476
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,600
public event, military event, concerts,

477
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,120
they're using these types of boxes. And

478
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,880
um this company had been losing money

479
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,760
for eight years straight and they were

480
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,840
about to shut it down. And they just

481
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,080
finished spending $2 million for digital

482
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,919
consultants, which resulted in nothing.

483
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,480
So they brought in a a good colleague of

484
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,000
mine to come in and just automate a line

485
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,559
for us and then we'll copy the rest of

486
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,880
it. So I was fortunate enough being only

487
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,240
uh the plant was 70 miles away. So I

488
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,320
actually observed and worked with them

489
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,000
through the transformation. And just a

490
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:15,360
couple things I want to point out about

491
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:18,000
uh uh acting differently. So the first

492
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:20,160
question you ever want to ask is uh when

493
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,559
you're in a facility is uh and this

494
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,799
works for orders and uh software as well

495
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,240
is how long does it take for a customer

496
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:28,320
to get an order once they place the

497
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,320
order? And if anyone uh if you order a

498
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,400
couch in North America takes about eight

499
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,799
weeks. Now is there eight weeks of labor

500
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,520
in that couch? There's about four hours.

501
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:39,360
So with this uh same with this box, it

502
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,799
uh not only take eight to 12 weeks to

503
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,919
get a box that only had about 12 hours

504
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:46,080
labor, then when you actually looked at

505
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,840
the basic concepts, it was hard to see

506
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,799
more than two or three hours of labor

507
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:53,919
just from watching uh them put together

508
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:55,600
the boxes. So one of the things that uh

509
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,760
we noticed right on the first day is you

510
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,799
see uh you're basically wiring up this

511
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:03,840
box and uh one of the questions uh my

512
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:05,520
colleague asked is why do you put the he

513
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,480
saw people struggling. So the first

514
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,000
thing you ever want to do when you want

515
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,679
to look at a floor watch people

516
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,640
struggling to do their work. So he's

517
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:15,600
like so why do you put the box together

518
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:18,080
first while you're struggling? And um I

519
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:20,559
guess they never really thought about it

520
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,559
and um what they realized why don't we

521
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,000
build assemblies first and then we'll

522
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,600
put the box around it. So that cut the

523
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,600
labor down from eight hours to two

524
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,760
hours. The other thing I want to point

525
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,280
out is these are smart intelligent

526
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,880
people and we know that because they

527
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,880
basically they're the people that turned

528
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:38,080
around this facility. So the system

529
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,679
itself was not so smart, right? But as

530
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,280
we uh we all know and this comes from uh

531
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:44,160
Jay Forester, our founder of the system

532
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:46,640
dynamics group at MIT. A bad system will

533
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:49,320
defeat good people every time. And this

534
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:52,000
is just another example of that.

535
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:53,919
Okay. Now I want to talk about tech. I

536
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,440
don't want to sound I do not want to

537
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,440
sound like I'm anti-technology

538
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,679
especially from the uh institute I come

539
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:02,320
from. But you do want to be your first

540
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:04,240
few steps of technology be very careful

541
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,480
and then then good things will happen.

542
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,760
So uh and if you come from the

543
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,520
automotive industry, the one way to get

544
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,679
into trouble is invest in the wrong

545
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:14,480
technology at the wrong time. So when I

546
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:16,720
first came on site, my colleague, he had

547
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,640
this, uh this monument sitting in the

548
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,600
middle of the facility, and you can see

549
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,679
it's actually showing um uh uh uh

550
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,360
blueprints and diagrams of what they're

551
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,960
supposed to of what the team can be

552
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,320
building. So the first thing I went and

553
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,480
looked at and said, "What's the date on

554
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,720
it?" It was actually from that plan was

555
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,960
from yesterday which means they're

556
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,039
actually using this on a daily basis.

557
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,720
And then second I asked you know you

558
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:41,280
never invest money in technology. How

559
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,600
did you did you what what changed? He

560
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,760
goes oh no when I we were cleaning up

561
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,080
the other part of the facility uh that

562
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:50,240
was a display kiosk marketing was using

563
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,919
in Las Vegas and then it broke. So they

564
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,480
just threw it in a corner and left it.

565
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:56,559
We fixed it and someone in the facility

566
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,799
basically just set up the uh proper

567
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:00,559
Google connections and now they get the

568
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,320
daily and while I was there I saw people

569
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:04,799
coming up and looking at it instead of

570
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:07,760
walking around the facility all day. Um

571
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:09,360
so that was a very successful uh uh

572
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,120
investment that was based on money

573
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,760
they'd already spent. And you know what

574
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:17,080
marketing said when they saw it? Can we

575
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,080
have that back?

576
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,320
But I also want to say is now that

577
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,039
they've done sort of this kind of really

578
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,559
seeing some results from uh low uh

579
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:26,000
investing in the technology they already

580
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:27,360
have, they're now starting on new

581
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,559
product development. So when they

582
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,480
develop new products and they're

583
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:33,559
actually they're uh investments getting

584
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:36,159
larger, it's actually going to be uh uh

585
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:38,240
return a cash flow from new customers.

586
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:40,720
And by the way, within four months, they

587
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:43,039
went from minus a million dollars a year

588
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:46,240
to slightly cash positive. So pretty

589
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:48,000
amazing result. And so that's around

590
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,520
acting differently, how you go to the

591
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,360
floor and work with the teams and

592
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,919
introduce technology. I also want to

593
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,760
talk about communicating differently and

594
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:59,600
uh my good uh friend and colleague

595
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:02,159
professor Ron Westerm back in the 1980s

596
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,960
realized that information flow which is

597
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:07,919
something we consider uh as part of uh

598
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:10,080
control systems actually is deeply

599
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:12,880
impacted by the culture of your

600
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:16,840
organization. So for instance like when

601
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:19,440
I uh when I wire up a pump uh uh to a

602
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:20,720
PLC from different manufacturers they'll

603
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,640
talk to each other equipment to

604
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,200
equipment sometimes they won't but when

605
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,280
I pass on information to people we all

606
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,720
change the message right and

607
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:32,240
understanding how that message gets

608
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:34,559
changed is really critical and uh uh the

609
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,520
organization this he was working started

610
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:39,919
with was really pathological in that uh

611
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,760
the messengers were shot so that led to

612
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:44,799
low cooperation operation that's around

613
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,799
10 to 15% of organizations. The second

614
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:48,960
organization of which we're all part of

615
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:51,200
are bureaucratic right and I just want

616
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,039
to talk about one consideration is that

617
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,600
when something fails there's modest

618
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:57,360
cooperation we stay between the lines

619
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,159
when something fails we go to stay with

620
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,919
justice and novelty leads to problems

621
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,280
right because these are large organ

622
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,720
there's there's challenges to scaling

623
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,120
something right it can't the systems

624
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,640
can't handle too much novelty then you

625
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,120
go to a generative which is a

626
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,440
performance organization culture and

627
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,200
failure instead of leading to correction

628
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,640
leads to actually inquiry and

629
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,120
understanding and learning to a new

630
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,720
result. So the point here is not we'll

631
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,120
always have bureaucratic organizations.

632
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,960
The reason we do is they work. It's just

633
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:28,000
when does that organization have to

634
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:30,720
sometimes show some of these generative

635
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,400
uh uh uh properties of failure leading

636
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,320
to enquiry and getting that balance

637
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,080
right is key.

638
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,159
So when you go back, I'm going to ask

639
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,760
you to apply this and and uh during your

640
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:43,039
next break, you're going to actually

641
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:44,640
think about all the steps that you do in

642
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:46,720
your jobs that fit in that

643
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,960
synchronization level and what would

644
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:52,240
happen if that layer just disappeared,

645
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:54,480
right? And so one of the things this

646
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,320
layer does is that the the top layer is

647
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,799
we're being told future disruption,

648
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,080
right? We've got it. We uh have to

649
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,320
protect against the future. We want all

650
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:05,520
the new technologies. And then the the

651
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:07,440
bottom layer is make my day easier,

652
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,960
right? And if you go into a hospital and

653
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,760
you talk to surgical teams, doctors,

654
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,360
nurses, etc., still the same, right? I

655
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,520
have these highfrequency daily

656
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:18,080
emergencies, yet we still have to deal

657
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:20,000
with the long-term uh uh consequences.

658
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,480
And that is really the layer that this

659
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,600
uh group addresses. And I think the only

660
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,279
way we're going to get through it is

661
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,520
through our through our creativity. Not

662
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:29,279
only our own, but tapping into the

663
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,440
creativity of others. And isn't

664
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:33,200
technology really just a type of frozen

665
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,039
creativity that someone else has done?

666
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:38,000
So I think it's very important that

667
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:39,679
Slayer recognizes this and uh you know

668
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,159
this did make me think of a famous

669
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:45,840
Austrian movie star uh HD

670
00:24:43,159 --> 00:24:48,640
Lamar and she came up uh basically

671
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:50,000
during uh pre-World War II she came up

672
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,600
the idea with some colleagues this idea

673
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,279
of frequency hopping where you move from

674
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,200
one frequency of communication to the

675
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:57,360
other. In this case it was so other

676
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:01,360
people couldn't track you. But I think

677
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:03,200
our jobs in many ways on one uh one at

678
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,760
8:00 we're communicating on the factory

679
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,520
floor. Then at 11:00 we're talking to a

680
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,440
senior level person and then we got to

681
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,600
jump back and forth. And I think just

682
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:14,080
acknowledging this fact that we're this

683
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:16,240
balancing high and low frequency events

684
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:19,120
uh is really critical to to what we do.

685
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:21,039
And perhaps this is a way to uh uh

686
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,880
introduce technology. By the way, how

687
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:24,799
many of us here, don't raise your hands,

688
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,559
but how many of us here do more of the

689
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:29,039
real work when we get home than what we

690
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:31,039
do during the day, right? That is this

691
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:34,720
phenomenon. And by recognizing it, we

692
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:37,279
can make it better. And uh uh this is

693
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:40,000
basically the transition process I use.

694
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:41,279
Um and uh it's really based on two-step.

695
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,279
I won't go through all the details, but

696
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:45,679
I'll explain the key parts of it is when

697
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:47,200
you think about your uh uh uh long-term

698
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:49,360
vision of your digital transformation,

699
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:52,240
which is on the far right. That's the

700
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,600
this uh exemplary vision state. You're

701
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,400
actually starting over here at your

702
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:58,400
current state. And the key part here is

703
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,159
you want to put one or two phases in

704
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:03,200
between that transformation or

705
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:06,960
transition. And the first stage should

706
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:09,039
be more on taking away elements of the

707
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,600
current system that you don't want and

708
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:14,159
and just sparingly add new technologies

709
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:16,000
like simple sensors. Uh start using

710
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,840
information in the cloud and standard

711
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
algorithms. And once you've made that

712
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:22,080
transition to phase one, company's

713
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,320
working better, we've got some free cash

714
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,720
flow. Um we've built working

715
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,799
relationships with our colleagues, then

716
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,640
we're ready to start introducing those

717
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:32,799
next set of technologies. And the speed

718
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,960
at which you do that is basically

719
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,039
determined on on our abilities to manage

720
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,279
and

721
00:26:36,039 --> 00:26:42,240
lead. And uh I just finally why we do

722
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:44,400
it. Uh this is uh the final uh picture

723
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:47,039
after the uh transition when the company

724
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:49,919
went cash positive. And uh not only do

725
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:53,039
they have 150 employees uh in this small

726
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,960
community, this these 150 employees

727
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:57,120
support their families and their other

728
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,960
small businesses from those paychecks

729
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,880
they get from that uh transformation

730
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,960
company. And again, uh, their next step

731
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,960
is they're actually starting to use some

732
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,799
of the more, uh, sophisticated tools

733
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,600
like Genai as they're developing new

734
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:11,520
products. But they showed basically a

735
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:15,120
profitable stress-free transformation as

736
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:16,720
they move through this. Okay, this is uh

737
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,720
really the key slide about when people

738
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,039
say, you know, what do we what do I do

739
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:24,159
or what value do I really add to a

740
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:26,240
company? Why am I there? Um and whenever

741
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:29,480
you look at some sort of a performance

742
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:31,760
metric over time, uh

743
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,120
normally there's going to be a dip,

744
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,440
right? Because we have to invest

745
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:38,240
something first or learn and then it's

746
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,799
going to curve back up and uh generate

747
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,919
money. And of course, uh uh accounting

748
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:44,200
figured out a way around it. They call

749
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:47,760
it net income, right? They hide that

750
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:50,480
investment. Um and if we're doing our

751
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:52,640
jobs right, we can basically move from

752
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,559
this very poor

753
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,799
standard mindset that we have to invest

754
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:58,799
a lot of money first to by sequencing

755
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:01,760
investments we can actually have a much

756
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:04,720
smaller dip and in fact we might even

757
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:06,799
exceed expectations if we combine

758
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,120
creative problem solving with the new

759
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:12,080
technology and finally uh you'll ask why

760
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:14,159
I drove this by hand it's I I made I

761
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:17,600
spent about uh five or six hours putting

762
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:19,760
this all nice and and uh digital it took

763
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:22,240
the human element out of it so I went

764
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,760
back with the human element

765
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,399
And then I just want to give this a last

766
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:29,120
word from Jay Forester uh who founded

767
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:31,760
the system dynamics group uh at MIT and

768
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:34,720
uh has too many uh accomplishments to

769
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:36,880
mention but he said few people realize

770
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:40,000
the role that feedback loops play in our

771
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:42,880
everyday lives. Okay. And so just in

772
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,039
summary, uh do we explicitly understand

773
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:48,080
and value our roles of this middle layer

774
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:50,559
in the organization and where can we

775
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,799
incrementally add technology to change

776
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:55,120
the dynamic response of the organization

777
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:57,200
and then finally when we look at where

778
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:59,440
we spend our day like when I look at my

779
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,600
calendar and spend my daily time is it

780
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,200
actually matching up with uh that

781
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,600
synchronization goal that I should be

782
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,360
having with the organization. So, uh,

783
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,440
with that, I'd love to, uh, thank you

784
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,390
and just, uh, take any questions if you

785
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:15,960
have

786
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:17,640
[Applause]

787
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:20,559
them.

788
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:23,640
Okay, let's see, John, I think we have

789
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:26,559
time for a few questions

790
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:29,120
here. Okay, what are common reasons why

791
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:31,840
digital transformation efforts fail and

792
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:35,120
what should we avoid and look for? Okay.

793
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:38,480
So, I would say the the biggest one is

794
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:40,960
we uh haven't scoped. We've gotten to

795
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:43,200
the 1,00 foot level, the technology that

796
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,039
we want, and we don't invest enough in

797
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,520
getting for the first three months from

798
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:48,960
the thousand foot to the on the ground

799
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,399
level of what we're going to do next,

800
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,159
who's going to do it, and when we're

801
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:53,679
going to show results. That would be

802
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:55,600
number one. And then second, related to

803
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:57,600
that, you'll typically find something

804
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,679
that they you can show results in three

805
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,840
to six months. when you share that

806
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:04,320
message with senior leadership that will

807
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,520
create uh uh that that feed that

808
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,039
positive feedback loop and

809
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,840
communication. So I'd say that would be

810
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:12,159
the biggest one. And we have time for I

811
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:14,240
think one more question. How do you

812
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:16,480
recommend building momentum for digital

813
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:20,640
change when frontline teams are already

814
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:23,600
stretched thin? So uh uh I I've I got

815
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:25,200
the magic two words that uh I heard uh I

816
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,559
got I got from several of my colleagues.

817
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,480
It's called go to the floor and watch

818
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:30,320
for them where they're struggling. Then

819
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,159
ask them why they're struggling and make

820
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,520
a list of that. And then make a list of

821
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:35,520
the technologies you have. And out of

822
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,960
those 10 things they said, three of

823
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,080
those will match up with the new

824
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,520
technology. And that's what I would

825
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:42,610
recommend. Great. Well, thank you so

826
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:46,000
much.

827
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:46,000
[Applause]
