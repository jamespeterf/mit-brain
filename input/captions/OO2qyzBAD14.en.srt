1
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:18,160
so uh last week was a crypto day so I

2
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,240
didn't get to see you so let's kind of

3
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,720
do a quick kind of recap of where we

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,880
were uh and where we're heading to so

5
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:29,199
last time I saw you at least in this

6
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:30,840
room uh was two weeks ago where we

7
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,960
talked about

8
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:36,160
how to use uh the gkr protocol to

9
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,320
construct what's called a PCP a

10
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,719
probabilistically checkable proof and

11
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:44,079
what's a proof the idea is it's you take

12
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:45,960
a proof so take any NP language let's

13
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,680
say that has a proof like let's say

14
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,039
three set you take a witness or a proof

15
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:53,480
so a satisfying assignment and you

16
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,359
actually make it longer okay so you

17
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:58,800
don't shrink it you actually extend it

18
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:03,320
it's bigger but now to verify it you

19
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:05,760
don't need to read the entire a

20
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,640
proof what you need to do is just read a

21
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,240
few locations in this proof so you can

22
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,799
even though the proof is actually became

23
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,720
longer you can verify it much more

24
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:15,799
efficiently by reading just a few

25
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:18,159
locations and we actually showed how to

26
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:21,159
constructed how do you get a PCP and the

27
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:23,479
idea of how how uh to get a PCP the idea

28
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:26,000
was well let's look at the gkr protocol

29
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:29,000
for three set so let's do a PCP for for

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,840
NP okay so any NP you can convert to a

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,799
three set you know three set is and be

32
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,079
complete so convert whatever you want to

33
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,600
prove into a three set formula now you

34
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:40,079
have a witness now what do you do you

35
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:43,479
the you you want to generate a PCP what

36
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:46,320
you do is you you pretend you're a gkr

37
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:49,000
approver that has this witness the

38
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,560
satisfying assignment and want to

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,799
convince the verifier that this is a

40
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:57,600
valid witness so what do I mean by run

41
00:01:53,799 --> 00:02:00,600
the gkr protocol what I mean is let's

42
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,000
look at the so given fee let's say three

43
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,399
set

44
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,119
instance what you do you look at the

45
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:10,200
circuit C sub Fe that takes as input a

46
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:12,000
satisfying assignment an assignment and

47
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,160
outputs you know zero or one whether

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,760
it's satisfying or not this is a very

49
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,519
low depth circuit it's just as kind of a

50
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,560
bunch of checks and add the local checks

51
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:25,599
and and add them all together and now

52
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,959
what what we do is how do you generate

53
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:32,920
the PTP given this witness given this uh

54
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:36,360
uh uh witness for fee what you do is you

55
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:38,680
run in your head the GK protocol for the

56
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,840
circuit so remember the GK protocol is a

57
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:43,560
protocol that proves that a low depth

58
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:46,760
circuit that a w that an input is you

59
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,120
know that a given input even though it's

60
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,720
weird the verifier doesn't know the

61
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,560
input so it's kind of weird to think of

62
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,120
gkr in this context gkr the context of

63
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,319
GK was there's an input everybody knows

64
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:01,680
the input the pro and the verifier but

65
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:03,680
the circuit is large and the prover

66
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,080
wants to convince the verifier that the

67
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,799
output is

68
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,640
something here it's kind of weird the

69
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:12,879
input is more or less as large as the

70
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:14,360
circuit okay because the checking if a

71
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:18,280
witness that satisfying assignment is

72
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:20,280
valid for a 3 CNF not the 3nf is the

73
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:24,200
circuit here is almost the same size as

74
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:26,319
as the witness and so it seems like why

75
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,360
using gar here is very weird it doesn't

76
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,599
seem like the right application and in

77
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,200
particular the verif Fire doesn't even

78
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:36,439
have the input so how can you use gkr

79
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:39,599
that seems very unint

80
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:41,680
counterintuitive so the IDE is no let's

81
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,080
pretend that he does have the witness

82
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,080
what do you even pretend oh don't worry

83
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:48,519
we'll give it to him so in the PCP we'll

84
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,720
write the witness not only we write the

85
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:51,560
witness we're going to actually write

86
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,959
the low deegree extension of the witness

87
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,879
in the PCP okay so what is your big

88
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:58,680
proof it first contained the lree

89
00:03:55,879 --> 00:04:01,920
extension of the witness sitting there

90
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:05,079
then for now for each now think of the

91
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,560
gkr protocol for each and every kind of

92
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:11,040
question of the verifier the prover has

93
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:13,560
an answer write it down in the PCP so in

94
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,439
the PCP write if the first message of

95
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,479
the verifier you know the first message

96
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,400
is a bunch of like well the F first the

97
00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:21,600
approver goes first so you send the your

98
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:24,120
univarate polinomial then the verifier

99
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,759
sends a field element now you say well

100
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,960
if the field element was one here's my

101
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,680
answer if the field element was two

102
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,080
here's my answer for each and every

103
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,280
possible field element you say the

104
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,840
answer okay now there's only poly log

105
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:38,639
number F it's not so bad okay then you

106
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:41,000
give him the answer now for the prover

107
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:44,800
sent another field element now he said

108
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,440
for any possible next message here's my

109
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,759
answer and so on so essentially you kind

110
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:53,000
of open up this G gigantic tree now

111
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:55,280
first you see why this is huge like it's

112
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,479
it's it's like exponential but actually

113
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:01,320
G has a very nice

114
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:05,600
property that the Prov messages actually

115
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:10,479
only depend on the last very

116
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:12,160
few messages of the verifier so if you

117
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,520
remember the gkr it's a bunch of su

118
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,400
checks protocol it's like a just a

119
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:19,919
sequence of su checks and the PR's

120
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:22,759
message depend only on the messages in

121
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,840
the last subject so it's kind of very

122
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:27,919
few and kind of where you start it's

123
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:34,479
very few messages so to be a little more

124
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:34,479
precise each Pro in gkr each Prov

125
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:47,680
message depends on the last kind of what

126
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:49,759
it is it was log n over log

127
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:54,039
login

128
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,039
messages from V from the

129
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,400
verifier where this is like the number

130
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,280
of variables if you remember when we did

131
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,280
you

132
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,960
and it was a bunch of a bunch of sum

133
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:07,319
checks and each Su check was over M or 3

134
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:12,080
m variables this is the

135
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:12,080
m and the field is poly

136
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,960
Logan and here is the size of the

137
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,919
circuit so think of it the size of the

138
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,680
of the witness the size of the 3 CNF

139
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:22,400
it's all up to polinomial factors it

140
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:26,000
doesn't

141
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:28,319
matter and so now okay you depend you

142
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,800
need to depend on all these messages

143
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,639
from the verifier but there's only that

144
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,759
many each time even if you look this to

145
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:37,319
the power of this is only ply that's how

146
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,840
that's exactly how we chose h&n so it

147
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:40,840
will be P that's why we chose these

148
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:44,199
weird setting parameters and not just

149
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:47,360
two and and login but the point is

150
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:50,000
because gkr has this kind of

151
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,199
memoryless property of the of the Prov

152
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,840
you can expand all the gkr into a big

153
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:56,759
proof of size

154
00:06:53,840 --> 00:07:00,280
polyan now what does the verifier do the

155
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:02,240
verifier simply uh it so that that's

156
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:06,199
what the PCP is the PCP you write for

157
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,560
every possible kind of uh you know you

158
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:10,039
got write all the possible answers of

159
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:13,479
the provs and the Lo of extension of

160
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:16,039
your witness that's what the PCP is how

161
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:18,879
do you verify this PCP well you pretend

162
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:20,479
you're a GK Pro verifier you say okay

163
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:21,599
get let me see your first question thank

164
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,840
you now you're saying I'm going to

165
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,039
choose a random field element and I'm

166
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,000
going to look at the answer correspond

167
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:28,800
to this field element and then I'm going

168
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,080
to choose my next random field element

169
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,879
and you just kind of

170
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,960
go through this kind of tree and and

171
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:37,240
randomly and make sure and at the end

172
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:40,400
you need to verify if you remember gkr

173
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:42,800
at the end you need to verify to verify

174
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,319
you need to check your input on a random

175
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,680
point in the low degree extension this

176
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:51,360
is how GK works well you have the load

177
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:54,840
be extension uh uh sitting there uh as

178
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:57,720
part of your PCP so you check

179
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:59,639
that okay that's basically it except

180
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,599
there's one component that we're missing

181
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:04,440
and that's going to appear in your pet

182
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:06,599
which by the way is going to be out this

183
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:09,639
weekend okay so this weekend the pet is

184
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:12,159
going to be out originally the due date

185
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:13,639
was after Thanksgiving I'll move it to

186
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:15,680
before just to give you an incentive to

187
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:17,159
not take it with you on your break if

188
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,080
anybody needs an extension just let me

189
00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:22,319
know okay so you'll have almost a month

190
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,400
no not quite but close Okay but if you

191
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:29,240
need an extension just let me know uh

192
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:34,240
it's this is very arbitrary the okay um

193
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:37,760
okay so uh so uh what's the problem the

194
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:40,519
problem is so if indeed

195
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,760
the so what about soundless okay

196
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:44,320
soundless seems like it should follow

197
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,680
from just gkr okay you're interacting

198
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,839
with like a approver a gkr prover and

199
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:51,600
someone should just fall from the gkr

200
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:54,560
except that there's one point here which

201
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,800
is what if the PCP prover doesn't give

202
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,399
you a low degree extension of some input

203
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,519
so if he gave you a low degree extension

204
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:04,519
of an input and this input did not

205
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:06,440
evaluate to one namely if he's not

206
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:07,920
satisfying assignment then this input is

207
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:12,079
not evaluate this because one does not

208
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:13,440
exist in that case of course uh you know

209
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:15,040
it would the sound would really follow

210
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,279
from GK

211
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:20,680
soundus however one needs to think there

212
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:22,839
may be a malicious prover who doesn't

213
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:25,720
give you here a low deegree extension of

214
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:28,640
some double so what he should give you a

215
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,959
lot extension of w it means like some W

216
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,399
goes from f

217
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:35,399
to the m to F and it's of degree H minus

218
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:37,560
one in each variable okay if it's a

219
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:39,800
degree H minus one in each variable then

220
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:43,800
it it extend it's a Lo extension of kind

221
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:47,200
of the W sitting in kind of in so then W

222
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:49,560
is just W sitting on H to the m that's

223
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,440
kind of the little Cube where W is

224
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:54,440
sitting if indeed he gave you a low

225
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,240
degree extension of some

226
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:59,839
W then you're good if this W that he

227
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,680
gives you is of degree H minus one in

228
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,680
each variable then you're good but what

229
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,839
if it's high

230
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:11,959
degree what if this W W's what if he

231
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:11,959
gives you some W star which is very high

232
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:15,800
degree then is it

233
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:21,440
sound so in the homework you'll have

234
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:24,760
exactly this actually it's not sound and

235
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:27,279
you'll ask to find actually an attack

236
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,959
and then there's a way to make sure so

237
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,959
now what the verifier needs to do in

238
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:34,560
addition is to do what is called a low

239
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:38,279
degree test it's a test that verifies

240
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:40,079
that this W star has low degree okay so

241
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:42,639
this is what the homework assignment or

242
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:45,399
one part of the homework assignment is

243
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:47,279
about okay but this is module making

244
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:49,040
sure that this is actually the verifier

245
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,320
can't make sure it's low degree but he

246
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:54,160
can make sure it's close to low degree

247
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:56,839
so it agrees with some low degree

248
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,839
W like on one minus Epsilon fraction of

249
00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:00,560
the points so you can test that it's

250
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:02,560
very close to low degree if it's very

251
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,920
close to low degree then most likely

252
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,760
wherever you'll ask you ask randomly it

253
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:10,320
agrees with kind of the low degree and

254
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:13,639
therefore that's kind of the idea okay

255
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,440
but uh but but this is the PCB and the

256
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:20,279
verification just adds a low degree test

257
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:22,279
and we'll expand on then the pet okay so

258
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:24,399
that's kind of what we did most of the

259
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:27,680
class and then we talked at then we

260
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:30,920
talked about okay so now we have a

261
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,839
gigantic PCP it's very large but you can

262
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,839
verify it by looking at very few

263
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:37,760
locations which is nice how many

264
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:41,399
locations like the communication

265
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:44,760
complexity of the gkr which on circuits

266
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:47,800
of depth log n which or order log n

267
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:50,279
which is for example threat then the

268
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:52,639
communication complexity is poly login

269
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:56,000
so you can verify this by reading only

270
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:58,160
poly login locations as opposed to n

271
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,440
locations so it's like an exponential

272
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:03,440
Improvement but again you have this

273
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:05,800
gigantic PCP and now the question is

274
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,160
okay but who's going to note here's

275
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:11,000
something to just make sure you

276
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:14,760
understand it's very important that this

277
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:18,040
PCP is kind of given to the

278
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:20,600
verifier before the if the verifier C so

279
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:23,320
okay the PCP is very large now one can

280
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:25,320
say okay you know don't send the PCP

281
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:27,199
I'll tell you what my queries are just

282
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,680
give me the answers to my queries

283
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:29,920
instead of sending me anyway I don't I'm

284
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,880
not going to read them so why send it

285
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:35,320
over just send me the answers to my

286
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:38,320
queries that will not be sound if the

287
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:40,480
verifier if the approver gets to choose

288
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,959
the answers based on all the queries

289
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:46,480
that he sees sound this breaks down

290
00:12:43,959 --> 00:12:48,040
completely okay and so it's very

291
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:52,560
important that he first tells you what

292
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:54,800
the PCP is and then you query it okay in

293
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,680
particular what the damaging the hard

294
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,600
the the way the cheating Prov can cheat

295
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:02,440
is by

296
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:05,519
you know when you tell them give me the

297
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:07,079
PCP in location I if you ask for it

298
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,440
together with location J it will give

299
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:09,839
you one answer but if you ask it for

300
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,760
location J Prime he will give you

301
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,800
another answer that that's how he can

302
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,680
cheat but if he needs to fix it ahead of

303
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:18,320
time then no it's one answer doesn't

304
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:21,000
matter the other locations you ask and

305
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,639
that's what makes this

306
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,240
sound okay you can actually go back to

307
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:27,680
gkr and see if you use this PCP with gkr

308
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,279
where you give the queries ahead of time

309
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,760
it's like you give the sump queries all

310
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:33,800
ahead of time everything breaks down

311
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,399
completely okay so it's very important

312
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:38,720
that you first committed to this entire

313
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:41,519
PCP and then one can ask well if you

314
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,760
give this how does the so the entire

315
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,720
thing says look the verifier is a weak

316
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,839
device that's the idea he's weak he

317
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,399
cannot do the computation how can he

318
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:52,160
store this gigantic

319
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:53,920
PCP so it seems like that's very nice

320
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,519
but how do we use this

321
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,920
thing and the way we use this thing the

322
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:59,399
way it's used today these things are

323
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,560
used today and the way they're used is

324
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:05,920
using cryptography so what we do we use

325
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:09,040
cryptography to take this gigantic proof

326
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,560
and squish it okay and this is used

327
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,040
using what's called Collision resistant

328
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,880
hash functions so this is what we're

329
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,759
gonna kind of we're going to uh talk

330
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,800
about uh today we started last time but

331
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:20,880
we're going to continue today but before

332
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,759
we go into how we squish it and make

333
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:26,480
kind of everything succinct let me first

334
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:30,639
what what once we use cryptography we

335
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:33,360
can no longer ass get sound against any

336
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,720
all bounded kind of cheating prover

337
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,880
because

338
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:40,839
cryptography can be broken by all

339
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:42,839
powerful uh adversaries cryptography

340
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:45,639
assumes the adversary is not strong

341
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:47,240
enough to break our assumptions for

342
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:48,680
example the collisions and hash function

343
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:51,320
that we saw and we'll review it in a

344
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:54,480
second so now when we talk about proof

345
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:57,160
systems we need to relax the notion of

346
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:00,839
what we mean by a proof system by the

347
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:02,680
way who's scribing today okay great uh

348
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:05,199
we need to relax the notion of what we

349
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:07,600
mean by a proof system to what's called

350
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:10,279
a computationally sound proof system

351
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,440
namely you cannot cheat assuming you're

352
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:15,360
polom bounded if you're all powerful and

353
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:16,800
can break my crypto no guarantees but as

354
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,079
long as you cannot break my crypto you

355
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,519
cannot cheat so I just wrote it here

356
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:23,320
this is copied from last time uh so what

357
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,360
is so instead of interactive proof we

358
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:27,279
call it an interactive argument and we

359
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,440
say that an interactive argument for

360
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,800
some language L think of it like say NP

361
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,680
language but whatever language you want

362
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:36,079
to think about is a protocol between

363
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,839
aover and a verifier the completeness is

364
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:40,360
the usual namely effect is in the

365
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,240
language uh then you'll convince the

366
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,160
verifier with probability one okay and

367
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:48,000
if it's an NP and you know witness

368
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:49,680
you're also efficient okay the soundness

369
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,519
that's where the changes instead of

370
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,199
soundness you get some computational

371
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,440
version of soundness and the

372
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:59,000
computational version of sound says the

373
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,240
following it says there's some parameter

374
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,880
security parameter when you talk in

375
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,199
cryptography there's always security

376
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:06,360
parameter which kind of says how much

377
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:09,160
time do we

378
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:13,959
believe uh real world adversaries can

379
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:17,519
run in okay uh so what the sist says

380
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:19,240
that any real world real world cheating

381
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,160
prover real world mean runs in time

382
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,240
polinomial in the security

383
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:26,600
parameter we're going to denote secur

384
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:28,480
parameter by Lambda uh throughout this

385
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,720
uh class sometimes they call it by n but

386
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,480
n and sometimes K here n is going to be

387
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,839
input size so I don't want to so we're

388
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:38,920
just going to use Lambda so for any P

389
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:41,480
star of size polinomial in the security

390
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:43,279
parameter he can win only with

391
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:45,560
negligable probability namely there

392
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:48,120
exists a negligable function mu again

393
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:49,199
negligible means it's smaller than any

394
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,079
inverse

395
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:54,920
polinomial such that no matter which

396
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:57,720
security parameter you use and any X so

397
00:16:54,920 --> 00:17:01,040
think about the P star he's polom in the

398
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:03,680
security parameter he chooses an X

399
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:07,000
adversarially the probability or an X is

400
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:09,480
chosen okay it exists for any X the

401
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,679
probability that he convinces now the

402
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,880
protocol depends on the security

403
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:14,520
parameter so the verifier may may choose

404
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,439
like a hash function according to the

405
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,959
security parameter so everybody knows

406
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:19,640
the security parameter every run

407
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:21,520
everyone runs in time polinomial in the

408
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,319
security parameter and that's why we

409
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:27,760
give it as input the security parameter

410
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:30,160
in unary uh so an input X in this and

411
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,919
security parameter there's a protocol

412
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,120
and the probability that this cheating

413
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:39,200
prover convinces the verifier to accept

414
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:43,120
is this negligable function mu okay so

415
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:45,160
again we offer soundness only for poly

416
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,000
Lambda cheating provs okay so now you

417
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:49,200
should think of the cheating provs as

418
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,640
like a family of provs one for every

419
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,200
Lambda okay it's like a for any security

420
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,320
parameter you're allowed to give a

421
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,480
cheating prover but they're all let's

422
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:02,240
say run in time at most Lambda to the N

423
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:02,240
to the 10 okay so polinomial in

424
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:10,240
Lambda any questions about the review

425
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:10,240
before we go on to the new uh to

426
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:17,559
today

427
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:19,080
yeah is like like hide with this no no

428
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:20,679
no no good good good so two things first

429
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:23,960
of all we're not at all talking about

430
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:26,120
hiding okay if the if uh if we didn't

431
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:27,600
want succinctness you can take the pro

432
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:31,080
we just give you the witness here you go

433
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:32,960
check on your own okay and then but we

434
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,360
we'll want we'll want another property

435
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:38,000
from these interactive arguments which

436
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:40,360
is succinctness or or yes sickness or

437
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,520
you know yeah exactly for for NP for

438
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:46,159
example and

439
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:48,280
yeah that me formulas yeah exactly three

440
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:52,600
set is just think of it it's it's a

441
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:55,120
exactly uh just three cnfs you know it's

442
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:59,080
and of a bunch of lit of a bunch of uh

443
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:01,559
Clauses each one is like X i1 or X I2 or

444
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,559
not X

445
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:10,400
I3 small yeah so any any 3 CNF any 3 CNF

446
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:15,400
is of the form like uh Clause one and

447
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:18,520
Clause two and Clause n let's

448
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:21,840
say you can get a Boolean formula with

449
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:25,880
fan in two of size order log

450
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:28,360
M because you just do kind of the and

451
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:30,559
and you know all the ends and then you

452
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:32,520
have these little literals at the bottom

453
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,720
and each one is constant size it just

454
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:38,880
depends each Clause is constant

455
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,880
size so it's really a

456
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:44,679
log M

457
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,159
circuit okay so you can take any three

458
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:51,360
set which is just an end of a bunch of

459
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:56,679
literals and write it as a log uh depth

460
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:59,360
circuit can you go directly to SJ can do

461
00:19:56,679 --> 00:20:01,480
the PCP over SJ

462
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:05,039
by doing aromatization instead of going

463
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:07,320
through G okay to to do to get a PCP I

464
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:10,960
need to go the way I construct the pcps

465
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:13,000
by going through gkr I do a gkr on this

466
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,960
kind of circuit I open up all the

467
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,320
possible Pro Pro's messages and that

468
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,960
what constitutes the PCP in addition to

469
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,200
the low degree extension of the input

470
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:24,480
that's going to be the PCP and the

471
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:28,919
verifier just kind of verifies behaves

472
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:31,600
like the gkr verifier and checks that

473
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:34,520
the witness he gets the the extended

474
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,039
witness is of low degree like it does a

475
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,039
low degree test with the low degree test

476
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:39,039
we didn't talk about but it's going to

477
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:42,240
be in the

478
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:45,520
homework so that's how the PCP works and

479
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,880
now I'm kind of talking about how you

480
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,919
use this long PCP together with

481
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,960
cryptography to get these succinct

482
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,880
arguments that's kind of the next step

483
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,760
how to use cryptography to just have

484
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:58,120
like a fully succeeded protocol let's

485
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:00,039
say for NP we want a protocol that has

486
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:03,159
polylog communication because you have

487
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:04,799
an instance of Link n and theover wants

488
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:05,720
to prove to the verifier that X is in

489
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:09,159
the language and you want the

490
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:12,559
communication to be only poly log in for

491
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:14,919
example okay okay one thing I do oh did

492
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,919
you have a

493
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:21,240
question like like is interactive

494
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:23,640
protocol necessary because in like the

495
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:26,360
traditional like the complexity Ser PCP

496
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:29,240
the W has to be written down in advance

497
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:31,799
and not be and it cannot be

498
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:34,240
aded so it's the whole point the prot

499
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:37,279
try to like fix that problem sense where

500
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:40,120
you forcing to Comm exactly exactly

501
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:43,720
that's exactly it that's exactly it h

502
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:46,279
exactly one thing I do want to say note

503
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:49,799
that I ask for the cheating crover to be

504
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:51,360
polinomial in Lambda okay uh because

505
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:52,679
usually that my assum that's what my

506
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,960
assumptions usually look like I want to

507
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:56,159
say if I use Collision resistant I would

508
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:59,159
say well I use some Collision resistant

509
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:01,360
function uh with SEC parameter that says

510
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:03,600
that my assumption is that a PO Lambda

511
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,400
size circuit cannot find collisions okay

512
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,679
my my cryptographic assumption usually

513
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:10,360
assumes that the they are hard to break

514
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,760
against provs against adversaries that

515
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:14,720
run in time po

516
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:18,000
Lambda but this is may be may seem very

517
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:20,000
weird and very weak why because you know

518
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,840
our goal is to come up with succinct

519
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,799
arguments okay succinct in particular

520
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,760
one example to think of to keep in mind

521
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:28,520
is let's say the input n can be really

522
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:31,520
huge but I want the communication

523
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:32,919
complex be poly login so think of Lambda

524
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,000
as being like poly

525
00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:36,880
login okay everything is going to grow

526
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,440
with with the security parameter but

527
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,600
let's take the security member to be

528
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,039
poly

529
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:45,840
login now it seems weird you're like

530
00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:48,960
wait really so the cheating Pro if the

531
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,960
instances of length

532
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:54,880
n and the security parameters of length

533
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:57,279
poly log in the cheating Pro were not

534
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:02,039
even giving him the opportunity to

535
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:03,799
read the input so it's a very weak

536
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:06,279
guarantee so what does this guarantee

537
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:09,200
tells you let's say I want you to prove

538
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:11,880
to me that a given X is in the

539
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:14,320
language and my only guarantee is if you

540
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,760
run in time that's only poly logarithmic

541
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:19,679
in N you can't

542
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:21,840
cheat okay what if you run in time men

543
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:25,679
you

544
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:27,880
know so that seems like a problem

545
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,080
especially if look if n is too big for

546
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:31,400
anyone to read

547
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:34,720
then in some sense why like nobody's

548
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:37,159
going to use it anyway and if n is we

549
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,760
able to read it if I'm able to read it

550
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:40,799
then you have the time to run in that

551
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:43,159
time so you run in time n I'm not going

552
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:45,480
to assume you run in time polog n so

553
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:47,200
this seems very weird okay you should

554
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,000
not be happy at this point you be like

555
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,200
wait something is going on I don't like

556
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,400
this definition it's

557
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:55,080
meaningless like this SEC if look if you

558
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:58,480
don't want suc synness you can make

559
00:23:55,080 --> 00:24:01,760
Lambda B size of N and then you're happy

560
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:03,600
if Lambda is of size X like the in

561
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:06,600
instant size then you can say yeah the

562
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:09,120
instant size is some N I am I allow my

563
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:11,520
my real my honest Pro run runs in time

564
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:13,720
poen I allow my malicious Pro to run in

565
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:16,159
time poen and that makes sense to

566
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:17,520
me but now saying no the honest Pro he

567
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,200
can actually run in time men the

568
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:22,320
malicious cannot like no the malicious

569
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:26,120
usually has more power than the

570
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:29,240
honest so it's a very it's really a weak

571
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:31,159
guarantee that kind of

572
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,799
you know uh especially if we want to

573
00:24:31,159 --> 00:24:34,880
take the security the idea is we're

574
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:38,120
going to take the security F really

575
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:40,039
small okay really really small but if we

576
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:42,399
take the security paret so small we

577
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:44,200
should give the adversary more power

578
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:46,600
than poing the security parameter

579
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:48,720
because it just doesn't meet real life

580
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:50,520
what the idea is to the idea of this is

581
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,399
to kind of capture real life setting not

582
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:54,880
to make a model that makes no

583
00:24:52,399 --> 00:24:58,120
sense so if we take Lambda to be very

584
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,840
very small then the actually real world

585
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,720
would can run in time more than po

586
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:06,440
Lambda can they can run time

587
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:07,960
poen so it doesn't capture yeah if P3

588
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:10,120
the circuit how do we even think of

589
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:12,960
plugging in like a variable link X into

590
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:17,520
a circuit he can't they can't even read

591
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:19,880
X you're right yeah for

592
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,880
example so you can say oh P star can't

593
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:25,000
Redux you're right they can't Redux they

594
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:27,679
it's a circuit and yeah it can't

595
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,720
Redux this is a big problem okay so the

596
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:31,600
way I defined it is really doesn't make

597
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,320
much

598
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:37,000
sense

599
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:38,960
yeah why we need LDA to be PO is it so

600
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,039
that the resulting interaction is

601
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,159
exactly so great question the question

602
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:45,200
is why do we need it to be poly log in

603
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:46,440
you know let's so what I think where

604
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,399
maybe you're going to saying you know

605
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:51,090
what let's make Lambda enter the Epsilon

606
00:25:49,399 --> 00:25:52,760
for a constant Epsilon enter the

607
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:55,320
[Music]

608
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:58,960
0.001 then the communication complex

609
00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:01,880
then we say look uh the original proof

610
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,799
grows with Lambda which is n to the

611
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:05,320
point to the power of

612
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:07,600
Z

613
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:09,320
001 which is much smaller than n so

614
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:12,360
we're still happy but the cheating

615
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:15,600
prover can run time any poly any

616
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:17,360
polinomial in so it's polyn so that's

617
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,960
good you're right and that's that's a

618
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,600
good setting to think about in that case

619
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,520
there's no issues so one thing what

620
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:25,240
you're saying is you're saying let me

621
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:29,279
fix all your problems just take Lambda

622
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:32,320
to be think of it as n to the

623
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:33,240
0.01 and you're done or n to the Epsilon

624
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,320
and you're

625
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,760
done okay if you think about n to the

626
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,200
Epsilon everything kind of Mak sense you

627
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:42,200
allow the cheating prover to run in time

628
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:44,600
p n the instance is n and we're good

629
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:46,399
okay so that that's one way to think

630
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:48,320
about it so usually the way we think

631
00:26:46,399 --> 00:26:50,360
about we say for any n we choose a

632
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,000
security parameter that depends on N

633
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:54,480
okay that's usually how we say how we do

634
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,840
it we have an n and now we say okay

635
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,399
which security par do we use it's kind

636
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,039
of a function of n so that's what one

637
00:26:58,399 --> 00:27:01,880
example choose that to M and then you

638
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:04,320
solved all the problems but what if I

639
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:07,200
want more succinctness than that maybe

640
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:11,279
ENT to the 0.01 is not it's okay but I

641
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:13,799
want better I want poly login so what if

642
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:17,039
my Lambda that's one option but another

643
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:19,320
option is polyan that's even more

644
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:20,520
succinct so that's what I want now

645
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:23,120
you're saying well if that's what you

646
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:26,440
want you get a definition that makes no

647
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:29,159
sense and you're right but then what I

648
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:30,720
can do is strengthen the definition

649
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:33,640
so how do I strengthen the definition

650
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:36,159
I'm going to say you know what PO is one

651
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:38,760
option but let me make let me actually

652
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:40,880
make my assume make a stronger

653
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:42,600
cryptographic assumption I'm going to

654
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:46,880
assume some I'm going to say for any

655
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:50,679
adversary that runs that for any P star

656
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:54,039
that that um executes a circuit not of

657
00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:55,559
size poly Lambda but of size 2 to the

658
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:57,720
Lambda to the

659
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:59,279
Epsilon I'm going to allow my adversary

660
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:02,519
to run time 2 to the Lambda to the

661
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:05,640
Epsilon more than

662
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:08,120
poly now it's a stronger assumption okay

663
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:10,519
so now I want to say an adversary that

664
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:13,720
runs in time two or of size two to the

665
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:15,120
Lambda to the Epsilon cannot break my my

666
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:17,039
my hash function he cannot find

667
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:20,120
collisions it's a stronger

668
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:22,559
assumption but now this makes

669
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:24,679
sense so I can take Lambda very very

670
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:27,679
small but I'm saying even if the

671
00:28:24,679 --> 00:28:29,039
adversary runs in time that's much

672
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,240
bigger than than Lambda that's actually

673
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:32,440
two to the Lambda to the Epsilon even he

674
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:35,640
cannot

675
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:39,120
break my crypto and that's why when we

676
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:40,960
talk about suing proofs most often we

677
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:43,360
talk about this kind of assumption like

678
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:49,159
subexponential assumptions come up a

679
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:51,440
lot K we see that actually but often uh

680
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:53,760
if when if we want to implement so when

681
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:56,320
if we want to implement if we want to

682
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:59,919
take Lambda to be poly log in it makes

683
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:03,240
sense to require for this for for the

684
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:05,640
soundest to be to make sense to to

685
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:08,399
correspond to real world applications it

686
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:12,080
makes sense to require subexponential

687
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:14,080
assumptions of of of our underlying

688
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:16,360
cryptography okay so just to kind of

689
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:19,760
close this parenthesis one can talk

690
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:21,760
about poly signs cheating provs it will

691
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:24,039
give you more standard assumption but

692
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:26,000
the soundus guarantee you get may not be

693
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:28,159
strong enough depending on how Del how

694
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,760
security parameter relates to the input

695
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:32,399
size if you want lamb to be very very

696
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:36,919
the security parameter to be very very

697
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:39,600
small and yet you want to offer security

698
00:29:36,919 --> 00:29:41,080
against adversity the run time poly n

699
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,600
then you will need to make your

700
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:47,159
assumption

701
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:50,600
stronger okay but but but given this is

702
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:52,600
kind of a end a design Choice okay for

703
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:56,039
now we just going to think of you know

704
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:57,640
for any given P star of size poly Lambda

705
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:59,880
or more I don't know whatever we choose

706
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:01,679
here that corresponds to the Assumption

707
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:06,240
okay so if we have a t- secure

708
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:08,360
assumption then for any t- size so in

709
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,919
general more gener you can think of

710
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:13,840
replace this by T of

711
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:16,760
Lambda right any T it can be poly it can

712
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:18,960
be subexponential it can be

713
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:20,840
whatever okay and then we choose the T

714
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,799
and now the T kind of governs the

715
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,559
application but also have a t now we can

716
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:27,440
just prove it using math we don't need

717
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:29,720
to think about it anymore okay so that's

718
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:33,399
kind of uh

719
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:35,440
a the how Lambda relates to n okay and

720
00:30:33,399 --> 00:30:38,039
how the strength of the Assumption

721
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,039
relates to

722
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:43,039
n okay any questions about about

723
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:49,960
that okay so now let's uh go ahead with

724
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:52,159
how we use uh so that's what we want I

725
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:54,480
want to come up with a succinct

726
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:58,480
interactive argument for all of

727
00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:00,639
NP okay I want to show how uh I can take

728
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:03,880
any NP language let's think of three set

729
00:31:00,639 --> 00:31:08,880
why not it's complete I want to prove to

730
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:12,519
you that a a 3 CNF formula is

731
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:15,440
satisfiable I have a witness of length N

732
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:17,639
I want to prove to you that it's

733
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,600
satisfiable but with the communication I

734
00:31:17,639 --> 00:31:22,159
want it to grow only with

735
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:24,039
Lambda okay Lambda can be polog and I

736
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:25,360
don't even want don't don't go now to

737
00:31:24,039 --> 00:31:27,320
the choice how we chose the Lambda but

738
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,600
now I have a security par Lambda I want

739
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:31,760
the communication to only go with the

740
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:36,799
security parameter not with

741
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:41,480
n okay so how do I do it so the idea is

742
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:43,559
well I'll use my PCP I have my PCP I'm

743
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:47,039
going to use crypto

744
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:48,440
to squeeze it how do I use Crypt to

745
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:50,240
squeeze it it's exactly what Collision

746
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:52,519
resistant hash functions do they take a

747
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:55,279
big thing and they

748
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:57,559
squish them down so now I'll take I'll

749
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:59,600
take my PCP the prover will take his PCP

750
00:31:57,559 --> 00:32:01,120
he will squish it down using a collision

751
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,799
resistant hash

752
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:05,639
function okay so he gives a verif here

753
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:08,360
you go here's a like a squish like a

754
00:32:05,639 --> 00:32:09,799
digest you know of this PCP okay the

755
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:12,279
verify takes this thing it has no

756
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:15,120
meaning so what does he do now other the

757
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:18,720
proof okay thank you very much but I

758
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:22,440
want to see the PCP on a few locations

759
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:24,480
so now what can the prover do the pro

760
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:28,080
can't okay so Collision isn't hash

761
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:32,480
function as as is uh are it's a way to

762
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:34,600
kind of compress in a way that you can't

763
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,559
you're kind of committed you because you

764
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:39,000
can't find collisions later so you can't

765
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:41,960
open you can't kind of after you gave

766
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,000
the uh the hash value you can't open to

767
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:46,559
x and x Prime you can't give x and x

768
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Prime that both hash to the same

769
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:50,720
value but I don't want you to give me

770
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,919
you can't give me now you're hashing an

771
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:56,559
entire PCP the PCP is Big you can't just

772
00:32:54,919 --> 00:32:58,600
I never want you to give me me the

773
00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:01,440
verifier never want to receive this PCP

774
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:03,120
I can't even hold it I want to receive a

775
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,399
few bits of the

776
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:08,880
input so what we need is a collig in

777
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:11,880
hash that has a special property that's

778
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:14,840
you can open bit by bit so instead of

779
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:17,880
giving me the entire kind of input the

780
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:19,919
entire pre-image of the hash value I

781
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:22,360
want you just to give me a few bits here

782
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:25,120
a few bits here and a few bits here and

783
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:29,240
prove to me that they're they correspond

784
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:31,320
to to what to the input you have

785
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,919
so I'm now I'm going to Define this

786
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:34,639
primitive once I have this we're going

787
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:36,679
to see it's going to be very easy to

788
00:33:34,639 --> 00:33:41,279
come up with the actual interactive

789
00:33:36,679 --> 00:33:44,279
argument okay so the Primitive is a a

790
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:46,960
what's called a collision resistant hash

791
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:48,039
with local opening let me Define it so

792
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:51,120
we're going to have a collision

793
00:33:48,039 --> 00:33:54,120
resistant hash function with local

794
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,120
opening

795
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:04,480
and this consists of five algorithms the

796
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:07,440
first one is the first two are gen and

797
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,960
Dalal these are exactly these two

798
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,919
algorithms is is what defines cud and

799
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:14,480
hash function so this we saw last time

800
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:17,720
I'll just repeat just to recall gen

801
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:20,399
takes his input a one to the Lambda the

802
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:24,879
security parameter and

803
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:28,399
outputs hash key so this is some key

804
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:31,800
eval takes his input hash key and any

805
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:35,280
input X from zero one star

806
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:37,720
anything okay any string of any length

807
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,720
and it

808
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:44,919
outputs a hash

809
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:47,919
value we denote it V and that's fixed in

810
00:34:44,919 --> 00:34:50,079
0 one to the Lambda I I call sometimes

811
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:54,079
Delta and sometimes Lambda right sorry

812
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:56,200
it's Lambda a you output a hash of a

813
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:58,520
fixed size which means you can take very

814
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:01,520
very long things and you digest down you

815
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:05,079
digest them down to a value of size

816
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:07,400
Lambda okay so it takes an input of

817
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:10,320
arbitrary size can be huge can be two

818
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:12,280
Lambda four Lambda ton huge and it

819
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,560
digest down to a string of size of

820
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:16,520
length

821
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:18,960
Lambda okay now there's two more

822
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:21,880
algorithms two or three okay so now

823
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:24,200
there's an algorithm called

824
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:25,920
open open I just want to make sure I

825
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:29,680
want to tell me don't give me theti I

826
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:31,599
want to I want to so V is just digest

827
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:34,240
has no meaning I want to tell you now I

828
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:36,040
want the I bit of X don't give me all of

829
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:39,839
X what you have I can't hold it I just

830
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:41,839
want the I bit so open so what do you do

831
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:44,160
you open how do you open you have the

832
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:47,640
hash key you have

833
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:52,760
X which you computed the value V and now

834
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:55,640
you have some I in kind of 01 to the

835
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:58,359
length of X so this is kind of which

836
00:35:55,640 --> 00:36:01,319
index I want you to open

837
00:35:58,359 --> 00:36:01,319
and what you

838
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:09,880
output is a bit B which is kind of

839
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:12,800
correspond to x i the I bit a bit and an

840
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:16,280
opening value

841
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:19,119
row okay this is some kind of uh string

842
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:19,119
and this is of

843
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:29,200
size Lambda so

844
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:29,200
small or it can be po Lambda

845
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:38,760
okay an opening of size poly Lambda

846
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:41,040
yes who's uh running the open good who's

847
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:43,520
running the open good the person who

848
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:47,200
generated the hash so let's say you're

849
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:49,960
the Prov you want to prove to me uh that

850
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:51,359
Fe satisfiable you generate a PCP I

851
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:53,480
don't want your PCP it's too big you

852
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:56,240
give me a hash a value V thank you very

853
00:36:53,480 --> 00:37:00,359
much now I want you to open the PCP and

854
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:02,359
some location I so I tell you here's I I

855
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:05,800
don't know your PCP I don't know your

856
00:37:02,359 --> 00:37:08,560
input you give me some row I like an

857
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,839
open give me XI if you only give me XI

858
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,560
you can cheat you can give me whatever

859
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:13,560
you want I don't believe you so I want

860
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:16,720
you to give me kind of row I this

861
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:19,720
opening is like a proof that indeed what

862
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:22,079
what I hash down in the I location is

863
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:25,359
sitting XI this is what you think of

864
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:28,960
rowy it's like a proof yeah shouldn't I

865
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:28,960
be in

866
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:38,200
oh sorry sorry sorry sorry thank you

867
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:41,319
sorry it's an index not in01 sorry it's

868
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:43,760
an it's an it's an index with one until

869
00:37:41,319 --> 00:37:46,280
the length of x one to n let's see yeah

870
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,280
thank you very

871
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:52,400
much questions

872
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:55,720
yeah just

873
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:59,520
like I guess it's just interesting that

874
00:37:55,720 --> 00:38:01,880
you have to retain the higher hash value

875
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:03,880
X like maybe that's necessary for

876
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:07,000
correctness to be able

877
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:08,200
to uh confirm any bit of X but I don't

878
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,520
know it just seems interesting that in

879
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:11,880
practice you would have to store keep

880
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,880
storing all these hash values right so

881
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:16,680
what you wait let me make sure what your

882
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:18,480
your comment is not that to open you

883
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:21,000
need to know the entire

884
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:23,920
X and why do you need to know the entire

885
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,680
X in a sense to open to bit eye so in

886
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:28,319
some sense

887
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:30,280
look I mean to open to bit I all you

888
00:38:28,319 --> 00:38:32,040
need to remember is row I that's kind of

889
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:35,800
what you need to give for the opening

890
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:39,520
but all the row eyes together give

891
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:42,839
contain all the X so that's why you need

892
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:44,520
to to kind of store all the X and you'll

893
00:38:42,839 --> 00:38:47,800
see the construction soon so it'll be

894
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:50,680
kind of uh uh clear uh okay the last

895
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:54,640
algorithm is what we call Ver

896
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:58,240
verify and verify takes his input a hash

897
00:38:54,640 --> 00:39:01,119
key a a hash so now I'm verifying you

898
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:04,200
gave me x i and row I how do I know it's

899
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:09,040
good so I take my hash key the hash key

900
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:14,319
the value that you gave me i x i and row

901
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:16,200
I and this algorithm outputs zero or one

902
00:39:14,319 --> 00:39:18,800
namely accept or

903
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:24,599
reject okay so I can kind of

904
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:27,040
verify uh whether the row is a valid

905
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:29,520
opening okay and now what are the

906
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:31,680
guarant es so you can hash and then you

907
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:34,680
can open like

908
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:36,119
a what is the guarantee the guarantee is

909
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:39,119
first of all if you do everything

910
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:39,960
honestly I'll accept you okay so there's

911
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:43,520
two

912
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:45,520
guarantees the first guarantee is just

913
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:47,960
correctness and the second guarantee we

914
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:51,040
want is Collision resistant so we'll see

915
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:51,040
so for

916
00:39:53,319 --> 00:39:59,440
correctness uh before actually let me

917
00:39:55,400 --> 00:40:03,359
just uh a sorry let me just say these

918
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:07,240
are all PPT algorithms okay all of them

919
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:09,560
are polinomial time uh actually the only

920
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:12,760
everything is these are I should say

921
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:13,680
these are polom poly time algorithm and

922
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:17,040
this is

923
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:19,520
PPT so this is a randomized algorithm

924
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:21,560
poly time so it runs in time poly Lambda

925
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:23,680
generates a hash key these are all

926
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:26,040
deterministic algorithms okay they run

927
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:28,240
in po time so EV Val takes his input X

928
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:32,200
he runs in time x of course

929
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:36,880
uh open runs in time x but verify runs

930
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:39,599
in time uh poly Lambda why because hash

931
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:42,760
is of size poly Lambda this is of size

932
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:44,160
Lambda because I required it and XI is a

933
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:47,839
bit and this is a size poly Lambda

934
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:50,960
because I required it so the verific the

935
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:52,520
the verifier runs in time poly Lambda

936
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,480
okay so when you send me a hash value I

937
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:57,560
get a value of size Lambda when I want

938
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:59,480
to you to open to a certain bit I can

939
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:01,760
check it in time po Lambda independent

940
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:05,280
of n i mean Lambda may depend on N but

941
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:07,760
it doesn't grow with n yes why is all to

942
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:10,560
be why is

943
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:14,119
Jal is not these are polinomial

944
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:16,960
time ah why is it not allowed uh it

945
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:21,280
doesn't need to be it just doesn't need

946
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:22,880
to be uh probabilistic I I'm not I'm not

947
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,240
inherently opposed to using Randomness

948
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:27,800
and algorithms but it just doesn't need

949
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:32,079
to be whereas gen has to be probalistic

950
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:34,800
okay great thanks good question uh okay

951
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:40,839
so uh the correctness guarantee just

952
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:46,119
says that uh let's see for every

953
00:41:40,839 --> 00:41:52,560
Lambda every hash key generated like in

954
00:41:46,119 --> 00:41:56,359
the image of gen and every X okay not

955
00:41:52,560 --> 00:42:00,760
every X we get completeness up to X in

956
00:41:56,359 --> 00:42:04,359
01 to the two to the Lambda okay so it

957
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:07,280
it or I should say sorry smaller or

958
00:42:04,359 --> 00:42:08,960
equal to two to the Lambda so let's

959
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:12,000
think of the security parameter it says

960
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:14,079
least of size log log n n is the size of

961
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:19,079
X okay we never take security parameter

962
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:21,640
to be smaller than log n okay and and so

963
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:24,160
that's why like uh we always assume that

964
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:26,240
the size of X is at most two to the

965
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:30,680
security parameter the number of bits in

966
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:34,400
x okay so for every x what we uh we want

967
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:38,440
that uh the probability that verify oh I

968
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,440
forgot to say for every

969
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:49,359
I the probability that verify an

970
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:53,200
HK

971
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:59,520
eval HK of X this is

972
00:42:53,200 --> 00:43:01,839
V what else do I have i x I and row I

973
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,839
which is

974
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:13,599
open this is kind of the row it outputs

975
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:18,200
one with probability one so if you are

976
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:21,640
honest you take some input x uh any hash

977
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:23,960
key and you give me a hash value and

978
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:25,920
then you open it I'll accept

979
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:28,200
you okay if everyone's doing what

980
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:31,040
they're supposed to do for any X and for

981
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:32,319
any hash key we'll get output one by the

982
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:34,599
way

983
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:36,079
sometimes one can Define also with high

984
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:40,040
probability over randomly choosing a

985
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:42,200
hash key but our constructions work

986
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:45,559
often in the worst case but one can also

987
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:48,640
a weaker definition is for kind of hash

988
00:43:45,559 --> 00:43:51,960
key randomly

989
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:54,640
generated and here you have one minus

990
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:57,119
negligible where the probability is over

991
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:58,640
over the hash key here actually sorry

992
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:59,880
here there was no okay before there were

993
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:02,280
no probabilities because I just chose

994
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:04,520
forever but one can think of a Rand hash

995
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:07,160
key randomly generated and you can have

996
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:08,839
a negligable probability of error we

997
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:11,599
won't need that because this I mean some

998
00:44:08,839 --> 00:44:15,240
schemes but many schemes are just uh

999
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:17,839
probably one yeah you mean that corre

1000
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,839
always holds for

1001
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,720
anys right yeah I didn't go to soundness

1002
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:24,720
yet yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we'll see

1003
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:26,720
sound for in a minute but correctness we

1004
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:28,119
can get for every hash key but the one

1005
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,760
can thing

1006
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:31,720
constructions that actually it's only

1007
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:33,079
even correctness with high probability

1008
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:35,800
but but often we think of it a

1009
00:44:33,079 --> 00:44:38,800
correctness one yes for you have that

1010
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:40,599
restriction on X again why for prance

1011
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:43,040
you you have that restriction on the

1012
00:44:40,599 --> 00:44:45,800
length x okay the length should be this

1013
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:48,400
than Le that right yeah yeah yeah you're

1014
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:50,160
asking why yeah because uh our

1015
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,960
constructions often we'll see a

1016
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:55,440
construction and we'll see that if the

1017
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:55,440
length is too

1018
00:44:55,640 --> 00:45:03,640
is okay the the reason is we can our

1019
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:05,280
constructions grow with log X that's the

1020
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:08,240
truth it just grows with log X and we

1021
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:09,480
want the output to be Lambda so the fact

1022
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:11,640
of the matter is the way we construct

1023
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:14,680
these schemes our construction the hash

1024
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:16,119
value grows with log X but we we don't

1025
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:17,800
want to kind of say it we want to just

1026
00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:20,000
say Lambda because it's nicer so we just

1027
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:21,640
make sure Lambda is at least log X and

1028
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,680
then we're

1029
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:27,160
okay okay great

1030
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:28,680
question okay any other questions before

1031
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:31,559
go to

1032
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:35,760
soundness okay so soundness that's the

1033
00:45:31,559 --> 00:45:39,839
more interesting one soundness says

1034
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:43,119
intuitively that for any bounded poly

1035
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:45,520
Lambda or t bounded if there some you

1036
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:48,200
have some the soundness is like you can

1037
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:51,280
call it t

1038
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:53,400
soundness okay and T you can poly sound

1039
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:55,040
poly soundus you can with two to the

1040
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:58,359
Lambda to the Epsilon

1041
00:45:55,040 --> 00:46:02,280
soundness but there's some t and it

1042
00:45:58,359 --> 00:46:04,760
says any adversary that runs in time at

1043
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:10,599
most of size at most

1044
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:14,000
T the probability that it can find a

1045
00:46:10,599 --> 00:46:16,720
value and an index a hash value in an

1046
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:19,880
index so that an that index he can

1047
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:22,160
successfully open to both zero and one

1048
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:24,800
is negligible okay so it essentially

1049
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:27,800
means one once the adversary gave you a

1050
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:30,520
hash value for any index he cannot

1051
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:33,079
generate a valid opening both for zero

1052
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:37,319
and for one it's impossible for him okay

1053
00:46:33,079 --> 00:46:39,359
so let me write it formally so for

1054
00:46:37,319 --> 00:46:42,000
any poly

1055
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:45,359
T again think of T is like linear so

1056
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:47,160
poly Lambda poly T

1057
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:49,559
size

1058
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:51,680
adversary the

1059
00:46:49,559 --> 00:46:54,720
probability and the probability is over

1060
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:57,440
hash key he gets a random hash Key

1061
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:59,400
choses by J chosen by Jen

1062
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:03,800
okay gets a random hash key chosen by

1063
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:07,559
Jen this adversary given the hash

1064
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:10,359
key he tries to open some index in two

1065
00:47:07,559 --> 00:47:15,559
different ways so he his goal is to give

1066
00:47:10,359 --> 00:47:18,760
you a hash value V an index I and a

1067
00:47:15,559 --> 00:47:21,559
valid opening row zero that opens to

1068
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:23,400
zero and a valid opening Row one that

1069
00:47:21,559 --> 00:47:25,680
opens to

1070
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:28,200
one that's what he outputs so the

1071
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:31,400
adversary outputs gets a hash key he

1072
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:33,400
outputs a hash value an index and two

1073
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:35,119
opening for that index that's what he's

1074
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:37,400
trying to do one corresponding to Zer

1075
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:39,720
one corresponding to one and the

1076
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:42,880
probability that both of them are valid

1077
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:44,079
opening the probability that for every B

1078
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:49,119
in

1079
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:52,520
01 verify verify agrees so verify given

1080
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:57,800
hash key v i

1081
00:47:52,520 --> 00:48:02,119
and a zero B and row b

1082
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:02,119
outputs one this is

1083
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:10,400
negligible okay so again what soundness

1084
00:48:08,839 --> 00:48:13,359
is like Collision resistance in this

1085
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:16,359
setting so this is kind of a another way

1086
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:17,640
to usually people call this property

1087
00:48:16,359 --> 00:48:19,640
Collision

1088
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:22,480
resistance and the Collision resistance

1089
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:25,640
property says that once the adversity

1090
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:27,880
chose a hash value the probability that

1091
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:31,640
for any index

1092
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:33,800
okay he chooses for any index I the

1093
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:36,400
probability that he can

1094
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:39,400
open in a way that verifies in an

1095
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:42,160
accepting way to both zero and one so

1096
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:44,240
for any for every B row b is a valid

1097
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:46,400
opening row zero is valid for zero and

1098
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:49,400
Row one is a valid open for one that

1099
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:52,359
happens with negligable probability okay

1100
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:56,359
so for every row there

1101
00:48:52,359 --> 00:48:56,359
exists negligible

1102
00:48:57,079 --> 00:48:59,599
such

1103
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:08,920
that okay so this is the Collision

1104
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,920
resistant

1105
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:16,240
property any questions about the

1106
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:25,640
property okay so now I have two things I

1107
00:49:22,119 --> 00:49:28,599
want to do the first thing oh sorry I

1108
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:31,559
unordered two things things I want to do

1109
00:49:28,599 --> 00:49:36,480
one is show you how you construct this

1110
00:49:31,559 --> 00:49:38,520
thing and two show you how to use it to

1111
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:42,079
construct an interactive

1112
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:44,920
argument any preference on the on the

1113
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:46,680
order what goes first who wants uh

1114
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:51,280
construction

1115
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:51,280
first who wants uh interactive argument

1116
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:57,640
first okay we'll do interactive

1117
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,720
arguments and then we do construction

1118
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:03,640
was not that if anybody wants to weigh

1119
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:07,319
in say so cuz it it wasn't very

1120
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:07,319
significant the result but

1121
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:21,520
uh okay so interactive argument first

1122
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:25,000
yeah

1123
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:28,880
okay okay so here's

1124
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:31,880
the this is what known as the kilan

1125
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:31,880
mikali

1126
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:46,559
protocol okay

1127
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:05,599
okay so actually I want

1128
00:51:02,599 --> 00:51:06,839
succinct interactive Arguments for NP

1129
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:08,280
okay so I'm going to show you how to

1130
00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:11,400
construct a succinct interactive

1131
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:14,760
argument for any NP language

1132
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:18,440
okay so here is how I'm going to do it

1133
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:21,160
the prover first so we have a prover and

1134
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:23,960
a verifier and here's what the they both

1135
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:25,960
share a witness X the approver wants to

1136
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:28,839
prove to the verifier that X is in the

1137
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:31,599
linguage and he has some

1138
00:51:28,839 --> 00:51:34,920
witness okay you can think about it as a

1139
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:36,839
3 CNF we talked about 3nf complete

1140
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:38,119
anyway it can be nice to have like

1141
00:51:36,839 --> 00:51:40,960
something Concrete in mind so you can

1142
00:51:38,119 --> 00:51:42,119
think about X as being a 3 CNF and W of

1143
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:45,760
satisfying

1144
00:51:42,119 --> 00:51:47,680
assignment okay what does the prover do

1145
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:51,000
the first thing any guess what the

1146
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:51,000
prover first do first

1147
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:57,119
does thank you comput the PCP that's the

1148
00:51:54,400 --> 00:52:00,559
first thing he does so he takes w and

1149
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:00,559
converts it to a

1150
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:05,079
PCP okay and if you want to have

1151
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:07,359
something Concrete in mind he does he

1152
00:52:05,079 --> 00:52:09,440
opens all the gkr adds a low de

1153
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:12,599
extension of the witness that's a huge

1154
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:17,319
thing that's a PCP he can't ship it over

1155
00:52:12,599 --> 00:52:22,400
that's too big what does he want to do

1156
00:52:17,319 --> 00:52:25,000
instead hash okay he needs a hash key

1157
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:27,760
he's like I want a hash can anybody give

1158
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:29,119
me a hash key right oh let me sorry

1159
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:32,480
because it's an argument I should say

1160
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:34,400
they also share security

1161
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:37,240
parameter so the first thing the

1162
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:38,720
verifier does is he says sure I'm going

1163
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:40,920
to here's a hash key I'm going to

1164
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:43,440
generate

1165
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:47,400
it and here you

1166
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:47,400
go now what does the prover

1167
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:56,799
do thank you very much so I compute he

1168
00:52:53,440 --> 00:53:00,880
sends over V we usually didn't okay we

1169
00:52:56,799 --> 00:53:03,200
send it sends V which is

1170
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:07,480
eval of hash

1171
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:13,079
key and the PCP

1172
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:15,839
P okay so the verifier gets this V this

1173
00:53:13,079 --> 00:53:19,000
digest it's a bunch of bits with no

1174
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:21,400
meaning he wants to open this PCP right

1175
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:24,040
like he want okay so what does he do

1176
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:26,760
what is the the verifier gets the V

1177
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:28,040
cannot doesn't understand a thing what

1178
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:30,559
does he want from the prover what will

1179
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:30,559
he ask the

1180
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:37,240
prover exactly it selects a randomly

1181
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:40,000
selects a bit and ask to open it which

1182
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:43,040
distribution how will he choose which

1183
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,040
bits to open from this

1184
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:54,960
PCP exactly what the exactly what the p

1185
00:53:51,319 --> 00:53:58,440
as the PCP verifier so what he does he

1186
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:58,440
runs the VP

1187
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:08,640
PCP and the PCP verifier tells him oh

1188
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:08,640
sure ask I want up I don't know some

1189
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:14,680
I so okay let me just mention sorry I'm

1190
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:16,920
going to construct an interactive

1191
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:20,760
argument for NP from two ingredients

1192
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:21,960
yeah one I'm going to use a PCP so we

1193
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:25,640
already we have a PCP in our head the

1194
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:29,480
gkr PCP yeah we have it and two this

1195
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:31,680
Collision resist s hash with local

1196
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:33,799
opening these are two ingredients that

1197
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:36,280
we're going to use in this

1198
00:54:33,799 --> 00:54:37,760
construction and we're going to assume

1199
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:39,720
remember when we talked about PCP when

1200
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:42,160
we defined it it was like before we went

1201
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:44,079
to kind of crypto land and we said

1202
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:46,839
there's two parameters CNS completen and

1203
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:48,880
soundness we said that a PCP comes with

1204
00:54:46,839 --> 00:54:53,200
two parameters completen and soundness

1205
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:54,960
CNS and uh usually we think of the of

1206
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:56,960
the completeness as one because all our

1207
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:58,920
pcps have actually complet one that's

1208
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:01,640
kind of it's easy to construct them with

1209
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:04,760
completeness one

1210
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:06,119
soundness we pay for soundness so the

1211
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:08,319
more queries you get the better

1212
00:55:06,119 --> 00:55:11,440
soundness you get and here we're going

1213
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:11,440
to always assume that the

1214
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:14,960
soundness is

1215
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:23,200
negligible okay so uh we give enough so

1216
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:26,039
for example if we do one uh gkr if you

1217
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:28,400
just run the gkr verifier once if you

1218
00:55:26,039 --> 00:55:31,319
remember remember you kind of query one

1219
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:34,400
point in the low degree extension but a

1220
00:55:31,319 --> 00:55:37,000
field element in gkr is of size one over

1221
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:39,319
polylog so the soundness you'll get it

1222
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:41,119
sorry the field size is polylog so the

1223
00:55:39,319 --> 00:55:43,760
soundness you'll get is one over polylog

1224
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:46,039
which is pretty not great I want

1225
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:49,599
negligible so I'll need to repeat the

1226
00:55:46,039 --> 00:55:51,960
gkr enough times like log times so that

1227
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:53,720
it will be become negligible I want my

1228
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:55,359
soundless to become negligible the

1229
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:56,960
reason I want the soundness of the PCP

1230
00:55:55,359 --> 00:55:58,720
to be negligible

1231
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:01,200
is because when we Define interactive

1232
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:03,359
arguments we wanted soundless to be

1233
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:05,359
negligible okay these two will kind of

1234
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:07,319
the soundless I get from my interactive

1235
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:09,200
argument will kind of depend on the

1236
00:56:07,319 --> 00:56:10,480
soundness I'm going to get from my PCP

1237
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:13,039
so I'm going to assume here that I have

1238
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:15,119
a PCP with negligable soundness that I

1239
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:18,799
ask so if I have a PCP with sound is

1240
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:21,480
half I'll just repeat it polylog like

1241
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:23,160
I'll repeat it let's say Lambda times

1242
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,839
and now my sound becomes one over two to

1243
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:26,920
the

1244
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:29,240
Lambda okay so uh

1245
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:33,119
uh I'm gonna always assume that it's

1246
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:33,119
negligible in in

1247
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:40,480
Lambda okay so I run the PCP verifier

1248
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:45,720
yeah orle access to the proof what do

1249
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:47,520
you mean that what is the previous

1250
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:51,160
version the previous version where you

1251
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:53,079
had to query the proof Oracle okay so

1252
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:55,640
when you had okay so you said let's

1253
00:56:53,079 --> 00:56:58,280
remember the PCP model where I had the

1254
00:56:55,640 --> 00:57:02,119
PCP as a an Oracle and I quered it that

1255
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:04,079
was very succinct but if I had an Oracle

1256
00:57:02,119 --> 00:57:06,760
in which world do I have an oracle what

1257
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:08,480
this Oracle is a nice like who puts the

1258
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:09,680
PCP in the sky for me where is the sky

1259
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:11,559
it's not sitting on a cloud you know

1260
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:12,599
what it's like a well Cloud I guess now

1261
00:57:11,559 --> 00:57:15,240
has many

1262
00:57:12,599 --> 00:57:17,400
meanings uh but you know so it can be

1263
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:19,039
sitting actually on a cloud but that's

1264
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:21,160
kind of the point we don't want anyone

1265
00:57:19,039 --> 00:57:23,960
to store this P we don't want to assume

1266
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:25,799
someone actually holds this thing so in

1267
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:28,160
that model where you assume you have an

1268
00:57:25,799 --> 00:57:29,680
oracle everything is successed now what

1269
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:32,880
I'm trying to do here is get rid of that

1270
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:35,119
assumption that I have an oracle great

1271
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:39,400
yeah what about even before the P if you

1272
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:42,799
were to just do interactive gkr on

1273
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:44,240
circuit okay good good great great so

1274
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:47,400
the question is look just do an

1275
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:51,400
interactive Gare and the circuit and the

1276
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:54,680
and and this CA fee that's maybe here oh

1277
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:56,960
no it vanished uh you can but here's the

1278
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:58,400
problem you can do GK and essentially

1279
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:00,680
it's what we're doing in the PCP in some

1280
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:02,599
sense but here's the issue but you're

1281
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:04,559
saying GK you don't need to deal with

1282
00:58:02,599 --> 00:58:08,760
with hashing right that kind of your

1283
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:10,799
point very very good point however in GK

1284
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:12,880
anybody see that's actually AIT a good

1285
00:58:10,799 --> 00:58:14,680
anybody see what's wrong so let me

1286
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:17,720
repeat your your point the point is the

1287
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:19,280
following look G is succinct think of

1288
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:20,839
three set it's very low depth it's

1289
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:23,640
succinct the communication is very

1290
00:58:20,839 --> 00:58:27,000
succinct why are you now going to crypto

1291
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:30,920
and opening GK just do GK be done with

1292
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,920
it why are we doing all of

1293
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:37,480
this very good why because gkr works if

1294
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:40,039
the verifier knows the

1295
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:41,760
witness if the verifier knows the input

1296
00:58:40,039 --> 00:58:44,599
in gkr when we talk about GK we said

1297
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:45,480
look the verifier and prover both hold

1298
00:58:44,599 --> 00:58:48,960
an

1299
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:50,720
input and the ver verifier wants to know

1300
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:53,079
the output of this circuit and the input

1301
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:53,079
that he

1302
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:56,680
has okay and indeed at the end the

1303
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:59,319
verify

1304
00:58:56,680 --> 00:59:01,960
needs to check the final thing against

1305
00:58:59,319 --> 00:59:03,960
his input you know is is in the end

1306
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:06,119
going to get kind of a value in the load

1307
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:07,480
exension and he checks oh does this is

1308
00:59:06,119 --> 00:59:08,359
this consistent with the input I have in

1309
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:11,200
my

1310
00:59:08,359 --> 00:59:14,480
hand now he doesn't have an

1311
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:16,359
input so what do you do so actually let

1312
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:18,440
me tell you

1313
00:59:16,359 --> 00:59:20,079
something the way these things are

1314
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:21,119
actually implemented it's very

1315
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:23,280
interesting to say because the way

1316
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:25,280
they're implemented is actually more

1317
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:28,720
along what you said what they do is

1318
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:29,799
first they commit to just the witness

1319
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:32,839
you're saying why are you committing to

1320
00:59:29,799 --> 00:59:34,480
en PP you have a witness commit to that

1321
00:59:32,839 --> 00:59:36,880
or commit to the low degree extension of

1322
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:38,400
the witness and actually in practice

1323
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:40,160
that's what they do they only committed

1324
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:42,559
the L and then they applied this

1325
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:45,240
interactive gkr or now they have even

1326
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:46,760
better protocols iops but that's for

1327
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:51,599
another

1328
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:53,200
time you once you the wi do normal gkr

1329
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:56,200
and then you can only need to open the

1330
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:58,280
andt that you care about exactly so what

1331
00:59:56,200 --> 01:00:01,240
you can do you can first the approver

1332
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:03,720
can tell the verifier sorry the verifier

1333
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:05,839
tells the approver I know you you claim

1334
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:08,079
that you have a satisfying assignment

1335
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:09,480
give me a load to extension of your

1336
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:11,319
assignment but hash it down because I

1337
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:13,880
don't want to hold this entire thing now

1338
01:00:11,319 --> 01:00:15,880
I have a hash now we're going to do G do

1339
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:19,119
g g then they need to check a random

1340
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:21,039
point in the in in a random point in the

1341
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:23,160
low degree extension I'll ask the appr

1342
01:00:21,039 --> 01:00:27,200
now open but now you're committed ahead

1343
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:28,960
of time and then you have to to make

1344
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:31,319
you need to add a low degree test to it

1345
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:33,680
yeah

1346
01:00:31,319 --> 01:00:35,640
exactly so many of the implementations

1347
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:37,480
that's exactly how they work and

1348
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:40,359
actually a lot of the work currently in

1349
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:42,520
the last couple years is actually not so

1350
01:00:40,359 --> 01:00:43,640
much an improving G that too but a lot

1351
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:45,400
of the work is actually on the

1352
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:47,280
commitment how do you construct this

1353
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:49,640
commitment that's kind of the most

1354
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:54,359
efficient and so on

1355
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:57,319
um okay great uh so

1356
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:59,640
yeah no the verifier the witness because

1357
01:00:57,319 --> 01:01:00,760
the witness is too large exactly exactly

1358
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:02,280
we don't want to give the verifier of

1359
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:05,039
the witness because it's too large so we

1360
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:07,520
don't have knowledge I don't care now

1361
01:01:05,039 --> 01:01:09,000
about zero knowledge usually when people

1362
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:12,400
implement this they add zero knowledge

1363
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:14,240
on top kind of as a but for now I don't

1364
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:16,319
care at all about hiding I just want

1365
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:20,680
verification like just to verify

1366
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:23,000
correctness yeah no I'm no like all of

1367
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:25,720
the hiding zero knowledge is kind of

1368
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,799
orthogonal yeah so the commitment that's

1369
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:30,359
given to the verify is only Ed for

1370
01:01:27,799 --> 01:01:32,480
verification it's never actually open

1371
01:01:30,359 --> 01:01:34,960
it's never opened completely yeah it's

1372
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:38,440
never good point so what you're saying

1373
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:42,480
this hash will never be completely

1374
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:45,160
opened okay so the the approver computes

1375
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:47,079
this PCP he sends it over the PCP will

1376
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:49,680
never be opened in its entirety it's too

1377
01:01:47,079 --> 01:01:52,240
big or the witness never going to be

1378
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:56,640
open its entirety instead what happens

1379
01:01:52,240 --> 01:02:00,880
is the verifier generates PCP queries

1380
01:01:56,640 --> 01:02:04,480
and he sends the PCP queries i1 up to

1381
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:06,720
iil and what the prover does he only

1382
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:09,039
opens the

1383
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:13,359
locations Pi

1384
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:17,599
i1 up to Pi i l so he only gives him the

1385
01:02:13,359 --> 01:02:20,920
PCP and these locations and opening row

1386
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:26,440
i1 up to row

1387
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:28,520
I yeah this is DET mention before like

1388
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:30,720
everything inall sometimes it's not

1389
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:34,799
sound can these be at the same time or

1390
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:37,760
they have to be multipal rounds okay so

1391
01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:39,440
if you do a PCP then they can be sent

1392
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:42,000
exactly at the same time because a PCP

1393
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:43,559
was committed to the PCP and we're done

1394
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,880
if you do Gare you need to do everything

1395
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:48,400
sequentially right okay yeah if you did

1396
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:51,200
so if you did the version that was uh

1397
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:53,559
proposed here where you don't you don't

1398
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:55,400
do PCP at all you have your witness and

1399
01:02:53,559 --> 01:02:57,839
then you need to do gkr completely

1400
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:57,839
Interactive

1401
01:02:58,079 --> 01:03:00,680
but if you have a PCP then it's

1402
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:02,400
committed now you don't have to do

1403
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:04,359
anything sequentially that's it the guy

1404
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:07,359
is kind of stuck so you can do

1405
01:03:04,359 --> 01:03:09,079
everything at the same time so great so

1406
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:11,839
you send all the queries you get back

1407
01:03:09,079 --> 01:03:13,160
the answers what does the verifier do

1408
01:03:11,839 --> 01:03:17,960
how does he decide if to accept or

1409
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:17,960
reject what tests does the verifier

1410
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:23,240
do

1411
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:29,240
yeah fantastic exactly what does he do

1412
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:35,039
he runs two things he runs the PCP

1413
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:36,480
verifier with kind of i1 iil Pi i1 up to

1414
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:40,920
Pi

1415
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:43,640
I with X also X comma and checks that

1416
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:46,799
it's one and it also checks all the

1417
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:46,799
opening so it checks the

1418
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:56,400
verify of hash key

1419
01:03:52,359 --> 01:03:58,520
v i j Pi I

1420
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:03,240
J row I

1421
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:03,240
J equals 1 for every

1422
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:15,000
J uh Pi i j is kind of

1423
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:16,400
oh uh no because um the P when you

1424
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:19,079
verify a

1425
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:22,240
PCP okay the verifier never knows the

1426
01:04:19,079 --> 01:04:23,880
entire Pi he never read the entire Pi

1427
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:26,000
but to verify of course he needs to know

1428
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:27,960
the instance like he needs you need to

1429
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:31,839
check it against the instance so the

1430
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:35,839
proof is succinct but the verifi work he

1431
01:04:31,839 --> 01:04:38,279
has to read what what the claim is okay

1432
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:41,720
so it's the verifier will run in time

1433
01:04:38,279 --> 01:04:44,079
linear in X that he needs to read what

1434
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:46,920
what the claim is but the

1435
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:49,799
communication is very small so the

1436
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:53,079
communication is hashy which is poly

1437
01:04:49,799 --> 01:04:55,520
security parameter V which a security

1438
01:04:53,079 --> 01:04:58,079
parameter I went up to I which is going

1439
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:59,920
to be at most security parameter and the

1440
01:04:58,079 --> 01:05:01,520
opening which is security parameter so

1441
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:04,319
everything here only grows with the

1442
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:06,799
security parameter okay poom security

1443
01:05:04,319 --> 01:05:10,000
parameter not with X so if the security

1444
01:05:06,799 --> 01:05:12,359
parameter is poly log n n being the

1445
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:16,559
length of X then you have communication

1446
01:05:12,359 --> 01:05:18,839
poly log in to verify well okay this

1447
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:20,440
verification has it's a size poly log in

1448
01:05:18,839 --> 01:05:22,640
like security parameter because the X

1449
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:24,880
doesn't come in but of course to verify

1450
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:27,039
the PCP you need to read the input you

1451
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:30,480
need to read what the claim you're

1452
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:33,720
verifying so here you do run in time

1453
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:36,480
linear in these pcps usually the runtime

1454
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:39,200
of the verifier is linear in the input

1455
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:41,000
length and let me mention actually

1456
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:44,319
there's this notion which we won't go

1457
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:47,559
into this semester uh but it's called

1458
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:49,400
PCP of proximity where the verifier

1459
01:05:47,559 --> 01:05:51,839
doesn't even need to read the input he

1460
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:54,480
just reads a little bit but now of

1461
01:05:51,839 --> 01:05:56,160
course he if he only reads a little bit

1462
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:57,400
then how does he know

1463
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:59,079
that the input is correct maybe he

1464
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:01,000
didn't read one bit and that flips it

1465
01:05:59,079 --> 01:06:04,440
from True to false you know so the only

1466
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:06,839
guarantee he has that if he's accepted

1467
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:09,599
then this input is close to an input in

1468
01:06:06,839 --> 01:06:12,839
the language that's why the proximity so

1469
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:15,760
there is a notion where the verifier is

1470
01:06:12,839 --> 01:06:17,359
actually sublinear in X he runs in time

1471
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:18,799
much less than x but then the guarantee

1472
01:06:17,359 --> 01:06:21,160
is weaker the sound is guarantee is

1473
01:06:18,799 --> 01:06:24,880
weaker the sound is just says that if

1474
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:26,559
you accept you cannot accept statements

1475
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:28,680
which are

1476
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:30,799
far for being in the language but you

1477
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:32,880
may be able you may accept sentence you

1478
01:06:30,799 --> 01:06:34,760
may accept claims that are false but

1479
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:36,319
close to ones that are in the language

1480
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:39,559
so it's a different it's a proximity

1481
01:06:36,319 --> 01:06:41,160
type uh soundness guarantee but without

1482
01:06:39,559 --> 01:06:44,039
if you really want soundness yes or no

1483
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:46,160
you have to read input there's nothing

1484
01:06:44,039 --> 01:06:49,279
you know nothing you can

1485
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:50,960
do unless the input is kind of in an air

1486
01:06:49,279 --> 01:06:52,640
craing code or you change something

1487
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:55,960
above the model but otherwise you have

1488
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:58,000
to read the input

1489
01:06:55,960 --> 01:07:00,000
any any questions about the construction

1490
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,599
forget about soundness and so on just

1491
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,920
about the con like about the proof just

1492
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:03,920
about the

1493
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:09,599
construction okay so I just want to

1494
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:12,319
point one thing that I said let's send

1495
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:15,640
i1 up to iil really the way the PCP

1496
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:17,359
verifier works is he gets his input like

1497
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:20,079
uh let's say the security parameter just

1498
01:07:17,359 --> 01:07:23,119
to know how many times to repeat the if

1499
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:25,079
the original PC if the original PCP

1500
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:26,359
let's say is a size a has sound is half

1501
01:07:25,079 --> 01:07:28,440
he needs to know how many times he needs

1502
01:07:26,359 --> 01:07:31,000
to repeat it so there's some security

1503
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:33,839
parameter and some random he also knows

1504
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:36,240
the input link like n in binary so this

1505
01:07:33,839 --> 01:07:39,520
can be very efficient

1506
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:42,279
and he uses

1507
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:46,200
Randomness what my point is instead of

1508
01:07:42,279 --> 01:07:47,640
sending i1 up to I instead he could have

1509
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:49,319
just sent the

1510
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:51,440
randomness okay he could have sent the

1511
01:07:49,319 --> 01:07:54,400
randomness and tell the prover okay you

1512
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:56,200
see this Randomness compute run this

1513
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:58,520
yourself

1514
01:07:56,200 --> 01:08:00,960
okay why am I saying this it's like okay

1515
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:02,520
fine like why is that interesting the

1516
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:06,440
reason this is very

1517
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:08,559
interesting is because and also here by

1518
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:12,079
the way here instead of

1519
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:14,119
the this is a randomized

1520
01:08:12,079 --> 01:08:15,920
algorithm actually here it's here it's

1521
01:08:14,119 --> 01:08:18,159
not important let's just leave this as

1522
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:22,679
is I want to focus on this here why is

1523
01:08:18,159 --> 01:08:24,799
this important because later not today

1524
01:08:22,679 --> 01:08:26,359
but later in this class we'll start

1525
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:30,640
actually next week

1526
01:08:26,359 --> 01:08:32,199
we'll see that a we'll want to go after

1527
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:34,600
we'll prove this and we'll be very happy

1528
01:08:32,199 --> 01:08:36,359
and we say wow we have a succinct

1529
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:39,199
argument and it's so succinct we can

1530
01:08:36,359 --> 01:08:41,480
have all security parameter success

1531
01:08:39,199 --> 01:08:43,319
happiness but then of course every time

1532
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:44,880
we have something we want some more and

1533
01:08:43,319 --> 01:08:46,359
then we'll say you know what we don't

1534
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:48,759
want

1535
01:08:46,359 --> 01:08:51,279
interaction why interaction we want we

1536
01:08:48,759 --> 01:08:53,799
want to go back to kind of actual proofs

1537
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:55,799
so we want to eliminate intraction and

1538
01:08:53,799 --> 01:08:58,600
what we'll see is a way to eliminate

1539
01:08:55,799 --> 01:09:02,080
interaction from protocols where the

1540
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:04,799
verifier messages are completely

1541
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:06,880
random okay and that's why I want I want

1542
01:09:04,799 --> 01:09:09,600
you to remember in your head that here

1543
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:11,600
this message can be completely random

1544
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:13,319
okay we can make all those also this

1545
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:16,199
random but we don't need to because it's

1546
01:09:13,319 --> 01:09:18,040
the first message it's kind of the first

1547
01:09:16,199 --> 01:09:20,279
the first message is kind of special and

1548
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:21,319
that it's kind of the first one so we

1549
01:09:20,279 --> 01:09:22,759
don't need to kind of eliminate

1550
01:09:21,319 --> 01:09:26,400
intraction from it it's kind of the

1551
01:09:22,759 --> 01:09:29,679
first one uh so that's fine the all the

1552
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:32,359
later messages of the verifier will need

1553
01:09:29,679 --> 01:09:34,120
to if they're really random just random

1554
01:09:32,359 --> 01:09:36,199
bits then we can show how we can

1555
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:38,120
eliminate an interaction that we can

1556
01:09:36,199 --> 01:09:40,799
actually get rid of the interaction so I

1557
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:43,799
just want to point out this message can

1558
01:09:40,799 --> 01:09:44,839
be is completely random these ior tile

1559
01:09:43,799 --> 01:09:46,960
are not random they're actually

1560
01:09:44,839 --> 01:09:50,400
correlated but the you can just send the

1561
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:52,679
randomness yes I guess this side but why

1562
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:55,679
is first message special you imagine

1563
01:09:52,679 --> 01:09:57,080
that like I don't know there could exist

1564
01:09:55,679 --> 01:10:00,080
hash key which is really bad or

1565
01:09:57,080 --> 01:10:01,840
something so if you like it feels like

1566
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:04,159
you should still be sampling the first

1567
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:05,719
hash key oh you definitely sampling it

1568
01:10:04,159 --> 01:10:08,400
no no you're going to sample this hash

1569
01:10:05,719 --> 01:10:10,080
key for sure I'm just saying the hash

1570
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:13,239
key itself is not necessarily random

1571
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:15,120
bits depends on the hash some hash some

1572
01:10:13,239 --> 01:10:18,080
hash keys are random some hash keys are

1573
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:20,400
very have some structure dep depending

1574
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:22,520
on which hash function you use you know

1575
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:24,800
so some hash Keys indeed some hash keys

1576
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:26,239
are just random and then this message is

1577
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:28,719
just random

1578
01:10:26,239 --> 01:10:30,480
some hash keys are not random I have

1579
01:10:28,719 --> 01:10:32,800
like I don't know lwe structure what if

1580
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:36,120
so for those who know what LW but I have

1581
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:38,360
some special structure so now I'm saying

1582
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:41,400
I guess all what I was saying is if the

1583
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:43,800
messages from the verifier to the prover

1584
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:45,719
we're truly random we're going to see we

1585
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:47,120
can eliminate interaction so I'm telling

1586
01:10:45,719 --> 01:10:48,719
you you just notice it's completely

1587
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:50,880
random and now you can say wait this is

1588
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:52,600
not necessarily random I don't know how

1589
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:54,320
hash ke is distributed depend on the

1590
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:55,920
construction maybe it's not completely

1591
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:57,360
random they said don't worry this

1592
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:59,840
doesn't have to be it can be an

1593
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:59,840
arbitrary

1594
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,640
distribution good good good good good

1595
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:08,120
good good so you're saying hey send the

1596
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:11,040
coins here too well inste do the same

1597
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:15,640
put here R and send

1598
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:17,719
R you can however not all hash functions

1599
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:21,080
there may be hash functions that are

1600
01:11:17,719 --> 01:11:22,800
secure if you only give the hash key but

1601
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:24,400
on not give the randomness use to

1602
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:26,560
generate the hash key maybe with this

1603
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:29,560
Randomness you can break the Collision

1604
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:31,960
resistance so some some hash functions

1605
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:33,480
are okay some are not like the hash

1606
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:35,520
function that we'll construct you'll see

1607
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:37,040
it's fine actually it's Randomness but

1608
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:39,040
that's under a specific assumption and

1609
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:41,520
some are not it's not okay to give the

1610
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:43,560
randomness but I just want to point out

1611
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:45,480
that for later to eliminate interaction

1612
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:48,000
using What's called the F Paradigm we'll

1613
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:49,120
talk about it next class the first

1614
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:51,480
message actually doesn't need to be even

1615
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:54,120
random it's only the later messages have

1616
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:56,600
to be random so I just want to emphasize

1617
01:11:54,120 --> 01:12:00,080
This Is Random

1618
01:11:56,600 --> 01:12:00,080
there were other questions

1619
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:09,520
yeah n n is the size of X yeah so sorry

1620
01:12:04,719 --> 01:12:12,520
I said yeah n thank you is the length of

1621
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:12,520
X

1622
01:12:12,639 --> 01:12:16,600
thanks H so the PCP verifier needs to

1623
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:18,639
know the length of the instance he's

1624
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:22,760
working with to know which queries to

1625
01:12:18,639 --> 01:12:22,760
ask yeah Tina

1626
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:30,840
because okay because yeah good so uh

1627
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:33,159
the I just want to emphasize that to

1628
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:35,440
generate these queries you don't need to

1629
01:12:33,159 --> 01:12:38,080
run in time that depend that's poomi in

1630
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:39,360
N it's enough to run in time polog in in

1631
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:41,880
order to generate the queries that's why

1632
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:43,440
I give it in it doesn't matters so much

1633
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:44,800
because here anyway you need to run time

1634
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:46,560
linear so you're like why am I making

1635
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:50,880
this

1636
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:52,159
point yeah uh it's not very important

1637
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:53,280
even though sometimes it is important

1638
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:54,719
when later you want to talk about

1639
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:56,880
proximity and stuff then all of a sudden

1640
01:12:54,719 --> 01:12:59,760
it becomes an issue so yeah just this is

1641
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:02,920
just to emphasize that the PCP verifier

1642
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:04,719
at least when generating the queries

1643
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:07,000
doesn't run in time linear in N you runs

1644
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:10,040
in time actually linear in security

1645
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:12,159
parameter and poly Log In N to generate

1646
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:12,159
the

1647
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:20,600
queries okay

1648
01:13:16,639 --> 01:13:24,280
questions okay so let's uh go ahead and

1649
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:25,280
uh prove the let me see I change the

1650
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:30,480
order so I just want to make sure sure

1651
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:34,040
I'm not a skipping

1652
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:35,719
um okay yeah let's do it okay soundness

1653
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:37,000
a complete let's let's analyze this so I

1654
01:13:35,719 --> 01:13:39,920
want to prove that it's complete and

1655
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:41,400
sound this protocol yeah so fix an NP

1656
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:45,360
language your favorite one let's say

1657
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:47,800
three set and I want to argue that you

1658
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:50,040
know if the prover is honest he indeed

1659
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:51,800
has a satisfying assignment or a witness

1660
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:54,600
the verifier will accept him with

1661
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:56,760
probability one and if he's honest he

1662
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:59,400
does everything like he should and and

1663
01:13:56,760 --> 01:14:02,199
if and the sound is if he tries to cheat

1664
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:04,159
and gives me an xn in the language we're

1665
01:14:02,199 --> 01:14:06,320
going to catch him he's going to be

1666
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:10,000
accepted with probility

1667
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:10,000
negligible okay so that's the

1668
01:14:10,110 --> 01:14:14,719
[Applause]

1669
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:18,520
goal any questions before

1670
01:14:14,719 --> 01:14:19,800
we no okay so let's do it so okay let's

1671
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:22,199
start with completeness because that's

1672
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:24,400
really easy the focus well I can just

1673
01:14:22,199 --> 01:14:26,400
say completeness is not doesn't not

1674
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:28,120
worth writing it's so trivial so what do

1675
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:30,639
I want what does completeness say he

1676
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:33,760
says if the Prov choose X is in the

1677
01:14:30,639 --> 01:14:36,280
language and he has a witness he's going

1678
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:37,800
to be accepted with probability one why

1679
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:40,840
why is it going to be accepted well

1680
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:42,880
let's see what he does he chooses a PCP

1681
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:44,760
the PCP let it has completeness one

1682
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:48,199
that's my assumption it's soundness

1683
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:51,080
negligible and completeness

1684
01:14:48,199 --> 01:14:52,280
one okay I assume that about my PCP

1685
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:56,800
otherwise the completeness is like the

1686
01:14:52,280 --> 01:15:02,560
complet of the PCP so I uh he chooses a

1687
01:14:56,800 --> 01:15:06,760
PCP he hashes it now he gets PCP queries

1688
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:08,120
from the verifier he opens the PCP now

1689
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:09,560
he's accept these are acceptable with

1690
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:13,000
probability

1691
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:15,000
one now he generates also open these

1692
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:16,280
rows are from open right so I didn't

1693
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:21,600
maybe I should write I didn't write it

1694
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:26,280
but row i j is by Computing open on hash

1695
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:28,000
key Pi i j right that's

1696
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:31,600
the

1697
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:33,440
yeah that's how he generates roig J and

1698
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:36,560
what do we know we know by completeness

1699
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:38,320
here or correctness like you know he's

1700
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:39,840
accept with probability

1701
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:44,280
one

1702
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:47,679
so uh the probability that both the PCP

1703
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:50,679
is accepted the PCP verifier accepts and

1704
01:15:47,679 --> 01:15:52,840
the hash verifier accept is one because

1705
01:15:50,679 --> 01:15:54,199
both of them is one I I took perfect

1706
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:56,760
completeness from both of them so it's

1707
01:15:54,199 --> 01:16:01,360
just that's all we

1708
01:15:56,760 --> 01:16:01,360
do so this is just pretty

1709
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:04,679
trivial yeah

1710
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:09,600
questions are you guys okay moving to

1711
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:14,080
the soundness that's kind of the

1712
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:14,080
interesting part okay so how about

1713
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:25,239
soundness okay so what's the idea the

1714
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:26,239
idea for soundness is the following I

1715
01:16:25,239 --> 01:16:28,800
want to

1716
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:31,719
say so Suppose there exists a cheating

1717
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:34,400
prover that ches X not in the

1718
01:16:31,719 --> 01:16:36,280
language okay and manages to cheat so

1719
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:41,400
let's suppose and let's try to break the

1720
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:41,400
Collision resistance okay so

1721
01:16:42,159 --> 01:16:48,880
Suppose there

1722
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:53,679
exists uh T time whatever

1723
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:59,520
uh so okay we assume this

1724
01:16:53,679 --> 01:17:03,280
is where with t soundness or security I

1725
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:05,280
I call C Collision

1726
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:07,320
resistance that's my assumption now I

1727
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:11,719
want to argue if I assume that the

1728
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:14,199
Collision resistant has is T secure

1729
01:17:11,719 --> 01:17:17,080
namely even someone in time poly T

1730
01:17:14,199 --> 01:17:21,760
cannot cheat then I want to argue

1731
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:24,960
Suppose there exists a oh

1732
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:27,320
sorry we're going to okay we're I'm

1733
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:29,639
going to get back to this okay what

1734
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:31,960
exactly this is we'll see it actually

1735
01:17:29,639 --> 01:17:33,120
needs to be quite big but we'll see that

1736
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:36,239
Suppose there

1737
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:40,120
exists a

1738
01:17:36,239 --> 01:17:46,600
poly cheating prover P

1739
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:50,000
star that cheats namely that uh uh and

1740
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:54,120
the and there exists like for every

1741
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:56,840
Lambda or there exists like a bunch of X

1742
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:56,840
Lambda

1743
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:02,639
not in the

1744
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:07,480
language

1745
01:18:02,639 --> 01:18:07,480
and there exists a non-negligible

1746
01:18:12,159 --> 01:18:15,880
Epsilon such that the Prov succeeds with

1747
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:18,000
that

1748
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:20,639
probability the

1749
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:23,480
probability that P star talking to

1750
01:18:20,639 --> 01:18:28,000
verifier an input X the verifier accepts

1751
01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:30,239
him is at least Epsilon so do that for

1752
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,239
every

1753
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:39,920
Lambda this is be precise this is x sub

1754
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:43,159
Lambda and they get

1755
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:46,679
Lambda okay so suppose a cheating prover

1756
01:18:43,159 --> 01:18:51,280
for any Lambda he chooses some x sub

1757
01:18:46,679 --> 01:18:53,520
Lambda and P star and V accepts him even

1758
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:55,960
though X is not in the

1759
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:59,080
language okay

1760
01:18:55,960 --> 01:19:01,920
one the my only assumption is that X

1761
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:04,440
Lambda is smaller than 2 to the Lambda

1762
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:06,040
so I choose my security parameter so

1763
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:10,320
that the security parameter is bigger

1764
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:12,560
than log the the size of

1765
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:16,719
X

1766
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:18,520
okay then H actually it's it's it's not

1767
01:19:16,719 --> 01:19:20,960
even needed for for sound this this

1768
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:25,040
actually was needed for completeness

1769
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:25,040
because we only had completeness

1770
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:30,520
for these X's for S actually it doesn't

1771
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:32,320
really matter okay so let's see what do

1772
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:34,080
I want to do I'm saying Suppose there

1773
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:36,440
exist a cheating prover and this

1774
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:38,719
cheating prover

1775
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:40,280
convinces okay now what did let's see

1776
01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:42,840
what did this cheating prover do he

1777
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:45,120
committed to a he kind of send he hashed

1778
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:48,080
a PCP now he I don't know what he did

1779
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:50,760
he's a cheater but he gave me a hash of

1780
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:54,960
something should be a

1781
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:58,719
PCP then he opens this PCP

1782
01:19:54,960 --> 01:20:00,360
so what do I want to do I want I'm gonna

1783
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:02,440
to find I won't argue I can find a

1784
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:04,400
collision why can I find a collision

1785
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:07,760
what is the idea the idea is the

1786
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:10,000
following I'm GNA run this cheating

1787
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:13,040
prover I'm gonna ask the cheating prover

1788
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:18,440
okay here's a Hashi give me a

1789
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:20,760
v then I'm going to run him many many

1790
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:22,520
many times and many PCP verifiers I'm

1791
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:24,800
going to tell okay you know what here's

1792
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:27,960
I want to from the PCP verifier give me

1793
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:30,600
me openings again here's I went up to

1794
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:32,880
give me openings again give I'm going to

1795
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:36,120
kind of rewind him and try to give him

1796
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:38,560
tons of kind of messages I want to I so

1797
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:41,199
I'm GNA kind of rewind him okay so again

1798
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:41,199
what do I want to

1799
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:45,679
do given a hash key okay given a hashy I

1800
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:47,480
want to find collisions for this hash

1801
01:20:45,679 --> 01:20:50,400
key how do I find Collision for this

1802
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:54,080
hash key I'm going to give this Pro the

1803
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:55,760
hash key he gives me a value V then I'm

1804
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:58,360
going to tell the

1805
01:20:55,760 --> 01:21:00,800
prover I'm going to choose a random a

1806
01:20:58,360 --> 01:21:02,880
random R I'm going to tell him open

1807
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:05,280
these locations he

1808
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:07,199
opens good now I'm saying okay okay okay

1809
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:09,960
actually let's rewind him forget that he

1810
01:21:07,199 --> 01:21:11,320
I sent him these let me give him R R2

1811
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:16,000
different R

1812
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:17,679
open okay and forg R three I'm GNA run

1813
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:22,800
this step tons of

1814
01:21:17,679 --> 01:21:25,600
times R1 R2 R3 R4 a lot of them and I'm

1815
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:28,000
gonna have a lot of openings from

1816
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:30,080
him I'm gonna run it so much that I'm

1817
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:31,920
just gonna have tons of opening like I'm

1818
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:34,320
gonna run him more than like poly one

1819
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:37,600
over Epsilon and more than poly like

1820
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:40,040
poly One epon n so the point that I'm

1821
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:41,600
going to run it much more than the num

1822
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:46,040
like the size of the

1823
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:49,440
PCP times one over Epsilon but if to

1824
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:52,000
some power to some to the third whatever

1825
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:55,600
run a lot of times now what's the idea

1826
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:55,600
the idea is the following

1827
01:21:57,480 --> 01:22:01,560
if there are no collisions so if there

1828
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:03,440
look I'm going to run now if at any

1829
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:06,040
point every time that he gave me an

1830
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:07,360
opening that didn't work it's zero it

1831
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:08,920
like didn't work okay so I'm going to

1832
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:10,760
throw it out that okay look there's he

1833
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:13,400
only succeeds in probability Epsilon so

1834
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:16,000
all the time that he didn't succeed okay

1835
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:16,840
well failure but one over epon of the

1836
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:19,239
time he

1837
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:21,159
succeeded and in all these times in all

1838
01:22:19,239 --> 01:22:23,199
these one over Epsilon and sorry Epsilon

1839
01:22:21,159 --> 01:22:26,760
of the times he succeeded in all these

1840
01:22:23,199 --> 01:22:29,440
Epsilon times I got got a lot of good

1841
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:31,480
openings now let's look at all these

1842
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:32,679
openings that I got if somewhere there's

1843
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:36,719
a

1844
01:22:32,679 --> 01:22:39,080
collision I I found him I I I I found a

1845
01:22:36,719 --> 01:22:41,880
collision so I'm

1846
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:43,920
happy if nowhere there's a collision

1847
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:46,360
then essentially I I found a PCP from

1848
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:48,480
him I completely constructed like maybe

1849
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:50,440
not the entire PCP but a lot of it and

1850
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:52,560
the rest I'm going to put zeros I'm say

1851
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:54,120
you know okay these identically zeros

1852
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:57,080
but the argument is that if there were

1853
01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:59,560
no cision I got a PCP that's accepted

1854
01:22:57,080 --> 01:23:02,120
with probability at least poly in

1855
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:05,120
epsilon which is not

1856
01:23:02,120 --> 01:23:07,840
negligible so that's the high level idea

1857
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:13,560
but let me say everything I said now

1858
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:13,560
slowly okay so suppose I have a cheating

1859
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:19,760
prover that succeeds in convincing for X

1860
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:21,040
not in the language I'm going to

1861
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:22,840
construct I'm going to find the

1862
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:26,120
Collision to the hash function so we're

1863
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:26,120
going to construct

1864
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:32,840
adversary a that

1865
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:40,360
breaks the Collision

1866
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:42,719
resistant or the the Collision resistant

1867
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:46,639
property okay how do I break the Collen

1868
01:23:42,719 --> 01:23:50,320
resistant property here's the idea so a

1869
01:23:46,639 --> 01:23:52,639
okay so given so he's given a random

1870
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:52,639
hash

1871
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:59,000
key and his goal is to find

1872
01:23:56,560 --> 01:24:02,440
collisions how does he find collisions

1873
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:03,560
what does he do he gives so here's what

1874
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:06,560
a does

1875
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:06,560
first

1876
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:16,800
compute V which is p star on hash

1877
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:18,800
key that's the first thing I got a v

1878
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:23,120
then I do the

1879
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:29,440
following many times so for

1880
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:34,440
I go goes from one two up to poly in n

1881
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:37,239
and one/ Epsilon so many times what I do

1882
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:37,239
is I

1883
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:48,520
run like what P star given HK and he

1884
01:24:45,239 --> 01:24:53,800
gave V would run

1885
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:56,080
on input RI RI corresponding to a okay

1886
01:24:53,800 --> 01:25:02,080
let me call this

1887
01:24:56,080 --> 01:25:05,639
J J corresponding to a kind

1888
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:08,080
of i1 up to I

1889
01:25:05,639 --> 01:25:09,880
L I just didn't want to confuse this eye

1890
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:12,760
with these

1891
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:15,560
eyes okay so I'm going to run many times

1892
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:17,400
I'm going to choose many RS oh I didn't

1893
01:25:15,560 --> 01:25:22,199
say sorry

1894
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:26,600
choose sorry for I goes to one

1895
01:25:22,199 --> 01:25:30,560
choose a random RJ so for J go from one

1896
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:33,520
two up to poly in n and one over Epsilon

1897
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:33,520
I choose a random

1898
01:25:35,119 --> 01:25:40,800
RJ how many how much random bits like

1899
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:42,480
the PCP verifier I'm going to kind of

1900
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:45,360
I'm going to behave like the I'm going

1901
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:48,920
to give it the randomness of the PCP

1902
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:50,960
verifier corresponding to i1 up to I and

1903
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:54,639
I'm going to compute his answers which

1904
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:56,320
is pi i1 up to Pi these may be ious

1905
01:25:54,639 --> 01:25:57,400
answers I I denote it by pi but of

1906
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:58,920
course it can I mean it's not

1907
01:25:57,400 --> 01:26:02,000
necessarily correspond to an i PCP he's

1908
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:02,000
malicious and

1909
01:26:04,119 --> 01:26:08,000
opening okay so this is how I find

1910
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:11,280
collisions

1911
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:13,119
I I get a hash key I give it to the

1912
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:17,719
cheating prover to get a

1913
01:26:13,119 --> 01:26:22,280
value then for I

1914
01:26:17,719 --> 01:26:23,880
for M * for J goes from 1 to m m is

1915
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:25,880
going to be poly and n and one over

1916
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:28,800
Epsilon

1917
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:31,440
what do I do I choose Randomness for the

1918
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:32,840
PCP verifier and I tell the approver

1919
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:34,920
what are your answers for this

1920
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:36,080
Randomness with the same V I didn't

1921
01:26:34,920 --> 01:26:39,560
change the

1922
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:42,360
V okay so he gave me a v in in the

1923
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:44,800
second message and then I kind of run

1924
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:45,600
the third message with him many many

1925
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:50,679
many

1926
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:55,239
times M times and expect to see

1927
01:26:50,679 --> 01:26:58,679
answers okay now what do I do those for

1928
01:26:55,239 --> 01:27:00,760
which the row doesn't work like those

1929
01:26:58,679 --> 01:27:04,199
for which row doesn't accept you know it

1930
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:05,800
has a bad the verify doesn't this

1931
01:27:04,199 --> 01:27:07,000
doesn't accept I throw out and it's

1932
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:09,520
meaningless he could put whatever he

1933
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:11,400
wants I throw it I throw it out but

1934
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:13,119
that's only Epsilon fraction of them

1935
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:14,520
because the turns out the prover I

1936
01:27:13,119 --> 01:27:17,000
assume the prover is accepted with

1937
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:19,480
probability Epsilon so Epsilon I throw

1938
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:22,960
out okay but I I chose much more than

1939
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:26,000
one over okay This only affects you know

1940
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:31,040
so except for the Epsilon the rest are

1941
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:33,520
good yeah sorry I th as I said that yeah

1942
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:35,440
I th I'm left with Epsilon okay I

1943
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:37,560
thought one minus Epsilon I'm left with

1944
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:39,080
Epsilon but Epsilon is good enough

1945
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:40,840
because I chose more than probably one

1946
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:42,760
over Epsilon that's why I have here one

1947
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:45,480
over Epson because Epsilon are are bad

1948
01:27:42,760 --> 01:27:47,800
which is why okay so I still have a lot

1949
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:49,040
left okay so now what do I do with the

1950
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:53,400
ones I have

1951
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:59,000
left so I want argue so here here's the

1952
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:59,000
claim the claim is that

1953
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:06,000
um me write it here so the claim is that

1954
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:07,960
I should be able to find Collision so

1955
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:12,199
the algorithm the algorithm a what it

1956
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:12,199
does the way it breaks and so

1957
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:19,679
find

1958
01:28:16,159 --> 01:28:24,760
output a collision if one exists I I'll

1959
01:28:19,679 --> 01:28:24,760
write it here why my output so three

1960
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:28,560
output

1961
01:28:29,239 --> 01:28:33,199
Collision if one

1962
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:41,280
exists that's it so I got what do I mean

1963
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:43,000
if one exists many of the eyes here I

1964
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:47,000
asked many

1965
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:48,800
times right because I I I did poly an n

1966
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:50,719
n meaning kind of the witness length

1967
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:52,280
yeah more than like think of the witness

1968
01:28:50,719 --> 01:28:56,679
length to the power of the

1969
01:28:52,280 --> 01:28:58,880
third divided by Epsilon like w the P

1970
01:28:56,679 --> 01:28:59,920
size of the PCP divided by Epsilon to

1971
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:02,199
the third that's how you should think

1972
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:04,360
about it or to the times like security

1973
01:29:02,199 --> 01:29:07,800
parameter okay so now what what's the

1974
01:29:04,360 --> 01:29:08,880
point the point is I saw the same eye

1975
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:11,800
many many

1976
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:16,159
times because I asked many many

1977
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:18,360
queries now I want to argue that if so

1978
01:29:16,159 --> 01:29:19,920
there's two option either every time I I

1979
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:22,560
asked for an

1980
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:24,960
i he if he gave me a valid opening it's

1981
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:27,280
for the same one

1982
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:29,960
or at one of the eyes he gave me valid

1983
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:32,800
openings one for zero and one for one if

1984
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:35,360
that's the case I won I found a

1985
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:37,280
collision and then I I broke the hash

1986
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:38,400
function so if I if you believe you

1987
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:40,440
cannot break hash function then you

1988
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:42,840
cannot break then the scheme is secure

1989
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:44,920
which is kind of what we're trying to

1990
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:46,119
do but now you can say but maybe you

1991
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:48,280
didn't find a hash function maybe you

1992
01:29:46,119 --> 01:29:50,400
didn't find a collision

1993
01:29:48,280 --> 01:29:54,440
maybe the cheating

1994
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:56,719
prover whenever he answer he he answer

1995
01:29:54,440 --> 01:29:59,280
when he answers correctly it's always

1996
01:29:56,719 --> 01:30:01,159
with the same like for every eye if he

1997
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:02,199
answers correctly it's with the same

1998
01:30:01,159 --> 01:30:05,480
piie

1999
01:30:02,199 --> 01:30:07,679
eye he never answers correctly with pi

2000
01:30:05,480 --> 01:30:11,520
ey being zero with pi ey being

2001
01:30:07,679 --> 01:30:13,719
one then look then what happened I I

2002
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:17,040
take all the things that he asked me and

2003
01:30:13,719 --> 01:30:19,920
I piece together a PCP from him okay so

2004
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:23,360
okay so why I I say okay so the question

2005
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:24,880
is suppose I suppose I output suppose

2006
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:28,639
that a collision happens with negative

2007
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:31,719
probability if it's not I W I'm done

2008
01:30:28,639 --> 01:30:34,719
okay I want to argue now if not if a

2009
01:30:31,719 --> 01:30:34,719
collision

2010
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:38,880
so if a

2011
01:30:41,239 --> 01:30:44,239
collision

2012
01:30:46,760 --> 01:30:49,760
occurs

2013
01:30:49,880 --> 01:30:54,080
uh thank you

2014
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:58,480
with negative

2015
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:04,679
probability then I want to argue I can

2016
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:07,719
come up with a PCP

2017
01:31:04,679 --> 01:31:10,080
then there exists a

2018
01:31:07,719 --> 01:31:12,080
pi that I can construct from this

2019
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:15,239
adversary such

2020
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:19,040
that V

2021
01:31:15,239 --> 01:31:25,040
PCP of Pi

2022
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:25,040
accept with non- Nega probability

2023
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:31,119
and that's a contradiction because I

2024
01:31:27,880 --> 01:31:34,840
assume that my Pi is sound with NE I

2025
01:31:31,119 --> 01:31:36,480
mean uh sound is hold with probability

2026
01:31:34,840 --> 01:31:39,360
you know you break sound is only with

2027
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:41,280
negative probability so I'm I'm going to

2028
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:43,480
argue that if you don't if the

2029
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:46,320
probability finding Collision is

2030
01:31:43,480 --> 01:31:48,600
negligible then actually can come up

2031
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:50,440
with a PCP that's accepted with non

2032
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:53,480
netive probability but X is not in the

2033
01:31:50,440 --> 01:31:55,040
language so that that breaks the my that

2034
01:31:53,480 --> 01:31:57,040
can't happen

2035
01:31:55,040 --> 01:32:00,239
because I know the PCP has soundness

2036
01:31:57,040 --> 01:32:02,679
negligible so that can't happen and

2037
01:32:00,239 --> 01:32:04,960
therefore I must have Collision was not

2038
01:32:02,679 --> 01:32:07,920
probability and hence broke the

2039
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:10,920
Collision so why is there why is it the

2040
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:13,880
case that I can find a PCP that's

2041
01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:15,639
accepted because what am I going to do

2042
01:32:13,880 --> 01:32:17,080
remember let's think I never found

2043
01:32:15,639 --> 01:32:19,639
Collision it's negligible so you know

2044
01:32:17,080 --> 01:32:20,840
for all practical purposes never okay

2045
01:32:19,639 --> 01:32:23,320
let's think of the fact we never

2046
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:26,239
encounter a collision so then what do we

2047
01:32:23,320 --> 01:32:29,239
do I take this PCP I take this adversary

2048
01:32:26,239 --> 01:32:32,760
I run it oh I I start pieing up a PCP I

2049
01:32:29,239 --> 01:32:34,440
say oh Pi 1 here good Pi i1 every time I

2050
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:36,199
ask it again I know he'll give me this

2051
01:32:34,440 --> 01:32:38,520
answer because there's no

2052
01:32:36,199 --> 01:32:42,679
collisions and I start kind of slowly

2053
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:42,679
piecing together an entire

2054
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:49,040
PCP now there may be some form some

2055
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:50,880
places of the PCP that either that he

2056
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:52,560
will never open correctly never he'll

2057
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:54,760
never give me a valid

2058
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:56,880
opening then I can't I don't know I

2059
01:32:54,760 --> 01:32:59,119
don't moreover there may be some places

2060
01:32:56,880 --> 01:33:00,040
of the PCP that somehow this verifier

2061
01:32:59,119 --> 01:33:03,719
never

2062
01:33:00,040 --> 01:33:05,880
asked that can also be so I'm G to write

2063
01:33:03,719 --> 01:33:08,360
all the places that actually

2064
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:10,400
opened I'm going to write down whatever

2065
01:33:08,360 --> 01:33:12,360
didn't open look this adversary can

2066
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:14,119
always let's say it can always take one

2067
01:33:12,360 --> 01:33:16,040
minus Epsilon fraction of this PCP and

2068
01:33:14,119 --> 01:33:18,560
never open it and the rest open

2069
01:33:16,040 --> 01:33:19,960
correctly because he's only the Epsilon

2070
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:21,719
right so there can be always I don't

2071
01:33:19,960 --> 01:33:23,840
want to not really one man's epon the

2072
01:33:21,719 --> 01:33:25,679
PCP because we ask many queries but

2073
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:29,600
there can of course be some parts of the

2074
01:33:25,679 --> 01:33:31,040
PCP that he just never never answers and

2075
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:33,600
it's okay because because of this

2076
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:34,840
Epsilon okay so in that part I'm going

2077
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:36,880
to whatever I don't know I'm going to

2078
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:40,600
just put

2079
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:40,600
zeros okay but this is my

2080
01:33:40,719 --> 01:33:45,000
PCP and that's it now this is pi I'm

2081
01:33:43,199 --> 01:33:47,960
going to call this

2082
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:50,440
Pi now you're asking why is why would

2083
01:33:47,960 --> 01:33:54,760
the verifier accept Pi with non-

2084
01:33:50,440 --> 01:33:59,080
probability well because

2085
01:33:54,760 --> 01:34:01,800
this P star is accepted with probability

2086
01:33:59,080 --> 01:34:07,119
Epsilon

2087
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:09,920
and this if v v is gonna ask okay so

2088
01:34:07,119 --> 01:34:12,280
what's the concern the concern is well V

2089
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:14,920
now is going to ask like places that are

2090
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:18,040
zero here right so the point is we're

2091
01:34:14,920 --> 01:34:21,920
say what's my you're con

2092
01:34:18,040 --> 01:34:24,520
look P star succeeded maybe P star

2093
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:26,440
succeeded but here if P star succeeded

2094
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:28,800
we have here pies then this will succeed

2095
01:34:26,440 --> 01:34:31,000
too because it's p star answers like

2096
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:33,840
this but you're saying but maybe here

2097
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:35,480
there zeros maybe here there are zeros

2098
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:38,239
but why are there zeros let's remember

2099
01:34:35,480 --> 01:34:40,440
why did I put zeros here because P

2100
01:34:38,239 --> 01:34:42,400
failed on them that's why there's zeros

2101
01:34:40,440 --> 01:34:44,679
there I asked this place many many times

2102
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:47,239
and every time petar said no so he won't

2103
01:34:44,679 --> 01:34:50,000
succeed on this or there's also another

2104
01:34:47,239 --> 01:34:51,480
option that VPC never asks that that

2105
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:54,880
question in which case he still won't

2106
01:34:51,480 --> 01:34:54,880
ask that question

2107
01:34:55,040 --> 01:35:01,119
okay so again the claim is that this PCP

2108
01:34:58,639 --> 01:35:03,639
will be accepted with probability close

2109
01:35:01,119 --> 01:35:06,320
to Epsilon because the

2110
01:35:03,639 --> 01:35:08,840
probability that we will hit

2111
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:11,960
locations where we

2112
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:14,440
fail he and he succeeds is very very

2113
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:16,600
very small so whenever we fail he will

2114
01:35:14,440 --> 01:35:18,560
fail too with very high

2115
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:20,360
probability because if he succeed there

2116
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:22,400
we would have succeeded we asked so many

2117
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:24,159
questions we would finally get the right

2118
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:26,760
answer that's

2119
01:35:24,159 --> 01:35:29,239
the high level idea okay I don't want to

2120
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:31,400
go into more details I can send there's

2121
01:35:29,239 --> 01:35:34,000
a link in the website exactly on the

2122
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:35,600
proof but there's two reasons I don't

2123
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:38,159
want to go into more detail first

2124
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:39,600
because it's tedious H so if you you

2125
01:35:38,159 --> 01:35:40,639
know if you're interested just look look

2126
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:45,440
at the

2127
01:35:40,639 --> 01:35:48,119
paper but also this is not the right

2128
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:50,360
proof this is not the right proof and

2129
01:35:48,119 --> 01:35:53,119
why is it not the right proof because

2130
01:35:50,360 --> 01:35:55,480
note I cheated you actually I actually

2131
01:35:53,119 --> 01:35:59,040
lied I promised you that I broke

2132
01:35:55,480 --> 01:36:01,440
soundness but I didn't actually there's

2133
01:35:59,040 --> 01:36:04,639
a very

2134
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:06,119
minor a I don't know if to call it bug

2135
01:36:04,639 --> 01:36:10,239
but I I

2136
01:36:06,119 --> 01:36:13,159
lied and this doesn't quite

2137
01:36:10,239 --> 01:36:14,800
do it doesn't quite break the Collision

2138
01:36:13,159 --> 01:36:18,360
resistant

2139
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:22,239
with my okay when I say A breaks the

2140
01:36:18,360 --> 01:36:25,040
Collision resistant I need to say a

2141
01:36:22,239 --> 01:36:28,440
break p

2142
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:32,520
T Lambda adversary that breaks right I

2143
01:36:28,440 --> 01:36:34,320
said I assume T Lambda that you cannot

2144
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:37,400
break the Collision time T

2145
01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:40,080
Lambda so I said let's us say there's a

2146
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:44,119
t Lambda time P star and I'm going to

2147
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:46,119
break my my the Collision the I'm G to

2148
01:36:44,119 --> 01:36:48,000
find the Collision in time poly T

2149
01:36:46,119 --> 01:36:51,440
Lambda that's what gives me a

2150
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:53,119
contradiction I right I I argue my

2151
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:55,400
assumption is that there exists a CIT in

2152
01:36:53,119 --> 01:36:59,480
hash that cannot be broken collisions

2153
01:36:55,400 --> 01:37:01,000
cannot be found in time polity to break

2154
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:01,960
that I need to say if there exists a

2155
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:05,679
cheating

2156
01:37:01,960 --> 01:37:09,239
Prov then I can break the Collis time

2157
01:37:05,679 --> 01:37:12,560
po now let's look at the runtime of this

2158
01:37:09,239 --> 01:37:13,600
adversary the peace times of time poity

2159
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:17,040
that's

2160
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:18,159
okay but what might does my adversary do

2161
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:21,800
my

2162
01:37:18,159 --> 01:37:24,360
adversary he he tries to generate an

2163
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:26,159
entire PCP and and then he says if I

2164
01:37:24,360 --> 01:37:28,159
succeeded I can't succeed and therefore

2165
01:37:26,159 --> 01:37:32,960
I must be Collision but to generate

2166
01:37:28,159 --> 01:37:32,960
entire PCP he needs to run in time Po in

2167
01:37:33,320 --> 01:37:43,880
N what if T of smaller than

2168
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:46,320
n now you can say ah come on uh T Lambda

2169
01:37:43,880 --> 01:37:48,719
must be bigger than n otherwise this

2170
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:50,560
kind of this def I don't like this

2171
01:37:48,719 --> 01:37:52,480
definition because I we should allow the

2172
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:54,679
cheating proof to run time poan if you

2173
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:56,920
don't something's wrong with

2174
01:37:54,679 --> 01:38:00,639
definition I don't know maybe yes maybe

2175
01:37:56,920 --> 01:38:03,400
no I I have now a definition that says

2176
01:38:00,639 --> 01:38:04,840
you know time T of Lambda maybe you want

2177
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:06,719
T of lamb to be smaller than n because

2178
01:38:04,840 --> 01:38:08,239
the application makes sense because you

2179
01:38:06,719 --> 01:38:10,320
use it in a way that actually the pro

2180
01:38:08,239 --> 01:38:15,000
will never run in time

2181
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:16,760
n so you know I have now some T of

2182
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:20,719
Lambda how it connects to N I actually

2183
01:38:16,760 --> 01:38:23,280
don't know and I want to ensure that you

2184
01:38:20,719 --> 01:38:25,800
know I can break the adversary the the I

2185
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:28,639
can fine Collision time t to the Lambda

2186
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:31,199
but actually I run P star which is time

2187
01:38:28,639 --> 01:38:34,679
t to the Lambda that's fine but I run

2188
01:38:31,199 --> 01:38:36,880
him n times one over Epsilon is fine

2189
01:38:34,679 --> 01:38:38,280
because Epsilon is like Epsilon in

2190
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:40,920
Lambda or ta to the

2191
01:38:38,280 --> 01:38:43,440
Lambda okay it's one over po t to the

2192
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:47,639
Lambda fine that's good t to the Lambda

2193
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:50,320
T of Lambda sorry but this n n can be

2194
01:38:47,639 --> 01:38:50,320
bigger than T of

2195
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:55,400
Lambda so

2196
01:38:56,199 --> 01:39:01,760
so really this works if this this

2197
01:38:59,159 --> 01:39:04,360
definition is good if only if T of

2198
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:07,080
Lambda is bigger than n so this is a

2199
01:39:04,360 --> 01:39:07,080
good proof

2200
01:39:19,400 --> 01:39:23,880
If and this is kind of kind of bother

2201
01:39:22,040 --> 01:39:25,760
cryptographers because even though it

2202
01:39:23,880 --> 01:39:27,440
makes sense to assume the T of Lambda is

2203
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:29,800
bigger than n it makes sense to let the

2204
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:31,760
cheating prove a run in time

2205
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:35,679
poen it's

2206
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:38,440
um it's annoying that we need to do

2207
01:39:35,679 --> 01:39:40,719
that so I think we should take a break a

2208
01:39:38,440 --> 01:39:44,239
f minute break after the break I'll tell

2209
01:39:40,719 --> 01:39:46,760
you just a very high level idea there's

2210
01:39:44,239 --> 01:39:49,960
a beautiful paper that came in 2002 by

2211
01:39:46,760 --> 01:39:52,400
Barak and gold that they showed how to

2212
01:39:49,960 --> 01:39:53,679
get around it how to do it for any they

2213
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:57,560
get around they actually don't construct

2214
01:39:53,679 --> 01:40:01,000
an entire PCP they do what I think is a

2215
01:39:57,560 --> 01:40:03,679
more a clever and more beautiful kind of

2216
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:06,159
what I think of as the right proof uh

2217
01:40:03,679 --> 01:40:07,440
for this uh and we'll see that after the

2218
01:40:06,159 --> 01:40:08,840
break and then we'll do the construction

2219
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:11,639
of the Collision resistant but there was

2220
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:11,639
questions before

2221
01:40:15,880 --> 01:40:21,760
yeah great

2222
01:40:18,719 --> 01:40:23,760
question I don't the rewinding for okay

2223
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:26,119
so the question is was is the rewind in

2224
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:28,320
necessary and it's a great question the

2225
01:40:26,119 --> 01:40:31,639
answer is for all I know yes the

2226
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:34,560
rewinding is necessary a this question

2227
01:40:31,639 --> 01:40:36,920
was very important also for postquantum

2228
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:38,679
because you know today we're worried

2229
01:40:36,920 --> 01:40:41,599
about quantum computers and if the

2230
01:40:38,679 --> 01:40:43,360
cheating prover is a Quantum device you

2231
01:40:41,599 --> 01:40:46,440
can't rewind him because once you

2232
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:49,119
measure a Quantum state it collapses and

2233
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:51,159
so proving postquantum security of this

2234
01:40:49,119 --> 01:40:53,400
protocol it was Pro actually it's known

2235
01:40:51,159 --> 01:40:54,960
to be postquantum secure but it was a

2236
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:57,239
lot of work because when it was work

2237
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:59,440
that required to kind of rewind the

2238
01:40:57,239 --> 01:41:00,880
cheating prover in the quantum like to

2239
01:40:59,440 --> 01:41:03,119
rewind the quantum cheating prover and

2240
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:05,280
why can you rewind so they showed you

2241
01:41:03,119 --> 01:41:07,920
can actually do it but just to answer

2242
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:09,560
your question do you need to rewind yes

2243
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:11,280
uh kind of we don't have a StraightLine

2244
01:41:09,560 --> 01:41:14,679
proof of of

2245
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:14,679
soundness for this

2246
01:41:16,599 --> 01:41:20,960
protocol you know so it the the the

2247
01:41:19,679 --> 01:41:22,920
other proof I'll show you after the

2248
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:25,280
break doesn't quite construct the PCP

2249
01:41:22,920 --> 01:41:27,360
but in order to find collisions we need

2250
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:28,639
to run him at least twice I run him and

2251
01:41:27,360 --> 01:41:30,239
then because how am I gonna find

2252
01:41:28,639 --> 01:41:32,239
Collision I give him queries he's gonna

2253
01:41:30,239 --> 01:41:34,840
give me answers how how how can I find

2254
01:41:32,239 --> 01:41:36,719
collisions from that but if I run him

2255
01:41:34,840 --> 01:41:37,960
once and I run him again with the idea

2256
01:41:36,719 --> 01:41:40,159
is I'm going to run him I'm going to

2257
01:41:37,960 --> 01:41:41,599
choose like a random query eye I'm once

2258
01:41:40,159 --> 01:41:42,800
going to run him eye with some queries

2259
01:41:41,599 --> 01:41:43,960
and then I'm going to run him ey with

2260
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:46,880
other

2261
01:41:43,960 --> 01:41:49,840
queries and the only way you can cheat

2262
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:51,239
is if you're not always consistent and

2263
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:54,239
that but at least I need to rewind you

2264
01:41:51,239 --> 01:41:54,239
twice

2265
01:41:54,599 --> 01:41:57,320
so that's

2266
01:41:57,599 --> 01:42:03,400
the any any any other questions

2267
01:42:06,679 --> 01:42:12,280
yeah

2268
01:42:08,199 --> 01:42:15,199
this no I don't think the the right the

2269
01:42:12,280 --> 01:42:18,400
the the actually when you look inside

2270
01:42:15,199 --> 01:42:20,119
the hash functions it just becomes messy

2271
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:21,920
I think actually abstracting out the

2272
01:42:20,119 --> 01:42:24,480
hash functions and just thinking what

2273
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:27,320
property gives you makes the proof

2274
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:28,599
cleaner uh put it kind of to put boxes

2275
01:42:27,320 --> 01:42:31,320
around things you know and just

2276
01:42:28,599 --> 01:42:33,320
modularize kind of what you need

2277
01:42:31,320 --> 01:42:37,520
actually helps the understanding and

2278
01:42:33,320 --> 01:42:39,440
helps simplifies the proof uh it's uh

2279
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:41,719
yeah I I think the the problem with this

2280
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:43,760
proof is that it requires constructing

2281
01:42:41,719 --> 01:42:46,119
an entire PCP and some saying why do I

2282
01:42:43,760 --> 01:42:47,520
need to construct an entire PCP so the

2283
01:42:46,119 --> 01:42:48,880
other proof kind of shows that you

2284
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:50,000
actually don't need to do that and

2285
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:52,360
that's why you could the pro doesn't

2286
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:56,000
need to run time linear and N just runs

2287
01:42:52,360 --> 01:42:56,000
in time the depend on

2288
01:42:56,520 --> 01:43:03,960
T A any any other questions before the

2289
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:05,520
break yeah n here is the size of PCP

2290
01:43:03,960 --> 01:43:07,400
yeah you're right n is the size of the

2291
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:09,880
PCP but I'm thinking here because I'm

2292
01:43:07,400 --> 01:43:13,159
thinking of three set I'm thinking the

2293
01:43:09,880 --> 01:43:15,000
input the instance n the witness and the

2294
01:43:13,159 --> 01:43:17,800
PCP are all poly

2295
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:20,360
related so it's because I have your

2296
01:43:17,800 --> 01:43:23,880
polinomial it doesn't matter but I do

2297
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:28,239
want to say uh in some settings you can

2298
01:43:23,880 --> 01:43:29,920
think of the witness can be much much

2299
01:43:28,239 --> 01:43:32,080
smaller than instance or much much

2300
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:35,199
bigger than the instance so for example

2301
01:43:32,080 --> 01:43:39,040
take nondeterministic time t x is of

2302
01:43:35,199 --> 01:43:41,599
size n but the witness is of size T of n

2303
01:43:39,040 --> 01:43:45,040
which can be super polinomial in

2304
01:43:41,599 --> 01:43:48,119
N then this becomes polinomial in the

2305
01:43:45,040 --> 01:43:50,320
witness the PCP is always or okay the

2306
01:43:48,119 --> 01:43:52,760
PCP is always polom related to the

2307
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:54,239
instance and witness now sometimes the

2308
01:43:52,760 --> 01:43:55,840
witness is bigger sometimes the instance

2309
01:43:54,239 --> 01:43:57,239
is bigger and the relation does not need

2310
01:43:55,840 --> 01:43:58,920
to be po nomally related if they're all

2311
01:43:57,239 --> 01:44:01,239
Pally related it doesn't matter here

2312
01:43:58,920 --> 01:44:03,719
because I put a poly but sometimes the

2313
01:44:01,239 --> 01:44:06,440
witness can be much much smaller like

2314
01:44:03,719 --> 01:44:08,599
log click the witness is size log

2315
01:44:06,440 --> 01:44:10,040
squared but the input is n and sometimes

2316
01:44:08,599 --> 01:44:13,599
the instance can be small and the

2317
01:44:10,040 --> 01:44:17,080
witness can be big so what I mean here

2318
01:44:13,599 --> 01:44:18,440
is input plus witness length here I just

2319
01:44:17,080 --> 01:44:19,719
put one of them because I assume three

2320
01:44:18,440 --> 01:44:22,400
set they're all the they're both the

2321
01:44:19,719 --> 01:44:24,239
same so yeah but that's a good what

2322
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:27,159
really I need to put here's PCP length

2323
01:44:24,239 --> 01:44:30,440
that's the truth um yeah great great

2324
01:44:27,159 --> 01:44:31,360
Point fantastic other questions before

2325
01:44:30,440 --> 01:44:33,400
we

2326
01:44:31,360 --> 01:44:36,560
break okay let's do a five minute break

2327
01:44:33,400 --> 01:44:36,560
and then we'll return
