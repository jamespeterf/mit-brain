1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:06,960
It is my pleasure to introduce our first

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:09,440
speaker Matters Versa who is a research

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,840
collaborator with the MIT digital

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:17,320
currency initiative and also the chief

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,320
scientist of Radius. Welcome Matters.

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,080
>> What are you going to talk to us about

7
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,199
today?

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:25,519
>> Um thank you very much Jim. Um uh today

9
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,880
I'll give a brief introduction to uh

10
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:33,600
postquantum uh

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:36,160
um so um first uh what is cryptography?

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,079
Cryptography is communication in

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,160
presence of adversaries kind like if we

14
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,480
didn't have adversaries there would be

15
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,040
no need for cryptography. But we do have

16
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,440
adversaries like let's say there's uh uh

17
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,520
two people Alice and Bob and Alice wants

18
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:53,360
to um

19
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,920
uh uh send a a message to Bob um and

20
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,399
because she's sending it over untrusted

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:02,000
network anyone on the pass on the

22
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,680
network can read and uh modify it like

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,600
this would happen like if you were for

24
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:09,920
example at a coffee shop. Uh so there is

25
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,159
a standard technique that Alice uses and

26
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,799
like we all of all of us rely every day

27
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:18,080
which is just use encryption. That way

28
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,840
uh only Bob can receive Alice's message

29
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,040
but everyone else on the path from Alice

30
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:25,200
to Bob is left in the dark.

31
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,759
But here's the problem. Uh quantum

32
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,840
computers an upcoming technology uh

33
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,079
break most of encryption methods used

34
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,680
today.

35
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:38,159
uh in particular uh uh this is a quantum

36
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,680
threat as applied to cryptography.

37
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,680
There are two quantum algorithms that

38
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,360
matter for cryptography.

39
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,520
You might have heard of them like one of

40
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,000
them is called Grover's algorithm and it

41
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,880
basically weakens symmetric ctography

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
like hash functions or uh uh encryption

43
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,479
algorithms like AES and it gives a

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,680
quadratic speed up like if previously it

45
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:03,040
required 2 to 128 uh uh operations to do

46
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,560
a search now it requires 2 to 64

47
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,560
and because this speed up is just

48
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,399
quadratic it means there is a simple

49
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,640
solution it just suffices for us to

50
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,879
double the parameter sizes we used

51
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,840
smaller keys Now we all just like use

52
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:19,040
little bit larger keys but um that's not

53
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,360
again like life-ch changing.

54
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:24,720
But the second algorithm by Peter Shore

55
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,720
invented here at MIT uh is devastating.

56
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,520
It breaks most public key crypto

57
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,599
cryptography used today such as RSA

58
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:35,680
crypto system which relies on hardness

59
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:38,480
of factoring of large composits

60
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,200
elliptic curves and similar and it gives

61
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,120
exponential speed up. While uh n bit

62
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,360
integers can be uh factored in just

63
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,319
polinomial time

64
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,400
and like uh those terms mean that this

65
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,920
is a real threat to today's systems

66
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,080
unlike for Grober where you could just

67
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,440
double the parameter sizes you cannot do

68
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:00,080
that for short algorithm uh like you you

69
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,920
really like if if if quantum computers

70
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,519
get built that can execute short

71
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,480
algorithm then much of today's

72
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:10,239
cryptography is toast

73
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:12,319
but how far away is this and uh I'm a

74
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,640
computer scientist. I'm not a physicist

75
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:18,000
but u I'm going to consult a physicist

76
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:20,480
remotely. There's a great resource by

77
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,120
professor at your water loss which gives

78
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,120
a landscape of quantum computing and it

79
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,959
basically looks like this like there are

80
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,599
two main parameters for quantum

81
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:32,879
computers. One of them is how many

82
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:35,200
cubits are there and uh second them is

83
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,879
like how good are the cubits meaning uh

84
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,959
like what is the error rate and

85
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,720
generally can like uh uh like for for

86
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,480
most powerful computations you want to

87
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:46,080
be kind of like up and to the right you

88
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,920
want like a large number of uh very high

89
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,760
quality cubits

90
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,519
and if you can see kind like this is a

91
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:57,920
how quantum computing landscape was in

92
00:03:53,519 --> 00:04:00,480
21 and now it's 22 and now it's 23 three

93
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,480
and now it's 24 and it's very clear that

94
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,640
we are advancing up and to the right

95
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,959
exactly as would be necessary to

96
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:10,239
implement a short algorithm to break

97
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:12,400
break crypto systems like RSA

98
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:15,200
and um

99
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:18,239
oh and and now we arrive at 25 and we

100
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,799
actually see something else uh like not

101
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,400
only we have attack from below like we

102
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,800
get like better quantum algorithms we

103
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,040
also have uh uh quantum computers we

104
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,240
also get like attack from above Like

105
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,800
people have figured out like

106
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,199
optimizations to source algorithm and

107
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,320
like when the two lines meet like what

108
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:39,040
where computers are there and algorithms

109
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,759
are there to uh to be run on them we

110
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:46,479
have breaks.

111
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:49,840
So uh so it might really be that we have

112
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:51,360
more uh type phenomena. uh uh quantum

113
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,800
computers just get better and better and

114
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,720
algorithms themselves are a moving

115
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,160
target

116
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,639
and global risk institute uh did a

117
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,919
survey of leading uh quantum computing

118
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,840
uh professionals and uh these experts

119
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,600
estimated likelihood of quantum computer

120
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,400
being able to break crypto systems like

121
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,720
RSA and in five years kind of like the

122
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:16,240
low values of the estimates were maybe

123
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,720
like 5% chance an optimistic one was 14

124
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:22,000
but in 20 years the situation completely

125
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,759
completely flips like uh the pessimistic

126
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,560
estimate is that it's more likely than

127
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,720
not 60% chance that quantum computers

128
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,199
will be able to break our say in 24

129
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,960
hours.

130
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,280
And fortunately there is kind of like

131
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,280
good news. The answer is uh postquantum

132
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,440
cryptography. There are algorithms that

133
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,680
are resistant to quantum computers. They

134
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,639
are based on different mathematical

135
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,919
problems like problems that we used and

136
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:50,560
loved uh just like elliptic curves or

137
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,000
RSA function are vulnerable to quantum

138
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,680
computers but other mathematical

139
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,919
problems like latises or codebased

140
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,960
cryptography is not.

141
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,400
Um and in 2016 uh national institute of

142
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,360
standards technology announced a

143
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,840
competition uh for selecting postquantum

144
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,560
algorithms for protecting uh Americans

145
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:11,520
data. 92 algorithms were submitted and

146
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,680
after multiple rounds of evaluations

147
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,120
uh NIST announced seven finalists to be

148
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,199
standardized and then like a couple

149
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:21,039
years later final versions of first

150
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:23,840
three standards are out there

151
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:25,680
so that's good news but like it's not

152
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,880
like this process would would have been

153
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,680
uh uh without challenges like in 2009

154
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:35,600
Cloudflare and Google collectively did

155
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:37,120
experiment where they changed the way

156
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,600
encryption works when you visit a

157
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:43,520
website to in incorporate a postquantum

158
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:45,759
algorithm called psych. Psych was um an

159
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:49,840
excellent uh believed to be excellent

160
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:52,400
performance giving algorithm with like

161
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:55,759
structures that's impervious to uh

162
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:58,080
quantum attacks and um in fact even

163
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,319
advanced to round four of N competition

164
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,160
but just a couple a couple months later

165
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,400
there was a catastrophic break in psych

166
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:08,160
even without using any quantum computers

167
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:10,080
it was just broken an ordinary laptop

168
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,000
so and this kind like like highlights at

169
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,319
a certain best practice to use hybrid

170
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,960
approaches like use classical algorithm

171
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:19,360
together with a postquantum algorithm

172
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,440
because like had Cloudflare and Google

173
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:25,039
just used psych and wouldn't paired it

174
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:27,039
with as a classical uh uh curve 25519

175
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:29,280
algorithm like all of the traffic would

176
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,720
have been broken but because they used

177
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,280
hybrids they used classical and

178
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:37,240
postquantum together uh they at least

179
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,240
retain the classical security

180
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,680
so question is kind of like well how

181
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:45,440
urgent it is like maybe it is coming uh

182
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,039
uh in 20 years but uh why upgrade now

183
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,479
and here there are two main quantum

184
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:52,479
threats. The first one is uh forging or

185
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,560
impersonation. You can break

186
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:56,160
authentication protocols in real time.

187
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:01,039
Remember like when Alice was talking to

188
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:04,479
Bob maybe uh somebody in the middle

189
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:06,960
could uh uh use their quantum computer

190
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:10,240
to impersonate Bob without Alice

191
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:12,240
knowing. And like people give all kinds

192
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,000
of like arguments. Well, maybe large

193
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,560
scale quantum computers never get built.

194
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,720
Well, that's a possibility or or maybe

195
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,639
we'll see signs and and then we'll

196
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,000
upgrade kind like let's let's wait and

197
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:26,400
see. Um but that doesn't work for the

198
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,520
second quantum threat which is so-called

199
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:33,440
harvest node decrypt later uh attacks.

200
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:36,240
Adversaries can today decrypt uh uh can

201
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:39,599
uh record traffic to be decrypted later

202
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:42,719
when quantum computers are available

203
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:45,040
and upgrading later wouldn't protect

204
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:48,240
today's traffic and unfortunately it

205
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,240
even breaks perfect forward secrecy uh

206
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,640
uh that's based on current pre-quantum

207
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:56,640
methods as they rely on ephemeral key

208
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:58,640
exchange um and key eraser.

209
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,720
So

210
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,959
really to protect against harvest now

211
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,959
decrypt later attacks we should upgrade

212
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,920
now.

213
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:10,240
So here are the key takeaways. Number

214
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,640
one uh quantum computing is pro

215
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,320
progressing steadily and it is very

216
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,040
likely that existing cryptography won't

217
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,640
remain secure indefinitely. Upgrading

218
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,480
now would pre prevent those attacks

219
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,320
where somebody just records traffic and

220
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,800
then 20 years later when quantum

221
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,360
computer is there like decrypts it and a

222
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:30,160
lot of information is still sensitive 20

223
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,920
years in the future. There are good news

224
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,160
that the postquantum cryptography

225
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,640
standards are here and the best practice

226
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,480
would be using hybrid approaches as they

227
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,080
protect uh risks inherent in new

228
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,560
software and new constructions risks as

229
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,560
we saw with site

230
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,399
and then there's also like a call to

231
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:51,200
call call to action which is uh leads to

232
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,760
our next uh talk like you could use this

233
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,000
upgrade uh as a catalyst to revaluate

234
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,920
and modernize system architectures not

235
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,160
only to switch to something postquantum

236
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,240
secure but maybe switch to something

237
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,640
else entirely.

238
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,600
Thank you very much.

239
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:10,160
>> Great. Uh thanks so much uh matters uh

240
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,640
for an enlightening presentation. Uh

241
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:16,720
we're going to continue on to our next

242
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:20,079
speaker right now and then after uh

243
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:22,640
after that we'll bring Madar back on and

244
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:24,959
we'll have about five minutes for Q&A.

245
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,920
So uh prepare your questions of the

246
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:30,079
folks that are out there. With that, it

247
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:33,680
is my pleasure to introduce our next

248
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:36,480
speaker, Dan Arinoff, who is a uh

249
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:39,440
research affiliate with the MIT

250
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:43,200
Department of Economics and like matters

251
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:45,760
is a research collaborator with the MIT

252
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,040
digital currency initiative. Welcome

253
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,160
Dan.

254
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,000
>> Thank you Jim. So to take the baton from

255
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,839
Madars

256
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,959
what what we see over time the

257
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:59,279
horizontal axis is is a time dimension

258
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:02,320
are advances in the technology of

259
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:04,560
quantum computing that Madar spoke about

260
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:07,360
and also progression and regulatory

261
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,959
rules in in the I'm restricted to a US

262
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:13,040
content because I'm I'm not sure what's

263
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:18,000
happening outside the US but um it the

264
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:21,440
NSA uh national security agency um

265
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,440
announced in 2015 I think it was or 16

266
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,360
that it was going to change all of its

267
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,079
systems and requires its vendors going

268
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,760
forward to adopt postquantum standards

269
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:33,200
and then the National Institute of

270
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:36,000
Standards NIST at that time announced an

271
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:39,040
intention to develop postquantum

272
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,279
um standards and then we go to 2022 as

273
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,480
Madar pointed out the first postquantum

274
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:46,480
standards were uh approved by NIST and

275
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:50,160
this is an ongoing process for both you

276
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:53,040
know messaging, keys and uh data

277
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,040
security and also the uh Congress passed

278
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,760
the US quantum computing cyber security

279
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,040
act which sets a timeline

280
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,360
excuse me for federal government

281
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,040
agencies and all the entities that they

282
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,160
interact with to adopt these standards.

283
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:09,040
So effectively the entire regulated part

284
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,360
of the US economy is going to be uh is

285
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:14,240
going to have to adopt post-quantum

286
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,560
standards and that's like regardless of

287
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,320
what one's opinion about the real threat

288
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,320
of quantum computing is you can think

289
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:23,360
there is no threat at all you still have

290
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,560
to adopt the standards. Um so that's

291
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,000
something businesses are going to have

292
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,360
to contend with particularly in

293
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,279
financial services and healthcare.

294
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,720
So now we go to so what are what what

295
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:37,519
methods are available? Um the two most

296
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:40,079
prevalent and promising methods are

297
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:43,120
multi-party computation and fully

298
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:45,920
homorphic equip uh encryption and both

299
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,240
have been progressing over time. We'll

300
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,480
start with multi-party computation. What

301
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,200
is it? Well, suppose we're computing

302
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,839
Alice's credit score and there are

303
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:58,000
different vendors with information and

304
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,320
there's a desire or a requirement that

305
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,279
their information not be coming that it

306
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,519
be private. Um, rather than sending it

307
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:08,399
to a trusted party, cryptography is

308
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,959
based on on removing trust and relying

309
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:13,760
on math. In the case of multi-party

310
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:16,639
computation, each vendor would would

311
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:19,839
chop up its its uh information that it

312
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:22,959
has on Alice into chunks and it would

313
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,480
send independent chunks to one of a

314
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,240
group, you know, each chunk to a

315
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,519
different server that was part of the

316
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,959
multicomputation pool. And so all the

317
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,959
vendors do that. So let's say you have

318
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:35,680
three vendors, you have three computers

319
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:37,279
doing multi-party computation. uh the

320
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,920
vendors each vendor chops this

321
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:43,839
information into three parts distributes

322
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:46,160
it to the vendors each each computer has

323
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:49,120
the function to compute but it's

324
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:51,120
computing on partial data so this is not

325
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,959
penetrable by quantum computer there's

326
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:57,760
no numbers to factor and then they

327
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,760
combine the outputs and you can then

328
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:03,120
make the in you can then get the result

329
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:05,760
from the output you can control who gets

330
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,600
to who has the key to see the outut put

331
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,440
you can make it resilient so that if

332
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,920
there's fake data coming in or some kind

333
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,320
of an attack it's resilient to that. So

334
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,920
this is a lowcost resilient method.

335
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:20,639
However,

336
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:22,720
it relies on on uh there being no no

337
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,440
collusion between the computers doing

338
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:28,959
the computing. If they if they if they

339
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:31,120
collude, they can decode and break the

340
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:35,040
system. So there's that that human

341
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:37,279
vector of attack that that is out there.

342
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,680
The next method is fully homamorphic

343
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:43,279
encryption. With fully homorphic

344
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:45,279
encryption, you're encrypting data.

345
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:48,000
And the encryption has the desirable

346
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:49,920
property that you can compute on it. So

347
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,959
for example, Madars and I can each have

348
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:55,519
a number and we can add, we can

349
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:57,440
multiply, we can compare our numbers by

350
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,360
just looking at the cipher text, the

351
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,160
encrypted data. We don't have to

352
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,720
decrypt. We can send our information to

353
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:07,040
a central processor encrypted. That

354
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,440
processor can compute over our data

355
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,279
never seeing it. And yet we can verify

356
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,480
that the computation's being done

357
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:16,959
correctly. Better yet, the methods that

358
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,519
are used for fully homorphic encryption

359
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:23,519
are res are quantum computer resistant.

360
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:26,560
And the reason is that they rely on on

361
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:28,079
random noise to protect the data. And

362
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,639
there's nothing a qu a quantum computer

363
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:33,279
can't penetrate random noise. So all of

364
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:36,399
that is very good. It's very promising.

365
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:38,399
Um it's and and it's very new. The

366
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,160
drawback is it's very expensive in terms

367
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,800
of computation.

368
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:47,040
It's not feasible to deploy at scale

369
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:49,040
yet. And so um uh it there's a lot of

370
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,440
research being done, significant amounts

371
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,800
here at MIT, but but it's not ready for

372
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:57,279
prime time. And therefore the method

373
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:00,320
that's currently relied on is generally

374
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:03,040
a trusted execution enclave. And what

375
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:05,680
that is is you have an it's it's is you

376
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:08,160
have an enclave around a processor. So

377
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,680
your data is coming in encrypted. In

378
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,759
Alice's case, all these different

379
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,160
vendors send their encrypted data in. It

380
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:16,160
gets decrypted, you know, by the machine

381
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,800
inside the enclave, computed on,

382
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:21,440
re-encrypted, sent out. This is

383
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:24,000
resistant to quantum computing attacks.

384
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,160
Um, however, you're now relying on your

385
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,880
hardware for security. The value of

386
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,880
cryptography is that when it works, when

387
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,480
it's impenetrable, it's math. There's no

388
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,440
way around it. It's it's it's

389
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,959
unbreakable. Here, because it's hardware

390
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,399
dependent, there can be flaws in

391
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:41,040
hardware. There can be human

392
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,639
malfeasants. Um, and so there's an

393
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,040
ultimately an element of trust that's

394
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:48,000
reintroduced in the in the trusted

395
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:50,399
execution environment. Finally, all

396
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,880
these methods can be deployed on

397
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:56,000
existing computer systems which is which

398
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:59,120
is beneficial.

399
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:03,440
Okay. So, um

400
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:06,319
next we have the progression of of AI

401
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,720
techniques of neural networks and

402
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:11,760
computational power that we're all you

403
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:14,959
know I'm sure aware of and using um over

404
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,559
time. But at the same time there's

405
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,799
there's this question of how do you

406
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:21,360
combine these advanced techniques with

407
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:23,280
the requirements of privacy? Privacy in

408
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,600
medical records, privacy in financial

409
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,959
records. So let's go back to Alice's

410
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,039
credit score. In fact, let's go back to

411
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,200
how do you compute a credit score? One

412
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:35,840
way is the current method which is you

413
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:39,600
send encrypted data to a vendor that you

414
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:43,679
trust um you know not to not to reveal

415
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:47,360
the contents but to make it trustless

416
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:49,039
um you can use cryptographic methods and

417
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,679
one of the most promising is called

418
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:53,760
federated learning. What we would do

419
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:56,799
here is now suppose there's there's

420
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,880
several silos of data on a large group

421
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:01,679
of people and we're trying to compute a

422
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:04,960
credit score function. So you would have

423
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:07,840
a central computer send like a a an

424
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:12,000
equation structure, a model structure to

425
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:14,559
each silo and each silo would compute

426
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,320
its function on that data. So it would

427
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,480
come up with its own let's say mini

428
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:21,600
credit score model on on the slices of

429
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:24,000
data that it has. It would then send

430
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,640
encrypted the parameter estimates back

431
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,160
to the central computer. The central

432
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,919
computer could then aggregate those

433
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,000
together. Maybe just averaging across

434
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:34,400
the the the neurons of a neural network

435
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,720
or whatever the model is.

436
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:40,320
And then you iterate back and forth. And

437
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:42,559
by doing that you can actually compute

438
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,760
um efficiently compute a or not

439
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:48,960
necessarily efficient compute you can

440
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:50,799
get an accurate um developed model um

441
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,080
without any of the underlying data being

442
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:54,559
shared because all that's being shared

443
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,480
are the parameters and you can of course

444
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:58,880
even disguise the parameters using

445
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:01,280
methods like FHE.

446
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,760
Um, and now we get to Alice's credit

447
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,840
score. And there you've got the model

448
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,400
set up and each vendor can send their

449
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:12,320
pieces of Alice's information and use

450
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:15,600
the methods that we talked about before.

451
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:18,559
Um, and so this is this is um this is

452
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:21,520
something that has a lot of promise.

453
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:24,559
And so to to summarize

454
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:26,640
um regulated institutions will be

455
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,880
required to adopt postquantum privacy

456
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:32,000
and security regardless of the reality

457
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,760
the ground truth of of whether quantum

458
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,600
computing is is going to be a real

459
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:39,600
threat. And there are methods available

460
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,440
but they're not cost feasible many of

461
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,360
them for atscale deployments

462
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,120
cryptographic methods. And again we

463
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,120
desire cryptographic methods because

464
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,520
it's trustless. It relies on math. It's

465
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:52,640
the most when it works in the right

466
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:55,840
conditions, it's the most secure um

467
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:58,480
thing that you can do. Um so a fallback

468
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,080
is trusted execution enclave, but that

469
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:03,360
opens a vector of attack through the

470
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:06,000
hardware. uh and finally we can apply

471
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,840
post-quantum techniques to decentralized

472
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
learning in the way that I described

473
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,559
where the data the underlying data is

474
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,120
never being combined and within each

475
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:17,360
silo um you can use the methods we

476
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:20,080
discussed earlier that can protect

477
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:23,760
against um postquantum or quantum

478
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:26,960
attacks. So that that's all I have.

479
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:28,880
>> Thank you Dan. uh great presentation and

480
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,679
uh we're going to move to the uh

481
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:35,520
question and answer portion of your

482
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:38,400
talks and uh so both of you can feel

483
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:41,840
free to tag team on a few questions that

484
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:44,159
have have come in. Uh so I'll just uh

485
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:47,200
start off with the first. Uh do you

486
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:49,440
believe that firms will need to scrap

487
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:53,039
the existing tech stack that they're

488
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,720
using in order to adapt to postquantum

489
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,840
security?

490
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,799
Um

491
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:01,760
>> well it's always kind like a a good and

492
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:04,000
um standard practice to do inventory of

493
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,000
uh of your software assets and hardware

494
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,360
assets and in this case also like what

495
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,840
underlying cryptography uh they use and

496
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:14,640
um of course um vendors will provide

497
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,880
updates uh uh but uh uh uh your

498
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,120
institutions might want to adopt like a

499
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,799
particular strategy. for example, a

500
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,360
vendor might choose not to use hybrids

501
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:25,600
and you might choose to actually do use

502
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,200
hybrids because uh uh that's a more

503
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,720
prudent choice.

504
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,039
>> But I think I think it's also the case

505
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,360
that that these methods we're talking

506
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:36,080
about are classical computer that is

507
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:39,120
existing computer type infrastructure or

508
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:41,520
methods that can that use classical

509
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:44,080
computers to defend against quantum

510
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:46,240
attacks. So they're they're not methods

511
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,720
that require that you have to yourself

512
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:52,400
you have to have a quantum computing

513
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:55,679
base to protect your data. You can use

514
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:59,520
the existing you know technology

515
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:02,520
um in principle to to achieve

516
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,520
protection.

517
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:11,280
>> Okay. Uh another question in for uh from

518
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:13,120
our Q&A function. Uh and and uh do there

519
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,120
was uh do you have any comments? Um

520
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:20,159
there was an announcement a couple of

521
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:24,799
days ago about uh 12,000 laser tweezers

522
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:27,440
uh that achieved uh 6,100 cubits and uh

523
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:30,799
do you think that that would ex expedite

524
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,799
uh the need for more uh uh postquantum

525
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,960
data security?

526
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:36,960
Uh well it's always kind of like like

527
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,120
when when you see those announcements

528
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,200
there's like uh I think the prime number

529
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,360
is the number of cubits but uh there's

530
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,679
also the second number is the error rate

531
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:48,960
and kind like uh because like ultimately

532
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:50,720
what happens is uh uh like to implement

533
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,480
uh quantum algorithms you implement them

534
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,440
on what's called logical cubits. You

535
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:58,240
apply quantum error uh correction uh uh

536
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,480
to deal with faulty physical cubits. And

537
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,960
so like maybe you have a ton of physical

538
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,799
cubits but uh you cannot implement

539
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,360
quantum error correction and it's like

540
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:10,159
not not not that useful but but if you

541
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:13,360
can and it's interesting because it

542
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:16,480
seems to be a modality where people are

543
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:20,320
uh not working a lot on uh the Twitter

544
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:22,880
specifically then um it sounds promising

545
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:25,520
but I I I hadn't seen this. I would want

546
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,679
to uh look at the error rate uh not only

547
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,600
the cubit count.

548
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:33,280
I believe this announcement came in from

549
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:36,320
Caltech. So, uh um I I guess being

550
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:39,120
academics, we're we we we put a lot of

551
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:41,280
um um credibility behind when when

552
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,280
another a peer institution makes an

553
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:46,720
announcement like that. So, it is

554
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:49,919
>> somewhat exciting. Uh okay, another one

555
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,919
coming in from uh our audience. And with

556
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:55,039
deep learning and AI, do you believe

557
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:59,240
that hardening your authentication for

558
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:59,240
your endpoints is necessary?

559
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:05,840
Uh, and I would I wouldn't see um a

560
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:08,799
reason why

561
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:11,039
why why it wouldn't be kind like like

562
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:12,320
the unfortunately there's this like

563
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:14,320
insecurities there's this kind of like

564
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,559
generic principle that like attacks only

565
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:19,039
get better. So if there's an attack that

566
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:21,600
doesn't rely on on on on deep learning

567
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:23,600
on AI and that can uh uh harm your

568
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:29,039
endpoints then this attack will will

569
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:30,640
continue to exist and uh uh uh so yes I

570
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:33,880
would believe that it's it's still very

571
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,880
much relevant.

572
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:44,240
>> Great. And uh one one final question. Um

573
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:46,320
it it appears that uh the cryptographic

574
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,200
methods that we're talking about here

575
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:51,120
today are relatively new. Um do you

576
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,559
believe that there is a particular

577
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:57,919
epicenter of research for for crypto?

578
00:24:54,559 --> 00:25:00,480
>> Well, MIT is kind of the birthplace of

579
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:03,039
modern crypto and Madar was trained by

580
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,720
one of the uh founders so he could speak

581
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:08,480
to that.

582
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:10,799
Well, uh there many premier institutions

583
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:14,720
and I'm happy happy to agree that like

584
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:16,640
MIT is um is one of them and like to to

585
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,880
answer like the substantive portion of

586
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,760
the question which about can like u many

587
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,600
of those things are indeed newer like uh

588
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:26,159
say like practical zero knowledge proofs

589
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:29,200
or practical polycomomorphic encryption

590
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,400
has only taken off in in the past decade

591
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,400
versus like other branches of

592
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,240
cryptography we've seen in industry for

593
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:37,919
for many decades.

594
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:41,760
uh but um also there is kind of like a

595
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:44,000
the field uh is has developed like

596
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:46,080
maturity and there's like a lot of

597
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,240
investment in those technologies. So

598
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,840
they are really progressing quite

599
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,799
heavily and like many of those things is

600
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,159
kind like it's not uh 10 years away

601
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:56,720
technology. It was 10 years away

602
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:59,840
technology 10 years ago. So

603
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:03,360
>> great. Well, we have to move on now. So,

604
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:06,960
thank you both uh Dan and Madars uh for

605
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,960
uh presenting this morning.
