2
00:00:06,279 --> 00:00:11,240
morning everyone my name is ABI yadav uh

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:14,799
I'm the co-founder CEO of a company

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:17,320
called I customer uh I customer is a

5
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,760
decision intelligence company missone

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:23,720
grad

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:26,199
2013 um so I'm going to talk about a

8
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,080
problem I mean we all have heard about

9
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:31,679
generative Ai and lot of contents

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,480
getting creative but I look at this or

11
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,920
we some of us look at this very

12
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:39,079
differently we seeing in go to market

13
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,239
GTM is go to market so go to market and

14
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:44,920
marketing what is really the evolution

15
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:46,840
happening is that there was a big

16
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,879
machine on the creative side which is

17
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:52,719
generating content video images and a

18
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:55,719
whole bunch but now what you're actually

19
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:58,120
seeing is actually where compan is

20
00:00:55,719 --> 00:01:00,039
really struggling is how to deliver that

21
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:02,719
message to the right person right place

22
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:05,600
the right time in a very individualized

23
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:09,320
way not a spray and prey way which is

24
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:11,759
kind of working um and this kind of

25
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,920
misalignment of thinking is actually

26
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:17,240
costing

27
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:20,600
companies um a two trillion like fit you

28
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:23,360
know which is basically primarily led by

29
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:25,880
like data fragmentation wrong identity

30
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:29,640
wrong matching wrong message wrong

31
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:31,720
timing one size fitall segments whole

32
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,920
bunch a thing while marketing keeps

33
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,840
thinking that the more campaign they

34
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,360
could churn they could engage more

35
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,960
people which is kind of creating the

36
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:44,960
false positive uh signal Loop effect so

37
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:47,719
um this is also the challenge because

38
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,399
you know nowadays the goto Market is not

39
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:51,360
just marketing it's kind of the whole

40
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:55,039
customer experience between sales

41
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:58,360
marketing customer success you know

42
00:01:55,039 --> 00:02:01,159
personalization um so how we trying to

43
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:03,600
tackle this is really about taking

44
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:06,520
agentic AI approach which is basically

45
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,039
to manage your data chaos the whole

46
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,599
fragmentation and sort of you know

47
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,560
having these three pillar of our

48
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:15,560
platform called match decide and

49
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,680
activate which is basically creates this

50
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:21,400
what we call a decision optimization

51
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:24,040
Loop more under the hood the way it

52
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:27,760
works is we are a composable platform

53
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:30,239
for multi- agentic system uh pre-train

54
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,319
it sits where your data is so could be

55
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,560
an on-prem data it could be on any of

56
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:38,280
your data warehouse we see ourself as a

57
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:41,120
brain between your data warehouse and

58
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:44,440
all things about which send out you know

59
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:47,319
campaigns or act DEC Mark de like

60
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:50,080
activation you know basically with of

61
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:53,159
course like human in the loop but a lot

62
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:58,840
of like repeatable task more in an

63
00:02:53,159 --> 00:03:01,840
augmented way and uh so so think of this

64
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:04,080
as a like a GTM assistant working for

65
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,159
the marketing business team which is

66
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,200
continuously monitoring the signal the

67
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:12,280
data and things like that basically like

68
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:16,280
helping um you know with the business

69
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:18,400
team we we see this as a you know uh

70
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:21,480
intersection of like human expertise

71
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:25,760
with agent Ai and customer data specific

72
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:28,239
use case uh because of this AI decision

73
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,879
engine um you could do customer life

74
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,519
cycle orchestration at scale I mean

75
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:35,000
we've all seen this you know people have

76
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:37,760
been doing segment LED thing I mean us

77
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,080
election is a classic example where how

78
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,000
segments do not work today and

79
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,040
everything we all are individual

80
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,400
everyone has his own perspective own

81
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:49,000
time so that moment is finally here like

82
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,640
oneon-one personalization which we're

83
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,879
enabling in production today same with

84
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:56,640
that targeting inside planning and

85
00:03:53,879 --> 00:04:00,200
things very quick case study for a large

86
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:02,519
cpg retail brand we've been working with

87
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:06,840
um so it not just tells you looking at

88
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:08,720
your data what is really missing or why

89
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,760
it missed but also do the root cause

90
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,439
analysis and suggest you very

91
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,280
prescriptively which are the new

92
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:16,519
segments which are the new campaign or

93
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:19,160
what what you should be doing classic

94
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:23,080
result we already have are in large

95
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:25,600
