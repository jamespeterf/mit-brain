1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,960
and uh I'll try to uh leave you with uh

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,360
what ultimately is uh a simple

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:11,280
perspective but one that stuck with me

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:13,759
on how I think new technologies can be

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,760
inserted into manufacturing going

6
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,760
forward and hopefully make manufacturing

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,160
more productive more efficient more

8
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:23,400
sustainable uh in the context of

9
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,720
specific Industries and use cases which

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,039
I think it's always comes down to so the

11
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:30,560
title is very broad scaling digital

12
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:32,960
production and it'll be uh laced with

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,320
some examples from our work here at MIT

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,200
from entrepreneurial Ventures and from

15
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,640
as mentioned in the introduction our new

16
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:44,480
initiative focused on manufacturing

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:47,879
across MIT uh I'd like to begin uh with

18
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:50,960
a question uh and that is uh you know

19
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:52,680
imagine uh how you would describe the

20
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,120
manufacturing of something as simple as

21
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,960
a Lego brick I love Legos have small

22
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,480
kids there's Legos everywhere at home uh

23
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,120
and uh you know it's it's arguably the

24
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:07,280
simplest possible product a single

25
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:11,119
component a single process yet uh Legos

26
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:13,159
are extremely precise uh and my answer

27
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,960
to the question is that it's it's really

28
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:19,200
hard to explain how to make it right

29
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,360
it's not just about the design the

30
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,840
geometry right you could make the cad

31
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,000
model and transfer that to the uh

32
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:30,360
production house but it's about encoding

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,600
the information needed to achieve the

34
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,680
product's performance right the

35
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:37,880
dimensions and tolerances and surface

36
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:41,560
finish and so on uh and that's really

37
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:43,479
hard I will make several uh mentions of

38
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,000
various types of AI tools and how I

39
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:49,040
believe along with the theme of this uh

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,439
meeting they can be very powerful in

41
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,799
accelerating uh product Innovation and

42
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:57,799
the process from uh concept to finished

43
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:01,479
goods but it'll be a long time until we

44
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:04,079
have the full capability to automate the

45
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:08,360
description of making something even as

46
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:12,080
simple as a Lego brick and uh like uh

47
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:13,959
many of you I'm sure uh uh you know I I

48
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,800
feel that manufacturing has transformed

49
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:18,519
enormously over uh you know uh history

50
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,360
in over recent decades right in 100

51
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:24,480
years we've gone from making automobiles

52
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,720
like Henry Ford's uh assembly line did

53
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:30,480
in the 1920s uh to you know not not just

54
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:32,400
making more and more uh efficient

55
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,800
vehicles and electric vehicles but you

56
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,200
know making the incredibly sophisticated

57
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,800
products that keep us connected today so

58
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,760
you know imagine that Lego brick and and

59
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,319
now imagine this right how does a

60
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,560
company such as Apple or Google or you

61
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:51,519
name it uh organized all the information

62
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:53,120
needed to execute uh manufacturing of

63
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,000
one of its products that's a huge

64
00:02:53,120 --> 00:03:00,040
competitive Advantage also is a huge

65
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,680
thing to manage uh and I feel that you

66
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:06,599
know to to a simplification one of the

67
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:09,760
tradeoffs that uh We've made as a world

68
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:13,720
uh in uh driving manufacturing forward

69
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:18,080
driving products forward has been the

70
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:22,360
decentralization of Knowledge from uh

71
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:28,080
more decades ago single firms where the

72
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:30,080
knowledge and the resources to design

73
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,200
develop the process and produce work

74
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,159
Under One Roof you know whether it be

75
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:38,480
one building or one company across to

76
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:42,040
more distributed understanding right

77
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:45,840
from small Supply chains to know simple

78
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:49,840
cartoon here but long gnarly distributed

79
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:52,480
fragile Supply chains and with that you

80
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,599
know you can imagine again all the

81
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,519
knowledge and complexity it takes to

82
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:57,959
basically get anything made right it's

83
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:00,079
one thing to say I can make this this

84
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:02,680
way but another thing entirely to Source

85
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:04,680
it and maintain reliability of sourcing

86
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,079
and so on and so forth so while this is

87
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,439
not a talk about Supply chains uh

88
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:13,280
hopefully that's a motivating Point as

89
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:15,680
to uh you know one of the big challenges

90
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,519
I see that you know the world needs to

91
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:21,600
address in improving the productivity

92
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:26,040
and efficiency and sustainability of

93
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:28,000
manufacturing but also one that is in

94
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,199
some ways I think starting to limit the

95
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,240
rate and Pace at which we can develop

96
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:35,120
new and better products and that is the

97
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:39,880
increasing complexity uh required to

98
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:42,240
execute manufacturing at scale so my uh

99
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,720
general question for the talk is how can

100
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,960
we think about collapsing this

101
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,039
complexity while continuing to uh

102
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:51,960
innovate as organizations innovate as

103
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:54,560
Nations innovate as a globe uh and the

104
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:57,440
uh end point uh or you could say

105
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:02,440
backbone of the talk is this three plane

106
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:05,600
chart uh and uh this is uh quite you

107
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:10,440
know a high level but my idea with this

108
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:13,639
chart is that we can think of the

109
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:18,319
relationship between the design of a

110
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:21,000
product and the end point of production

111
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:24,120
not just through a lengthy chain of

112
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,479
steps but through in the future

113
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,240
relationships between the inherent

114
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,199
capabilities of the production

115
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:34,039
infrastructure we have

116
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:36,680
the machines the people the capabilities

117
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:39,680
in our factories and our supply chains

118
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:42,720
uh arguably as as a foundation we can

119
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:45,240
think of the capabilities we have for

120
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,680
product and process design at a top

121
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:50,840
level right where the inputs and the

122
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:53,880
ideas and the constraints come and by

123
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:57,039
some important interaction we will be

124
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:59,880
able to develop new computational tools

125
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,680
including tools of multim modal

126
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,160
artificial intelligence working with

127
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,440
different types of data right

128
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:08,520
manufacturing involves multi- modes of

129
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:10,599
data that can help Stitch the two

130
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,400
together I'm not here to say like we're

131
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:14,240
on the verge of solving that problem I

132
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,160
said earlier it'll take a long time to

133
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,160
even explain uh uh how to make that Lego

134
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,960
brick but that there are some exciting

135
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,360
and important advances that I think can

136
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:26,080
be very meaningful at certain places

137
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,880
along that chain and that there's uh

138
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:31,160
examples at all levels of the chart that

139
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,840
I've woven in into the rest of the

140
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:37,479
presentation uh so beginning with this

141
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:41,280
ground floor uh I see first of all that

142
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:43,840
there's uh an increasing tool set of

143
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,319
capabilities that are bringing new

144
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:49,319
processes new configurations of

145
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,800
automation uh uh into manufacturing

146
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:53,680
operations or making these tools

147
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,639
available to manufacturers and again it

148
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,080
depends on the specific context the type

149
00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:00,120
of product that your organization makes

150
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,440
or sources or whether you're software

151
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:06,319
company or a hardware Product Company or

152
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:10,000
something else but examples include for

153
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:11,560
instance ways to use robotics to uh form

154
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,039
sheet metal right Sheet Metal

155
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:17,120
Manufacturing at large volume uh AKA

156
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:19,960
stamping right is done using large you

157
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,720
know fixed tooling fixed dieses like how

158
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:24,840
you make hoods of cars and uh those

159
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,319
kinds of components at large volume it's

160
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:30,960
small volume sheet metal forming while

161
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:35,560
it's a vast industry uh is is uh

162
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:38,440
basically a craft an art of craft uh so

163
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:40,319
uh uh among others there's a company in

164
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,720
California called Machina Labs that's

165
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,879
developing robotic automation for doing

166
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:48,319
small volume sheet metal forming one of

167
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:51,520
these uh uh pieces uh on that

168
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:54,680
foundational base that I mentioned uh

169
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:57,400
there are many local companies uh in the

170
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:59,520
Boston area developing new kinds of 3D

171
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,479
printing Technologies I'll talk more

172
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,000
about 3D printing in a minute uh this

173
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:05,319
one which you may know is called inkbit

174
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,120
it's a spin out of mit's uh computer

175
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:10,680
science and AI lab Professor matus group

176
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,520
and it has a unique capability to print

177
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:15,039
uh multiple materials with very very

178
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:18,080
high resolution and so this is uh uh

179
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:21,319
literally a robotic hand with pneumatic

180
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:23,639
lines and with effectively uh rubbery

181
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:25,840
tendons printed in in one piece the

182
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:28,560
kinds of things that like we we we don't

183
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,680
even know how to design for yet uh but

184
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,719
that capability is one of these uh

185
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,599
foundational pieces that'll find its way

186
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:37,519
into into product

187
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:41,159
workflows another company close to MIT

188
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:44,080
is called tulip uh they build uh uh

189
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:47,240
software and and and digital interfaces

190
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,959
for production workers so production

191
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:53,080
supervisors can uh monitor data from the

192
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:56,000
factory floor can uh develop apps that

193
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:58,760
provide uh things like uh heads up work

194
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
instructions and also can identify how

195
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:03,480
to improve improve uh you know the

196
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,480
productivity of factory floor operations

197
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:10,160
and so on and so forth many examples

198
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:12,640
like this uh some years ago uh uh I had

199
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:16,079
the opportunity with a former student uh

200
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,800
of mine here uh in uh our master's

201
00:09:16,079 --> 00:09:20,440
program in manufacturing to spin out a

202
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:23,320
company with interest in industrial

203
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:25,360
scale metal 3D printing uh AKA additive

204
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:28,079
manufacturing and we co-founded a

205
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:31,680
company called Vulcan forms that now has

206
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:34,440
uh 150,000 foot factory uh just west of

207
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,839
Boston doing metal 3D printing at

208
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,000
industrial scale uh and this has been

209
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:40,600
about a 10year journey to this point and

210
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,120
we're just getting into scaled

211
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:47,920
production but it's an example of uh uh

212
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:51,000
a idea to bring a new metal 3D printing

213
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:53,680
technology to a factory scale and do it

214
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,600
not in the way of selling 3D printers to

215
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:59,399
the marketplace but the company designs

216
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:01,600
and builds its own 3D printing equipment

217
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:04,600
like the machines you see here and then

218
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,720
does production as a service uh not

219
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:09,240
unlike a contract manufacturer but one

220
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:12,000
that is focused on producing high value

221
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:14,040
metal medic metal components for a

222
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,519
variety of large Industries and large

223
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:19,279
customers and I'm not here to

224
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:21,200
necessarily say uh here's the details of

225
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,360
the company but use an example of what

226
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,440
the company has developed as another one

227
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,680
of these foundational pieces where I

228
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,120
feel there's important attributes of how

229
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,399
this process operates that are key to

230
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,640
this kind of three-level uh vision of

231
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,160
digital production in the future so for

232
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:40,240
instance we can use metal 3D printing to

233
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:43,800
fabricate components of jet engines from

234
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:47,399
small to large uh you would normally be

235
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:49,959
uh uh casting a Billet of raw material

236
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:52,560
forging it perhaps multiple times and

237
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:54,720
then Machining the component often a

238
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,639
very uh uh expensive and hard to work

239
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,680
with material and here we can print the

240
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:02,560
finished component in one go this is

241
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:05,519
about uh 600 mm in diameter and

242
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:08,160
representative of the size of a small

243
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:11,079
format jet engine the uh printing

244
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:13,040
process uh like most 3D printing

245
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:14,480
capabilities has a build plate so you

246
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,639
print the part or you print multiple

247
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,000
parts and then you slice the part off

248
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:21,600
and you can do finished postprocessing

249
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,160
the power of this technology and you

250
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,320
know 3D printing is one of these uh the

251
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,959
these uh production processes overall is

252
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:32,120
its flexibility right to a limit if you

253
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:34,000
change the code for the uh machine you

254
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:37,480
can print something entirely different

255
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,519
so on the same printer uh you can create

256
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:43,680
uh arrays of components of medical

257
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:47,760
implants these are uh the cup component

258
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:49,839
of hip implants uh that are implanted in

259
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,560
the human body and the reason why these

260
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,200
are 3D printed is that you can create a

261
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,120
three-dimensional lattice structure on

262
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,160
the surface uh so there's some

263
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,560
applications of you could say 3D

264
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:03,120
printing or more automated digital

265
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,959
Manufacturing in general where you can

266
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,399
you you make what you make today but you

267
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:09,480
might make it uh you know uh more cost

268
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:11,639
effectively or in a smaller volume with

269
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,079
higher accuracy here's a case where you

270
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:15,120
making something that you cannot

271
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:16,760
otherwise make because of this unique

272
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,560
structure on the surface that improves

273
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:22,680
the rate of integration with the bone

274
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:25,000
and what's powerful about these emerging

275
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:27,360
uh uh types of 3D printers and and you

276
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,120
could say more automated equipment

277
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,600
overall is the ability to gather data

278
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:34,800
from the manufacturing process uh so

279
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:37,959
this is my own kind of you know picture

280
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:40,880
to cartoon but as the printing process

281
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:43,880
is happening the machines are able to

282
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:46,880
collect data uh uh from each layer

283
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:49,519
printing happens layer by layer and use

284
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,839
that to construct uh you know uh using

285
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,000
the broad term digital twin effectively

286
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,320
a digital twin of the component

287
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,440
representing the data from the printing

288
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:02,279
process and therefore you can train

289
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:05,000
these models to detect anomalies uh that

290
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:07,519
can then indicate whether you had a

291
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:11,480
component of of of suitable quality or

292
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:14,240
you have defects in your print uh and uh

293
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:16,519
in order to bring this process to scale

294
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:20,760
uh we not only had to develop the

295
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:22,720
machines uh uh and the inprocess sensing

296
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:25,240
but develop a whole Suite of software

297
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,199
that allows us to virtually plan the

298
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,360
printing process and we can go all the

299
00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:31,440
way to Machining at the end but because

300
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,519
for most components uh if you're

301
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,600
familiar with 3D printing you not only

302
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,560
have to print it and remove it and clean

303
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,320
it up and heat treat it to get the right

304
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:42,440
properties and metallic micr structure

305
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,440
but you often want to do some finishing

306
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:46,560
operations such as Machining to clean up

307
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:49,199
certain surfaces so now a different

308
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:51,480
component an example of uh a watch

309
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:53,440
housing uh this is just a demonstration

310
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,279
geometry but representative of real

311
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,880
applications things like smart watches

312
00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:00,519
that can be made at Large Scale uh you

313
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:03,560
print not not one or 100 but you print

314
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:05,279
about 600 at a time on a build plate uh

315
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:07,600
and to get to the point of the finished

316
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:10,600
parts that look like this the software

317
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,959
chain uh involves virtual planning of

318
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:15,440
the process simulation of the 3D print

319
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:18,040
that involves laser power and a lot of

320
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,959
heat and energy uh and then the

321
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,759
collection of data during the printing

322
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:24,639
process and the creation of that digital

323
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:26,639
twin that can be match to a 3D scan and

324
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,240
this is of course very far accelerated

325
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,839
but also shows the integration of

326
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,120
Downstream manufacturing planning uh

327
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:35,720
virtualizing the Machining process and

328
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,240
virtualizing the Metrology process and

329
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:40,560
that uh full kind of end to-end digital

330
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:43,120
threat is really critical to Bringing

331
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:47,959
these digitally digital first processes

332
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:50,680
to scale and uh uh also uh all of the

333
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:52,480
printers are uh controlled centrally

334
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,880
right uh you saw the picture of the

335
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,720
factory it looked pretty empty it's not

336
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,079
that there aren't humans in the in the

337
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:02,160
process it's not that it's completely

338
00:14:59,079 --> 00:15:03,800
lights out you need people to uh to

339
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,040
interface with the machines load them

340
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:08,120
unload them maintain them but the

341
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:10,040
monitoring of the printing process once

342
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:12,279
the machines are running is entirely

343
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:14,279
centralized and this is very powerful

344
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:16,279
because we can use software that goes

345
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:18,600
alongside the printing process collects

346
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:20,680
that data to look for Flaws to look for

347
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:24,560
defects and therefore improve the

348
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:28,519
process over time so this is one example

349
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:30,440
of uh uh many applications of 3D

350
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:33,360
printing as an emerging production

351
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:35,959
technology from Aviation and space to

352
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,240
medical devices to consumer goods

353
00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:40,720
including the shoes of the the the soles

354
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,000
of the shoes that I'm uh uh wearing

355
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,480
today made by Adidas uh but I don't mean

356
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,480
to imply that you know this is uh

357
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,000
anywhere near a significant fraction of

358
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:52,120
manufacturing in fact 3D printing as a

359
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,079
whole is like less than a drop in the

360
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:56,639
bucket right if you think of global

361
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:59,800
manufacturing as a big bucket of value

362
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:03,160
created right 15 or so trillion dollar

363
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:05,440
uh what what 3D printing can do as one

364
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:08,600
specific process which has many

365
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:11,920
challenges in cost and and scaling is

366
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:13,759
ultimately only one one one maybe maybe

367
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,160
much larger drop in that bucket but not

368
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,519
a significant fraction of it but I think

369
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,519
it's reflective of this digital first

370
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:23,240
mindset that we need when we think of

371
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:25,360
how to design processes design software

372
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:28,120
to interface with machines and

373
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,399
automation whether they be uh existing

374
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,399
Technologies of which there's a lot and

375
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:35,000
you know those technologies will survive

376
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:38,279
for a long time uh and the insertion of

377
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:42,240
these new emerging Technologies and

378
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:44,440
processes in my own research uh uh some

379
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:47,680
examples are one the development of new

380
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:49,360
Metals New Alloys uh for processes such

381
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,199
as metal 3D printing and also

382
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,360
conventional metal uh processes uh so a

383
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:56,360
former member of my research group mahad

384
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:59,240
who's now a faculty member at Carnegie

385
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:02,319
melan University developed a computation

386
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:05,600
pipeline uh to discover new aluminum

387
00:17:02,319 --> 00:17:07,839
Alloys uh that can benefit from the

388
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,799
unique conditions that exist in 3D

389
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:12,079
printing when you're 3D printing with

390
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:14,280
Metals you typically use a laser to

391
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:16,919
rapidly heat and therefore rapidly cool

392
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:18,480
the metal and that imparts unique

393
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:21,319
conditions and also unique challenges

394
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,480
for the stability of the metal itself uh

395
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:25,360
to make the long story short she

396
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,120
developed a pipeline that could look at

397
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,960
hundreds of thousands of combinations of

398
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:31,600
different elements also look at the cost

399
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,600
C and the carbon footprint implied by

400
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:37,799
their use and then predict compositions

401
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:42,080
that would be uh able to be printed uh

402
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:43,640
to be 3D printed and uh uh that had

403
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,799
attractive properties and we came up

404
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:49,679
with a family of Alloys that have higher

405
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:51,799
uh strength uh than uh existing known

406
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,919
structural aluminum Alloys and also can

407
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:56,360
withstand higher temperatures in use and

408
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:59,600
we're exploring commercial avenues for

409
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:02,200
that uh another way that we can think of

410
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:05,000
bringing these Technologies to to scale

411
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:07,760
is that uh you

412
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,679
know manufacturing is not just something

413
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,400
that happens in a factory right

414
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:14,440
manufacturing can happen on site or

415
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,039
there's many applications where you

416
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:19,120
could say a mode of manufacturing could

417
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:21,880
be used for repair on site and we have a

418
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:24,120
very exciting ongoing project with

419
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:26,760
collaborators at the University of M

420
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:28,039
Massachusetts uh as well as support from

421
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:31,280
the Massachusetts Department of

422
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:35,200
Transportation to look at a kind of 3D

423
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:38,240
printing for Onsite repair of uh damaged

424
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,679
uh and corroded aging infrastructure so

425
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,440
I know we shouldn't take pictures while

426
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:44,760
we're driving but I must admit I took

427
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,520
this picture driving slowly on I95 going

428
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:49,080
north if you are from Boston you know

429
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:50,679
the 9590 intersection and if you've

430
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,799
driven by there recently you know that

431
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:56,720
they're replacing this bridge with a new

432
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:59,000
one because the bridge is so rusted and

433
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:02,679
corroded this is probably one of the

434
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,720
most uh uh corroded aged bridges in the

435
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:06,559
state of Massachusetts and you know we

436
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,520
don't want anything to happen to this

437
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:12,960
this this bridge and Service uh so the

438
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:16,280
motivation for our work is uh you know

439
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,280
our infrastructure needs help and uh uh

440
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,960
actually there's many opportunities not

441
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:24,600
just in bridges but you know ships and

442
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:26,880
other things for repair of uh physical

443
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:29,159
structures before it's too late before a

444
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,640
structure needs to be replaced so again

445
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:34,559
to make the long story short we're

446
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:39,200
developing a digital thread that allows

447
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:41,760
uh uh one to scan uh say Bridge beams

448
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:46,720
this is led by our collaborators at at

449
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:49,679
UMass uh uh predict uh to what extent

450
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,679
the strength the uh properties would be

451
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,240
improved if you added material in that

452
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:56,880
place using a simulation a computational

453
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,760
model and then develop the technology

454
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:03,240
that we're hoping to bring into the

455
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:05,159
field to do on-site repair and you know

456
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:08,159
it will take time to do that it will

457
00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:10,760
require a a fairly intricate setup but

458
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:13,320
we believe it's way more efficient and

459
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:16,000
cost effective than replacing a whole

460
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:17,440
bridge but is also potentially more

461
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,400
efficient and cost-effective than

462
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,320
traditional methods of repair that

463
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:24,919
involve closing the road cutting out

464
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,559
beams bolting on plates and things like

465
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:28,960
that and I feel there's a large

466
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,880
opportunity in thinking about how these

467
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,559
new you could say manufacturing

468
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:36,360
processes can also be used on site uh

469
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:39,080
for repair uh there's probably also many

470
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:41,240
applications in a railway infrastructure

471
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:42,799
from repairing rails to repairing wheels

472
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:46,039
and so on and so

473
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:47,679
forth so now let me go back to the

474
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:50,159
highle picture and just jump through a

475
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:52,679
few other examples not from my own work

476
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,960
but from other work at MIT and from the

477
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:57,400
broader community of things that I find

478
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,520
exciting and uh of course the three-

479
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,960
plane chart here I talked about the

480
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:05,200
bottom the production infrastructure and

481
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:07,200
now I'll talk a bit about the top the uh

482
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:10,480
tools we have for product and process

483
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:12,960
design right of course like design is a

484
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,360
complex activity design means many

485
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,600
things uh uh there's different processes

486
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:20,840
for dining different types of products

487
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:24,440
uh and so on and so forth but another uh

488
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:28,279
uh capability that I believe is kind of

489
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:32,120
the fringes uh is you know if we have

490
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:36,159
more more computational tools at our

491
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:38,159
disposal uh more ability to scale the

492
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:43,039
information that we bring into the

493
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:45,600
design process right uh it's not

494
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:48,080
necessarily the case that products look

495
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:50,360
or behave like in the future the same

496
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:53,440
way they've come to look or behave

497
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:56,559
because you know it's the way we expect

498
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:59,480
them to look or that this door hook for

499
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:01,520
example a very simple product obviously

500
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:03,679
is made this way because it you know is

501
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,960
formed out of sheet metal uh and there's

502
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:09,120
you know that that's one of the big

503
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:14,200
reasons uh so uh among uh these emerging

504
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:17,799
tools are methods to take not uh a kind

505
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:20,640
of inductive design uh but take a design

506
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:23,279
problem and specify the constraints and

507
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,919
then allow the computer to develop a

508
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:29,240
geometry develop a design that fits

509
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:31,840
those constraints uh you may know

510
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:34,720
what uh has been long called topology

511
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,880
optimization this simulation even is

512
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,320
from 2013 so not showing a new

513
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:42,200
capability but shows the basic idea that

514
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:44,480
if I start with a virtual block of

515
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:46,520
material and I say here's where I want

516
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,200
the hook to attach it's got a hook on

517
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:52,760
the door here or and and hold the the

518
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:56,520
clothing here uh tell me what the

519
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:58,600
optimal use of material is and as

520
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:01,039
computing power becomes more available

521
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:02,559
we bring in more considerations like the

522
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:04,120
carbon footprint of the material the

523
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:06,080
cost of the material we can make more

524
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:10,120
sophisticated choices and apply these to

525
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:13,240
more sophisticated scenarios and certain

526
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:15,679
emergent examples from the marketplace

527
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:18,840
include taking similar approaches and

528
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:21,279
applying them to for example Hydraulics

529
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:26,200
uh this is an example hydraulic manifold

530
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:29,000
where the conduits for the uh fluid are

531
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:30,840
uh optimized to reduce the pressure drop

532
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,880
and maintain the routing traditionally

533
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:34,760
when you manufacture hydraulic manifolds

534
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,320
you take blocks of metal and you drill

535
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:39,720
orthogonal holes perpendicular holes and

536
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:41,320
and that's a constraint but to reduce

537
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,679
the pressure drop to improve the

538
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,919
performance you actually want a much

539
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:47,240
more kind of organic distribution and

540
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:50,720
this is enabled by those kinds of design

541
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:53,320
tools but adapted to uh uh routing fluid

542
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,720
flow and simulating fluid flow and

543
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:57,600
incidentally by 3D printing there will

544
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:00,279
be future applications in physical

545
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:04,840
infrastructure uh large beams concrete

546
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:07,240
trusses Etc and uh uh in in a large part

547
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:10,080
using these kinds of Technologies

548
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:11,799
several years ago GE uh decided they

549
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,039
would clean sheet the design of one of

550
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:16,520
their jet engines uh and they discovered

551
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:18,960
that they could design it such that if

552
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:20,279
they 3D printed large components of it

553
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,720
they could reduce the number of

554
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:26,240
components significantly and uh with one

555
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:28,919
particular part of the engine uh defined

556
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:31,440
here as the mid-frame structure

557
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:34,480
they could reduce 300 components to a

558
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:37,720
single component and imagine the

559
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:40,240
advantage right in in uh other aspects

560
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:42,120
of the complexity of manufacturing and

561
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:45,320
supply chain sourcing and so on so there

562
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:46,960
are examples where uh you could say

563
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:48,720
let's let's do a rethink we don't have

564
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,000
to commit to this new technology but

565
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,360
let's think of what would be possible if

566
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,240
we started from scratch and then think

567
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:58,559
of how your organization would get there

568
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,399
if you determine it's a good business

569
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:02,320
case and a good reason to bring it into

570
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:05,960
your into your

571
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:08,279
portfolio and our colleagues uh at MIT

572
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:11,640
this is Professor F ahed in mechanical

573
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:14,320
engineering are developing what I

574
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:17,720
believe arguably the next generation of

575
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:20,279
tools that connect more powerful Ai and

576
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:24,960
machine learning capabilities uh this is

577
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:27,880
a to me a really inspiring example uh of

578
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:29,200
how you could uh connect uh uh

579
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:32,880
generative

580
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:36,559
uh design approaches uh uh to

581
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:40,360
Performance models for say the design

582
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:42,919
and uh configuration of something uh of

583
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:44,919
widespread utility such as a bicycle the

584
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:48,679
idea is that by putting a few different

585
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:51,039
model capabilities together you can uh

586
00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:53,520
specify I would like a road racing

587
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:56,399
bicycle that has this certain style you

588
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:58,520
could input your own right uh you know

589
00:25:56,399 --> 00:26:00,120
height and you know maybe Poss

590
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:04,039
preferences or you could sit on an

591
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:07,360
example bicycle in a store uh and then

592
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:09,679
the uh uh software would come up with a

593
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:12,000
number of design Alternatives based on a

594
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:14,200
simulation of perhaps the aerodynamics

595
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,559
as you are writing and this is just one

596
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:19,000
example uh but I think it's indicative

597
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:22,919
of how we'll see an ability to close the

598
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:26,159
loop between design and some amount of

599
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:28,679
encoded uh performance uh going forward

600
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:32,039
in the future

601
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:34,960
and I'm also uh really intrigued uh

602
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:40,120
about a number of startup companies uh

603
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:43,080
that are developing uh tools to automate

604
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:45,120
uh the steps in the design to

605
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:47,600
manufacturing workflow that are

606
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,919
traditionally very labor intensive I'm

607
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:52,279
not talking yet about like Factory floor

608
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,799
operations but imagine coming up with

609
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:59,279
assembly instructions to put an assembly

610
00:26:54,799 --> 00:27:02,480
of components together or checking that

611
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:04,240
uh uh you know engineering drawings if

612
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:08,080
not generating the drawings in the first

613
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:09,279
place uh follow certain standards uh

614
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,200
such as you know standards of the

615
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:13,880
maritime industry and one company I met

616
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:16,760
recently is called der they're on the

617
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:19,360
west coast there's another MIT uh spin

618
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:22,360
out called Foundation llm working on

619
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:25,480
automated work instructions uh also a

620
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:28,559
spin out of the uh uh Cale the Cs and AI

621
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:30,120
Lab at MIT and this is where we start to

622
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:32,000
get to this kind of connective tissue in

623
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:36,600
the middle I think we're starting to see

624
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,600
more exciting possibilities uh

625
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:44,399
emerge so uh now it's just two I didn't

626
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,720
cut out the middle one but just to say

627
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:47,960
that you know to kind of bring the

628
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:49,559
points together you know let's think

629
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:53,039
about how these new capabilities in

630
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:55,360
product and process design uh kind of uh

631
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:58,159
don't necessarily require but could be

632
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:00,880
enabled by or could enable new kinds of

633
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:03,159
uction capabilities right uh data being

634
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,600
a thread between the two and at the

635
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:08,080
bottom we have arguably digital first

636
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:10,240
process techn Technologies and ways that

637
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:12,679
we can combine human knowledge with

638
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:15,240
machine instructions uh and at the top

639
00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:16,880
we have uh the opportunity for a new

640
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:19,880
generation of design tools that are

641
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:23,159
manufacturing aware not just able to

642
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:25,799
explore you know massive geometric or

643
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:28,679
configurational design spaces and in the

644
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:32,399
middle uh you know this idea of

645
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:34,919
uh ai ai models that combine uh

646
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:37,039
multimodal data right the this is a

647
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:39,360
broad area of development in in the

648
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:42,039
field of AI models not just for

649
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:44,559
manufacturing but for generating images

650
00:28:42,039 --> 00:28:47,039
and working with video and uh training

651
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:48,960
robots and so on and so forth but I do

652
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:52,279
believe there's a big opportunity and

653
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:55,480
need to develop manufacturing tailored

654
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:57,720
uh AI models that can learn on you know

655
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:00,440
geometry look at representation of

656
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:03,279
component on and understand you know uh

657
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:06,600
how can you screen for manufacturability

658
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:09,200
or can you uh uh report within a certain

659
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:12,440
category of component whether a design

660
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:15,200
is manufacturable or not similarly uh

661
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:17,519
working through uh reduced order

662
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:20,279
simulations of certain manufacturing

663
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:23,600
processes to then feed back uh to the

664
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:26,240
design and then my second Point here uh

665
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:28,799
figuring out how we can securely

666
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:31,480
abstract data among stakeholders

667
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:33,399
uh and we're kicking off uh along with

668
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:36,360
our manufacturing at MIT effort that

669
00:29:33,399 --> 00:29:38,799
I'll mention in a moment uh a project to

670
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:41,760
Think Through how we could develop a set

671
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:43,679
of distributed AI models to support

672
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,720
manufacturing uh you know take for

673
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:49,440
instance uh using uh AI tools to

674
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,480
optimize a wellestablished manufacturing

675
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,720
process if not one such as 3D printing

676
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:56,360
such as Machining or sheet metal forming

677
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:58,039
or think about you know optimizing the

678
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:00,760
safety of a manufacturing process

679
00:29:58,039 --> 00:30:03,480
process in general it's clear that uh

680
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:07,080
such a uh model could benefit from a lot

681
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:08,799
of data and whether it's one company or

682
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:10,320
a large number of companies we need to

683
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:13,279
figure out how to bring that data

684
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:16,880
together in a way that can be informed

685
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:19,200
by global models but can be tailored to

686
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,240
specific needs of certain processes or

687
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,559
certain uh companies and so we're very

688
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:26,919
excited to bring some bright people some

689
00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:29,720
faculty and students uh to uh bring more

690
00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:33,240
detail to this picture going forward and

691
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:36,399
in a way this idea or uh what'll be my

692
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:39,120
next point was inspired uh by Morris

693
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:41,760
Chang so Morris Chang is the founder of

694
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:44,840
tsmc Taiwan semiconductor manufacturing

695
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:48,000
company and he came to MIT we uh were so

696
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:50,519
fortunate to host him uh uh just under a

697
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,360
year ago and he gave a wonderful talk

698
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:56,159
which you can you can find online uh on

699
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:59,039
YouTube and uh he talked about the

700
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:01,480
history of tsmc and the history of the

701
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:05,440
semiconductor industry right and how

702
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:08,559
tsmc has now become right in a way the

703
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:11,760
world semiconductor Foundry and uh one

704
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:13,519
thing he said uh stuck with me the most

705
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:16,039
and it was right at this moment where I

706
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:21,440
took this picture he he put up this

707
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:24,159
chart of uh it away the semiconductor

708
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,639
you know supply chain value chain right

709
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:28,960
from research and development to

710
00:31:25,639 --> 00:31:31,639
fabrication to packaging Etc and he said

711
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,880
tsmc did just one thing obviously did a

712
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:35,760
lot of things but he said they added the

713
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:38,320
red line he said we added the red line

714
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:41,679
we figured out how you could

715
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:43,639
bring knowledge and physical capability

716
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:46,919
together in a way that it would be

717
00:31:43,639 --> 00:31:49,320
offered to the world and it would enable

718
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:52,200
a next generation of product Innovation

719
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:54,880
and now we know many of the world's most

720
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:57,919
valuable companies that make products

721
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:02,399
that rely on semiconductors you know uh

722
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:07,760
rely on the foundaries tsmc included as

723
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:09,720
their production resource and uh that

724
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,399
you know leads me to kind of an open

725
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,480
question like as we think of

726
00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:16,080
manufacturing being more flexible in the

727
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:17,279
future what are the ways in which in

728
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,799
different Industries for different

729
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:21,880
applications manufacturing might be more

730
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:24,799
distributed but connected and what are

731
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:27,399
the ways where we'll see new models of

732
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:28,279
vertical integration right perhaps new

733
00:32:27,399 --> 00:32:32,240
foundaries

734
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:34,600
if you will that can uh with a deep

735
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:37,399
understanding of process technology and

736
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:40,559
automation provide new scalable

737
00:32:37,399 --> 00:32:43,039
capabilities for designers innovators

738
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:45,720
you know firms from small to large that

739
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:47,039
uh design products to bring those

740
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,320
products to scale and that will

741
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:51,880
certainly have implications on you know

742
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:54,039
today's companies that do contract

743
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:56,679
manufacturing that manufacture products

744
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:59,120
but don't necessarily sell the product

745
00:32:56,679 --> 00:33:00,840
so that was to me me a particularly

746
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:04,039
inspiring moment and I think one that

747
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:09,039
relates to the overall theme of of the

748
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:12,480
presentation so uh uh let me close uh

749
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:16,600
just with just two slides before uh we

750
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:20,519
take some some questions so the first is

751
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:23,039
uh you we at MIT have been thinking for

752
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:25,919
uh about a year now how we can bring

753
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:28,919
mit's expertise together around the

754
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:30,679
theme of manufacturing and we've a we we

755
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:34,159
brought a faculty group together for

756
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:36,840
that same amount of time and similar to

757
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:38,440
the idea that you know tsmc just put the

758
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,000
red line around all the boxes and

759
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:43,200
thought about how to reconfigure

760
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,200
capabilities uh I believe that a lot of

761
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,080
the the future of manufacturing for

762
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:50,600
individual companies is is based on

763
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:52,559
looking at how to insert different

764
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:55,360
Technologies with their existing

765
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:58,159
operations use data and think about

766
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:00,519
driving forces such as new Energy

767
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:02,559
Technologies and sustainability and so

768
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:04,519
we've coined for ourselves this term of

769
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:07,000
new manufacturing like what does the new

770
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:09,079
manufacturing look like here in the US

771
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,760
and around the world and when you think

772
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:13,000
of why is this moment very very

773
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:14,679
important one of the driving factors is

774
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,320
because so many companies around the

775
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:20,240
world for various reasons whether it be

776
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:23,599
Supply chaina fragility or geopolitics

777
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:26,679
or you know driving force of of of of

778
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:30,119
climate change are thinking of how to

779
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:32,119
reposition uh and also realizing that

780
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:34,399
they can do much better their operations

781
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:37,280
can be much better and just one example

782
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:40,359
in terms of the big shifts is data from

783
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:41,760
our colleagues here on the amount of

784
00:34:40,359 --> 00:34:43,679
foreign direct investment in

785
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:46,560
manufacturing in the US it's literally

786
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:48,879
at a generational high so while I will

787
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:51,359
wrap up with this slide uh that's what

788
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:53,520
this new manufacturing initiative at MIT

789
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:56,079
is all about it's about studying the

790
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:58,200
Next Generation themes in manufacturing

791
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:59,680
working closely with industry including

792
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:02,119
through an industry Consortium that

793
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:06,119
we're putting together this fall and

794
00:35:02,119 --> 00:35:08,960
reaching deeply into mit's expertise in

795
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:11,040
uh in in in particular areas of focus

796
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,839
Robotics and automation AI for

797
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,480
manufacturing

798
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:16,160
biomanufacturing uh the built

799
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,359
environment and so on and so forth and

800
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:20,560
I'd be happy to be in touch and tell you

801
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:23,320
more about it uh is feel free to send me

802
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:32,359
an email at the address here thank you

803
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:34,560
[Applause]

804
00:35:32,359 --> 00:35:34,560
all

805
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:40,960
right how do I see Ai and gen

806
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:43,680
transforming PLM uh product life cycle

807
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:46,040
management and similar systems uh great

808
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,480
question I I think I don't have a great

809
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:50,520
answer I think there'll be a number of

810
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:53,880
ways uh one of the challenges that I I

811
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:56,240
think exists is that a lot of these

812
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:57,240
tools and the same thing exists in 3D

813
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,400
printing for instance are being

814
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:01,000
developed

815
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:03,000
by different companies and how they talk

816
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,839
to each other the interrup operability

817
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,599
is key so you know uh from the PLM

818
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:10,440
perspective I think it will come down to

819
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:12,720
the companies that uh uh develop the PLM

820
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:15,359
systems bringing those tools on board

821
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:17,119
and establishing interoperability but

822
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:19,480
you could imagine new ways that you

823
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:21,640
manage uh you know configurations of

824
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:24,440
products that you document variants of

825
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:26,520
designs that you document test data and

826
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:28,640
quality data and I think that will

827
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:31,200
influence uh p M systems in the future

828
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:32,920
for sure and and and open question being

829
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,280
you know how do suppliers tie in and how

830
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:37,880
how do they provide more data Upstream

831
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:41,240
as well as you know uh companies

832
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:41,240
sourcing products provide it

833
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,560
Downstream if starting with production

834
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,160
infrastructure as a base of

835
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:50,400
manufacturing is there risk of adding

836
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:53,079
extra constraints to product and process

837
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,880
design uh you good question I think

838
00:36:53,079 --> 00:36:56,720
possibly I would say more generally the

839
00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:00,119
question is how do you how do you

840
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:02,319
represent the constraints uh of of of of

841
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:05,119
process capabilities I I also would say

842
00:37:02,319 --> 00:37:07,880
there's many examples where you know we

843
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:09,839
don't really know the true bounds of

844
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:12,359
manufacturing at the design stage and

845
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:13,880
that can have benefits right oh I can

846
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:16,000
think you know think more broadly and

847
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:17,920
then manufacturing narrows it down or it

848
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,680
can also have the opposite effect if I

849
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:22,400
don't know truly what are the bounds of

850
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:25,280
a of a production process may maybe the

851
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,280
design stage is

852
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:29,839
restricted if you use 3D printing for

853
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,280
spacecraft or aircraft how can you

854
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:33,000
validate the quality and safety of

855
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:36,760
maintaining the parts after some years

856
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,960
great question uh there's uh established

857
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:42,200
capabilities for qualifying the parts

858
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:44,680
it's uh quite uh involved to do that uh

859
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:47,720
but uh you need to do the material

860
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:49,800
testing that is effectively the same

861
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:52,200
testing that you use to prove out

862
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:56,240
conventional processes the good thing is

863
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:59,160
that uh with appropriate control you can

864
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:01,000
uh you know achieve 3D printed material

865
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:03,200
properties that are conventional if not

866
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,599
Superior to many uh conventional

867
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:07,480
processes and that will enable these

868
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:09,160
Technologies to be inserted in you know

869
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:12,480
things like next Generation jet engines

870
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:12,480
and medical implants at

871
00:38:13,319 --> 00:38:16,440
scale all right should we wrap up or see

872
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,520
if there's one question from the

873
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:19,520
audience yes

874
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:27,960
please all right I don't see any hands

875
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:27,960
so thank you again thank you
