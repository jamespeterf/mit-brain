9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,320
So uh a lot of folks uh for instance

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,640
they'll run online poker or something

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,640
and they will say that oh we we don't

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,120
fall into the tax bracket for gambling

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,480
because we're a skill based game

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:39,280
and but literally agon is about you know

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,680
competition and some ways you can

16
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:45,360
consider sport but then the reason why

17
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:48,719
um why I was asking entirely um is

18
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,760
because the way how Ka writes it or at

19
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,840
least the way how uh Roger how has been

20
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,760
translated kind of makes it sound like

21
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,680
he's actually drawing hard divisions

22
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,840
between all these categories when really

23
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,359
they're all like adjectives. Uh

24
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,960
>> what was the original language?

25
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:09,119
>> Uh French I believe the original uh

26
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:12,280
version correct me if I'm wrong.

27
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,280
>> The original

28
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,920
>> if anyone can confirm that that would be

29
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,960
awesome. Write write a forum post about

30
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,479
it.

31
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,840
Yeah, I I'll I'll try to confirm that.

32
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,520
If it's actually French, I'll confirm it

33
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,640
and then write an obnoxious post about

34
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,479
translation errors.

35
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,479
>> Um, yeah, I'm sure it could have been

36
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,960
translated in far more interesting

37
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,960
language because it's kind of double

38
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,119
the branches going on if it actually is.

39
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,280
>> And then we have more reading on

40
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:42,640
Wednesday. Yay.

41
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:45,520
>> But it's it's it's an important text. Um

42
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,479
uh so that's uh but it but elinks will

43
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,720
be um I use the word vertigo a lot

44
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,759
because it sometimes gets get sort of

45
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,680
like substituted but vertigo kind of I

46
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:59,439
think people sort of have a very

47
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:02,560
specific understanding of vertigo um you

48
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:05,600
know as getting dizzy because of heights

49
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:09,200
and obviously not all games are about

50
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,959
heights um but you know people sure they

51
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,720
they use it to describe the sensation of

52
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,239
taking a roller coaster which literally

53
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,400
is about heights but it's also about

54
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,720
speed and you know you can use the same

55
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,360
thing of uh everyone played a game

56
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:24,080
called Descent uh on the PC back in the

57
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,280
day. Um so imagine a first person

58
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,959
shooter uh you're in you know you the

59
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:33,040
the game is filling up your entire

60
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:35,040
screen but there is no up um that uh

61
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,280
gravity that that there's no gravity

62
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,599
whenever you want you can turn yourself

63
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,480
this way and you'll just stay that way

64
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,080
until you want to turn it. Um otherwise

65
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,160
the controls work just pretty much the

66
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,599
same way as first person shooter. Um

67
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,680
that that that was that was descent. And

68
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,440
uh the whole the whole pleasure of that

69
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,720
game was that you'd be doing this all

70
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,879
the freaking time. I'm going down a

71
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,160
straight corridor. I and I never walk

72
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,200
and I never just go down a straight

73
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,319
corridor. I go down a straight corridor.

74
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,560
I turn into

75
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,480
>> Inception.

76
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,360
Yeah.

77
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,800
That's what I was saying. Imagine

78
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,280
playing if you ever get a chance to play

79
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,080
the game Prey, which is probably like

80
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,519
five bucks on like pre-owned nowadays.

81
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,400
You have that same sort of thing. And

82
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,879
Portal has a lot of that kind of like

83
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,400
loss of control, you know, physical

84
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:26,000
sensation that they're trying to get at,

85
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:28,080
but obviously real physical experiences,

86
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,519
you know, uh, you know, have have an

87
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:34,480
edge, right? You know, they're talking

88
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:36,159
about uh, three-legged races or um, that

89
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:40,040
coral game where you spin around on the

90
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,040
back with your head.

91
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:46,319
Um, I hate that game.

92
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,680
Um, and you think can be used to

93
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:51,760
describe any one of those things. Um,

94
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,920
I like to use it as describing the sort

95
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,280
of fun of loss of control, but that's

96
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,239
not necessarily even the case. It's just

97
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,560
the sheer physicality of of of the of

98
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,239
the game as part of the experience in a

99
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,560
way that

100
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,400
digital chess doesn't really have any of

101
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,879
that, you know? I mean, even real chess

102
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:12,159
at least has I'm moving my face. So um

103
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,920
actually I'm just going to write out

104
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:17,359
those words for those folks who didn't

105
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:20,400
get the chance to to read through that

106
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:25,160
that that page. So it's agon kind of

107
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,160
like gave the competition scale.

108
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,800
Uh I talked about elix which is kind of

109
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,880
jumping down to the last one of the user

110
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,960
just am I spelling this right?

111
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,120
>> Yeah. You know which is kind of like

112
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,199
physicality

113
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,680
kind of sucks.

114
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:45,960
Actually,

115
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,960
Jason, can you turn the light into

116
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,360
control?

117
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:01,240
Um,

118
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,240
other ones were

119
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,880
what was that again?

120
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:10,199
>> Chance, luck,

121
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,199
lot skill.

122
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:16,080
You guys know the phrase um aliest mean

123
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,280
you know

124
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,199
>> the have been cast.

125
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,919
>> Yes. Yes. The D has been cast right

126
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,240
before Caesar crosses and then you know

127
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:27,120
says and now they're going to attack

128
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:30,560
some

129
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,639
>> but uh but you know the you know Alia

130
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,639
meets basically

131
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,199
>> um match on the room.

132
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,479
>> Say what?

133
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:42,560
>> He matched on the room. much room.

134
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:45,039
>> Yeah. Yeah. So, so the the um uh

135
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,280
although I've heard two translations of

136
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,880
the dye has been cast as a phrase

137
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,800
actually because on one hand you know

138
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,600
you can think of it as the die has been

139
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,000
cast so you know we'll see where fortune

140
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:59,360
takes us and you know it's not that we

141
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:04,479
can be wrong. Um, but I've also heard it

142
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:09,520
described as um the dye as in the um the

143
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:13,600
thing that you put molten metal into has

144
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:18,000
been cast. So that so whatever uh we

145
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:19,759
were making is now set and uh and and it

146
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,360
kind of has that same idea but it's

147
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:25,280
weird because one one one way that you

148
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,759
can think of this is this is now out of

149
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,360
a out of control and the other way that

150
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,280
you can think of this is and now this is

151
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,680
set in stone which is the two fairly

152
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,880
different connotations by both saying we

153
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,440
don't really have any control of the

154
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,360
situation.

155
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,600
>> Ya means broom

156
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,880
>> throat right? Yeah. Yeah. But the but

157
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,880
the English phrase

158
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,960
>> are there words

159
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,639
>> in English that have as a root to mean

160
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,840
randomly

161
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:53,039
>> in French like the word for random is

162
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,880
coming straight from

163
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,400
>> Sure. Yeah. Uh

164
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,639
>> which is undoubtedly why you chose that

165
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:02,240
word. I just checked he is French.

166
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,560
>> Oh yeah. I mean uh obviously that's why

167
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,120
Yeah.

168
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:08,319
>> Uh kind of want to use it.

169
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,880
>> Yeah. I can't think of any um English

170
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:14,479
words that use that as a root. Although

171
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:17,880
there might be some uh uh I know there's

172
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,880
a game company

173
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,080
and actually they actually make strategy

174
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,080
games which is kind of weird.

175
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,240
Um, and there's and there's one more

176
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,240
which is

177
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,240
>> memory.

178
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:38,639
Which is kind of odd because that in

179
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:41,840
English uh but not in French. Um,

180
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:44,080
mimicry is mimicry. Uh, it's, you know,

181
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:47,919
it's actually in English. So, you know,

182
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:51,680
role playing, dress up, let's pretend,

183
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:53,360
um, simulation sometimes, uh, you know,

184
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,639
might actually fall into that. So you

185
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,800
you you you can imagine you know a

186
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,639
tactical simulation for instance you

187
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,160
know being very much about competition

188
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:06,879
and skill uh but then but then if it's a

189
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,960
tactical simulation about

190
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,960
you know Russian

191
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,280
penet or something that then you know

192
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,280
and then upon the actual famous war and

193
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:19,360
then you're starting to get into into

194
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,960
baby territory sort of like do you it's

195
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,120
part of the pleasure of believing that

196
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,599
you are something else I suppose. to I

197
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,720
am this guy playing go, you know, as

198
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:31,199
opposed to I am this

199
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,440
17th century scholar playing go and

200
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,279
you're making a game about that instead.

201
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,399
Um

202
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:41,839
so so these are the adjectives that he

203
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,760
talks about um to describe games. But in

204
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:47,839
the bit where we actually asked you to

205
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:50,640
read it's more about why you know the

206
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:53,600
these words give you a clue to think

207
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,600
about why are people playing games. Now

208
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:59,360
um these are types of fun much in a way

209
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:01,680
that uh that that gets touched on by uh

210
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,160
the NBA paper that that that definitely

211
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,519
highly last week. You know, what are

212
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,920
these aesthetics that people are going

213
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,640
for? You know, are they going for the

214
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,800
thrill of competition or the thrill of

215
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,959
luck? Are they going for, you know,

216
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,720
physical motion and how that feels or

217
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:20,800
are they going for the feeling of being

218
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,480
someone else? And and it's not, again,

219
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,480
these these are not mutually exclusive

220
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,760
terms. These are things that you you

221
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,440
could have one game that has all of

222
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,160
this. You could have one game that that

223
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:33,200
has two in some strong composition and

224
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:35,440
the rest and and the rest all minimized.

225
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,839
That's fine. But understanding that this

226
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,839
is what people are enjoying the game for

227
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,839
and more importantly this is what people

228
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:45,440
are enjoying playing with each other

229
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:48,480
for. Um, one one nice thing about this

230
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:51,120
is that for the for Argon and for

231
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,600
Mimicry, it's really really difficult to

232
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,519
think about those two in particular

233
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,440
without thinking about the players. You

234
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,760
know, the competition kind of sucks if

235
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,480
there's no one else you're competing

236
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:05,279
against. Uh, sure you can play against a

237
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:08,880
computer nowadays. Um, but you know,

238
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:10,000
traditionally you couldn't. um at at

239
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,120
least you're playing against the

240
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,399
designer, especially when kid puzzles,

241
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,079
you know, it's it's really really

242
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,000
annoying to pretend to be somebody else

243
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,600
when there's no audience, you know, even

244
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,800
if that other person is someone

245
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:25,040
pretending along with you to play

246
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,800
against you. Now, luck, you can

247
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,800
completely play a game, you know,

248
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,279
flipping a coin or something like that.

249
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,760
uh but even when it comes to luck and it

250
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:36,000
comes to you know experiences of

251
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,680
physical mo emotions these things tend

252
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,720
to be measurable when when there's

253
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:43,680
people around that's why these part four

254
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,600
particular divisions that that color

255
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:49,600
picked out are really really good for

256
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:51,440
thinking about social um that game where

257
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,440
is is there a name for this game where

258
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,440
you put the bat on the ground and you go

259
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,440
around

260
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,920
>> that irritating

261
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,120
Wait, wait. And like someone gets picked

262
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,160
and then

263
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,320
>> so so it's like a relay race where you

264
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,839
like you take a baseball bat, you put

265
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,200
your head on it, you go around it three

266
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,399
times and then you you run back to your

267
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,920
team,

268
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,079
>> carry the bat, and try to hand the bat

269
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,320
off to somebody else.

270
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:25,120
>> Usually ending up

271
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,160
>> because you're not heard bats. Dizzy

272
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,440
bats. Dizzy bats.

273
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:31,440
>> Dizzy bats. Yeah. So, so that game, you

274
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,920
know, it's a lot more fun when there's

275
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,920
somebody yells around.

276
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:42,600
>> I do that by myself.

277
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,600
>> Handing it off to yourself

278
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,120
around

279
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:52,079
>> and even with games of chance. I mean I

280
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,760
mean sure you could you could play games

281
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:56,480
of chance by by yourself but the most

282
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,000
part also my my my enjoyment playing

283
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,720
games of chance are usually with a group

284
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,320
of four people and actually uh either

285
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:06,480
playing poker or playing something like

286
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:08,399
macho you know so so these are all very

287
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,720
social experiences and to think about

288
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:14,720
when someone's going to come down sit in

289
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:16,399
front of your game you know and and what

290
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:20,000
what sort of frame of mind they're going

291
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:21,200
to be in uh to to to play your your

292
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,279
game. What what sort of frame of mind

293
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:26,320
you want to put them in uh in order to

294
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:28,160
enjoy your game, think about why they

295
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,839
might want to hang out with other people

296
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,720
because most of because actually for

297
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,160
assignment one, your game has to be. So,

298
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,760
you know, there's this other person that

299
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,639
you're playing with that you may or may

300
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,720
not know, but try to try to think about

301
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,399
how you're going to construct enough

302
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,560
clues to sort of get them to enjoy it.

303
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,079
So, the game is about pretending to be

304
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,920
someone else. You know, I'm going to

305
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:51,200
play I I'm going to make a game where I

306
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:54,720
am playing a negotiator in a hostage

307
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,160
situation for a card game. Awesome. And

308
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,480
you know, I'm going to be negotiator and

309
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:01,200
they're going to be the uh the guy

310
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:04,399
taking hostages. Um that and then you

311
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:07,040
want to play that up and on um Friday we

312
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,720
had the game crunch where people were

313
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:12,079
playing

314
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:14,000
CEOs, I think. Uh yeah. And the whole

315
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:16,959
bit basic idea that you were already a

316
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,440
corrupt that was awesome

317
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:21,360
>> corrupt and you think about you know how

318
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,040
does the game even from the rules even

319
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,079
from the design of the box you know get

320
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:29,040
you into the mood of thinking okay I'm

321
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:30,800
going to get into I I'm going to whoever

322
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,240
I am in real life I'm going to take on

323
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,240
this persona and I'm going to enjoy

324
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,279
taking for a while. Yeah, they did a

325
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,040
really good job of that because they had

326
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:40,320
this game kind of built in where you can

327
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:42,000
actually hide cards on yourself.

328
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,560
>> Did you guys catch anyone doing that in

329
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,279
the act?

330
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,000
>> I got caught.

331
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,720
>> Yeah,

332
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,240
>> I got hit.

333
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,800
I feel like argument that's part of the

334
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,519
rules.

335
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,440
>> Yeah,

336
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,440
>> cuz he he'd already got it. He had

337
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,880
already hit him away and then the cards

338
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:59,040
were saw like way afterwards, you know.

339
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,880
>> And and even arguing arguing over

340
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,360
whether something was illegal or not,

341
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,839
even when there's evidence that it is,

342
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,519
no one caught you doing it. It's kind of

343
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:10,399
appropriate for the theme of, you know,

344
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:12,720
being a CEO of a failing bank, right?

345
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:15,120
You know, it's like, well, so we have

346
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,360
all of these uh CPOS, you know, that are

347
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,720
working. Yeah, we purchased them at some

348
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,519
point, but nobody caught us while we

349
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,040
were doing it, so now you have to help

350
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,000
us fix it. That's that's what the game

351
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:28,160
is about. Um

352
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,040
uh was there a game that was

353
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:33,519
particularly competitive uh that people

354
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,720
played on Friday? The game was pretty

355
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,360
competitive.

356
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,720
>> Pick one.

357
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,120
>> Yeah.

358
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,760
>> There was a competitive moment in in

359
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,320
Sabaturur when Alec

360
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,360
>> revealed himself to be a sabotur and

361
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,680
ruined

362
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,800
>> our attempts to find the gold.

363
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:54,160
>> Sabotur is a is is what I would describe

364
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:57,680
as cutthroat. Uh it's it's it's a game

365
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,440
that's deliberately about winning by

366
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,160
other people losing. You know, it's like

367
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,880
that's

368
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,399
>> it made me upset in Alec

369
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,440
made me proud

370
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:12,279
>> and and and um John Nash actually, you

371
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,279
know, a lot of it or

372
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,079
>> Okay. All right.

373
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,360
>> I keep thinking that he was involved in

374
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:23,279
MIT at some point. Anyway, um I mean Oh,

375
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,920
because he he he did spend some time

376
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:29,440
here at MIT. uh possibly when visiting.

377
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:32,480
Uh but he designed one game uh called

378
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:36,880
Hex which is ostensibly designed based

379
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:42,320
on the washroom tiles of one of the

380
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:45,760
building 39 or building 37 bathrooms.

381
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:49,199
But anyway, um that game and another

382
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:51,360
game called Screw You Buddy. Uh

383
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,560
>> are both cut games. Yeah, it's like it's

384
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,720
the only way that you're going to win

385
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,240
this game is by screwing over the the

386
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,120
other percentage.

387
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:01,839
>> Um, screwing in particular, it's kind of

388
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,440
just like boiled down diplomacy. You

389
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,360
know, the only way that you're going to

390
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,160
win this game is to betray someone else.

391
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,560
>> Yes.

392
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:14,360
>> Um, let's see. Games of Chance kind of

393
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,360
chanty on Friday.

394
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,600
>> It can go.

395
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:24,600
>> Yeah, it can go. That's 17

396
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,600
card.

397
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:30,560
>> Every threat was on the board. Two

398
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:32,320
people go in 17 drops. Oh my god.

399
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:35,040
>> It's a pressure of luck game, right? You

400
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:39,079
know, is the do you dare, you know, do

401
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,079
you think do you feel lucky now?

402
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:47,600
>> Um, but it's, you know, I I enjoyed the

403
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:49,040
game a lot. I I had a lot of fun. Cool.

404
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,880
I don't think that we had any games that

405
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:54,399
were specifically uh it's hard to get

406
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:57,040
really physical in card games. Uh

407
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:59,120
>> maybe like that game falling falling.

408
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:02,240
>> Yeah, that was hit

409
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,920
>> cuz it's like pit actually right two

410
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,919
weeks ago some of the games that we

411
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,480
played were really kind of kinetic.

412
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:10,640
>> So those so so even with card games you

413
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,679
you you already have fairly good

414
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:16,880
examples of that. I want I want you to

415
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,319
kind of keep uh keep in mind this one

416
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,400
because today we're actually going to

417
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,679
start the process of like getting you

418
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,720
folks to think about what you're you're

419
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:26,400
going to do with your first assignment

420
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:29,440
and and breaking you up in teams. Um

421
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:32,559
before we completely leave Jason here,

422
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,760
do do you have anything to raise

423
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,080
anything?

424
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,240
>> No. Or anybody else?

425
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,520
>> I was still confused about the whole

426
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,600
Eskimo part.

427
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,840
>> Agreed.

428
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,840
I'll have to look through

429
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,840
misos.

430
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,840
>> Take a look at the French actually.

431
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,760
>> Yeah, I'll take a look. He actually went

432
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,960
to the same one my dad did and went to

433
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,480
university somewhere a good friend of

434
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,559
ours did. So I mean we might know

435
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,480
someone who knows him. I'll I'll find

436
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:01,919
out tonight.

437
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,640
>> He's dead.

438
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:07,760
>> So why just have him like come over

439
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:12,200
chill at MIT for a little bit. Yeah,

440
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,200
>> we can talk to him about the Eskimos and

441
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:17,600
>> we just have to we Does anyone here know

442
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:21,600
cuz he's so we need to raise him?

443
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:23,840
>> Yeah, he he is dead but I might

444
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,240
>> necromancy. It's okay.

445
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,320
>> All right. So, so this is this is what

446
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:31,520
we're going to do. Uh we're basically

447
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,720
going to do brainstorming today. Uh the

448
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:36,400
the basic idea is that we're going to

449
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:39,440
hand out cards and one job to sort of

450
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:42,240
make it easier on the job of the uh of

451
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,600
the secretary is that you is that you'd

452
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,840
actually be reading out stuff that

453
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,039
you've written. So especially while

454
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,880
other people are throwing out their

455
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,080
ideas, you know, and you get something

456
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,840
and that person is still talking, you

457
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,799
might as well just write down your idea.

458
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,720
Um so we'll have a whole bunch of cards.

459
00:18:54,799 --> 00:19:00,480
Um

460
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:02,000
the but uh I also like you to write

461
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,640
start off by writing your name right on

462
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,080
top. Um and the reason for this is

463
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,480
because I don't think every single

464
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:11,360
person in this room knows each other's

465
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,280
names yet. And but as we do this

466
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,960
process, it's more likely that you

467
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,919
remember, oh yeah, that guy who came up

468
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:23,120
with that idea. Uh and then oh, and that

469
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:25,520
person's name is, you know. Um so

470
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,600
now you want to have all the ideas from

471
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,480
each person on one card or have one idea

472
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,160
per card?

473
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,679
>> Uh all on one.

474
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,120
>> What if the professors took the notes

475
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,000
and we could just bounce out ideas?

476
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,520
Well, that's what they regarded as well.

477
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,120
But but the thing about writing your

478
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,120
ideas down is so that people can then

479
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,360
look at the card and say, "Yeah, that

480
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,120
guy, I want to follow up with this guy."

481
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:48,880
Because we're not actually going to form

482
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:51,520
the team uh uh for you by the end of

483
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:54,880
this class. The idea is so that after

484
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:58,400
this brainstorm uh this brainstorming

485
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:00,720
phase, you've got a pool of ideas of

486
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:03,360
which you guys can make games. It

487
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,360
actually frankly we we don't care if two

488
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,120
teams ended up making you know pretty

489
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,799
much the same game out of the same

490
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,400
concept because I know that two

491
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,679
different teams and two different people

492
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,200
two different sets of people are going

493
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:17,200
to end up making different games anyway

494
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:20,559
even from the same u that's that's not a

495
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:24,000
requirement you guys you folks can make

496
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:27,600
uh uh you can can take any set of ideas

497
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,000
from the boo today obviously if you're

498
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,200
the one who pitch an idea and somebody

499
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,200
else thinks, "Hey, that was actually

500
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,120
pretty cool." And, you know, take that

501
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,520
opportunity to talk to the person and,

502
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:40,000
you know, maybe team it.

503
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:43,360
>> Um, that pretty much is going to happen

504
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,120
between classes. So, by Wednesday, um, I

505
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,720
wanted you folks to come in. This is

506
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,799
basically one of the pieces of homework

507
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,200
is to is to tell tell me which team

508
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:53,919
you're on, who's on your team, and

509
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,640
what's the general oneline, you know,

510
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:58,240
uh, idea that you're working with. Now

511
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,240
the idea that you're giving us is what

512
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,880
you started with. It may not be what you

513
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,880
end with. That's fine. I I we're very

514
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,400
comfortable with that idea change while

515
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,640
you guys work with things. That's fine.

516
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,799
The team shouldn't change. So you you're

517
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,200
working with you know these three other

518
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:15,679
people. So for a team of four then that

519
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:20,440
should be you know be intact for the

520
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:20,440
rest of this uh for this assignment.

521
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:30,960
>> 9 10 12 13 14 15 16 perfect. So keep it

522
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:32,880
for Oh, great. Um, now the

523
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:36,159
um one more clarification about the

524
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:38,960
project. Uh, the card game for all all

525
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:42,159
the cards need to be identically sized.

526
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,600
Um, we do like cards that are going to

527
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,440
be legible, but you don't need to spend

528
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,400
a whole lot of time making them pretty.

529
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,000
Uh, I would just uh appreciate it that

530
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,679
by the time you actually hand in your

531
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,720
cards, you have them written in ink.

532
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:56,400
handies. Uh um pencil is great when

533
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,720
you're prototyping because you can erase

534
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:02,720
and you can make things but ink is great

535
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:07,679
for grading because it's not white. Um

536
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:10,080
your game can be uh uh playable by two,

537
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,880
three or four players.

538
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,640
It does not need to cater to any

539
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,559
grouping other than what you decide that

540
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,240
it needs to be. So if you say this is

541
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:20,799
two-player game, we will test it with

542
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,400
two people. If you say this is 224,

543
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,640
we'll test it with some number with

544
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,880
however many people we manage to wrestle

545
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,799
with two tests. Uh if you say it could

546
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,320
be two or four but not three, that's

547
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,360
fine. But you need to make that clear

548
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,760
because there are some games that work

549
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,760
really really well.

550
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:42,640
>> Um keep it keep it for uh four and under

551
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:46,480
uh or at least make it possible for us

552
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:48,320
to grade it uh with maximum of four

553
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,080
people. Because if you give us a game

554
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,840
that requires five people, we have to

555
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:55,200
find five people and get them together

556
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:57,280
in order to create your your

557
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:00,080
>> Okay. Minimum requirement.

558
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,760
>> Uh that's um I think there was one more

559
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,000
requirement for how long the game could

560
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,280
take.

561
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,280
>> I think it's probably 10 months.

562
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:08,640
>> Oh yeah, it was short.

563
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:11,039
>> Super short. Falling is really short.

564
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:14,400
>> Yeah, but crunch is not.

565
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:16,720
>> Yeah, it's about crunch is over. So when

566
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,240
you're brainstorming for game ideas, how

567
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,840
much of the game mechanism does that

568
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,280
come up with brainstorm?

569
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,159
>> Uh

570
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:27,120
>> it's a cool idea. Zombies in space.

571
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:30,320
>> I would say the game mechanic is the

572
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:32,320
thing that's that's encouraging you to

573
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,760
that's the thing that you about this

574
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,320
assignment. I have this cool game

575
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,840
mechanic in mind and

576
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,480
then that's then that's the thing that

577
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,799
you're throwing out. And obviously if if

578
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:46,080
if instant is you know I want to make a

579
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:47,679
game about fish I have no game mechanics

580
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,880
in mind but I think fish are awesome

581
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,480
then uh okay that's what

582
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,039
maybe that's the first you know the

583
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:57,120
first bad idea

584
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:59,360
I'm throwing up

585
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,200
if we have like several game ideas

586
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,480
should we take several index cards and

587
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,039
write one per

588
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:07,360
>> actually no I would rather see them all

589
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:08,880
on one if you can't fit them and if you

590
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:12,080
run out of space them

591
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:14,480
Um again the idea of the index cards is

592
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,080
not just to record the ideas down uh

593
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,760
because what I am going to do is I'm

594
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,400
just uh I'm going to try to type them

595
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:22,240
all out so that uh you can refer to them

596
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,559
on on forum post just to remember what

597
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,480
people discussed but also to find find

598
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:28,320
you you folks again. So I said yeah that

599
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,039
was that guy who had this idea about

600
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:33,679
fish. Who was that again? Yeah. Okay

601
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:39,799
then.

602
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:39,799
So, uh I guess I need to leave.

603
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,880
>> You want me to write down?

604
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,880
>> Um I think I think

605
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,039
you're not a facilitator.

606
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:54,919
>> Yeah, I'm facilitator.

607
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,919
>> I like better

608
00:24:55,039 --> 00:25:00,039
secretary. It's almost like the

609
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:00,039
beginning

610
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:04,279
leader.

611
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,960
>> But I am actually wondering whether we

612
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,200
should divide this into two groups.

613
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,880
>> They would get to see the cross.

614
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:21,039
>> We did some crossation.

615
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:22,240
>> That's why it's a whole fast. Okay. So,

616
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:24,080
>> I know there were some folks who

617
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,159
actually started off with ideas already

618
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,919
on the forum. So, uh, why don't those

619
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,080
folks throw, uh, throw in your ideas

620
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:32,960
first because you you mentioned before?

621
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,720
>> Yeah, I I wasn't quite that forum.

622
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,159
>> Well, to start off, I mean, Jeremy and I

623
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,279
have been sort of discussing an idea.

624
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,679
You want to go ahead?

625
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:38,480
>> Sure.

626
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,600
>> Two ideas, I guess.

627
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,600
>> Well, yeah. So, I'll start with the

628
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,279
titles one. So the basic concept is a

629
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,440
game in which players are forced by some

630
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:47,520
mechanic game mechanic to refer to each

631
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,440
other by name uh constantly throughout

632
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:52,000
the game and at a rap very rapid pace

633
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,279
and that players accumulate uh their

634
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,559
name is generated by the game and

635
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,480
accumulate increasingly longer and more

636
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,679
wordless games as they succeed. So you

637
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,200
would start, you would be like lord of

638
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:01,600
something and you could accumulate extra

639
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,960
title son of this like bringer of flame

640
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,400
and you could just like have all these

641
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,080
modifiers that just kind of accumulate

642
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,600
and accumulate until your title becomes

643
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,200
ridiculous and then people will start

644
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,279
screwing up and as they say your name

645
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,200
and and it just hilarious.

646
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:15,120
>> Okay, I'm just going to write down like

647
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,520
memory jobs. Uh

648
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,159
>> so like procedurally generated names,

649
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,159
titles,

650
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,159
>> name

651
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,159
one.

652
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,799
>> Yeah. Can I go in the second one more uh

653
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,480
while we

654
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:30,240
>> Okay, so I had this idea of like sort of

655
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,080
like a survival horror game kind of

656
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,640
inspired by falling. Like the premise

657
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:36,159
is, you know, you have a group of like

658
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,919
player characters that are like charging

659
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,760
through a building and you can have like

660
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:41,120
a dealer that is putting down like

661
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,559
hallways as you're going through.

662
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,919
Occasionally threats come up and you

663
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,840
have to like react really quickly and be

664
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,520
like, "It's a zombie. We have to like go

665
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,720
upstairs and throw down a car to like do

666
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,919
that." And you have to keep doing this

667
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,520
until you get to the end of it and

668
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,760
people can like die and get eaten and

669
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,039
stuff.

670
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,679
That's good.

671
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,440
>> Kind of like

672
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,679
>> should

673
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,080
we be writing his ideas down?

674
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:03,120
>> No, I'm writing mine down and then

675
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,960
>> write on your own.

676
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:07,440
>> Yeah. Um,

677
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,039
>> so I have idea I thought made this up

678
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,799
like a year ago when I took game design.

679
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,640
Oh, not game design.

680
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:14,960
>> It showed video game studies. It's

681
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:17,200
actually it's like majority rule. So you

682
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,360
can it's kind of like a crunch where you

683
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,360
can just hide cars and stuff but as if

684
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:24,000
you if you get caught then you get

685
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:27,679
called out and in order to be penalized

686
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:30,080
for it you have to be you have to a

687
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:32,799
majority rule has to be by everyone

688
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:36,320
playing and so you can actually bribe

689
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:39,120
people to vote for you.

690
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:41,440
>> It's more of like a Yeah. And then the

691
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,200
way you get points is

692
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,760
depends on how we describe it.

693
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,640
>> Okay. Uh I'm just going to go around

694
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,880
this way.

695
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,200
>> Okay. So I had an idea of a card game

696
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,159
based on like having success in life. So

697
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,840
the beginning of the game all the

698
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:56,240
players are randomly assigned different

699
00:27:53,840 --> 00:28:00,640
different goals in order which are like

700
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:02,320
wealth and uh uh adventure and love and

701
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,679
things like this. And then all the cards

702
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,520
represent different activities that take

703
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,640
up a different amount of time. So like

704
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,480
you have all these activities you can

705
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,000
keep in front of you and then however

706
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,360
much free time you have you like draw

707
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,440
that many cards looking for new

708
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,880
opportunities. So it's like you like

709
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,240
take opportunities and kind of leave

710
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:21,559
opportunities and things.

711
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:21,559
>> Okay. I put it right on opportunities.

712
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:30,240
>> Sure. So I have a very mechanically

713
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:32,799
oriented idea. Essentially I'm stealing

714
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:35,120
and trying to improve the draft mechanic

715
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:37,279
from um from Magic the Gathering booster

716
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:39,600
draft for those who don't know. The idea

717
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:44,000
is the idea is that you're trying to

718
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:45,919
collect a set and um so let's do it in

719
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,679
terms of regular card games. You're

720
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,679
trying to collect a straight flush as

721
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:52,559
long as possible, as high valued as

722
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:54,240
possible, but other people may be trying

723
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:56,399
to collect that same suit. So you want

724
00:28:54,240 --> 00:29:00,240
to collect a different suit from other

725
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:01,919
people. And you do this by um looking at

726
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,840
the cards in your hand, picking one of

727
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,679
them, passing it the rest to the person

728
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,120
on your right, and then continuing to do

729
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,960
this. and then going back in the other

730
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,399
direction with a new hand and then in

731
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:14,320
the same direction again with a third

732
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:18,000
hand. And the object is collect straight

733
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:19,440
flush. Um, also guess what the person to

734
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,600
your right was collecting and guess what

735
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,520
the person to your left was collecting.

736
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,279
So you're trying to signal to other

737
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:29,000
people what suits are open and collect

738
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:29,000
the suit which is open.

739
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:36,880
>> Let's see who's next. Uh,

740
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:38,159
>> yeah. Um so it's going to be uh there

741
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,240
are different types of cards like action

742
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:44,399
cards like pickup cards or loose cards

743
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:47,279
but then so you know where they have

744
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:48,880
cards where so you have like oh from

745
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,640
stock pile from your friend hand from

746
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,159
discard pile people play different cards

747
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,720
in different order so the rule always

748
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:55,919
changes kind of mess up or help yourself

749
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:59,279
out.

750
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,880
>> How would you describe that uh the rules

751
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:02,880
are constantly changing?

752
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,880
>> Yeah but you get like so there's

753
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,720
actually an order to it. So you can

754
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,799
choose. So if like it's going to be your

755
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,039
turn that says pick a free card, you can

756
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:12,240
put down like oh from a friend's hand

757
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,200
like lose three cards or something like

758
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:17,159
that.

759
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,159
>> Makes a lot of sense in my mind.

760
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,880
>> So rules changing with cards.

761
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,880
>> Yeah.

762
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,120
>> Okay. Uh

763
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:31,120
>> all right. So uh one idea I have is a

764
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,480
game about uh character growth through

765
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,240
narrative arc. So, at the start of the

766
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,840
game, you're given a character, and the

767
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,240
idea is you want to follow a certain

768
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:39,919
narrative arc so that they grow in terms

769
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,279
of the hands of the game you're playing.

770
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,039
So, if you start out with a cocky

771
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:45,440
character, then you may want to actually

772
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:47,279
lose a couple of the hands of the game

773
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,799
such that your character experiences

774
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:52,159
failure and his character growth

775
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:53,840
increases. Um, and so basically, the

776
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:55,520
winner of the game is determined by who

777
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:58,320
manages to get their character to grow

778
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,279
the most, like emotionally.

779
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,559
>> Very deep.

780
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,960
>> Yeah.

781
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:04,320
Um, so I had this idea for like a poker

782
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,760
like game except it's played with more

783
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:08,000
than one deck, but the normal rules

784
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,919
still apply. So if you get dealt five

785
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,679
aces, you can't actually play that hand

786
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:13,120
because that would be cheating. So you

787
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,120
have an incentive to try and, you know,

788
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,799
like slip cards into your sleeve and

789
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,480
slip back and forth. So you're almost

790
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:21,679
forced to cheat at the game to be able

791
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:24,080
to actually play it.

792
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:26,640
>> So you can mix that with like

793
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:28,880
>> Yeah. and you get caught, then it's

794
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:31,600
pretty much you have to figure out how

795
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,279
to get out of the cab.

796
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,360
>> Oh, so the idea that I had was kind of

797
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:38,399
like bananagrams but with a card game.

798
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,840
So you have uh cards with like lines or

799
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:41,519
preset lines or shapes or something on

800
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:44,080
the cards and you have to try to connect

801
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:46,240
them all in some way on like on your

802
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,440
personal board so that it it forms a

803
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,480
closed shape and once you're done, you

804
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,640
know, you have to take another card from

805
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,159
the pile and try to fix your shape so

806
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,399
that it's still closed while trying to

807
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:57,840
beat everyone else. collecting cards

808
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:59,279
make shapes.

809
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,519
Okay.

810
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:04,000
>> So idea was just using normal poker

811
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:06,799
poker cards and doing a trading game.

812
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,039
You just like trading like four kinds of

813
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:11,600
pattern as four kind of stocks and you

814
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:13,519
can randomly draw the draw the card to

815
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,279
be your own stock and every day you

816
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:18,320
randomly draw card determine the day

817
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:21,360
price and you can trade with bank or

818
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:24,640
other players. I think you can use A to

819
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:29,760
10 as the as the stocks and the JQ and

820
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:31,760
Kas special cards and install some so

821
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,360
>> Okay,

822
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,760
>> so this one's another procedurally

823
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:38,080
generated idea. Uh the game generates

824
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,760
for you encounters and it's supposed to

825
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:42,159
be ridiculous and somewhat humorous. So

826
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:44,399
you'd have like a a base card like you

827
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:46,159
you know a bear and then there various

828
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:47,919
modifiers that would that you would that

829
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:49,679
you would draw to create that encounter.

830
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:52,799
So, it could be like a ninja zombie bear

831
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:54,000
in space wrapped in bacon and uh and

832
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,760
then and then those would all give

833
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,279
different attributes to that encounter

834
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,480
and then you'd have to find a way to

835
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,840
beat it. And your characters might also

836
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,519
maybe be procedurally generated in

837
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,440
similarly ridiculous ways and you'd have

838
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:05,440
to counter it with just you know

839
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,960
basically I like procedurally generated

840
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,840
ideas. Card games have never played the

841
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:13,640
same way twice. So,

842
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:13,640
>> um I need something.

843
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,279
>> Sorry.

844
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,919
with laser beams.

845
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,600
>> Of course.

846
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:24,960
>> Of course.

847
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:28,880
>> So, my idea was a musical RPG in which

848
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:31,919
um players cards are musical notes and

849
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:33,440
you uh build chords. For example, to

850
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:36,320
raise your character strength, you might

851
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:38,080
make an augmented chord, etc. And then

852
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,200
you can chain chord progressions to

853
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:43,399
attack players.

854
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,399
>> Diminished your life.

855
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:47,960
>> I I just dominated yourself.

856
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:54,480
All right, I got obsessed with drafting.

857
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:56,640
I have another drafting bit. Another

858
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,000
drafting game uses the same drafting

859
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,600
mechanic except that you're drafting

860
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,480
tiles. You play the tiles in front of

861
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:04,399
you and they make a machine. um drafting

862
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,000
the same color of machine bit or same

863
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:08,720
type of machine bit and then laying it

864
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,399
in in consecutive blocks um

865
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,079
multiplicatively makes them better and

866
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:18,040
then your machines like attack other

867
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:18,040
people or do crazy

868
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,760
>> But but the challenge being you have to

869
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:23,040
draft the piece that fits into your

870
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,480
machine.

871
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,800
>> They can do crazy

872
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:30,760
>> They can do crazy. It has to be

873
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,760
pronounced like crazy.

874
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,879
Uh, anyone here?

875
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,879
>> Oh.

876
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:39,119
>> Um, so my idea is kind of like a

877
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:41,679
monarchy type thing. So it starts out as

878
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:43,359
everyone's a heir to the throne except

879
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,599
the king. Like everyone wants to become

880
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:47,440
the king or queen, I guess. And then um

881
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:50,000
the point is either to get the king to

882
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,919
really like you or to assassinate him.

883
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,040
But if you want to um assassinate him,

884
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:54,800
you have to kill off all the other

885
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:57,680
players first. So it's kind of like a

886
00:34:54,800 --> 00:35:01,200
betrayal and deceit game and stuff.

887
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,200
>> So betrayal

888
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,839
Okay.

889
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:08,480
>> Uh, yep. So, another game is about uh

890
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:10,880
reducing your opponent's mo mobility by

891
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,800
placing cards that represent walls and

892
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,160
placing other cards to uh rotate various

893
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,440
walls and your opponent is doing the

894
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,440
same thing. So, you could sort of

895
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:20,000
envision the uh Tron life cycle game

896
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:21,599
without any hint of reflex uh removed

897
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,760
completely. So,

898
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:26,160
>> oh that would be really cool.

899
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,480
So, it's all just a strategic uh

900
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:32,320
placement of walls to reduce your

901
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:34,240
opponent's mobility. Cool.

902
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,240
>> Uh yeah, I think you can just make a lot

903
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,760
of Tetris boss and then like every time

904
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,359
you select one, give to the other

905
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,359
player, let them play some of the

906
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:43,680
Tetris. See who got the most rows

907
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:48,079
remove.

908
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:49,760
>> So, so Tetris blocks. Got it.

909
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:51,760
>> Okay.

910
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:54,160
This is kind of like Pokemon except now

911
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:56,560
it's you have you raise zombies or you

912
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:58,640
catch zombies except so you have

913
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,880
different types of zombies. So may like

914
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:03,200
maybe take some from like the Left 4

915
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:06,079
Dead universe or something or just

916
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,599
Resident Evil or something

917
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:10,560
and you have and then you could do like

918
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:13,440
a like versus like other people or

919
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:16,800
something.

920
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:18,320
>> Um I thought of having cards. I I don't

921
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,480
know whether there would be like words

922
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:22,320
or a few words linked together, but you

923
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,680
would go around and each round you would

924
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,520
the goal would be to build a story. So

925
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,520
each person would play a card face down

926
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:29,040
or something. So it' be a mechanic like

927
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,640
apples to apples except you're like

928
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:33,520
progressively building a story and if

929
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,800
people like the the your addition to the

930
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,160
story

931
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,359
>> then you get points.

932
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:40,359
>> Apple story.

933
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:40,359
>> Yeah.

934
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:51,680
>> All right. Uh,

935
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:53,280
>> sure. Okay. Moving away from drafting.

936
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:57,440
>> Okay. So, I have another game idea

937
00:36:53,280 --> 00:37:00,240
called Are You Asylum? Um,

938
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:01,760
>> it essentially uh

939
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:04,240
>> Are you a Sylon?

940
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:07,839
>> Are You Asylum? It essentially like

941
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:09,280
broad brush strokes steals the um skill

942
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:10,720
resolution mechanic from Battle Star

943
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:14,079
Galactic for the board game and then

944
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:15,599
strips it down to um secret sylons

945
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:19,839
sabotaging people and then people

946
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:21,920
accusing them and then everybody crying.

947
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:23,119
>> Uh so I really like Harvest Moon. So, I

948
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:25,119
was thinking that maybe there could be

949
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:27,520
like a harvest moving card, competitive

950
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:30,240
card game, and like uh I guess you have

951
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:32,079
a certain like amount of stamina each

952
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:34,000
turn and like cards are actions and

953
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:35,520
stuff and whoever has like the biggest

954
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,720
harvest at the end of the game would

955
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,520
win. I don't know how many turns it

956
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:41,440
would be, but yeah.

957
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:43,520
>> So, like farming.

958
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:45,359
>> Yeah. Okay.

959
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:48,079
>> All right. So, sort of building on the

960
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:49,760
monarchy and betrayal idea. This is game

961
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:51,839
about the heir to the throne. the king

962
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:54,240
is dying. In X turns, you and the other

963
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:56,079
players are going to compete um to prove

964
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,520
who is the correct heir to the throne.

965
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,960
And you can do so through combat

966
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:01,119
directly with other players,

967
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,119
assassinations, or political uh

968
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:07,800
minations such as like accusing other

969
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:07,800
players of being baseorn. So

970
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:20,079
>> um actually uh just as a a favor uh when

971
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:21,599
you uh throw out your idea also throw uh

972
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:24,000
also mention your name because I'm still

973
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:25,599
learning everyone's names.

974
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,359
>> Okay. So I'm Ian.

975
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:30,880
>> Uh so I had this idea for a game called

976
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:32,880
Admiral Snack Bar.

977
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,480
So, the idea is each it's a competitive

978
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,160
game where each player is building up

979
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,640
their own sort of like snack shop and

980
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:41,280
they make a certain product, right? Um,

981
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:43,040
and the other players need that product

982
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,200
in some way to like enhance their own

983
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:47,040
things, but you can secretly poison

984
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,119
parts of your product so that when they

985
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:51,200
purchase them, they'll like get messed

986
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:52,480
up in some way. So, it's it's sort of

987
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,320
like a trade-off and you can like make

988
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,760
alliances and stuff like that.

989
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,760
>> You can say it's sort of like a trap.

990
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:00,400
>> Yeah, it's a trap.

991
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:03,839
>> There's the tagline right there.

992
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:05,359
Oh, no. It's a snack.

993
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:09,280
>> I don't know. Maybe. So, I was thinking

994
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:11,839
of a game, I guess, kind of like um when

995
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:14,480
like the Total Wars mixed with Nazi

996
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:16,560
Germany. And so, the point of the game

997
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:19,359
is you you want to snatch up uh

998
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:22,079
territories. And you can do this by

999
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:24,400
maybe attacking other players. Well, by

1000
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:25,599
territories is like cards. And you can

1001
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,280
do this by attacking other players or

1002
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:29,920
maybe making alliances which you can

1003
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:32,640
easily betray or maybe have like all the

1004
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:36,000
cards in the pile and you have to every

1005
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:39,040
turn you can take one and and try it and

1006
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,359
you get points by getting certain like

1007
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:43,839
combinations of lands I guess kind more

1008
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:46,640
like a risk right there as well.

1009
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:51,079
>> Compose

1010
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:51,079
the city like compos. Okay.

1011
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:05,359
Um, so I was thinking of like a trick

1012
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:06,720
taking game, but uh the idea is there's

1013
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:08,480
four players and you're trying to get

1014
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:10,560
the second most tricks each round and

1015
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:12,160
then there are cards that like allow you

1016
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:14,880
to swap out other cards at the end of a

1017
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:16,640
round and like other things that are

1018
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,480
tricky.

1019
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:21,200
So,

1020
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:23,760
>> it's the second best

1021
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:27,320
trick or second most tricks or something

1022
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,320
like that, but yeah.

1023
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:34,119
Okay.

1024
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:39,760
>> So, I think sort of a I guess put

1025
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:42,000
succinctly, scrabble means chicken.

1026
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,680
So like

1027
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,599
you have a bunch of people playing and

1028
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:48,240
they play cards in the middle and you

1029
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:50,640
have to make words out and then if you

1030
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:52,160
make longer words you get more points

1031
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:54,000
and so forth and so forth. Maybe your

1032
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:56,960
letter is more rare and get more points.

1033
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,359
But the catch is that the word is longer

1034
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:04,800
you're you can't gain as much point like

1035
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:07,119
your point gain like is dim is dim for

1036
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:10,480
it's proportional to how long the word

1037
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:10,480
is you make.

1038
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,839
Uh, I'm Beto and I wanted to combine

1039
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:18,160
like Mario Karts and Chronauts. So, like

1040
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:20,560
the idea of like you're racing like

1041
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,839
through time like somebody has some like

1042
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,960
somebody's like the main guy that's

1043
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:24,800
trying to get to some place, everyone

1044
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:26,640
else is trying to stop them and your

1045
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,560
like abilities or weapons only work in

1046
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,839
certain time periods and stuff like

1047
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:32,560
that. And so you have like the time

1048
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:34,880
travel and the items from Chronauts and

1049
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:38,200
then like the racing and attacking from

1050
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,200
Mario Kart.

1051
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,839
Michelle.

1052
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:43,200
>> My name is Michelle. Um, so I was

1053
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:45,680
envisioning something like ricochet

1054
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:47,359
robots, but where the two people

1055
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:51,200
basically, so the point is that everyone

1056
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:53,280
has uh a set of like uh cards that have

1057
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:55,119
pathways or grids or walls that you can

1058
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:57,920
bounce off of and you build a grid with

1059
00:41:55,119 --> 00:42:00,400
your opponent and the there's one robot

1060
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,800
piece that you have to try to bounce off

1061
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:05,680
the walls to reach some specific goal.

1062
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:10,599
You can go to the other player.

1063
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:10,599
Bill Walt and Robots are

1064
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,200
>> Patrickhead.

1065
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,640
>> Okay.

1066
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:21,119
>> Patrick and Charlie.

1067
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:24,240
>> Um, so this is a game where the players

1068
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:25,520
are uh owners of businesses and

1069
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:28,000
depending on the nature of the business,

1070
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:29,440
they might have mutual dependencies that

1071
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,079
would be beneficial for people to get

1072
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:35,119
more money. But then uh as the market

1073
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:38,240
goes bad, they'll have to play cards to

1074
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:44,200
uh cut off the ties between companies.

1075
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:44,200
And so I call it objectivism game.

1076
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:50,839
>> That that was probably a better term

1077
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:50,839
than what I write down.

1078
00:42:55,119 --> 00:43:01,520
Uh so there's a slight variation on the

1079
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:04,079
uh precision beast idea, but uh I'm now

1080
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:07,200
imagining it possibly as a as a sort of

1081
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:08,720
falling real time type deal. So every

1082
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:12,160
turn you're getting dealt cards and you

1083
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:14,319
have cards that can modify the the

1084
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,760
dealing pattern so that can discard

1085
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:17,280
other players cards or can get them to

1086
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:19,520
be skipped so on and so forth. And you

1087
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:21,119
also have cards that can add various

1088
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,640
modifiers to your beast. And the goal of

1089
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:24,319
the game is that by the end, like by the

1090
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:27,440
time the deck has been entirely dealt,

1091
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:29,599
you have the most badass um creature

1092
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,480
that you've created and that you'd have

1093
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:31,839
to figure out and there might be an

1094
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,880
optimal way to rearrange things. So, as

1095
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:34,000
you're getting cards, you have to try to

1096
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,040
figure out how to rearrange them. And at

1097
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,720
the same time, other players could be

1098
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,240
discarding stuff and you have to deal

1099
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,680
with all these things at the same time.

1100
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,680
And then at the end of game, you have to

1101
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,880
freeze, see who has the best one, and it

1102
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,560
could be really bad, you know, quick

1103
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:47,680
game and very hilarious.

1104
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:49,280
>> Say procedural classes. kind of like

1105
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:51,119
building creature plus

1106
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:56,200
>> um

1107
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:56,200
okay this game is monkey or Shakespeare.

1108
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:01,520
>> Okay, so there are several different

1109
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:03,680
several different piles of cards. Each

1110
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:06,800
of them has words on them in Shakespeare

1111
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:09,200
and English. Um the object of the game

1112
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,720
so some of them

1113
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:12,160
are going to be played by players. Some

1114
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:15,440
of them are going to be like random

1115
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:17,599
number generators essentially. So the

1116
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:20,560
players that are playing as covert

1117
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:22,960
Shakespeers select cards and then place

1118
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:24,720
them face down in a common pool. Then

1119
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,839
the top cards from all the other decks

1120
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:28,000
get placed in the pool and then

1121
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:30,319
everything gets shuffled up. And then

1122
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,760
each of these different um piles is

1123
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:34,160
going to be a different color. And so

1124
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:36,400
you'll spell out sentences in the color

1125
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:38,160
progressively based on the card draws.

1126
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,000
And the object of the game for the other

1127
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,680
players who aren't hidden Shakespearees

1128
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,680
is trying to try and work out who is the

1129
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:46,079
Shakespeare who's a Shakespeare. They're

1130
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:48,800
just trying to spell the pre-arranged

1131
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:51,119
sentence beforehand is and who are just

1132
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:54,000
monkey piles. All right. Well, there

1133
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:56,560
that was so detect the random number

1134
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,880
generator.

1135
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:01,119
Um, Beethoven. I want to take that like

1136
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,480
tanks versus robot game that we played

1137
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:04,880
before on the paper and make it into

1138
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:06,800
like a card game between players and

1139
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:09,119
like the tanks can like level up and

1140
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:13,240
like you can change your uh specific

1141
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:13,240
strategy and that kind of stuff.

1142
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:17,599
>> Would the robot still be like

1143
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:20,720
deterministic or something?

1144
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:23,680
>> Uh, up in the air.

1145
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:27,319
Um let's see who who this side hasn't

1146
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:27,319
gone yet actually.

1147
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:37,520
>> Um

1148
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:40,480
so one mechanic is uh any game that has

1149
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:42,800
a high amount of trading of cards. Uh I

1150
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:44,079
mean you can imagine anything from a go

1151
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,599
fish type thing to something more

1152
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:47,839
complicated. However, you don't

1153
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:51,359
mechanically enforce uh the trade of

1154
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:54,240
cards. So there is basically lying in

1155
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:59,119
that narrative. Um also playing off of

1156
00:45:54,240 --> 00:46:01,839
the uh robot tank idea a game where

1157
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:03,359
basically your strategy is mitigated by

1158
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:06,480
the cards you play rather than the

1159
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:09,920
actual characteristics. So the cards

1160
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:12,560
play dictate how another deck or another

1161
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:16,280
mechanic is run rather than you directly

1162
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:16,280
interfacing with that.

1163
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:24,160
modification

1164
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:26,480
with

1165
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:28,160
an

1166
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:30,160
adjusting. So I just have idea about

1167
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,920
like your silon game. I think it's

1168
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:34,000
really interesting. That's good thing

1169
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:36,240
maybe it's even it will help if you can

1170
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,640
play two characters instead of one like

1171
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:40,640
if so if four people you have eight

1172
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:42,720
characters that determine the identity

1173
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:47,200
first and you can play either of the

1174
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:48,240
character. So, two player silent

1175
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:51,480
not two play two characters.

1176
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,480
>> Two characters.

1177
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:05,520
>> Sure. Uh, Andrew, so you can have

1178
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:07,839
something that's sort of like a MIT

1179
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:09,760
game. So, you're an MIT student and

1180
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:12,079
you're going through pizzas. We'd be

1181
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:14,240
doing like energy drinks to help you

1182
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:17,920
along through the night. Social events

1183
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:18,720
can hang out at Harvard for a night.

1184
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,079
Career fair.

1185
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:21,920
>> That would be a debug.

1186
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:24,160
>> Yeah, exactly.

1187
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:27,319
Sorry. You force other people to hit for

1188
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:27,319
a night.

1189
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:37,599
>> Uh, anything else? Second one's got

1190
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:40,000
Okay, Dion, this is I guess it's so MIT

1191
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:42,560
or Harvard. So this one is a you have to

1192
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,079
decide there's some pl so let's say you

1193
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:46,960
you're in design class and you're trying

1194
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:49,599
to build a project but so there's some

1195
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:51,040
students that some students are MIT most

1196
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:53,200
of them are but then there's one or two

1197
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:54,400
Harvard students and so everyone's

1198
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:56,240
trying to build this project but the

1199
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:58,400
Harvard students

1200
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:01,520
is messing it up or maybe it could be

1201
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:03,359
from MIT or Caltech and so the the other

1202
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:05,920
student that's not MIT is trying to

1203
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:06,960
screw up your project and so you by the

1204
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:12,079
end of the game you want to figure out

1205
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:14,880
who that person is or or like maybe I

1206
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:18,400
don't you take turns and you make an

1207
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:21,839
addition to it's something like that.

1208
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:23,440
>> Uh so this came up only a few seconds

1209
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:26,880
ago in my brain. I'm setting I imagine

1210
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:30,400
this for this might be something like a

1211
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:31,920
dark elf realm underground and there's

1212
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:34,559
like various houses or various families

1213
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:36,480
of dark elves and there's one that that

1214
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:39,119
is not controlled by players. I guess

1215
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:41,599
it's deterministic. It follows a set uh

1216
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:44,559
set rules. And players every turn can

1217
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:47,119
can play certain cards to influence the

1218
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:50,079
behavior of this non-player entity the

1219
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:51,920
next turn. And basically players are

1220
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:53,599
buying for influence over this

1221
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:56,000
non-player entity which can then do

1222
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:58,559
benevolent or malevolent things towards

1223
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,400
players. And it might be only

1224
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:02,720
semi-obvious depending on how cards are

1225
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:06,000
played who exactly took certain actions

1226
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:08,160
to get the um this this like master

1227
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,079
house to to give favor, remove favor

1228
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:11,280
from one player or another. And so it'

1229
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:12,720
be a game where you're trying to beat

1230
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:14,240
other players at the same time trying to

1231
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:16,160
figure out who's on your side, who's not

1232
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:19,720
on your side, and forging alliances and

1233
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:19,720
betraying each other.

1234
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:24,000
>> Uh so everyone's a guy at a party and

1235
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:27,319
the objective is trying to get a girl at

1236
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,319
the end of the night.

1237
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:32,240
called a fret bowl. Is that a card?

1238
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,440
>> You could screw other people over by

1239
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:35,359
like going up to them and bringing them

1240
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:36,720
embarrassing stories or you would be

1241
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:39,680
like really nice and like try to meet

1242
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:41,920
the girls friend and based off an AI

1243
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:44,160
kind of move.

1244
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:47,839
>> Yeah.

1245
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:50,160
Okay. Um, so Ian, uh, you have a game

1246
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:51,680
where the objective is is all the

1247
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:53,440
players are sort of actually trying to

1248
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:56,240
build a physical house of cards out of

1249
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:59,280
the cards, but each card has like, uh,

1250
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:01,680
an an in-game mechanical effect as well.

1251
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:03,440
And then there's like possibly the

1252
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:05,200
actual structure determines something as

1253
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:10,240
well. You'd have to do with like really

1254
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:13,599
thick cards. Okay, so House of Cards

1255
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:16,000
Jenga with the cards of cards.

1256
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:17,839
>> There would be a mechanic. Actually, my

1257
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,200
idea was building a house, but not with

1258
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:20,720
a house of cards. But that's a better

1259
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:22,160
idea.

1260
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:24,319
Adding a mechanic would be like you can

1261
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:26,960
play an action card that's like a a

1262
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:29,040
storm destroys the west wall of your

1263
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,960
opponent's house or something. In your

1264
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:32,480
case, it has

1265
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:34,160
>> like

1266
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:39,040
your favorite.

1267
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:40,880
>> Okay. Uh Jason uh Jason so the idea is

1268
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:43,200
you're on a student project or corporate

1269
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:45,359
project where some team doomed to fail.

1270
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:47,119
Uh so your objective is to make you look

1271
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:49,040
as good as you can whether by making the

1272
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:50,240
project better or by making sure other

1273
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:53,240
people are responsible for it being

1274
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:53,240
worse.

1275
00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:01,079
>> A terrible microcosm for the first

1276
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:01,079
design.

1277
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:08,520
Don't fail too badly.

1278
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:13,760
>> Brian Brian,

1279
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:15,760
>> um, there's all this talk of drafting. I

1280
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:17,359
started thinking about auction games. So

1281
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:19,839
like an auction game where there's like

1282
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:21,119
some some different points and maybe if

1283
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:23,200
you collect certain types of points,

1284
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:24,480
it's good. And then also like some of

1285
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,760
the cards you can add additional

1286
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,760
mechanics for yourself. So you can like

1287
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:29,359
bid for a card that later you can play

1288
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:31,040
and have everyone else bid and then you

1289
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:33,040
have to go bid like after them or

1290
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:35,040
something like that. But everyone has

1291
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:38,040
the same amount of points at the

1292
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:38,040
beginning.

1293
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:42,119
>> Yeah. Points

1294
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,599
from

1295
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:47,119
>> Jason by the way. Yeah. going back to my

1296
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:48,720
guys that are party one. Uh there's a

1297
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:53,960
way a mechanic where people could bring

1298
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:53,960
in real stories um and real

1299
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,520
>> but you can obviously lie and make it

1300
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,599
work for someone else but then you lose

1301
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:04,480
points for lying

1302
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:06,800
guy.

1303
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:08,720
>> Do you see

1304
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:11,839
that for people?

1305
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:14,240
So, a game it's like a it's like an RPG

1306
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:16,640
card game where you know you each have

1307
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:18,880
your set which is like of of things you

1308
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:20,319
can do and like equipment you have uh

1309
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,760
and then there's like an encounter deck

1310
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:23,760
and these keep getting flipped over and

1311
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:26,400
then people have to react to this but

1312
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:28,480
it's not quite coop cooperative because

1313
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:31,599
at the end there's like something that

1314
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:32,880
only one person can get. Um so, you

1315
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:34,240
know, maybe they have to like duke it

1316
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:37,480
out at the end if there's more than one

1317
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:37,480
person left.

1318
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:42,000
Yeah. Um, so bringing up auction

1319
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,480
mechanics, uh, there is a bidding

1320
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,760
mechanic that is interesting from a

1321
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:48,480
theoretical standpoint that never

1322
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:50,880
implemented where, uh, if you have some

1323
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:54,319
or if you have a thing that's being

1324
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:55,760
bidded for uh, or you have everyone

1325
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:58,079
assign something that they get from some

1326
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:59,359
pile and then if someone feels that they

1327
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:01,200
aren't happy with what they have, they

1328
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:02,720
trade it with someone else's and either

1329
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:05,680
put some amount of money on the other

1330
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:07,760
item or some decremental uh, type object

1331
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:09,359
on their item.

1332
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:11,680
The bidding system comes out of pirates

1333
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:13,599
trying to spill out booty and instead of

1334
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:17,839
>> making everyone happy to win.

1335
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:20,800
>> So bidding bidding by by reducing other

1336
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:22,960
people's bids. Is that a good

1337
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:24,640
description?

1338
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:27,680
>> It's a bidding system in which everyone

1339
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:29,920
has something and then you trade

1340
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:32,920
and add value until everyone feels it's

1341
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,920
equal.

1342
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:44,960
Uh let me

1343
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:47,440
>> So my idea was like it's so you have two

1344
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:49,839
team maybe like four players but and you

1345
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:52,720
have it's like an RPG and so before you

1346
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:56,240
start you have to draft or you have to

1347
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:58,720
yeah draft like equipment and like

1348
00:53:56,240 --> 00:54:01,680
spells you can do and so then you you

1349
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:04,000
have two like team battles against each

1350
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:05,839
other and the way you determine

1351
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,160
Like

1352
00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:10,240
what happens is maybe like a warlike

1353
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:12,960
system where you have each opponent has

1354
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:15,119
a deck and we just shuffle take the top

1355
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:17,839
card of the deck with the top the

1356
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:21,800
highest card wins and so that determines

1357
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:21,800
damage and such done.

1358
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:26,880
>> I don't like it.

1359
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:29,440
Uh, so sort of taking off the RPG idea,

1360
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:31,680
but adding on like a randomly generated

1361
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:33,040
like board or castle that like one

1362
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:34,720
player has to defend and everyone else

1363
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:37,119
is trying to attack into and he has to

1364
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:38,800
like set up his defenses around and like

1365
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:40,319
but he's also a controlling character.

1366
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:42,160
So he can move his guy around the board

1367
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:44,240
to like choose one of the guys to defend

1368
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:45,599
I guess. So essentially an RPG with

1369
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,720
randomly generated board as well.

1370
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:47,760
>> Defender castle.

1371
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,880
>> Yeah.

1372
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:51,680
>> Castle defense.

1373
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:54,240
>> So I like so sort of building off of the

1374
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:56,000
idea of pirates booty. I like the idea

1375
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:58,240
that you have a bunch of items within

1376
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:00,720
the game which uh the value for them is

1377
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:02,720
chosen randomly so that it's unknown

1378
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:04,240
what the value of the items are. So you

1379
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,760
just have the items and various players

1380
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:07,680
can make various moves like choose to

1381
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,200
appraise an item by paying some gold.

1382
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:10,720
And the idea is you want to try to get

1383
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:12,480
the item that's worth the most amount of

1384
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:14,559
money during any round to like get the

1385
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:19,640
most amount of gold.

1386
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:19,640
>> The most get the maximum value.

1387
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:25,119
I'm running out of space. So, I'm gonna

1388
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:30,040
be ending this soon, but

1389
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:30,040
actually I'm too

1390
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:33,160
interesting

1391
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:38,079
factories with different products and so

1392
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,520
you can either um so you want to b

1393
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:40,960
different items, but for some people it

1394
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:43,280
might be necessary to have a certain raw

1395
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:45,040
bit not necessary. So, it's going to

1396
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:46,640
things are going to have different

1397
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:48,079
values for different people. Then you

1398
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:49,119
can also get highend stuff for low-end

1399
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:50,400
stuff and the randomness is going to

1400
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:52,240
come in where if you have low-end stuff

1401
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:56,079
a user behavior product then you kind of

1402
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:57,119
lose money and stuff like that.

1403
00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:59,280
>> M

1404
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:01,760
>> um in a bidding sort of game you could

1405
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:03,680
be bidding for space and say uh for like

1406
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:05,119
space to use the Hubble telescope but

1407
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:10,200
before you can do this you have to pass

1408
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:10,200
a couple hurdles like taking Jab or

1409
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:15,839
>> use the Hubble. That's awesome.

1410
00:56:13,359 --> 00:56:20,200
>> One of the first hurdles

1411
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:20,200
I I don't got a video for that.

1412
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:28,180
>> Uh tower defense the card game.

1413
00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:28,180
[Music]

1414
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:33,359
>> That's a lot of math.

1415
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:35,520
>> Um

1416
00:56:33,359 --> 00:56:37,599
>> slight variation dungeon keeper the card

1417
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:41,280
game. So, I' I'd imagine that there

1418
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:42,880
would be several lanes down which uh uh

1419
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:44,480
enemies would come and you would

1420
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:46,079
collaborate with other players to create

1421
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:48,079
buildings on the other of those lanes

1422
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:50,400
that would then generate either traps

1423
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:51,839
along the way or your own units that

1424
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:54,559
would mark down the lanes to encounter

1425
00:56:51,839 --> 00:56:56,000
the enemies. And every turn you you run

1426
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:57,359
the game yourself. So, you run your

1427
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,640
opponent and it it automatically

1428
00:56:57,359 --> 00:56:59,839
advances and sends stuff at you that's

1429
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:00,960
you know drawn from decks and you have

1430
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:03,040
to be able to time stuff right and all

1431
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:05,040
that not to get your core destroyed

1432
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:08,040
basically.

1433
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:08,040
Okay.

1434
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:11,520
>> I'm just thinking of the idea of tower

1435
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,839
defense, the card game. Combine that

1436
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:15,200
with falling. The idea that uh turns are

1437
00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:16,559
happening at the same time. So, you have

1438
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:18,240
one player who's playing like the

1439
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:20,640
zombies invading and he's just basically

1440
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:22,240
going like 1 2 3 four. That's like a

1441
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:24,160
zombie advanced four steps or something

1442
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:26,240
by placing cards down. Then the other

1443
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:28,160
player is trying to place defenses just

1444
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:30,000
as fast, but has to like discard cards

1445
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:34,839
as well. So, it's really a game of how

1446
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,839
well you are able to handle cards. But

1447
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:39,040
>> I had another idea in the in the vein of

1448
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:42,240
falling, but it would be like Russian

1449
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:44,000
roulette. Um, so everyone's like trying

1450
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:45,280
to have everyone else die and not them.

1451
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,319
And then you can play excuse cards, be

1452
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:48,079
like, "Oh, I have to go to the bathroom.

1453
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:49,440
I'll be right back." Or like calling

1454
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:51,680
somebody else out and calling them the

1455
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:54,000
chicken or something. Maybe play with

1456
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:59,000
macho points.

1457
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Uh, I think that's Russian excuses.

1458
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:06,720
this.

1459
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,319
>> So players take turns being a

1460
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:10,720
prospective high schooler who wants to

1461
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:14,240
go to college and the other players take

1462
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:16,400
are therefore admissions officers and as

1463
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:19,839
a student you're trying to get into the

1464
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:22,480
college that gives you the most

1465
00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:24,079
>> swag anything and as admissions officers

1466
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:29,000
you're trying to give them the least. So

1467
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:29,000
admissions are usually like

1468
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:32,599
>> admissions offic

1469
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:37,760
mechanic for his idea. Um so you could

1470
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,880
kind of have a ball where you say I'm

1471
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:40,799
going to the bathroom and then someone

1472
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:42,319
else will call you call you out. You

1473
00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:45,040
either have the bathroom card you

1474
00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:47,200
actually go to the bathroom.

1475
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:49,599
>> So I mean that's a mechanic a bunch of

1476
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:51,040
games.

1477
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:53,200
>> Yeah. The full bladder card.

1478
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:55,040
>> Yeah.

1479
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:56,880
Uh this is a very simple mechanic but

1480
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:59,119
you're try you basically place cards

1481
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:00,720
down to try to create a path from some

1482
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:02,000
predetermined point to another. But in

1483
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:04,000
that way you can you know block other

1484
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:06,799
players by placing cards.

1485
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,880
>> So creating pass and blocking them.

1486
00:59:06,799 --> 00:59:10,079
>> Okay. I think it works.

1487
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:11,920
>> I think we're done.

1488
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:15,839
>> Yeah.

1489
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:17,359
>> Because I can't I'm not tall enough to

1490
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:18,160
>> All right.

1491
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:19,920
at the bottom.

1492
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:21,520
>> So yeah, I guess I could write down at

1493
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:23,680
the bottom, but that would be a painful

1494
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:26,079
for folks to look at it. So I mean these

1495
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:28,799
are just, you know, memory junks what we

1496
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:31,520
got up here. You know, um none of these

1497
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:34,960
ideas need to be taken wholesale for

1498
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:37,119
your initial idea for the team. But

1499
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:39,599
those were some of the things that folks

1500
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:42,480
remembered. Um, I would actually like

1501
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:44,319
folks to grab one of the uh thumb tacks

1502
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:46,480
over there once you've written down your

1503
00:59:44,319 --> 00:59:48,480
ideas on the card uh and pin them up on

1504
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:50,559
the wall. Uh, you don't have to be

1505
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:52,960
closely tied. In fact, spread them out a

1506
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:54,079
little bit so that people can look at so

1507
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:56,000
that a few people can look at the wall

1508
00:59:54,079 --> 00:59:57,680
at a time. Uh, and the rest of the class

1509
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:00,400
basically is just time for you guys to

1510
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:03,119
talk. You know, you you you talk, get to

1511
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:06,000
know each other's things better. Um and

1512
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:07,280
uh start discussing about you know

1513
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,240
projects that you should work together

1514
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:10,240
over there.
