1
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:12,200
At MIT, we tend to view the world a bit

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,719
differently than

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:17,279
most. Maybe it's our need to see past

4
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,840
the obvious or our dissatisfaction with

5
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,279
the status

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,920
quo. Maybe we're just obsessed with

7
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:27,240
asking the next question and solving the

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,240
next problem.

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,760
Whatever the case, we believe that

10
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,840
there's nothing in the world that can't

11
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,079
be made

12
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:43,520
better, stronger, cleaner,

13
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:44,360
faster, smarter, more life affirming,

14
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,760
life

15
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,760
saving, life improving.

16
00:00:50,399 --> 00:01:00,879
So we discover, teach, ponder, and

17
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:06,560
manage. We build, design, and explore.

18
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:11,119
We invent, innovate, create and cure. We

19
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,119
apply science and we engineer the

20
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:20,159
[Music]

21
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:22,680
future because it is exploring and

22
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:26,080
solving that moves us

23
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,240
forward. It lifts us. It's what makes

24
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:33,080
the world

25
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:33,080
better. It's what makes us MIT.

26
00:01:39,460 --> 00:02:06,280
[Music]

27
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:09,879
Good morning. Hello. Or as we say in

28
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:12,879
Vienna, Savos to everyone. My name is

29
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:15,040
Cornelia and with great pleasure I would

30
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:17,120
like to welcome you here at the

31
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,640
headquarters of the Austrian Federal

32
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:24,280
Economic Chamber. Welcome to the MIT

33
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:29,840
Europe Conference 2025.

34
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:33,840
[Applause]

35
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:37,519
So as you all know this year's theme is

36
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:40,239
the future of manufacturing and it

37
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:43,360
explores the industry's challenges and

38
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:46,160
also the opportunities when it comes to

39
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,160
global shifts when it comes to new

40
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:52,160
technologies and of course when it comes

41
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:54,519
to changing workforce roles. The MIT

42
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:58,239
Europe Conference is one of the leading

43
00:02:54,519 --> 00:03:00,560
technology and research conferences here

44
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,599
in Austria. And without a doubt, it's

45
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:07,040
one of the most forwardthinking business

46
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,560
events here in Europe. And right at the

47
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,760
beginning, I would like to take the

48
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:15,280
chance and invite all of you and

49
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:17,879
encourage all of you to engage engage

50
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:21,239
with decision makers, with

51
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:24,640
entrepreneurs, with executives, with

52
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:28,080
startups to have a conversation about

53
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,720
the future. So what I can tell you right

54
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,879
away is that we do have a quite

55
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:37,360
intensive program ahead of us. So I

56
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:41,120
suggest let's get started. And before we

57
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,840
dive into this year's sessions and this

58
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,360
year's keynote

59
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:48,080
presentations, let's start with today's

60
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,760
opening speeches. So first of all, I

61
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,920
would like to invite the vice president

62
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,879
of the Austrian Federal Economic Chamber

63
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:58,200
to join me here on stage. So ladies and

64
00:03:54,879 --> 00:04:10,519
gentlemen, please welcome Carmen Gobi.

65
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:14,120
[Music]

66
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:16,560
stage. Dear entrepreneurs, esteemed

67
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:19,759
experts, distinguished guests, ladies

68
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,720
and gentlemen, imagine waking up

69
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,800
tomorrow in a world where manufacturing

70
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,400
has undergone a radical transformation

71
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:32,479
overnight. Machines learn faster than

72
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:35,520
ever before. Materials seem to emerge

73
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:38,560
from thin air, and factories operate in

74
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:41,680
seamless symbiosis with AI, adapting to

75
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:44,639
changes in real time. Picture a

76
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,880
production line that detects and fixes

77
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:50,880
errors before they even occur.

78
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:53,120
components that regenerate themselves

79
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,919
when damaged and algorithms that not

80
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,639
only predict customer demand but produce

81
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:01,199
it in

82
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:03,680
advance. Self-repairing materials once

83
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:07,000
confined to the realm of science fiction

84
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,919
are now becoming reality in our

85
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,360
factories. Sounds

86
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:15,199
far-fetched perhaps, but the future of

87
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,919
manufacturing is not happening in a far

88
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:21,000
galaxy. It's happening here and it's

89
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:24,639
happening now and we are at the heart of

90
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:28,000
it. Why does this matter? Because our

91
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:30,800
industry is more than just a sector.

92
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,120
It's the backbone of our economy, the

93
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,759
foundation of our prosperity and the

94
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,400
driving force of innovation. If we get

95
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:41,440
this right, we will not only strengthens

96
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:45,039
Austria position but shape the way the

97
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,280
world manufactures, lives and works in

98
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:50,320
decades

99
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:54,080
ahead. But, and this is a big one, this

100
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:56,800
future will not shape itself. It demands

101
00:05:54,080 --> 00:06:00,160
courage. It demands curiosity. It

102
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,199
demands action today. Because those who

103
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,360
fail to innovate, those who will

104
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:06,280
stagnate. and those who stagnate will

105
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,759
fall

106
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:12,400
behind. With so many claiming to be

107
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,759
experts of the future, the Austrian

108
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:18,240
Economic Chamber is making a clear

109
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:21,039
stance. We only work with the best for

110
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,840
our member companies and today we are

111
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:27,120
very lucky and very proud to have the

112
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:29,230
best here, the experts of the MIT whom I

113
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:36,080
warmly warmly welcome.

114
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:38,319
[Applause]

115
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,039
MIT stands for groundbreaking research

116
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,520
and ideas that change the world. And

117
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:46,759
today they are here with us to show what

118
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,800
happens when technology meets

119
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:50,600
entrepreneurship. We will witness the

120
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,800
technologies that will transform our

121
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,440
factories. We will understand how

122
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,280
business models are

123
00:06:54,440 --> 00:07:00,800
evolving. And we will learn how not only

124
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,960
to keep up but actively shape the future

125
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,680
as

126
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:07,440
entrepreneurs. Think back 30 years ago.

127
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,880
Who would have believed that we would

128
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:15,319
one day control entire production lines

129
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:18,800
with a smartphone? And today we do just

130
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:21,000
that. So what will be possible in the

131
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,520
years ahead?

132
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,160
History has shown us that techn

133
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,880
technological leaps have repeatedly

134
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,240
disrupted entire

135
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:33,120
industries. The industrial revolution

136
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,960
began with the steam engine. Suddenly

137
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,160
muscle power was not longer the

138
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:41,039
bottleneck. Electrification made

139
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,960
factories more efficient and flexible.

140
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:45,240
We saw computers and automation

141
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:49,280
transformation uh transform the

142
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:52,880
workplace. The telephone took 75 years

143
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:57,080
to reach 50 million users. The internet

144
00:07:52,880 --> 00:08:00,199
just four. Facebook 10 months.

145
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:02,360
CHTP 5

146
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:05,520
days. And

147
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:07,520
today, today we stand at the threshold

148
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,800
of a new revolution. The era of

149
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,879
artificial intelligence, quantum

150
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:15,520
computing, and automotive systems. The

151
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:18,240
key difference from the past revolutions

152
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:21,599
is speed. Never before have techn

153
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:24,240
technological advances unfolded at such

154
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:27,280
an exponential pace. What seemed

155
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,720
impossible yesterday is reality today

156
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,399
and will be outdated by

157
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:35,440
tomorrow. The revolution presents a

158
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:38,399
unique opportunity for Austria. Those

159
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:41,479
who make the right decisions today and

160
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:44,480
now will not only compete on a global

161
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:47,720
scale, they will secure prosperity for

162
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:51,360
future generations and open to new

163
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:53,880
markets. But let's be clear, history has

164
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,800
also shown us what happens when we

165
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:59,760
underestimate techn technological

166
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,399
disruption. Kodak, we all know this

167
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:05,480
example, ruled the photography world

168
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:09,120
until it missed the transition to

169
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:12,440
digital. Nokia was an undisrupted leader

170
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:16,160
in mobile phones until the smartphone

171
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:18,160
arrived. Blockbuster fell to Netflix

172
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:21,360
because it clung to outdated business

173
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:24,240
models. Xerox invented the graphical

174
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:27,399
user interface yet um Apple and

175
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:30,720
Microsoft turned into billiond dollar

176
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:32,680
businesses. Those who fail to adapt,

177
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,560
those who fail to

178
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:39,920
save, they will be left

179
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:43,360
behind. Our message is clear. We do not

180
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:45,720
need less industry. We need more. more

181
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,560
industry, more businesses, more

182
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:50,360
innovation, more

183
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:53,279
entrepreneurs, more openness to new

184
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:56,600
technologies. But above all, we need an

185
00:09:53,279 --> 00:10:00,440
unshakable mindset that

186
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:03,080
progress is not a threat. That's an

187
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:06,320
invitation. An invitation to think

188
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:09,440
ahead, to shape change, and most

189
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:12,560
importantly, to be bold. Our economy is

190
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:15,519
at a turning point. Global competition

191
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:18,160
is intensifying. Innovation circles are

192
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,600
becoming shorter. Geopolitical shifts

193
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:23,680
demand great yet strategic

194
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:25,920
adaption. But one thing is certain.

195
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,200
Those who have the courage to invest in

196
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:31,160
research technology and new business

197
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:33,360
models today will be the leaders of

198
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:36,079
tomorrow. This is why the Austrian

199
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:39,040
Economic Chamber is committed to making

200
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:42,240
the future tangable.

201
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:44,160
We have transformed our Aenville Austria

202
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,240
into an international innovation and

203
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:49,680
technology scout connecting Austrian

204
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:51,920
entrepreneurs with the global leading

205
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:56,959
innovation ecosystem from the Silicon

206
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:58,959
Valley to Shaen from Boston to Tel Aviv.

207
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,640
We have built long-standing

208
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,800
collaborations with leading

209
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:06,160
international universities and research

210
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:08,360
institutions like MIT, ensuring direct

211
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,440
benefits for our

212
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:13,279
businesses. Our innovation map provides

213
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,959
companies with guidance and an

214
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:18,720
increasingly complex technology

215
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:21,680
landscape. And with the bold community,

216
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:26,040
we have placed Austria at the center of

217
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,040
a cross-cultural platform.

218
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:32,440
to bring together leaders, creatives,

219
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:36,360
pioneers in technology, the creative

220
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:40,800
sector, policy and research. And for

221
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:43,240
sure we as Austrian Economic Chamber, we

222
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:47,800
serve as the driving force in the

223
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,800
Austrian innovation policy.

224
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:54,680
A look at the world's top innovation

225
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:57,959
nations prove that success never was an

226
00:11:54,680 --> 00:12:00,880
accident. It is the result of strategic

227
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:04,480
decisions. We must create conditions

228
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:06,880
that encourage investment, cut red tape,

229
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,120
and provide young talent with the space

230
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:12,399
to turn ideas into market ready

231
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,320
solutions because today's technology is

232
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:18,800
the foundation of tomorrow's economic

233
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:22,040
growth. And let me make one final point.

234
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:24,639
Yes, global competition is becoming

235
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:27,200
tougher, but at the same time,

236
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:31,200
international collaboration is more

237
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:33,800
crucial than ever. We are not an island,

238
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,959
and for sure, we are not a

239
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:39,600
fortress. Austria is a successful export

240
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:42,320
nation. We can be proud of this. We are

241
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:45,279
an open country that thrives on strong

242
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,760
diversified trade relationships and fair

243
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:49,240
trade

244
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:52,240
agreements. The Austrian Economic

245
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:55,519
Chamber, we have always been and we will

246
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,560
ever be and we will remain a strong

247
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,519
voice for international

248
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:01,000
collaboration. This is why we are

249
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,920
committed to

250
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,160
fostering

251
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:08,760
collaboration not as a one-way street.

252
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:11,920
We have so much to offer to the world

253
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:14,079
precisely because we continue to learn

254
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,079
from

255
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:20,000
it. We are living through a time of

256
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:22,000
transformation. Artificial intelligence,

257
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,399
sustainable manufacturing, quantum

258
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,120
computing and advanced materials are

259
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:29,200
reshaping how we work and how we

260
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,560
produce.

261
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:36,320
The question is not whether the change

262
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:39,440
will happen but how we will use it and

263
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:43,360
whether we will shape them. What role

264
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,680
will Austria play? We will be consumers

265
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,800
of merge

266
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:51,000
technologies or the pioneers to lead the

267
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:55,200
transition. The answer is up to all of

268
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:58,000
us. Let's not just observe the future.

269
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:00,720
Let's actively create it. Let's do it

270
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,600
with vision, with courage, and with the

271
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,600
belief that Austria can be a global

272
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,120
leader in

273
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:10,720
innovation. Today is not a day for small

274
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:13,360
thinking. Today is a day to be bold.

275
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,880
Let's shape into this future with

276
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,720
curiosity, with passion, and with the

277
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:21,440
determination to shape the future of

278
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,760
manufacturing ourselves. Ladies and

279
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:27,360
gentlemen, a very warm welcome to the

280
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:31,519
MIT Conference 2025. Let's create the

281
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,519
future together and let's start

282
00:14:34,199 --> 00:14:40,399
today. Thank you very much Carmen

283
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:43,120
Gobi and I am now very much looking

284
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:45,600
forward to welcoming the second guest to

285
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,279
join me here on stage. He is the

286
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,440
director general of the Federal Ministry

287
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,600
of Labor and Economy. So ladies and

288
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,500
gentlemen, please join me in welcoming

289
00:14:51,600 --> 00:15:03,680
Florian Fracha.

290
00:14:53,500 --> 00:15:05,760
[Music]

291
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,480
So welcome one more time. It's good to

292
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,800
have you here with us today. So we

293
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,320
already heard we are living in

294
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:17,199
challenging economic times and it seems

295
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:19,680
particularly important to um on one side

296
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:21,920
strengthen research and innovation but

297
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,199
as common go already mentioned of course

298
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:27,040
also to promote international

299
00:15:24,199 --> 00:15:28,959
cooperation. So how exactly does the

300
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:31,839
Austrian government provide this kind of

301
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:34,880
support? Thank you so much and uh good

302
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:37,920
morning to to everyone. First maybe also

303
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:40,959
let me welcome our friends from MIT.

304
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:43,920
Thank you so much uh for joining us

305
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:46,079
today. Also a big thanks to the Austrian

306
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,399
Chamber of Commerce for organizing this

307
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:51,440
this conference. It's a big honor for

308
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:55,759
for us as a ministry for economy to

309
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:59,480
support this conference again. Um I'm in

310
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:01,839
in charge uh uh for innovation and for

311
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:04,720
international relations at the federal

312
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:07,759
ministry for labor and economy and I

313
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:12,000
think in both fields uh we can profit

314
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:14,320
from the from this cooperation. Um uh we

315
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,399
uh already heard how important

316
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:21,839
innovation uh is and uh I think u um

317
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:24,600
Austria can learn a lot from MIT when it

318
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:27,399
comes to innovation and when it comes to

319
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:31,040
entrepreneurship it's uh really really

320
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:33,759
important and um uh as you mentioned we

321
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:38,079
have really challenging times at the

322
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:40,480
moment uh when we look at uh uh growth

323
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:42,959
not only in in Austria but in whole

324
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:46,880
Europe. And I think in the in the short

325
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:50,720
uh term we have to uh lower energy

326
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:54,160
costs, lower labor costs to cut red

327
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:57,120
tape. But uh in the long term,

328
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:59,920
innovation is key. And so the the

329
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:04,880
Austrian government uh the new Austrian

330
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:07,520
government decided uh also uh with a

331
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:11,439
quite difficult budget situation at the

332
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:16,160
moment that we will invest more in

333
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:20,799
innovation in R&D and uh we set us

334
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:26,240
ourself the goal to have a R&D quot uh

335
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:29,240
of 4% uh in 2030. We are already uh uh

336
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,000
quite good in in Europe. We have now

337
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:34,720
3.3%

338
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:38,720
that's number three in in Europe. But we

339
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:42,640
want become first uh in Europe and with

340
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:45,520
that we will be a world leader in

341
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,840
innovation. That's our goal and um there

342
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,280
we have to invest. I would also like to

343
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,600
take the chance and talk a little bit

344
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:54,000
about the challenges of international

345
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,559
trading. So international trade also

346
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,120
faces a number of major hurdles as we

347
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:02,880
all know. So how is Austria reacting to

348
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:06,080
this? Um I'm I'm still a fan a big fan

349
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:09,280
of fair and free trade. Uh but yeah as

350
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:12,000
you said uh there are some uh other

351
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:16,000
players worldwide that don't share this

352
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:19,919
vision anymore unfortunately. Um so I I

353
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,960
think it's really important uh that uh

354
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:27,280
not only as Austria but as Europe uh

355
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:30,000
first uh we we look to new markets where

356
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:34,160
big growth is that we look to partners

357
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:38,400
where big potential is Austria is a

358
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:41,120
export nation. we are uh in the top 10

359
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:44,400
uh uh exporters nations worldwide when

360
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:46,480
it comes to per capita term. So it's

361
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:50,960
really really important for our

362
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:53,600
prosperity in in Austria and um one

363
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:57,760
thing in Austria is that uh we are still

364
00:18:53,600 --> 00:19:00,960
really focusing uh on Europe uh alone

365
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:04,000
30% of our exports going to Germany and

366
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:07,440
I think here we have to diversify that's

367
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,000
quite uh important uh second thing uh uh

368
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,559
important thing is what we as a federal

369
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,520
ministry for economy do we support

370
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:17,520
Austrian companies companies when they

371
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,840
want to go to new markets, when they

372
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,400
want to to export, we have the the

373
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,240
program go international that is also

374
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:28,120
managed together with the Austin Chamber

375
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:30,640
of of Commerce. Uh we had already over

376
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:33,440
46,000 Austrian companies that

377
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:36,640
participated in in this program and uh

378
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:39,919
we offer knowhow, we offer conferences

379
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:42,640
like this. Um we we offer a direct

380
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:45,600
funding to help the ocean companies to

381
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,880
go to new markets. We already heard a

382
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,760
lot about the importance of

383
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,200
international collaborations and

384
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:53,440
cooperations. So I would like to talk

385
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,360
about the transatlantic relations and

386
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,320
how do you see the way forward in an era

387
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:01,760
of renewed manufacturing focus. Yeah. Um

388
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:06,400
I I think the the uh bilateral relation

389
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:09,280
between Austria and the US uh uh are and

390
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:12,720
will also in the future be uh of really

391
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:15,600
really big uh importance. Um the US is

392
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:18,640
our second biggest trading uh partner

393
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:22,000
after after Germany and for that it's

394
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:25,360
really important that the bond between

395
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:28,159
Austria and Europe and the US uh will

396
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,960
will remain strong also in the in the

397
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:33,159
future in a political way in a economic

398
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:36,640
way and in a

399
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:39,919
academia way and I I think we as Europe

400
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:43,760
we have a lot to to offer. uh uh uh we

401
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:46,960
have uh 450,000 uh uh consumers. We have

402
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:50,720
a strong uh industrial basis especially

403
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:53,600
in uh in Austria. We have a really top

404
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:56,240
researchers in uh in Europe and in in

405
00:20:53,600 --> 00:21:01,039
Austria. So there's a lot of potential.

406
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:04,159
So I I think the way forward is to to uh

407
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:06,960
negotiate and to find uh solutions where

408
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:08,480
also both sides can can profit from.

409
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,240
Thank you very much. It's a great

410
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,080

to be here and welcome you to our 2025

430
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,559
MIT Europe conference. As I look around

431
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:21,120
this room um I'm excited to see so many

432
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:24,400
uh dedicated individuals passionate

433
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:27,520
about in innovation and collaboration.

434
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,440
Um today we gather not just as

435
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:32,640
representatives of our respective

436
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:35,440
industry and organizations but also as a

437
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:39,000
part of the global community um that

438
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:42,559
believes in the power of connection and

439
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:45,440
partnership. At MIT corporate relations

440
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:48,919
um we are committed to building u

441
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:52,640
meaningful relationships. Um

442
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:55,760
and I wanted to um talk to you about you

443
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:58,799
know we we uh try strive towards

444
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:01,280
building strategic um partnerships and

445
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:03,360
creating lasting impact and as we

446
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:06,080
explore the opportunities and challenges

447
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:09,120
of our interconnected world as we heard

448
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:12,000
the previous speakers um I'm reminded of

449
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:16,640
the importance of collaboration and

450
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:19,440
mutual support. Our work at MIT is more

451
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:21,880
than just forging connections. Uh it's

452
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:25,120
also about creating this network of

453
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:29,039
individuals, network of collaboration

454
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:30,360
um and driving uh positive change um on

455
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:34,880
a global

456
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:36,440
scale. So this is who we are at MIT. We

457
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:40,559
have

458
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:44,400
17,490 employees. We have about 1100 uh

459
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:47,520
faculty members and researchers. um uh

460
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:49,840
in terms of faculty is 1100 but uh about

461
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:53,840
4,200 researchers uh which include

462
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:56,559
postocs and all and 105 Nobel prize

463
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,960
winners. So um that that tells you the

464
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:02,240
scale of you know impact that we have at

465
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:05,919
MIT. Uh we have 4,500 undergraduate

466
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:08,240
students and we have uh 7,400 graduate

467
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:14,120
students. So from a student body it's

468
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:18,000
about 12,000 uh students um and 12% are

469
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:18,310
international. Um with that uh I also

470
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,960
wanted

471
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:23,840
[Music]

472
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,840
to oh do I point

473
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:34,000
here? Okay there it is. Um so I just

474
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:36,000
wanted to talk about uh industry

475
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,240
sponsored research and research impact.

476
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:42,080
Right. So if you look at uh what we have

477
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:45,200
at MIT, we have 65 plus research labs uh

478
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:48,320
centers and programs. We have about 840

479
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:51,120
million coming in from uh research

480
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:54,000
sponsored research on MIT campus. We

481
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:59,120
have about 608 US patents that were

482
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:03,200
awarded in FY 24 fiscal year 24. Um 323

483
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:07,520
uh issued patents. um about $40 million

484
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:11,279
in licensing revenue and 25 24 companies

485
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:14,400
formed in um 2024 fiscal year 2024. So

486
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:16,919
that gives you a a view into who we are

487
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:20,480
at MIT from a research impact uh

488
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:22,799
standpoint. Um we uh work

489
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,840
collaboratively across the different

490
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:27,760
departments, fields and institutional

491
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:30,400
boundaries. And as somebody mentioned, I

492
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:32,720
mean the uh we are not an island. Uh I

493
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:35,120
think uh you Carmen you mentioned that

494
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:39,440
we are definitely not an island right we

495
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:41,840
are a very um um uh porous uh institute

496
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,840
we don't have walls anybody can walk in

497
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:47,919
and walk out so I just wanted to

498
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:50,480
emphasize the fact that we are very um

499
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:54,320
uh ingrained in the collaborative uh

500
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:56,640
spirit at MIT uh nearly half of industry

501
00:25:54,320 --> 00:26:00,480
sponsored research comes from the

502
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:02,640
industrial um ILP members um member

503
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:05,840
companies. And so that is uh something

504
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:08,000
to uh to pay attention to because

505
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:12,799
through the industrial leazison program

506
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:15,039
we uh give access um or u showcase the

507
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:17,039
different uh opportunities within MIT

508
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:19,840
that would be the right uh opportunity

509
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:22,000
for you as an organization. Uh and again

510
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:24,559
always with the emphasis of glo you know

511
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:29,960
solving global problems and uh through

512
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:29,960
MIT's expertise um in different avenues.

513
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:35,480
Oh, sorry. I

514
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:38,400
jumped.

515
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:40,559
Okay. All right. Um I did want to uh

516
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:43,679
emphasize one other thing is that of

517
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:47,279
course we are great in many different um

518
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:51,360
uh areas but president Kluth who's our

519
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:54,720
uh new uh president at MIT she has laid

520
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:57,520
uh three specific areas where um she

521
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:00,880
wants MIT to uh focus on global

522
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:05,039
solutions right um so one is the MIT

523
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:07,279
climate project um the second one is MIT

524
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:09,679
heels which is the health sciences,

525
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:12,840
health and life sciences collaborative.

526
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:15,600
So solving for real health uh uh

527
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:19,000
challenges uh and other uh health

528
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:21,600
related um issues through um this

529
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,400
collaborative and then the last one is

530
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:27,600
AI and what we have uh create uh

531
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:30,880
developed uh at MIT is um the MIT

532
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:33,480
generative AI impact consortium and so

533
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:37,120
uh the idea is to through this

534
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:41,279
consortium come up um and come come

535
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:44,159
together to identify uh key challenges

536
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:46,400
uh address um solutions for that and

537
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:49,400
also look at what policies would be the

538
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,400
best.

539
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:57,039
Now, I did show you what MIT comprises

540
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:59,760
of in terms of 65 plus centers, 17,000

541
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:04,000
employees. But what does MIT really uh

542
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:06,080
encompass? And we encompass um uh five

543
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,240
schools and one college. the school of

544
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,399
engineering, school of science, school

545
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,480
of humanities, arts and uh social

546
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:15,120
sciences, school of architecture and

547
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,120
planning, uh school of Sloan School of

548
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:20,240
Management, uh and of course the

549
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:22,480
Schwarzman uh college of computing and

550
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:25,520
um so with through these different

551
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:28,279
schools and college we uh come together

552
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:31,679
to solve global

553
00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:34,399
problems and when I said we are not uh

554
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:36,240
an island, we are not an ivory tower, I

555
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:38,960
want to emphasize ize that by showing

556
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:43,120
this map. The maroon color that you see

557
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:46,399
is MIT uh activities or MIT uh buildings

558
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:49,200
if you will. Um and the rest of it

559
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:52,159
immediately juxtaposed is uh the

560
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,559
innovation ecosystem around MIT right so

561
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:58,080
the pink is the biioarma

562
00:28:54,559 --> 00:29:00,399
uh the blue uh the light blue is IT data

563
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:04,000
I would also urge you to think about it

564
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:06,559
as tough tech um and then there are dark

565
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,039
blue which is venture capital and the

566
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:11,039
green which is energy so I just want you

567
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:13,600
to see that this is all this is not a

568
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:16,720
full representation um this is just a

569
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:19,840
sprinkling but I want you to understand

570
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:24,720
uh what kind of uh ecosystem we have on

571
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:27,440
campus and this clearly shows you that

572
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,960
um and now I'll come to who we are uh

573
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,039
and I keep saying we are corporate

574
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,520
relations and I talked to you about uh

575
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:35,039
industry leazison program uh I didn't

576
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:38,480
talk to you about startup exchange but I

577
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:41,360
wanted to uh showcase who we are right

578
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:44,720
we are the gate or the doorway for

579
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:46,880
industry to access MIT and MIT to access

580
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,520
industry and how do we do that through

581
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:52,159
the industrial leazison program and the

582
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:54,799
interconnected uh or integrated startup

583
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:57,799
exchange program. The idea is for us to

584
00:29:54,799 --> 00:30:00,880
showcase all the um cutting edge

585
00:29:57,799 --> 00:30:04,240
research solutions that we are creating

586
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:07,279
at MIT through its uh different uh uh

587
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:09,840
departments uh schools and centers but

588
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:13,120
also um through our MIT connected

589
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:14,799
startups and introducing them to uh be

590
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:17,360
able to connect with you at the right

591
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:21,039
time uh as appropriate based on your

592
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:24,960
needs. Um so we have 200 plus members

593
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:27,039
member companies and we have 800 plus um

594
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:31,120
uh MIT connected startups that we

595
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:33,679
connect with uh as um as per your uh

596
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:36,799
needs. And I also wanted to let you know

597
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:38,799
that uh our program has about 30

598
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:42,159
different program directors and we have

599
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:44,320
a couple over here um that are available

600
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:46,159
to answer any questions if you want to

601
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:48,159
uh hear about the industry leazison

602
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:51,039
program or you can of course come to me

603
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:51,039
and talk to me as

604
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:58,720
well. I wanted to uh share with you that

605
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:00,000
I I said 200 plus member companies and

606
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,000
you may wonder who these member

607
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,039
companies are and this is the footprint

608
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:09,039
of who we are right we have about 30% in

609
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:11,120
North America but 40% in Asia 20% in

610
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:14,480
Europe and the rest of the world so this

611
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:17,039
is our footprint so truly we are not an

612
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:19,760
island we are global and so I just

613
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:24,399
wanted you to have that perspective and

614
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:24,399
um when when you uh hear about ILP

615
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:30,960
With that, I'm going to uh welcome you

616
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:34,080
all uh to MIT Europe conference and I

617
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:36,320
also wanted to uh thank the WKO for

618
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:38,720

619
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:41,600

00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:44,399
MIT and you know welcoming us the way

The floor is all yours.

634
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:34,360
[Music]

635
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:39,200
Okay, if we can start the

636
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:41,559
slides. Ah, okay. Welcome to the 2025

637
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,840
MIT Europe Conference, the future of

638
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:46,080
manufacturing. I'm Randall Wright,

639
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:48,559
program director with MIT's Office of

640
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:51,200
Corporate Relations. And as your guide

641
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:53,960
to today's program, together with you,

642
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:56,720
decision makers, entrepreneurs, business

643
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:58,880
executives, we will engage with MIT

644
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:01,919
faculty members, and their colleagues

645
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:03,679
from sister European institutions in a

646
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:05,440
conversation about the future of

647
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:08,000
manufacturing.

648
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:10,159
Manufacturing is central to the future

649
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,039
well-being of national economies and in

650
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:15,200
turn the global economy. Yet in the face

651
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:17,960
of extreme changes in geopolitical

652
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:20,760
views, technologies, industrial

653
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:23,360
practices, workforce roles and

654
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:26,000
expectations, trade policies, and

655
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:28,720
government and financial institutions,

656
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,279
manufacturing firms face unprecedented

657
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,919
challenges. These challenges are

658
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:36,480
especially important in the EU given the

659
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:38,919
rise of economic nationalism and

660
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:41,840
corresponding national industrial

661
00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:44,559
strategies. Today among some of the most

662
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:47,039
prominent MIT faculty members together

663
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:50,080
with colleagues from Frhaer Institute

664
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:52,519
and Technical University VIN address the

665
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:55,679
question how must we remake

666
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:59,720
manufacturing to secure national future

667
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,720
national and global prosperity.
