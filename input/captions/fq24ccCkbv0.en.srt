1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,439
I feel like social media has led to very

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,160
many terrible outcomes in our society.

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:07,279
And I often think 25 years ago, if we

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,800
knew what we know now, what would we

5
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:10,000
have done differently with social media?

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,440
What could we have done differently? I

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,719
don't really know the answer, but I feel

8
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,960
like that's a conversation we should be

9
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,400
having now about AI. We shouldn't get

10
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,760
behind. We know bad things are going to

11
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,119
come out of AI. We know good things that

12
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,880
come out of AI, just like bad and good

13
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,080
things that come with social media. We

14
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,279
need to be getting ahead of the bad

15
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,240
things in [music] a way we didn't with

16
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,560
social media.

17
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,519
>> So, it's up to us how AI can affect the

18
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,119
economy and how it's going to affect

19
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,880
life. It's up to whether we establish

20
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,800
the proper regulatory frameworks and the

21
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,800
proper way of thinking about it so that

22
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,640
we can deal with the negative effects

23
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,559
while capturing the positive effects.
