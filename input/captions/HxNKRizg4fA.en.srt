1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:08,240
And without further ado, uh Demetus uh

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,519
is going to Demetrius Betsimus who is um

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,200
among many things he's the vice

4
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,639
president of open learning but I think

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,480
uh here he's the associate dean of

6
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,640
business analytics and Boeing professor

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,440
of operations research. Demetrius take

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,440
it away. Thank

9
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:26,560
[Applause]

10
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:30,160
you. Uh good morning. I'm here as a

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:33,520
professor not the other titles which is

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:37,200
in fact u you think about it the most uh

13
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:39,680
important aspect of um my experience

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,239
here at the MIT. So I'm talking about

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,920
creating fair and efficient transplant

16
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:48,879
allocation policies.

17
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:50,840
Um this is uh work jointly with my

18
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:54,079
colleague uh

19
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:59,359
Nikoshakees, our doctoral students Eli

20
00:00:54,079 --> 00:01:02,239
and Mora, our uh postoc Tommy and

21
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:05,600
recently graduated uh Angelos and our

22
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:09,200
master student Jaun. So uh just as a

23
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:11,600
historical note um Nikos and I have been

24
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,159
working in transplantation areas for

25
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:18,479
about 15 years.

26
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:21,280
um although the focus uh today what I'm

27
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,600
about to present is work that we have

28
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,320
very much completed in the last year

29
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,000
after the circ

30
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,960
uh who here knows much about

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,720
transportation raise your hand not so

32
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:37,200
much I thought so so uh let me give you

33
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,520
some some perspective transplantations

34
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,840
in the United States last year we had

35
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:45,640
about 50,000 transplants about 27,000 or

36
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,680
so were kidney

37
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:50,960
transplantations. Uh these are people

38
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,880
who die and donate their organs. There

39
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,920
are also live transplantations but this

40
00:01:52,880 --> 00:02:00,960
is less far less common. More than

41
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:04,079
95% are um are from somebody who donated

42
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:08,200
the organ um when the person died. You

43
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:11,200
see 11,000 livers and so forth between

44
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:13,360
uh kidneys, livers and hearts. This is

45
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,680
the lungs. This is the majority. There

46
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:20,879
are some others as well. So

47
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:23,200
um clearly in many organs uh this is a

48
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,280
matter of life and death. If somebody

49
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,239
for example does not have needs

50
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:32,000
transplantation on the

51
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:35,519
liver, you either get a get a liver or

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,440
or unfortunately you you die waiting. So

53
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:42,560
I'd like to give you some background of

54
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:46,400
the of the process. Um so imagine uh

55
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,200
Jane Jane is 34 years old and has an

56
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,360
autoimmune

57
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:54,000
disease. Uh the disease recently damaged

58
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,920
her kidneys leaving her dependent on

59
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,120
dialysis

60
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,159
uh so the the the blood can be cleared.

61
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,560
Typically this is a three times a week

62
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:06,720
endeavor and in need of a transplant.

63
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,400
to receive a transplant she must enroll

64
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,040
on the national waiting list along with

65
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:15,440
thousand other

66
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:17,599
patients. So now this is a list and uh

67
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,440
when a kidney is offered meaning that

68
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:24,480
somebody has died and the kidney is

69
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:27,519
donated. Uh so according to some

70
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,840
criteria that we will discuss uh a list

71
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,840
is formed a queue is formed and Jane

72
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,840
enters that queue based on her

73
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,840
characteristics.

74
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:42,799
uh it's not a typical line in in the

75
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:45,440
sense that a new kidney changes the

76
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,680
priorities because the biological

77
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:52,319
matches are not the same from kidney to

78
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:54,560
kidney. So as a result uh when a kidney

79
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,560
is donated all compatible patients are

80
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,799
prioritized according to a policy a

81
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,680
national policy. So it acts more like a

82
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:05,760
pool.

83
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,760
Uh so

84
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:12,319
so now the kidney is so there is an

85
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,239
ordering developed by national policy.

86
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,840
We'll discuss about these matters. And

87
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,160
then the kidney that is offered is

88
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,560
offered first to the first the first

89
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,680
person waiting in that list. The person

90
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,680
has an hour to accept or reject. If the

91
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,880
person does not accept because he

92
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,479
doesn't think that the quality of the

93
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,639
organ is appropriate or for other

94
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:33,880
reasons, it goes the offer goes to the

95
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:36,560
second person and at some point the

96
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:38,720
order the the kidney is given to a third

97
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:42,479
person. Jane didn't get it this time. So

98
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:45,600
it re-enters the the the list and so and

99
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:48,600
so it goes. Okay. So just to give you a

100
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:52,040
sense uh there were about

101
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:54,160
27,000 last year successful

102
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:57,759
transplantations. The waiting list was

103
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:00,400
about a 100,000. So it's the average

104
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,639
waiting list can be in people can be in

105
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,560
the waiting list for five years. It's

106
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,800
not

107
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:08,320
uncommon. So

108
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:10,320
uh so what is the key concept? The key

109
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:14,400
concept is that of an organ allocation

110
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:16,840
policy. So this uh policy determines the

111
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,360
priority of an organ

112
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:21,560
transplant. It critically drives

113
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,240
aggregate clinical benefit of

114
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:28,120
transplantation and also shapes how

115
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:30,320
benefits are distributed across the

116
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,639
population. What is the significance of

117
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:36,199
that? By altering who is likely to

118
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:38,960
receive a transplant, policies might

119
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:41,759
affect reducing the weightless

120
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:44,000
mortality. what is the principle

121
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,240
um so and I'll see you a concrete

122
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,360
example based on some of our earlier

123
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,840
work that changing policies might

124
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,000
actually affect how many people live and

125
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:57,759
and die

126
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,160
uh or it could be affect how fairly you

127
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,320
distribute transplants across the nation

128
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,759
for

129
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:08,080
example here's a a simple example should

130
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,120
distance play a role in that if you have

131
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,440
a kidney

132
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:17,520
that uh needs to let's say travel 200

133
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:20,000
miles or 3,000 miles, does it matter?

134
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,319
And how does it matter? And also it

135
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,560
might increase the policy on the number

136
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,440
of usable organs. Why is this so?

137
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,199
Because as you start offering offering

138
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:33,360
the kidney

139
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:35,840
um I mean they they have a useful life

140
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,639
about 24 hours. If the kidney is not

141
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:42,080
donated within 24 hours, then it might

142
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:45,199
not be um viable anymore and is

143
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:48,080
discarded. So if you have a policy that

144
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:50,240
you have very few discarded organs, this

145
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,080
might actually affect lives in the

146
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:56,560
future.

147
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:58,479
So clearly you you observe that policies

148
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,639
might have

149
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,479
uh implications on life and death

150
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,639
ethical aspects. Who should have

151
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,720
priority sometimes who should have

152
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,280
priority affects who like who lives and

153
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,360
who dies. It's not a a nice to have is a

154
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,199
is an important aspect. Just to give you

155
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,720
an example from some of our earlier

156
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:19,120
works, Nicholas and I and our former

157
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:23,000
student Ted. Um so this was the this is

158
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:26,319
time and this is the count of

159
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,360
um weight list removals

160
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:32,400
uh that are too sick to transplant or

161
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:35,199
death let's say decreased small numbers

162
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:39,000
is a good thing it meaning that more you

163
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:41,919
know less people die in a way so we have

164
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,560
worked some of the tools we use we use

165
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,240
in this presentation were used for this

166
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,680
is for lung transplants

167
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,520
It's about 3,500 a year. So the land

168
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,639
policy based on some of our work was

169
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,400
started in 2000 March

170
00:07:53,639 --> 00:08:00,599
2023 and you so it has been going on for

171
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:03,440
two years and you observe that this new

172
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:07,639
policy decreased very unfortunate

173
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:11,280
outcomes death from around 300 to

174
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:15,000
about60 or so. So just to demonstrate

175
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:22,080
that these are not innocent aspects.

176
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:25,919
Okay. So, uh a 38 um decrease reduction

177
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:28,520
and this and and lung is about maybe 9%

178
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:31,120
of the total transplantations in the

179
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:34,479
country. So, how is a national policy

180
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:37,440
created? So national committees made up

181
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:39,839
of doctors, patients, ethicists and so

182
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:43,919
forth develop policies and these are

183
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:45,680
dedicated people with uh a committee

184
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,519
involves you know multiple times

185
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,519
Nicholas and I have presented in this

186
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:53,040
committee of the order of maybe 20

187
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:55,120
people. There are six such national

188
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:58,399
committees. There's a committee on

189
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:01,519
kidneys which is uh as as you have seen

190
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:04,320
the majority of the transplantations, a

191
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,640
heart committee, a lung committee and

192
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,440
more ethics committee that talks about

193
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,920
uh general principles and tradeoffs, a

194
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,160
multi-organ committee and a liver and

195
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:20,240
intestinal committee. Each committee is

196
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:24,320
separate. It is supported by u several

197
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:26,560
uh entities that hersa the health um

198
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,760
department in the United States has

199
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:32,399
formed that have certain roles. UNOS

200
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:35,680
which is the u a very important

201
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:38,680
committee and very incorporate unit that

202
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:41,440
um in many ways implement the national

203
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:44,040
policy. This national policies develop

204
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,720
guidelines. UNOS

205
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:50,320
implements uh and then there is another

206
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,880
important entity SRTR which uh does the

207
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,920
analysis of these uh of these aspects

208
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,680
you you will say you will see today now

209
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,760
what is the vision of what we try to do

210
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,279
I gave you this was a preliminary to

211
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,880
give you a little bit of a sense what

212
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,519
transplantation is and some of the

213
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,519
issues that arise so we have the

214
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,640
following objectives in this work as you

215
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:12,959
will see these objectives are not minor

216
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:16,399
in my unbiased opinion

217
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:19,480
So we would like to decrease the time to

218
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:22,560
design and evaluate organ allocation

219
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,920
policies from years of what it is today

220
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,920
and I'll tell you more detail two

221
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:30,120
seconds. In other words, we would like

222
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:32,480
to build a system that once

223
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:35,120
completed, people in the committee while

224
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,680
the committee is happening can use the

225
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,200
system and and when they propose

226
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,720
policies

227
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:46,320
uh they can figure out the effects

228
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:48,160
without having to wait months and years

229
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,800
for the results to come back which is a

230
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,440
current

231
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:55,000
situation to allow the

232
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:58,079
committees UNOS

233
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,720
Congress and the public to evaluate

234
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:02,440
these policies and understand

235
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:06,240
trade-offs. So currently that's not

236
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:08,399
true. That is all this knowledge

237
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,320
um is within the committees and so

238
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,720
forth. But you know let's say for

239
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,600
example uh the public wants to

240
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,200
understand the effect that's not

241
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:21,760
feasible. Very importantly would like to

242
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:25,519
decrease weightless mortality. I saw you

243
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:27,680
before an example of such a policy would

244
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,959
like to unify the design of policies for

245
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,640
all organs simultaneously.

246
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:35,279
Currently, one committee meets about

247
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:38,160
kidneys, another committee meets with

248
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:41,040
completely different on on livers and so

249
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:44,079
forth. There's no unifying theme. So

250
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:46,680
even the ethical aspects of what we are

251
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:49,440
doing is

252
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:52,079
uh is not by the same people in other

253
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:55,640
words. And finally would like to enable

254
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:58,480
the ability to design and evaluate

255
00:11:55,640 --> 00:12:01,839
multiorgans to today it's completely you

256
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,640
know when somebody passes uh there are

257
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:07,120
multiple organs that can be

258
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:09,519
donated but currently if somebody needs

259
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:13,160
a lung and a heart for example how do

260
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:16,639
you evaluate this relative to a lung

261
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:19,360
alone a heart alone two people will be

262
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:22,480
the recipient but one per so this is

263
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,720
there are serious just ethical issues as

264
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,519
well as efficiency issues. A very

265
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:30,399
important component of this is the

266
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:32,720
simulation of the transplant um system

267
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:35,120
because if you want to do something from

268
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,800
months to seconds, it has to run very

269
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,720
effectively and and and this is not a

270
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,399
trivial matter. The reason it's not a

271
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,200
trivial matter because when you see a

272
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,600
simulation, you know historical data.

273
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:48,560
When this historical data is available,

274
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:52,399
you have you have to say if the the

275
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:55,120
policy changes different orderings will

276
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:57,279
happen and you need to understand what

277
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,959
you know is what had happened what you

278
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,360
need to find out what would have

279
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:03,200
happened for a new policy. So there is a

280
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,680
so-called notion of counterfactuals and

281
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,440
estimating and so forth. you know we

282
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,680
won't uh I won't bother you with all the

283
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,519
details but this is not a this is not a

284
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:16,680
trivial story as indicated the fact that

285
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:20,639
SRTR which which uh simulates

286
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:22,720
um it's takes typically six months to

287
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,800
complete an investigation of five to 10

288
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,880
policies so in other words the story is

289
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,800
as follows the committee meets five to

290
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:33,040
10 minutes five 10 policies are

291
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:34,560
contemplating they are simulated by SRTR

292
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,800
after six months

293
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:39,880
you get some

294
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:44,000
results. Quite often new analysis is

295
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:46,959
initiated, new another six months. Often

296
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,959
changing a policy is a long long

297
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:52,720
multi-year process. That's the current

298
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:54,399
story. That's the current story. So of

299
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,920
course they have limited policy may have

300
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,839
limited information takes about six

301
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:01,760
months and only few policies are being

302
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:05,079
evaluated and definitely definitely not

303
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:08,199
online. So of course

304
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:11,880
um there's the idea is to simulate more

305
00:14:08,199 --> 00:14:15,680
policies to also trying to explore

306
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:18,079
uh far more than that and much more much

307
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,040
faster. So what we've done is we

308
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:22,480
developed a novel algorithm for

309
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:24,800
simulation. This is about a thousand

310
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:28,399
times faster than the existing. It goes

311
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:30,600
from six hours to 14 seconds. 14 seconds

312
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:33,360
is online. If you have a

313
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,600
simulation, if you you can while the

314
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,920
committee is meeting, it can run if you

315
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:42,160
have an appropriate way of um of

316
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:44,880
evaluating. So, and it also allows not

317
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:47,839
one policy, thousands of them. So, if

318
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:52,480
they have various ideas, uh this is

319
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:54,399
where AI can help. Um this is not just

320
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,839
because hardware is faster. You have to

321
00:14:54,399 --> 00:15:00,720
to organize it in a way that is uh far

322
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:03,600
more intelligent and then we have we

323
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,519
have generalized my time is closer but

324
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,680
but we also have a way of designing

325
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,839
policies and I will do it in this way.

326
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,399
So here are some things we'd like to

327
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:16,320
minimize weight lift mortality. We have

328
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:19,360
to have uh many transplants. We have to

329
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:22,639
have pediatric access. you'd like to

330
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:25,199
reduce geographic disparity to reduce

331
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:28,240
blood type disparity and so forth. The

332
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:30,639
way we do it, our simulation keeps track

333
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,279
of all these measures by thousands and

334
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:35,800
thousands of policies and by having

335
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:38,720
weights you can optimize this using

336
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:40,880
optimization to be able to uh to

337
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,519
optimize that. So it's a this is a

338
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:46,000
system that

339
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:48,399
optimizes the simulates optimizes and

340
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,320
because we have already pre-calculated

341
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:53,120
thousands upon thousands of policies the

342
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:55,680
optimization is much simpler to to build

343
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:59,440
this offline it might take a long time

344
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:04,639
but online is seconds and the way to

345
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:07,199
support all this uh is a website which

346
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:09,199
uh by the end of the month will become

347
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:13,199
available to the nation.

348
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:16,000
and the committees that basically allows

349
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:18,959
all these calculations in a in a way

350
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,240
that makes trade-offs and so forth

351
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:24,320
um and

352
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:27,320
gives you know various metrics for which

353
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,839
ethical questions can be addressed. For

354
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:33,639
example, um the question I was asking

355
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:36,600
you the tradeoff between if you allow

356
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:39,040
transplantations for longer longer

357
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:41,959
distances maybe the weightlift mortality

358
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:45,360
will go down

359
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:47,199
um on the other hand the discard might

360
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,440
be possibly higher because they have to

361
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:51,360
travel. So how do you optimize all these

362
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,880
things and this is because one you have

363
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,959
the metrics then you can possibly

364
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:58,800
optimize that. So this is uh James

365
00:16:55,959 --> 00:17:02,079
Alorn. It's a short video. I don't know.

366
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:04,079
I hope it would work sometimes.

367
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:06,039
One of our key partners in this has been

368
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:09,039
MIT or the Massachusetts Institute of

369
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:11,679
Technology. And what MIT has brought to

370
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:14,160
the table is they have brought their

371
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:17,360
expertise in mathematical optimization

372
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,039
to the table. MIT is able to radically

373
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,799
change the turnaround time for

374
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:23,199
evaluating these different simulations

375
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,959
of policy scenarios. What would normally

376
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,439
take a couple months to look at a

377
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:30,240
handful of different policy scenarios,

378
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:32,400
MIT is able to let us look at thousands

379
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,280
upon thousands of different policy

380
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,760
scenarios in a matter of minutes. And so

381
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:40,160
we are able to make these changes much

382
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:42,080
more rapidly, which ultimately means

383
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,360
that we're able to improve the system

384
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,799
for transplant candidates much more

385
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:50,280
rapidly. One of our key partners in this

386
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,280
has been MIT.

387
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:58,200
To conclude, we have completed this uh

388
00:17:54,559 --> 00:18:01,480
aspect of the design to to being able to

389
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:05,200
evaluate tens of thousands of of

390
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:08,080
policies. We build this website which we

391
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:11,120
plan to make available in the end of the

392
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:14,880
month uh for kidneys and in the end of

393
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:16,640
the summer for all organs. Uh we I gave

394
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,400
you an example of weight list mortality.

395
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:22,080
We have completed and implemented this

396
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:24,559
in the nation not uh for writing papers

397
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,000
um for lungs and we are in process

398
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,760
because we are in dialogue for all the

399
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,360
committees. We're optimistic that this

400
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:33,120
will also go on for for the other

401
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:35,840
organs. Uh we are in progress of

402
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,919
designing these policies simultaneously.

403
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,240
In other words, the website you click

404
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:43,840
the organ and then all of the analysis

405
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:46,480
is unified. And finally, uh we have

406
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,000
started more will start working on it on

407
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,600
how to evaluate given you have all these

408
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,640
data. How do we evaluate and make

409
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:56,120
ethical uh decisions between uh

410
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:59,200
multiorgan transplantations? Thank

411
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:00,400
you. Um awesome. Uh thank you so much

412
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,919
Demetrius. So we're going to take

413
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,760
questions quick. A couple of ground

414
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,160
rules. We'll get two mics going. Nikos,

415
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,000
is it gonna be you or Angela? Uh,

416
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,360
perfect. Okay, so I'll maybe start with

417
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,120
this side of the room and what we'll do,

418
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,320
we'll have a quick ground rules. Um, I'm

419
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,080
afraid it's going to be no follow-ups.

420
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,440
It's gonna be a single question and then

421
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,600
yeah, we'll try to get through and I'll

422
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,360
try to answer them quickly, please.

423
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,760
Yeah. Uh, questions. Questions for

424
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,679
Demetrius.

425
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,280
There was a question. Yes, we'll start

426
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:28,000
off and Angela, could you get somebody

427
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,919
on deck for the moment?

428
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,360
Uh, thanks very interesting talk. Uh I'm

429
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,440
wondering if your simulations have

430
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,360
revealed some new interesting trade-offs

431
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,400
which were previously unknown. There are

432
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,919
many but to be able to

433
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:41,840
answer there are many in fact the

434
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:44,240
discussions in the ethical in the ethics

435
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:46,160
committee discuss exactly that and the

436
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:49,919
beauty of this is because the you have

437
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:53,039
all these data in front of you uh it it

438
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:55,600
generates new ideas. You say for example

439
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:57,120
let's say the pediatric use is lower.

440
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,559
What would have happened? Can we do

441
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,320
something else? Of course there's no

442
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:02,320
free lunch. You cannot do anything that

443
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,640
fulfills every single obligation, every

444
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,960
single thing that you try. But people

445
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,880
now have a system that online they can

446
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,320
make these decisions. I'll be glad to

447
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,679
point you to some papers where all these

448
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,400
discussions otherwise will take us all

449
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:16,880
the time. The lady here. Yeah, I was

450
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,320
curious. Um, obviously with simulations,

451
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,080
one of the challenges is the data you

452
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,320
put into them and the assumptions about

453
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,400
the equations that you're using. So I'm

454
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,559
just curious how you got the committees

455
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,039
to buy into that or or how that process

456
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:33,280
worked.

457
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:36,000
uh years of effort. Uh but uh this is

458
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:38,240
the data that the nation has. This is

459
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,760
UNOS data. This is every single thing

460
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,919
that has happened. We also simulate it.

461
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,000
You can simulate and then see the effect

462
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,320
on things that you do know. We obviously

463
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,960
we increase credibility on that. I mean

464
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:53,360
as you know you build credibility with a

465
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,679
lot of evidence and so forth. I told you

466
00:20:53,360 --> 00:21:00,159
15 years we have some credibility on

467
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:02,159
that. uh and good results. Um that I

468
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,640
mean I I saw you when you have a policy

469
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:08,000
that we predicted the the the mortality

470
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:10,880
would would drop 200 deaths and it

471
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,880
happened. Well, that's pretty credible.

472
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,880
No.

473
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:20,799
Oh, okay. I have one question. Where are

474
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:22,480
you? Oh, okay. Yeah. I have a curious

475
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:24,400
one thing now. In my country, I am from

476
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,679
Mongolia. In my country, we have a very

477
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,679
country Mongolia.

478
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,679
We have a very big uh scandal in my

479
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:32,000
country currently because one doctor is

480
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:34,320
the president due to the harvesting the

481
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,320
many argans from the person who is the

482
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,960
donated and then how it will be

483
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,960
regulated by if it's involved in so many

484
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:44,080
stakeholders for example doctors and

485
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:46,799
other uh some how it is this is a highly

486
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:49,440
regulated story that has the attention

487
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:52,760
in the high echelons of the government.

488
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:56,000
So the the committees design a

489
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:58,960
policy these policies as implemented in

490
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,960
UNOS. UNOS is the the regulator in a way

491
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:04,159
the the one that

492
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,520
uh obviously I do not know what happens

493
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:08,200
in every single country in the world but

494
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:12,760
in the United States

495
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:15,840
uh I have not people disagree

496
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:17,600
scandals I have not heard. Okay thank

497
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,440
you. So therefore I do not know what

498
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:24,559
happens in other countries.

499
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:26,400
Other questions? Yes sir. Yes. Um uh my

500
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:28,960
understanding is that you have a large

501
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,440
amount of um uh policies you're looking

502
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,880
at and and you make that simulation or

503
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,559
decision based on the smaller amount of

504
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:39,919
criteria criteria such such as like the

505
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:42,000
uh reduce the mortality of the travel.

506
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:44,559
Yeah. You have that that list and what

507
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,360
if the the priority of the requirement

508
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:48,720
the criteria changes and that would

509
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,280
change a lot right? So that the whole

510
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,679
thing simulation will change. U my my

511
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:56,679
question is that uh when that happens

512
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:59,520
are somebody uh adding some other

513
00:22:56,679 --> 00:23:01,520
criteria and and how would that thing

514
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:05,080
change everything and would that be

515
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:08,000
still like ethical? The what we have

516
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:10,799
found that this has been going on for

517
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,080
some time. We know the criteria. There

518
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:17,440
are about 20 of them. Right? Now on

519
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:19,760
these 20 criteria, we have mapped

520
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:23,200
thousands upon thousands of policies to

521
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:25,520
this criteria. Right? So then we try to

522
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,200
optimize according to this criteria. We

523
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:31,240
have some weights. They can change. Let

524
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:34,559
us empa build a policy that emphasizes

525
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:37,360
uh weightless mortality. This is much

526
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:40,000
higher weight than before. We can we can

527
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:43,200
do that. On the other hand, if on if at

528
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,880
that point they design a 21st criterion

529
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,200
that it was never before, we have to go

530
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,520
to the drawing board, we cannot, you

531
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:53,200
know, we do many things. Coffee we don't

532
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:56,000
make. So I mean you realize this is uh

533
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:58,240
if if it is within what has been uh

534
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
analyzed in the past and it's it has

535
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,720
been my experience that is always like

536
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,640
that to find a a brand new criterion

537
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:08,000
that nobody has ever thought about. I

538
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:10,080
have never seen it. So

539
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,559
You see what I'm I'm saying? Other

540
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,559
question? Yes.

541
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:24,159
Um my question is um your criterias are

542
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:26,480
fact or subjective. Um like weight list

543
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:29,360
mortality is a factual how many people

544
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:32,080
died? Um no what is the average waiting

545
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:34,960
time? You said there are at least 10 to

546
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:38,240
20 criterias apply for the each

547
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:40,640
candidate. So I don't believe all for

548
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:43,679
those candidate. No, no, no, no, no.

549
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:46,480
These criteria are for the policy. For

550
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:49,559
example, if I change the ordering Mhm.

551
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:52,799
there are 35 more deaths, but the the

552
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:55,039
the but people have to travel 21 more

553
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:56,720
miles and the number of pediatric

554
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:59,600
transplants goes down. This is not only

555
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:02,640
the patient. This is you know as you

556
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,960
change the national policy you affect

557
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,360
the the aggregate behavior of the

558
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,360
system.

559
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:13,840
But on the slide you show it some

560
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:16,320
criterias like most of them ob for me

561
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:19,159
it's a fact like the blood group you

562
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:23,200
cannot change the patients this

563
00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:25,520
is how the weight list for example uh

564
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,679
how long have you been waiting for a

565
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:31,919
kidney transplantation matters in your

566
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:33,440
ordering the the sensitization of the

567
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,440
characteristics of the organ and

568
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,960
characterics of the patient also also

569
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:42,240
matter. So there are criteria of how to

570
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:45,080
order and with what significance but but

571
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:47,840
how the national policy is thinking

572
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:50,679
is what is the effect if you change

573
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:53,279
something to the overall national

574
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:56,640
effect. I hope I hope I'm making myself

575
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:58,640
clear. Not really. Thank you. Well, but

576
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,760
your question is also not as clear as

577
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,440
well. I'm sorry you say so. Okay. Thank

578
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,480
you. Are we having a sense? I'm just

579
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,000
going to close out. This will be the

580
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,159
final question. Are we have a sense of a

581
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:13,279
sense of what policies are winning out

582
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:14,960
when um when people are able to identify

583
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:16,880
precisely what their priorities are and

584
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,880
then simulate the effects of these these

585
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,840
we have look the class of policy we are

586
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,120
consider continuous distribution

587
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:25,520
policies. There has been a lot of debate

588
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:28,480
for decades of what is the class and so

589
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:32,159
forth. the the nation has converged on a

590
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,919
particular way with um what's called

591
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,520
continuous distributions with a

592
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:37,840
geographical aspects and so forth.

593
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:40,960
There's no time to explain but within

594
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:43,600
this class which is a broad class this

595
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,600
is where we optimize this is where we op

596
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,760
and and I think there is significant

597
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,080
convergence that this is the class now

598
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:52,240
the specific parameters you know that's

599
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:54,880
another story but that's what the where

600
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:58,520
the nation has converged. Awesome. Well,

601
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,520
thank you so much, Demetrius.
