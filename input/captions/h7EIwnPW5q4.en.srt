00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,550
I'm Cara Miller and I'm Rob Stoner and

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:14,760
this is what if it

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:14,760
[Music]

4
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:21,160
works from the MIT energy initiative

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,080
this is what if it works a podcast

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,240
looking at the energy solutions for

7
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,679
climate change I'm Kara Miller you might

8
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,679
know me from the public radio program

9
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:30,359
Innovation Hub which I hosted I now

10
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:31,880
write the big idea column the Boston

11
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:33,440
Globe and I'm Robert Stoner the

12
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:37,360
president of the Kendall Square project

13
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,360
and former director of the MIT energy

14
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,600
initiative and today a look at the Epic

15
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:46,920
challenge ahead keeping the World's

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:50,680
temperature from increasing by 2 degrees

17
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:54,199
CS we need to really get on the road to

18
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:56,160
Net Zero within the next 10 years if

19
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:59,000
that doesn't happen then you can kiss

20
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,120
two degrees goodbye we'll revisit an

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,600
enormous environment Al success story

22
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,560
that rarely gets talked about how the

23
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,240
ozone layer was saved which meant moving

24
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,240
away from CFCs

25
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:15,799
chlorocarbons and back in the 1970s

26
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:18,799
cfc's were in all sorts of things well I

27
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:21,840
was about 18 then and I had in my

28
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:25,159
medicine cabinet some underarm deodorant

29
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:28,799
and hairspray which Believe It or Not

30
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:31,399
75% of the global use at that time was

31
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,680
for quote medicinal

32
00:01:31,399 --> 00:01:36,320
purposes which were those purposes

33
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,439
that's Susan Solomon professor of

34
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,479
atmospheric chemistry and clate science

35
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:44,479
at MIT and she was once an 18-year-old

36
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:47,119
with CFC filled hairspray and deodorant

37
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,159
but she would go on to become a Pioneer

38
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,840
in understanding the hole in the ozone

39
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:53,920
layer and she believes that much as we

40
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,719
solved that crucial environmental

41
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:00,000
problem we can do it again which we will

42
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:03,079
get to but if you rewind for a minute to

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,680
the 1970s scientists were only just

44
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:11,000
starting to realize the huge impact that

45
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:14,040
cfc's had the early concerns about ozone

46
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,239
actually came from two scientists Molina

47
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,080
and Roland who went on to share the

48
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:21,080
Nobel Prize in chemistry for having done

49
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:24,040
such a cool thing and what they did was

50
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,640
to point out that the

51
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,000
chlorofluorocarbons which contained

52
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:30,040
chlorine were being used in increasing

53
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,280
amounts and that that chlorine had

54
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,879
potential to destroy ozone so they did a

55
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,879
little simple calculation and showed

56
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:37,640
that the key point was just these things

57
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:39,080
live for 100 years we're using more and

58
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:42,040
more of them so it's building up in the

59
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:44,239
atmosphere it's very dangerous cfc's had

60
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:47,599
been an integral part of American life

61
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:49,400
for decades at that point in the 1930s

62
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,920
they were being used to cool things down

63
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:54,720
in refrigerators and to cool us down

64
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,920
using early air conditioners in the

65
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,840
1970s it became clear cfc's were

66
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,879
building up in the atmosphere which

67
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,200
which is when Sher Roland and Mario

68
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:08,080
Molina started to wonder if that buildup

69
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:11,159
had adverse effects which of course it

70
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:14,040
did and pretty quickly consumers got

71
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:16,080
motivated to change overwhelming numbers

72
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,239
of Americans went to their medicine

73
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,360
cabinets and threw that stuff away so

74
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,159
hairstyles changed actually that's one

75
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,519
of the big reasons why the bont

76
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:27,519
hairstyles of the 70s went away which

77
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:29,840
was really no big loss I think suddenly

78
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,000
underarm deodorant became rolon with

79
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,480
which was advertised as saving the ozone

80
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,120
layer get on the stick to save the ozone

81
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,200
layer that's what people said yeah

82
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,360
Solomon the author of the new book

83
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,319
solvable how we healed the Earth and how

84
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,840
we can do it again says consumers don't

85
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:49,959
usually realize how incredibly powerful

86
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:52,239
they are when you look at for example

87
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:54,879
the closure of coal plants all around

88
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,000
the country many many of them have been

89
00:03:54,879 --> 00:04:00,560
closed because the consumers demanded

90
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,480
that they close so it's quite possible

91
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,879
for people to have a big influence and

92
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,959
you know I'm not saying we're going to

93
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:10,319
have a 75% reduction in fossil fuel use

94
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:13,040
that way but even a few percent gets

95
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:15,760
Industries attention because nowadays

96
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,759
Industries you know operate on the

97
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,120
belief that they have to keep growing at

98
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,440
some pace and they become you know

99
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:25,720
really concerned when they see a

100
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:28,040
difference happening she believes we are

101
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:30,199
rising to the occasion on climate change

102
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,639
because the stakes are high much as they

103
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:34,720
were a half century ago she calls the

104
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,840
ozone layer the world's signature

105
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:43,160
environmental success story so what we

106
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:45,759
have done is to basically phase out the

107
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,120
bad chemicals that were causing it yet

108
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,479
we still have air conditioning

109
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,039
refrigeration and all that happy stuff

110
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:54,600
so the concentrations of those molecules

111
00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:57,000
have dropped significantly they do have

112
00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:00,600
those hundred-year lifetimes just as was

113
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,520
predicted you know 50 years ago

114
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:06,919
amazing but uh so there is still some

115
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:09,919
left but the ozone hole for example is

116
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:12,960
starting to form later in the season and

117
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:15,680
it's smaller in the month of September

118
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,360
Solomon says the evidence is unequivocal

119
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,240
that the ozone layer is recovering and

120
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:24,120
if we hadn't chose to mostly phase out

121
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:27,560
cfc's we would be grappling with some

122
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:29,880
terrible problems the world would be in

123
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,479
deep deep yogurt right now I mean the

124
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,840
amount of ultraviolet light that would

125
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:37,280
be reaching the Earth causing already

126
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:40,840
increased numbers of skin cancers um it

127
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,639
it would be astonishingly bad so we we

128
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:45,720
really did something great on top of

129
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:49,080
that the chlorofluorocarbons themselves

130
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:51,960
are greenhouse gases so phasing them out

131
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:55,919
actually shaved off a chunk of global

132
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:58,759
warming probably by 2050 it would be

133
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:01,080
about a degree of global warming think

134
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:02,800
considerable yeah about that so it's

135
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:05,759
very very good that we got rid of this

136
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,720
stuff but to phase out a class of

137
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:11,240
chemicals or technology you have to

138
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,280
change the corporate world chemical

139
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,080
companies have to change what they sell

140
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,160
or fossil fuel companies if you want to

141
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:21,240
fast forward today and that often is not

142
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:24,000
easy indeed the battles we've seen so

143
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:26,840
far may be nothing compared to what's

144
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
next here's Rob Stoner in conversation

145
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:32,599
with Susan and me you talk about these

146
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,039
refrigerants and how we found a

147
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:35,160
different way a different set of

148
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:36,160
refrigerants that got us into a

149
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,440
different problem and now we're going to

150
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,880
solve that problem but at the end of

151
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:44,560
that the same chemical industry emerged

152
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:48,080
we didn't eliminate them I'm wondering

153
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,919
how that kind of situation contrasts

154
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,479
with the climate situation where we have

155
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,919
these fossil companies whose existence

156
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,879
depends on this and there isn't really

157
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:58,440
an alternative fossil fuel that they can

158
00:06:55,879 --> 00:07:00,440
create that would allow them to continue

159
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:03,800
I mean what do you think

160
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:08,080
yeah that's that is a difference that is

161
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:10,599
that is fundamental and and very serious

162
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,280
I will point out that another issue

163
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:16,479
where we did achieve A change is uh the

164
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:19,800
use of lead and gasoline and paint you

165
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:22,160
know the the the Metal Industries had

166
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,840
had a fairly big investment in in

167
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,840
producing the lead that went into those

168
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,520
products and they weren't going to be

169
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,919
part of the solution they were not part

170
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,080
of the solution they actually had to

171
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,599
change do do something else with the

172
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,520
lead I'm not even sure what they do with

173
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,280
it anymore it's such dangerous stuff it

174
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,319
wasn't pencils anymore maybe they well

175
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,840
actually one thing they could do is U

176
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:44,960
Mine zinc instead because zinc is uh is

177
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,159
is not toxic in paints but that's

178
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,280
encouraging because they did have to

179
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:51,199
write off an asset they had to write off

180
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:53,680
a big asset I mean they owned mines that

181
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,840
were lead mines but you know they were

182
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,240
not on the scale clearly of the fossil

183
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,720
fuel industry the fossil fuel industry

184
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:06,039
today is a 40 TR ion dollar industry

185
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:07,680
that's the value roughly of all of their

186
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:10,039
mineral rights you know they own

187
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,360
mountain tops full of coal they own the

188
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:15,120
rights to you know certain oil wells

189
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:17,560
they own offshore oil platforms every

190
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,120
one of which costs about $200 million

191
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:22,879
and I don't know how many they have it's

192
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:25,039
probably dozens so they own a massive

193
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,960
amount of mineral rights and

194
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,840
infrastructure it's worth a lot of money

195
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,680
what are they going to do with it is a

196
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,000
very very important question so what

197
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,120
they could do is carbon capture and

198
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,120
storage is is one thing where you

199
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,519
continue to burn the fossil fuels but

200
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:43,640
you put the carbon right back in the

201
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:46,680
ground that's right now too expensive to

202
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:48,240
be contributing in the same way that

203
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:51,120
some of the other things can contribute

204
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:54,519
now and one of the big issues is we need

205
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:57,279
to really get on the road to Net Zero

206
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:59,440
within the next 10 years I mean if that

207
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:03,240
doesn't happen then you can kiss two

208
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:05,320
degrees goodbye so we should be thinking

209
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:08,680
about the longer term solutions that

210
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:10,600
will help us in 20 years and 30 years to

211
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:12,519
get all the way to nit zero but one of

212
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:15,839
the big things we have to do in the next

213
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:17,440
10 years is get halfway there and and so

214
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,880
you know Carbon capture and storage is

215
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,000
great research question maybe we'll have

216
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,720
it ready in the longer term but it it's

217
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,320
not going to contribute right now so I

218
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,120
would argue we do the things we can do

219
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,839
right now the other thing of course that

220
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,000
the fossil fuel industry is interested

221
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:31,360
in is

222
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,480
you know they know how to do a lot of

223
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,560
things with methane they could learn how

224
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,600
to do a lot of things with hydrogen you

225
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:40,680
know a gas they can make out of the the

226
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,959
hydrocarbons that they have because they

227
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:46,000
have hydrogen in them the other thing

228
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:48,120
that they could do is uh make ammonia

229
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,760
which again has

230
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:53,480
hydrogen so all those options are on the

231
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,720
table and are being thought about is to

232
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:58,079
you know whether these really are good

233
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:00,120
Solutions you know how safe is it to

234
00:09:58,079 --> 00:10:02,480
make a lot of ammonia that's hopeful

235
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,079
important question they many of them do

236
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,959
refer to themselves as molecule

237
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:08,519
companies now not necessarily fuel

238
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:10,480
companies and so or energy companies

239
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:12,120
we're not an oil company we're an energy

240
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,279
company you hear that a lot actually

241
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:17,200
which is you know what it shows you is

242
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:20,440
that they have understood that there's a

243
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:23,880
time scale for this what established

244
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:26,279
that time scale it's the consumers and

245
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:28,720
it's the the fact that

246
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:31,160
consumers realized that this issue was

247
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,000
becoming per personal MH that it was

248
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,640
actually perceptible that Summers for

249
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,399
example are hotter and heat waves are

250
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,639
more severe so these are my three PS

251
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:41,760
that I love to talk about the issue is

252
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:44,440
personal and perceptible that gets us

253
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,720
going and we find practical solutions

254
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:49,279
that gets us the rest of the way there

255
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,639
and so the Practical Solutions have also

256
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:54,160
evolved tremendously solar has gotten

257
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:57,760
much much cheaper than it used to be uh

258
00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:00,920
it's now you know well cheaper than uh

259
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,600
than coal and even than gas which is

260
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:04,959
really quite amazing and that's without

261
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:07,680
subsidies in most of the country and

262
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:10,480
most of the world actually so the

263
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:13,680
technology forcing and steering that we

264
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,880
did when when people demand change and

265
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,399
governments do a little bit of

266
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:20,320
investment and research and companies

267
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:22,399
see that there's a Economic Opportunity

268
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,360
that steers technology in a certain

269
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,519
direction you put that together with the

270
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:29,360
3ps and and that's how we solve

271
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:30,920
environmental problems in my opinion so

272
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,240
I just want to dive a little deeper into

273
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:37,279
the fossil fuel question and companies

274
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,760
how much resistance is there because as

275
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,120
you say there's like all these sunk

276
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,079
costs we've already built these

277
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,959
platforms already drilled these Wells

278
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:47,160
this we spent a lot of money doing this

279
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:49,920
and we don't want to just like abandon

280
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:51,880
our investments and how much is it you

281
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,760
know beyond petroleum like are they

282
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:56,839
actually going Beyond something you know

283
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,800
to some other phase in their

284
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:00,920
lives they're trying to figure out what

285
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,839
that next phase is and you know I think

286
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:05,839
one of the challenges they face is doing

287
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,480
something at the same scale as what

288
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,519
they're doing now they think about

289
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,680
getting into electricity

290
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,560
generation okay electricity generation

291
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,800
is Big scale it's practiced everywhere

292
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:18,639
but it's not nearly as profitable so

293
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:20,839
they have also a big profitability

294
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:24,079
problem that they have to you know it

295
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:26,560
may at maybe at some level that leads to

296
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:29,199
nefarious behavior and doing stuff they

297
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:32,680
shouldn't do in Washington but I think

298
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:35,839
more insidiously it it leads to lethargy

299
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:38,279
and uh disinclination to do things and

300
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,680
finding excuses stuff we all do when we

301
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:41,279
don't want to do something we get

302
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,959
something better to do probably stuff we

303
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,600
all do when we're making so much money

304
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,240
doing something that's not that great

305
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,880
that you kind of drag your feet to like

306
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,079
change what like an individual might

307
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:54,680
have the same behavior yeah so I see a

308
00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:56,440
lack of real Vigor and commitment to

309
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,120
changing on the part of those companies

310
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,560
if I can say that without offending too

311
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:02,360
many of them you I I I don't know really

312
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,320
what the answer to that is they may no

313
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,720
longer be able to function as companies

314
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,079
that do what they're doing and maybe

315
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,240
they have to become different companies

316
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:12,680
or smaller companies or break up and

317
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,959
become companies that mine or do other

318
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:16,760
things some of the some of the things

319
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:19,600
they do will persist these are also very

320
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:21,360
large chemical companies in many cases

321
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,360
one of the chemicals they produce is you

322
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,240
know fuel but they also produce a lot of

323
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,480
plastics a lot of lubricants a lot of

324
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,760
other things we use throughout the

325
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,160
economy those things will continue

326
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,480
probably

327
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,240
substitutions can be found so so they do

328
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,199
invest in those sorts of things but I

329
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:40,000
think the notion that they can become

330
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:42,720
energy companies in a new energy economy

331
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,360
making solar panels and

332
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,120
windmills the this is sort of a I think

333
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,880
wrong I don't think that's going to

334
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,360
happen yeah and it's good for the public

335
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,720
to understand and think about those

336
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:56,040
things because it helps you to put into

337
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,680
context how to how to view those claims

338
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,759
and I will say that some of those

339
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,839
companies seem to be more genu about

340
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:03,759
changing than others so I I kind of

341
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:06,720
hesitate to put them all in the same

342
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:10,320
basket there is clearly money to be made

343
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:12,759
by the one or ones who figure out best

344
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,959
what to do instead and and they sense

345
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:17,680
that and they're going after it I mean

346
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:19,360
let's face it we don't have a a history

347
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,759
of doing a lot of protection of

348
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,560
industries that had be have become

349
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:26,839
obsolete you know we we we didn't

350
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,240
protect you know I don't know the the

351
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:31,160
buggy whip when the automobile was

352
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:34,440
invented because you know that was a

353
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:36,240
transition that had to happen um so

354
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,560
talking about companies that are making

355
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,759
things that are systemically important

356
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,759
yeah you don't need haris and deodorant

357
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:45,480
to run the economy but we've developed

358
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:47,480
For Better or Worse you know an 8

359
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,560
billion person global economy that that

360
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,560
runs on these things and simply

361
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:53,399
withdrawing them is absolutely

362
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:56,399
economically disastrous if it's done

363
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:59,240
wrong absolutely agree their best bet is

364
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:01,800
probably carbon capture and storage done

365
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:04,000
in a genuine way one of the problems we

366
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:07,680
have right now is that a fair amount of

367
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:11,440
that activity is actually using the CO2

368
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:14,320
then to Frack to get oil and gas out so

369
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:17,120
they they pump it down and out comes oil

370
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:20,000
and gas but that means that also the CO2

371
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,199
comes pouring out as well so they're not

372
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,360
really putting the CO2 away they're

373
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:25,959
capturing it but then they use it for

374
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,440
something that I mean all or you can put

375
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:29,360
it in fizzy drinks I mean you put in

376
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,759
fizzy drinks it ends up fizzing back out

377
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,680
into the atmosphere so you know you're

378
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,440
going to have to decide to really

379
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,319
capture it and a lot of them are not

380
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:41,000
really on board with that yet because

381
00:15:37,319 --> 00:15:43,040
there is financial value in selling CO2

382
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,199
so is the carbon capture that's

383
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,560
happening

384
00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:49,240
initially that they're capturing what's

385
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,120
coming from the initial drilling yeah no

386
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:53,199
well from from say a power plant from a

387
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,639
power plant but then injecting that back

388
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:57,360
into the ground to produce more oil

389
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:59,680
produce more oil or natural gas or

390
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,120
something got it I mean personally I

391
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,480
think it takes a village I'm being

392
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:07,440
totally honest with you when you look at

393
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:09,360
for example getting rid of DDT it took

394
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,199
Rachel Carson writing a book that woke

395
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,920
people up it took people realizing it

396
00:16:12,199 --> 00:16:16,680
was personal this stuff could be in

397
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,480
their bodies it was perceptible Robins

398
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:21,800
were falling out of the sky by the way I

399
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:24,079
remember I was I was a child back in the

400
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,639
days of Rachel Carson and I do remember

401
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:27,839
finding dead Robins on the lawn and

402
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:29,480
saying mom what is this why are the all

403
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,199
these dead birds

404
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:35,560
so the Practical Solutions were pick

405
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:38,440
something else but a lot of the action

406
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:40,519
that happened was public interest but

407
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:42,360
also the involvement of of EDF the

408
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:45,639
environmental defense fund was actually

409
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:47,399
founded because of DDT oh I didn't know

410
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:51,279
that and what the environmental defense

411
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:54,000
fund sprung from a group of citizens who

412
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:56,519
were meeting in living rooms of

413
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,839
themselves and their friends and talking

414
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:59,519
about the fact that there were all these

415
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:03,760
dead birds and they wanted stop the

416
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:06,319
spraying of DDT and so they started

417
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:08,039
lawsuits against the spraying against

418
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:10,959
their town that was doing the spraying

419
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:13,160
so this was at the very local level and

420
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,760
what ended up happening was amazing they

421
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:18,319
didn't actually win those

422
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:20,959
lawsuits the judges would say we have to

423
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:23,319
study this so you can't use it we have

424
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,640
an injunction against using it right now

425
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:26,079
and then you know what happened the

426
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,360
towns figured out they could actually

427
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:31,080
spray other stuff instead and so they

428
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:33,880
sprayed that other stuff and so EDF

429
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:37,559
learned how to win by

430
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:40,320
losing and how to use the courts in the

431
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:43,000
DDT story and it's really quite amazing

432
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:46,200
then they did it actually Nationwide and

433
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:49,679
eventually they brought a Citizens

434
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:51,480
petition in the state of Wisconsin to

435
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,320
their Department of Natural Resources

436
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,679
which happened to be a state that had a

437
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:58,280
law that said any any group of citizens

438
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:00,960
maybe even any citizen can petition the

439
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:03,679
state about something that's related to

440
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,679
environmental actions by the state so

441
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:08,200
that was the question is is it okay for

442
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:10,960
the state to do this and they actually

443
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:13,440
got so much public attention that it was

444
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,200
a big part of the why DDT was ultimately

445
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,480
banned in this country so that's

446
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,640
encouraging because we're having all of

447
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,159
these sorts of legal disputes over CO2

448
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:25,320
emissions and we're losing those too so

449
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:28,000
uh it takes hand it takes a village to

450
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,919
raise the the the awareness to raise the

451
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,559
questions of what else could be done

452
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:34,320
that's really what EDF was doing with

453
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:35,720
the DDT lawsuits people do a lot of

454
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,120
things because they're used to doing

455
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:40,280
them and consumer groups can force

456
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:43,600
change same thing is happening right now

457
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:46,480
with permitting for electric companies

458
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:49,200
so it's turning out to be very difficult

459
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,159
for companies to get permits to install

460
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,360
as much solar as we would like to

461
00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:57,039
install it's not anything nefarious it's

462
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:59,679
just that the People Who oversee how to

463
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:01,280
keep the electricity flowing are used to

464
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,080
doing the things they know how to do and

465
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,880
they're very concerned with reliability

466
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,200
yeah and of course they should be that's

467
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,240
great because you know we don't want the

468
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:12,080
lights coming on and off so they do what

469
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:13,760
they know how to do and that has to

470
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,440
change that's a big change by the way

471
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,880
the same things happening in China as

472
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,320
I'm sure you probably know it's it's the

473
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:22,520
provinces versus the federal government

474
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,919
in China but it's the same thing yeah

475
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:27,520
the locals want to do what they know how

476
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:31,360
to do and to there needs to be some

477
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:33,360
level of pressure to get them to

478
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,679
change that pressure could come from the

479
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,280
federal government could come from

480
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:38,000
people could come from the courts

481
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:40,240
there's lots of ways to like I said it

482
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,400
takes a village to solve these problems

483
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,240
you know for many years and this was

484
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,320
something bizarre to our listeners I led

485
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,120
a program here at the request of the

486
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:49,880
Chinese government to bring State

487
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,880
leaders to MIT to teach them about the

488
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,640
technology options available to them and

489
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,960
excellent policy which is sort of

490
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:58,080
laughable looking back at it and it was

491
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,760
actually quite a good program we learned

492
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,600
a lot but exactly what you're saying it

493
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:04,640
was get those provincial guys in there

494
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,280
and train them they loved it yeah and

495
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,559
then they went home and did a better job

496
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,559
yeah

497
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:13,039
[Music]

498
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:22,000
exactly so Susan um the current

499
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:23,640
expectation of um sea level rise my

500
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,280
understanding is is based only on

501
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:29,000
thermal expansion and does not take

502
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:31,440
other things into account do you think

503
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,720
we might be underestimating how bad

504
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,799
things might

505
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:39,200
get um actually we do take other things

506
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:42,080
into account and those other things are

507
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,320
small glaciers okay and of course the

508
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,600
the great ice sheets of Greenland and

509
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:49,320
Antarctica I'm not sure I know the

510
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:52,600
latest and greatest wisdom on that but I

511
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:56,159
think the estimates are that it's about

512
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:58,200
550 thermal expansion and all that other

513
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:01,039
stuff CU you know we we have lost a

514
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:03,200
massive amount of ice on land so it's

515
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:06,559
the ice that melts on land and gets into

516
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,320
the water that adds to the fact that the

517
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:11,080
the thermal expansion is just the simple

518
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:13,080
fact that it's water and as you heat it

519
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:15,640
up it expands I mean if you've ever made

520
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:18,600
a pot of tea you notice what happens in

521
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:21,200
your tea kettle um so it's it's

522
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:24,120
fundamentally that same process that is

523
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:28,279
the easier part to calculate it is true

524
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:30,240
that getting in an accurate way the loss

525
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:32,720
of the great ice sheets of Greenland and

526
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,520
Antarctica is a tough problem we do

527
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,640
better probably on the small

528
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:38,480
glaciers so that's where a big

529
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,279
uncertainty lies but it's not the case

530
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:43,559
that we ignore that when we give you a

531
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:45,360
number so take all that together what we

532
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:47,039
think we're going to see by the end of

533
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,679
this century is something on the order

534
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:52,279
of a meter of sea level R so about three

535
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:55,960
three and some feet how would that

536
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:58,000
affect you if you were in a coastal city

537
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:59,159
around the you know what does that mean

538
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,559
what is

539
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:03,559
it means you should look at the

540
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:05,919
elevation of property that you own and

541
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:08,279
ask yourself how long do I want to keep

542
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:09,960
this property you know and decide

543
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:12,279
whether you think you're safe enough

544
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:14,960
that's fundamentally where we're at yeah

545
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:17,559
it's a challenging issue and of course

546
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,640
there are whole parts of the world that

547
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:22,960
are definitely going to go

548
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:25,720
underwater you big chunk of Florida will

549
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,919
be underwater the State of Florida I

550
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:31,000
think the highest point in the state of

551
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:34,120
Florida Rob might know this answer it's

552
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,080
it's only a few feet it's not a lot yeah

553
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:38,279
Florida is very low the whole so like

554
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,120
three4 feet is really going to change

555
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:42,720
things in fora it will change the entire

556
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:46,000
Coastline it doesn't get everything but

557
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,520
it gets a big chunk of Florida it's

558
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,320
funny to see in Florida people building

559
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,200
houses on stilts with the idea that you

560
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,200
know I'm going to survive the sea level

561
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,559
rise of course they're not going to have

562
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,120
any neighbors so I don't know oh maybe

563
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:59,840
that's good like to live alone I don't

564
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:02,440
know even more exclusive middle of AC

565
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:05,320
yeah what are the indicators that you're

566
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:07,640
looking for that will tell you if things

567
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:11,480
are I don't know progressing more

568
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:15,039
rapidly than you think or deviating from

569
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:17,640
what you you know what you

570
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:18,799
anticipate um I'm concerned about heavy

571
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:22,799
rainfall and

572
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:26,840
flooding which seems to be on the Rise

573
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:29,120
um I mean it is on the rise we expect

574
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:33,520
that to some extent based on on the

575
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:37,240
climate models but the bad thing about

576
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:40,320
rainfall is that not only do you get a

577
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:43,159
change in the average amount but you

578
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:46,480
actually get a change in the shape of

579
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:50,360
the distribution of rainfall such that

580
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:53,159
you're getting more of the heavy stuff

581
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:55,679
and that's that's true pretty much

582
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:58,760
everywhere in temperature that's not

583
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:02,000
quite how it is you shift the average

584
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:03,720
which in turn means that the hottest

585
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,600
temperatures are hotter than they used

586
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:08,240
to be and you set new records and you

587
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,600
have new heat waves but it's it keeps

588
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,279
the same shape it just moves over a

589
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,960
little bit so we've seen that you know

590
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:16,400
and many many different measurements

591
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:19,000
confirm that but rainfall I think is a

592
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:21,400
lot more uncertain how heavy it's really

593
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
going to get it it it's projected to get

594
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:25,720
heavier but I don't think we know how

595
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,320
much heavier the heavy rainfall will be

596
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,559
and that worries me and things like you

597
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,919
know what it's going to do with

598
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,559
hurricanes you know we don't have an

599
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:34,279
infrastructure built to withstand the

600
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,480
kind of changes we're going to see we're

601
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:38,840
already seeing bad stuff happening there

602
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,320
was recently very heavy rain in Florida

603
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:42,559
caused a lot of flooding and the

604
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,880
governor as he want to do came out and

605
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:46,200
of course denied that this had anything

606
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:48,520
to do with climate change but it was

607
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,880
emblematic to me of of a problem that

608
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:52,360
you have when you're discussing this

609
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:54,200
with people and people who should not

610
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:57,039
say such things will will often

611
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:58,960
attribute one storm or another or a tree

612
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:01,799
falling down to climate change I mean it

613
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,600
sounds absurd even to me and so we're

614
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:05,399
sort of stuck in this world where in

615
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,440
order to make the case that it's

616
00:25:05,399 --> 00:25:10,720
perceptible one of your

617
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:13,840
3ps we've got to somehow claim those

618
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:16,559
events for climate and and how do you do

619
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:18,399
that I mean it's a statistical game yeah

620
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:20,320
and but you know people again are are

621
00:25:18,399 --> 00:25:23,840
are smarter than I think we give them

622
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:26,200
credit for yes these are familiar

623
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:29,399
phenomena in the sense that we've seen

624
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:33,159
heavy rainfall before but the idea that

625
00:25:29,399 --> 00:25:35,520
not only is it heavier than we ever had

626
00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:37,840
it's also happening more often is

627
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,480
actually not that hard for people to get

628
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,320
are we plotting graphs of these things I

629
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:43,240
mean so that the statistics are really

630
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:45,640
excitable where can we find

631
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:48,399
them I mean they're certainly in the

632
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:50,760
ipcc reports uh you can certainly find

633
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:52,559
them there the ipcc tell us more about

634
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:55,080
the ipcc you've been involved with that

635
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:57,279
for a long time the intergovernmental

636
00:25:55,080 --> 00:26:00,080
panel on climate change is an

637
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:02,039
international group that provides

638
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:04,880
assessments of the state of the science

639
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:07,279
and of the impacts and of the policy

640
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,360
options there's three different groups

641
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:12,320
and I was the co-chair of the science

642
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:14,799
panel in 2007 and we provide those

643
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:18,039
assessments to the UN and also to the

644
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:20,600
world so it's a very interesting process

645
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:21,919
you get to see how the negotiators work

646
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,559
the same people who negotiate the

647
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:27,320
treaties are the ones who discuss the

648
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:28,760
science with you it's often accused of

649
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,640
being sort of hij acted by the

650
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:33,399
negotiators I can tell you that is not

651
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:35,360
the case you know scientific assessment

652
00:26:33,399 --> 00:26:37,760
is so valuable not only for the

653
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,520
diplomats but also for for the public

654
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:42,919
because you you you

655
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:43,919
should look at those if you can you

656
00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:46,159
don't have to go through the big

657
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,600
underlying reports that are so thick but

658
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,880
you know you can look at the the

659
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:52,720
highlights and and ask yourself how did

660
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:56,760
this get agreed by 113 governments if

661
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:58,880
it's not true generally that it is true

662
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:00,520
because that's what has to happen to get

663
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,360
it agreed you know we're at the table

664
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:04,640
the Russians are at the table the

665
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:07,000
Europeans the developing countries

666
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,840
everybody it's quite a process you know

667
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,399
the ipcc did something in its more

668
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:16,520
recent assessment of climate science of

669
00:27:12,399 --> 00:27:18,520
showing what has to happen in emissions

670
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:21,640
over the course of the century in order

671
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:23,919
to achieve one and a half or two degree

672
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:26,799
temperature rise on average and and what

673
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:29,360
they showed was that we have to remove

674
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:32,039
they they labeled as removal of CO2 from

675
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:34,399
the atmosphere in order to achieve those

676
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:36,200
things and it was clear why they did it

677
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,320
I mean they they want to make sure you

678
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:40,480
understand I mean if we continue

679
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:42,320
emitting at the economic rate that we're

680
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,960
continuing to emit then we're going to

681
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,399
have to pull CO2 out of the atmosphere

682
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:47,039
to hit these numbers but it implied that

683
00:27:45,399 --> 00:27:49,320
we could in some way you know to see

684
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:51,559
that on a page make think oh well I'm a

685
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:54,080
diplomat I'm going to you know vote in

686
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:56,399
favor of uh having uh removals and it

687
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,640
was something like 10 gigatons a year

688
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:59,519
throughout much of the middle of the

689
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:01,679
century and in order to hit those

690
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:04,919
numbers what do you what do you think

691
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:07,080
about CO2 removal technology is that is

692
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:08,799
that really a practical option well you

693
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:11,960
know we talked about this quite a bit

694
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:15,640
earlier uh it's not going to be

695
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:18,760
practical in the next 10 years so it

696
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:21,399
gets back to if you decide that you're

697
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:24,399
going to continue to use fossil fuels

698
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:27,120
you're taking on sort of a carbon debt

699
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:30,279
that you then have to get rid of if you

700
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:32,679
want to for example keep the temperature

701
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:35,399
from going above 1 and A2 deg now maybe

702
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:37,559
you're going to decide you know 2° is

703
00:28:35,399 --> 00:28:39,600
okay then you don't have to remove it

704
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:41,880
you know those are the kinds of

705
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:44,600
decisions that are going to have to be

706
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:48,039
made and they present those

707
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:50,960
cases not to say this is the way to go

708
00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:53,799
or this is the most likely pathway they

709
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:56,200
present those cases just to show what

710
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:57,559
would happen if you chose this pathway

711
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,320
right they have a bunch of different

712
00:28:57,559 --> 00:29:00,720
pathways in fact so the implication

713
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:03,000
isn't that you can do it this is an

714
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,760
option that's available to you it's that

715
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,360
if you don't then you need a miracle to

716
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:08,039
occur and this is how big the miracle is

717
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:10,720
well or you you need to figure out how

718
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:13,320
you're going to adapt to a hotter

719
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:15,679
temperature adaptation that's another

720
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:18,120
really important topic because in large

721
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:20,200
part the problem with climate change is

722
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:23,640
not that two degrees warmer is

723
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:26,320
intolerable to us as people or that more

724
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:28,120
rain is intolerable to us as people we

725
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:31,000
can swim and we can find other plac

726
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:33,559
places to live is that it's too fast we

727
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,519
can't adapt and the ecosystem can't

728
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:37,320
adapt and other species with less

729
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:40,159
technological capacity than us can't

730
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:42,360
adapt for sure something I think about a

731
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:44,880
lot I haven't quite bottomed out on it

732
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:47,399
is how we should think about allocating

733
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,559
resources toward mitigating climate

734
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:51,799
change trying to reduce emissions and

735
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:54,000
just saying oh my goodness we better put

736
00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:57,200
more money into adaptation building

737
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,279
dikes relocating populations how do you

738
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:02,799
think about that are you not prepared to

739
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:05,240
give up yet oh give up what I mean give

740
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:06,760
up mitigation definitely not yeah you

741
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:08,399
know you have to view it as a carbon

742
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:10,399
debt that you're G to have to pay back

743
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:14,720
so it's like a balloon mortgage I mean I

744
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:17,559
personally don't like that so I am in

745
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:20,279
favor of going all out right now on the

746
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:23,159
things we know how to do and get our

747
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:27,720
carbon emissions down I think we can hit

748
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:30,519
50% reduction by 2035 maybe what would

749
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:32,840
be like the top two things you would

750
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:34,799
push like let's say the US government to

751
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:37,640
do yeah I mean we're already doing them

752
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:40,080
frankly because the uh infrastructure

753
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:42,559
Act and the inflation reduction act have

754
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:45,000
a lot of stuff in there that if we do it

755
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:47,679
effectively we'll we'll drive down our

756
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,000
carbon emissions a lot so it's uh

757
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,480
electric vehicles certainly one of the

758
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,240
problems there is not building out

759
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,960
enough charging systems we're going to

760
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:58,279
have to really get going on that but we

761
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:00,240
could if we chose to um the the other

762
00:30:58,279 --> 00:31:01,919
thing is solving these problems of

763
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,200
connecting the solar that we know we

764
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:06,559
need to connect to the grid and and also

765
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:08,279
wind you know there's issues of Supply

766
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:10,840
chains that are affecting the the

767
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:12,760
buildout of wind we need to solve those

768
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:15,039
problems but they are solvable they are

769
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:16,480
things we could do right now so this is

770
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,840
a really important Point you're making

771
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,120
because the cheapest thing we can do is

772
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:21,760
simply not to emit CO2 and then we don't

773
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:25,080
have to clean it up the next cheapest

774
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:27,279
thing is to quickly develop mitigative

775
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:30,120
Technologies like electrification of

776
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:32,120
cars that costs a certain amount and and

777
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:33,519
certainly affects our economy maybe

778
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:35,720
modestly

779
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:38,639
negatively but the most expensive thing

780
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:40,159
we can do is try to adapt in the future

781
00:31:38,639 --> 00:31:43,240
because we haven't dealt with those

782
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:45,360
things I mean moving New York City is a

783
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:47,480
lot more expensive than putting in some

784
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:49,039
charge points for 100 you know moving

785
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:50,880
Miami for example which we already

786
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:53,000
talked about is going to be real

787
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:56,639
expensive one thing we have not talked

788
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,679
about is the geoengineering piece of it

789
00:31:56,639 --> 00:32:00,000
I don't know how much you've thought

790
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:01,960
about about this um this idea of like

791
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,399
maybe injecting stuff into the

792
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:07,000
atmosphere how much have you thought

793
00:32:03,399 --> 00:32:09,080
about it where where's your head on that

794
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,559
I've thought about it quite a bit Yeah

795
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:12,799
because many of those schemes involve

796
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:14,840
injecting something into the

797
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:18,080
stratosphere which I know a fair amount

798
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:19,919
about they are uh zany I mean they're

799
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:23,440
that's the only word I can think of for

800
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:27,320
them really um it's it's so refreshing

801
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:31,039
to hear that it's not that we don't have

802
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:35,080
the potental poal to do those things but

803
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:36,880
you know do we really want to put sulfur

804
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:39,360
in the stratosphere which is what

805
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:41,840
they're talking about it's be like like

806
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:44,279
little volcanoes going all the time that

807
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:46,360
actually we know from stratospheric work

808
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:50,080
would destroy the ozone layer it would

809
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:51,960
be detrimental to the ozone layer so um

810
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,880
it's not going to completely destroy it

811
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:55,840
but it would give us some ozone loss you

812
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:58,519
know do we really want to take an action

813
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:00,600
to to set back the most successful

814
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:02,679
environmental protocol we've ever had

815
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:04,559
but more important than that there are

816
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:06,120
several things that are wrong about it

817
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:08,960
let me start with with the one of the

818
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:12,320
big ones for me and that is that when

819
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:15,559
you talk about it as if it were just a

820
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:17,679
scientific problem you're basically

821
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:19,720
normalizing the issue you're you're

822
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:22,720
making it something that the public is

823
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:24,600
going to hear saying oh scientists think

824
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,840
they can solve this isn't that great so

825
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,799
now I don't have to worry about it I

826
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,960
mean it's that lethargy problem that we

827
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:32,159
talked about before it's a perfect

828
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:35,519
excuse for complete lethargy let the

829
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:37,799
scientists figure it out and I have a

830
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:42,200
serious question here is it really the

831
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:44,159
proper role of science to be normalizing

832
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:46,720
something that we don't know how to

833
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:48,919
govern the real problem is there's no

834
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,679
reasonable governance structure for this

835
00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:52,399
who's going to be in charge of putting

836
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:53,639
all that sulfur in the stratosphere and

837
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:56,039
how are they going to set that

838
00:33:53,639 --> 00:33:58,039
thermostat for the whole world you know

839
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:59,960
who's going to decide if it's Russ they

840
00:33:58,039 --> 00:34:02,120
might like to be quite a lot High warmer

841
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:04,159
they pretty cold country you know make

842
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:05,760
Siberia you know a place where you can

843
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:07,519
grow a lot more wheat that might sound

844
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:10,359
real good to them it's not going to be

845
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:14,079
any individual country but they have the

846
00:34:10,359 --> 00:34:15,839
capacity to do it and so do individuals

847
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:18,040
you know is it I have nothing against

848
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:19,720
him but is it Elon Musk who's going to

849
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:22,839
set the thermostat for the whole world I

850
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:25,639
mean governance is a big big issue and

851
00:34:22,839 --> 00:34:27,079
it's not being talked about somehow the

852
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:28,639
the idea is well we'll figure out the

853
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:29,760
technology first and then we'll worry

854
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:31,760
about the governance I think it should

855
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,440
be the other way around let's actually

856
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,119
have a serious discussion about how we

857
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,879
would govern this thing if it was

858
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:39,040
possible you know it's a little bit like

859
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:41,720
covid you know people are now very upset

860
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:45,599
over the idea that really we don't have

861
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:47,960
enough biosafety in the world's Labs so

862
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:50,320
are we going to just keep doing

863
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:52,240
biological research that might be

864
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,000
dangerous without having a governance

865
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:56,960
structure that actually works at the

866
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,880
international level for dangerous things

867
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:01,320
you know so now there's beginning to be

868
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:03,640
a little discussion around International

869
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:06,040
governance of that kind of of

870
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:07,839
research I think you have to ask those

871
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:10,520
governance questions in the in the world

872
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:13,160
that we have today so geoengineering

873
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:15,520
worries me that way the other problems

874
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:18,440
with it scientific ones are you keep

875
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:20,920
emitting this the the carbon which means

876
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:24,760
you keep acidifying the ocean and the

877
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:27,400
dangers of that are big you also change

878
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:30,200
the rainfall patterns and maybe it's

879
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:32,800
only one country that suddenly maybe

880
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:35,839
it's India doesn't get the monsoon rains

881
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:37,240
anymore and so their agricultural system

882
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:39,839
is completely

883
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:42,640
upended is that going to be okay you

884
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:44,760
know personally I don't think it's okay

885
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:48,960
you know another problem is how do you

886
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:50,960
stop once you start if you stop you will

887
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,640
have a response in the climate system

888
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,880
and there's some evidence to suggest

889
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:58,480
that right now we've sort of done that

890
00:35:54,880 --> 00:36:00,640
experiment when you look at how hot

891
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,480
temperatures are for the last year and a

892
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,599
half or so you know they're they're

893
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,480
unbelievably hot much hotter than we

894
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:08,920
expected yes it's been an elino but it

895
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:11,040
isn't that extreme of an elino that it

896
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:14,079
should have produced this kind of global

897
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:15,800
massive temperature rise there's some

898
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:17,560
evidence to suggest I'm not saying this

899
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:20,520
is proven yet but it's being talked

900
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:24,599
about that the reason it happened is

901
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:27,319
that shipping fuels got cleaned up so

902
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:29,319
the fuels for um boats you know there's

903
00:36:27,319 --> 00:36:32,400
a lot of cargo that gets transferred by

904
00:36:29,319 --> 00:36:35,000
by ship nowadays that stuff used to have

905
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,599
very sulfurous fuels that it burned

906
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,280
which put particles in the atmosphere

907
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:40,920
not as high up as the stratosphere but

908
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:42,839
you know enough to make clouds and that

909
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:44,599
that has gone way down because the

910
00:36:42,839 --> 00:36:46,000
shipping industry decided to clean up

911
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:48,280
their fuel well it's great that they

912
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,800
cleaned up their fuel but it meant that

913
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:52,760
the particles went away and that may be

914
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:55,240
part of what's happening in fact there's

915
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:57,280
papers that suggest that is the story I

916
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:59,440
I'm not sure I believe it yet but it's a

917
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:01,160
certain a viable Theory but the notion

918
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:04,040
being you you take the geoengineering

919
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:05,800
away ands away you are going to get

920
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:07,319
warmer how much warmer is it going to

921
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,040
give you a little you know a serious

922
00:37:07,319 --> 00:37:10,359
thermal shock and all kinds of other

923
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:13,640
shocks like have happened in the last

924
00:37:10,359 --> 00:37:16,079
two years I mean it's it's been bad heat

925
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:17,440
waves have killed people right now heat

926
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:20,000
waves are killing people last summer

927
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,960
heat waves killed people heavy rainfall

928
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,079
has uh has caused a tremendous amount of

929
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:26,520
damage and

930
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:30,280
death you know it goes on and on the

931
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:33,240
world doesn't adapt easily to Quick

932
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:34,560
changes so once you start you know

933
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:38,359
you're going to you're going to have to

934
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:39,880
keep going and boy is it is it messy and

935
00:37:38,359 --> 00:37:41,560
with no International governance

936
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:44,359
structure are you kidding

937
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:46,040
me my sense is that this this topic

938
00:37:44,359 --> 00:37:49,480
though of geoengineering has gone from

939
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:51,599
being a taboo 10 years ago to one where

940
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:53,240
people are trying to do the experiments

941
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:55,599
they're talking about it a lot more than

942
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:57,960
they used to it's almost socially

943
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:59,640
acceptable that's kind of scary

944
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:01,359
that is this creeping normalization that

945
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:03,880
I just talked about and I think it

946
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:06,400
should not have happened I think more

947
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:09,520
scientists should have spoken out as I

948
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:11,640
do and I wasn't thinking that clearly

949
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:15,240
about it either to be honest with you

950
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:18,640
five years ago and said let's let's talk

951
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:21,040
governance first and Technology second

952
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:23,040
because boy we don't want to invent

953
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:25,599
something that's that dangerous I think

954
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:28,400
the media is also kind of fascinated by

955
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:32,079
it I mean I think partially it seems

956
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:34,599
like wow like could this be the solution

957
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:36,839
what an amazing sort of Science Fiction

958
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:38,839
come to light there's some charismatic

959
00:38:36,839 --> 00:38:40,359
scientists who I shall not name

960
00:38:38,839 --> 00:38:42,480
wandering around talking about this

961
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:44,800
stuff starting companies that do this

962
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,640
kind of stuff and um I would agree with

963
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,760
you that this this this should not be

964
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:51,720
going on governance should happen first

965
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,760
and if it's if the governance system has

966
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:56,200
worked out and it's all clear-cut how

967
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:58,400
you govern the research and also how you

968
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:00,119
govern the implementation

969
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,119
then we're ready to actually do the

970
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:04,720
research but we're doing the research

971
00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:06,599
like like Cowboys in the wild wild west

972
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,680
and so the public is getting a message

973
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:13,200
that is normalizing the conversation and

974
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:15,200
that is not good yeah so finally um you

975
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:18,280
written a book called solvable which

976
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,760
seems like a really optimistic title for

977
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:23,200
like a tough

978
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:26,359
subject um and and we know we're in a

979
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:30,560
country and in a world where people have

980
00:39:26,359 --> 00:39:32,400
a very wide variety of views about

981
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:34,760
climate change what if anything we

982
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,880
should do about it politicians are all

983
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:38,400
over the map on that kind of thing given

984
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:41,280
what we've talked about what makes you

985
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:43,760
think like yeah this is

986
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:46,280
solvable I really believe we're right on

987
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:49,079
the cusp of succeeding with this problem

988
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:52,680
we are right on the inflection point and

989
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:54,319
the reason is that basically when I look

990
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:56,240
at environmental issue after

991
00:39:54,319 --> 00:39:58,160
environmental issue I see the same

992
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:00,800
factors that

993
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:04,240
characterize when we start to achieve

994
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:06,640
success it's the public being engaged

995
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:09,359
and interested and feeling that it's

996
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:12,359
personal the technology steering going

997
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:14,800
on that makes Solutions practical we've

998
00:40:12,359 --> 00:40:16,520
seen all of that and it's not just in

999
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,359
this country I would say I mean you're

1000
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:22,079
you're quite right to point out that we

1001
00:40:18,359 --> 00:40:25,640
have a a deeply divided nation in many

1002
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:27,760
ways on the other hand amazingly doing

1003
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:30,680
something good about climate change

1004
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:33,680
doing doing actions to to mitigate to

1005
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:36,040
help climate change not be as bad is

1006
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:38,480
popular in this country when people do

1007
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:40,240
polls so people would like to see that

1008
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,960
happen people are in favor of clean

1009
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:45,160
energy and it's getting cheap enough

1010
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:47,240
that it's overtaken a lot of the other

1011
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:48,839
energy I mean you can bang on the table

1012
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:50,599
all you want and say I'm going to bring

1013
00:40:48,839 --> 00:40:53,640
back coal no one's going to bring back

1014
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:56,560
coal it's uneconomic it's on the way out

1015
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:59,160
we've seen that for years the number of

1016
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:01,040
coal plants has decreased dramatically

1017
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:04,079
and it's happening all around the world

1018
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:07,839
so economics and public

1019
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:09,880
interest and enough of a push to move

1020
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:11,720
those things along is exactly what we

1021
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:14,079
need we are going to have to change a

1022
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:16,280
big chunk of our infrastructure but you

1023
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:18,520
know there's more and more evidence that

1024
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:20,640
we can do that relatively easily people

1025
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:22,359
used to say oh the Grid it's too hard

1026
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,280
we'll never change the grid so that it

1027
00:41:22,359 --> 00:41:28,040
can distribute energy so

1028
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:30,280
easily we now have carbon fiber wires

1029
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:32,280
that we can put in place of the existing

1030
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:34,319
wires that will be much more efficient

1031
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:36,160
and will move that energy around the

1032
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:38,200
only thing stopping us from doing it is

1033
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,960
doing it's not that expensive to replace

1034
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:42,760
the wiring and it's old and falling

1035
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:44,599
apart anyway that's why the

1036
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:46,520
infrastructure Act and the inflation

1037
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:48,680
reduction act were so popular because

1038
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:50,599
they incentivized doing a lot of the

1039
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:53,000
right stuff and in other countries it

1040
00:41:50,599 --> 00:41:54,680
will happen too if if we're not in the

1041
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,400
Forefront you know maybe it's going to

1042
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:58,160
be the Europeans this time we were in

1043
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,200
the Forefront on solving ozone depletion

1044
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:02,520
it's fine with me if you know if

1045
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:04,760
somebody else carries the the the heavy

1046
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:06,560
water on this one and and to a large

1047
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:08,640
extent they have been carrying more

1048
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:10,800
water than we have the reason is that

1049
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:13,079
they are less fossil Rich than we are

1050
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:15,960
it's the fossil rich countries like and

1051
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:17,880
is mainly China and the United States

1052
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:20,680
that have a big job to

1053
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:22,680
do but you know they're not the only

1054
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:26,440
consumers in the world and the pressure

1055
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:28,800
on industry is enormous to be able to

1056
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:31,000
sell not only in the US but to sell

1057
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,960
overseas too that's why all the car

1058
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,640
companies want to go electric because

1059
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,960
they want to make cars they can sell in

1060
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:39,000
Europe too and you know Norway for

1061
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,760
example is already almost all electric

1062
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,480
vehicles it can be done Norway is not a

1063
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:44,040
very easy country to get around in

1064
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,280
either you know they have fjords and

1065
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:49,280
mountains and you know and yet it's all

1066
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:51,920
good you know so we can do it me like we

1067
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:54,240
we're going through your three PS in in

1068
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:56,280
phases you know we've we've got the

1069
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:58,200
perceptible personal and I think we

1070
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:00,160
really are moving into the practical now

1071
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:01,920
as these things become affordable and we

1072
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,839
figure out how to put them together and

1073
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,240
that's what's happened in every single

1074
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:09,520
past problem whether you talk about

1075
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:13,359
leaden paint leaden gas DDT the ozone

1076
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:15,400
layer smog you name it we did it and we

1077
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:17,599
moved some big Industries around by the

1078
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:20,240
way yeah you know DDT moved the farming

1079
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:22,040
industry out of its comfort zone smog

1080
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,839
moved the automobile industry out of its

1081
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:25,839
comfort zone and the automobile industry

1082
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:28,380
was as big as the US fossil fuel

1083
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:30,920
industry in those days

1084
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:32,319

Susan Solomon is Professor of

1086
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:36,839
atmospheric chemistry and climate

1087
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:38,680
science at MIT her new book is solvable

1088
00:43:36,839 --> 00:43:41,720
how we healed the Earth and how we can

1089
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:43,960
do it again Susan Solon thank you so

1090
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:46,160
much this is great thank you thanks for

1091
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:46,160
having

1092
