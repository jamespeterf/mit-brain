1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,020

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:06,440
So welcome.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,590
Welcome, everyone.

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:08,830
My name is Bill Green.

5
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:11,680
I'm the Director of the
MIT Energy Initiative.

6
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:16,490
I thank you all for coming
for our seminar today.

7
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:20,990
MITEI is hosting
the seminar series

8
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:24,560
to try to keep the
MIT community informed

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,150
about important work happening
all over to decarbonize

10
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,670
the world's energy system.

11
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:33,590
In particular, in the
United States, and today

12
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:38,330
we have US Congressman
to talk about that.

13
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:41,030
The key challenge for
the energy transition

14
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:45,680
is the urgency that the climate
is changing before our eyes

15
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,440
and we really need to move,
but, of course, there's

16
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,170
still many technical aspects
that we haven't figured out

17
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:52,675
exactly what to do yet.

18
00:00:52,675 --> 00:00:54,300
And in other cases,
we know what to do,

19
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,300
but it costs a lot of money or
it requires a lot of changes,

20
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:02,030
and so we have to figure
out how to move faster.

21
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:04,819
And so one way that
MIT can help with this

22
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:10,430
is by convening thought
leaders and discussions

23
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:13,490
about all the many,
many issues involved

24
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,440
in the energy transition.

25
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:20,240
And hopefully, those discussions
will lead to consensus

26
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,493
on how we should move
forward and maybe spark

27
00:01:23,493 --> 00:01:25,660
ideas that will lead to new
innovations here at MIT.

28
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:30,310

29
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:32,210
A very important part of this--

30
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:36,280
MIT, we mostly are
engineers and scientists,

31
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,980
economists, business people.

32
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:43,780
And we work on trying
to solve the problems we

33
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,770
can in front of us.

34
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:49,390
But in the end, the
climate challenge

35
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,890
is a problem of
collective action.

36
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:55,270
That if everyone just follows
their own individual interests

37
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:58,190
in the short-term, we're never
going to solve the problem.

38
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:00,320
We only can solve it
when we work together.

39
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,410
And, of course, the
government has a key role

40
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:03,860
in helping to pull us together.

41
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,850
And so today we'll hear
Congressman Sean Casten

42
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:07,610
talk about that.

43
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:10,235
For the introduction, I'd like
to bring forward Professor Chris

44
00:02:10,235 --> 00:02:11,350
Knittel.

45
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:16,370
Chris is the Director of the
MIT Climate Policy Project,

46
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:16,870
is that--

47
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:17,500
Climate Policy--

48
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,200
--Policy Center.

49
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,340
Climate Policy Center.

50
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,700
He's also the
Director of the Center

51
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,430
for Energy and Environmental
Policy Research.

52
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:27,430
He's also Associate
Dean of the Sloan

53
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:30,140
School for Climate and Energy--

54
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,467
I got that right?

55
00:02:31,467 --> 00:02:32,300
Something like that.

56
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,030
Something like that.

57
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:38,380
And as you'll see, he's
quite a good speaker

58
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:43,180
and was named Professor of the
Year by the Undergraduate and--

59
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:46,100
Economics Association
at the end of last year.

60
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,170
[APPLAUSE]

61
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:49,600
And so he will give
an introduction

62
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,980
for our main speaker today.

63
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:51,580
Thanks, Bill.

64
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,210
Yeah, I won that award.

65
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:55,290
Two of my colleagues
won the Nobel Prize.

66
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:58,190
[LAUGHTER]

67
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:58,690

68
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:01,600
If somebody wants a
trade, let me know.

69
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,760
So you know you're a
big deal when you get

70
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,270
two people to introduce you.

71
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:12,070
So I just wanted to briefly
introduce Representative Sean

72
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:17,230
Casten from the great
6th District of Illinois?

73
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,100
The greatest.

74
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,140
The greatest.

75
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,120
In many ways, when I
was looking at his bio,

76
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,000
he looks a lot like
one of my colleagues

77
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,110
from the Martin Trust Center for
Entrepreneurship than a sitting

78
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,490
congressman.

79
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:34,310
So he's actually a
trained graduate--

80
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:38,690
trained biochemical engineer.

81
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,970
Out of grad school,
it looks like he

82
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:44,150
was an energy consultant,
and then a CEO of a company

83
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:48,840
that took waste heat and
recycled that into usable heat,

84
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,380
and maybe we'll learn a little
bit about that technology.

85
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,860
Then he started his
own company to--

86
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:58,280
sounds like to
something very similar.

87
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,250
And then apparently, he
got bored with industry

88
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,060
and thought he'd
run for Congress.

89
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,830
So he ran for Congress
in 2018, flipped the seat

90
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,560
from a Republican to Democrat.

91
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:14,840
And in many ways, climate
and energy is his focus.

92
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,709
I encourage you to look up the
bills that he's cosponsored

93
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:24,600
and the bills that have passed
into acts, but he has many.

94
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,640
He has one sitting now, which
is near and dear to many

95
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:33,170
of our hearts that would build
more transmission and to free up

96
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:36,800
some of the permitting
and siting challenges

97
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,320
we have with transmission
that would have

98
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,830
big impacts on
greenhouse gas emissions

99
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:45,000
and on costs and on efficiency.

100
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,900
So I'm looking forward to
hearing what he has to say.

101
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:52,250
I think the plan afterwards
is we'll both sit down,

102
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,780
I'll ask a couple of
questions, and at some point,

103
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,990
you'll have the opportunity
to ask questions yourself.

104
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:00,800
So I also encourage you
to be thinking about what

105
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,550
those questions might be.

106
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:05,240
So without further
ado, Sean Casten.

107
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,436
Thank you.

108
00:05:06,436 --> 00:05:09,670
[APPLAUSE]

109
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:10,170

110
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,570
You want me to stand over here?

111
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:12,200
Yeah.

112
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,130
OK.

113
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:14,160
You can go up there.

114
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,350
All right.

115
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:17,580
Well, thank you so much.

116
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:21,030
I'm hoping we can spend
most of our time on the Q&A,

117
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:23,495
but I wanted to--

118
00:05:23,495 --> 00:05:25,790
let's not deny this
is a political season.

119
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,360
All eyes are to the election.

120
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,330
Any conversation about
forward energy policy

121
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,070
largely depends on the election.

122
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,480
And I don't want to
duck the politics,

123
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,680
but I want to just
first just frame

124
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,250
four macro trends,
that regardless of what

125
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,170
happens in this election
or the next election,

126
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:44,900
the trend lines are not
fundamentally changing.

127
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:49,220
The first is that the
United States has largely

128
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:52,080
decoupled economic growth
from fossil fuel consumption.

129
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,470
We're not done, we've
got a long way to go.

130
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:57,710
But if you look over
the last 15 years,

131
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:00,320
our economy has grown by 50%.

132
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,540
Natural gas use
has grown by 25%.

133
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,430
Oil use is flat.

134
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,620
Coal use is down by 50%

135
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,670
That is awesome.

136
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:11,490
We have found ways
to grow our economy

137
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:13,690
without linking to
fossil fuel use,

138
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,760
and that was a long time coming.

139
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,730
And that raises a
question going forward,

140
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:21,570
are we going to leave what's in
the United States in the ground

141
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:23,160
or are we going to export it?

142
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,620
That's a political question.

143
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,442
One of those is good for the
economy and the environment,

144
00:06:28,442 --> 00:06:31,150
the other is good for producers,
but that's a political question.

145
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:35,040
But that basic trend of
decarbonization, defossilization

146
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,770
is going to continue.

147
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:44,190
Second big macro trend is the
combination of electrification

148
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,730
and renewable deployment.

149
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:50,080
We didn't reduce coal
use, reduce oil--

150
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,990
flattened oil use,
slow down gas use,

151
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:54,130
and not provide
access to electricity.

152
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:56,760
We now generate more power
from non-hydro renewables

153
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,760
than we do from coal.

154
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,427
That is amazing.

155
00:06:58,427 --> 00:07:00,010
But we've built a
ton of it, and we've

156
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:02,100
built it because the
private sector largely

157
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,630
realized that it's cheaper.

158
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:08,190
We're also electrifying
huge parts of the country.

159
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:12,360
And we're electrifying in
places that don't have wires.

160
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,200
In the case of my
house, my garage,

161
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,190
where my electric vehicle
is now plugged in,

162
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,780
factories that are
electrifying-- this

163
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,800
is a larger trend.

164
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,330
That's also good
news because it's

165
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:24,210
much easier to decarbonize
the electric sector

166
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,480
than other sectors.

167
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,640
But building generation
in places where generation

168
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,390
has historically not
been, it's just there

169
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:33,430
because it's windy or sunny or
a lot of geothermal activity,

170
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:36,120
building loads in places where
loads have not historically

171
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,570
been, which means we have
to either build wires

172
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:42,300
way faster than we've
built wires before,

173
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,760
or just decide that
we love blackouts.

174
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,310
And that's a political question.

175
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:51,390
I have a bias, but it's
a political question.

176
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,773
Third big trend, and--

177
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:57,660

178
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,540
we are reinvesting
in manufacturing

179
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,490
in the United States.

180
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:07,540
And this is an inversion
of a 30-year trend.

181
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:10,440
We used to run about $70
billion a year of investments

182
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,910
in manufacturing.

183
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:14,550
I think we did $150
billion last year.

184
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:18,550
And a part of that
has been because

185
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:21,430
of, let's say, more
protectionist sentiments

186
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,650
in the United States,
but a part of it

187
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:25,870
has been because we really--

188
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:28,270
we basically ran
about as far as we

189
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:31,450
could go by getting cheap
stuff by outsourcing.

190
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:35,530
You can shut down the plant in
El Paso that pays $9 an hour

191
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,947
and move it to Ciudad Tavares
where they pay $0.90 an hour

192
00:08:37,947 --> 00:08:40,572
and you can lower your cost, but
you only really get to do that

193
00:08:40,572 --> 00:08:41,090
once.

194
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:43,900
And we ran that
gamut out, and a lot

195
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:48,638
of the hollowing out of the
middle class resulted from that.

196
00:08:48,638 --> 00:08:50,930
And there's been a very
bipartisan consensus to saying,

197
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,350
let's bring that
manufacturing back.

198
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:57,220
We've not really--
we haven't done

199
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:00,680
that with some grand
long-term intentional plan.

200
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:04,240
And so now we're having to
have this conversation around,

201
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,330
would you rather have
a factory in your town

202
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:09,980
that employs people and
provides a middle-class income

203
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:13,000
or would you rather
have cheap stuff?

204
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,830
And I'm not laying that at the
blame of some of the Inflation,

205
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,440
but that's a real challenge.

206
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,400
There's huge conversations
right now going

207
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,220
on in the solar
industry of, should we

208
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,590
look out for the interests
of solar developers

209
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:27,710
who want to have the lowest-cost
plant so that they can sell

210
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:30,270
power to Americans at the
lowest possible price,

211
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:33,140
or should we prioritize the
interests of US solar panel

212
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,390
manufacturers who would like
to sell at a higher price

213
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:38,750
and bypass Chinese
supply chains?

214
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,550
If that question sounds like
you can argue both sides of it,

215
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,080
you get why that's a challenge.

216
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,070
But that-- again, that trend
of bringing more manufacturing

217
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:48,320
United States in the wake
of COVID, making more robust

218
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,695
supply chains, I don't think
that's going away regardless

219
00:09:50,695 --> 00:09:51,800
of who wins.

220
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:56,480
And then the last
big macro trend

221
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:02,120
is that we are increasingly
awash in cheap energy.

222
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,650
It may not feel that
way in the bills,

223
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:07,280
but almost everything--
in your utility bills,

224
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,770
but virtually everything
we're building

225
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:12,190
has no marginal operating cost.

226
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,190
If you put a solar
panel on your roof,

227
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:18,440
you may or may not have
the spare cash lying around

228
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,190
to invest in the solar
panel on your roof,

229
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:21,240
but once you put
it on your roof,

230
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,823
you don't pay for
electricity anymore.

231
00:10:22,823 --> 00:10:24,907
If you have the cash to
put in an electric vehicle

232
00:10:24,907 --> 00:10:27,210
in your driveway, you don't
pay for gasoline anymore.

233
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,835
If you have the cash to insulate
your home, put a heat pump in,

234
00:10:29,835 --> 00:10:31,550
you don't pay for
natural gas anymore.

235
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:34,250
Whether you get an acceptable
return on that investment

236
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,590
is one set of questions,
but we're building

237
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:38,480
all of this cheap energy.

238
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,810
And that raises a
separate question,

239
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,780
which starts to get into
the politics of this,

240
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:49,520
is it the goal of
US energy policy

241
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,850
to maximize the
benefit to US consumers

242
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:55,610
or to maximize the
benefit to US producers?

243
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:59,300
And that may sound like
there's a really obvious answer

244
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,450
to that question, but
it is hugely contentious

245
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:04,220
and it is hugely political.

246
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:08,420
And this now gets into
where I want to just flag,

247
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:12,800
without being overly political,
just to understand how

248
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,140
politics factors into all this.

249
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:21,930
In April of 2020, the price
of gasoline collapsed.

250
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:24,270
I'm sure you all
remember how sad you

251
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:28,530
were that gasoline was so cheap,
and how your heart was breaking

252
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:31,790
about what should we do
for our poor oil refiners?

253
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:34,660

254
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,120
Senator Cassidy from
Louisiana introduced a bill

255
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,200
to the Senate that said that the
United States should threaten

256
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,650
to withhold military
aid from Saudi Arabia

257
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:47,170
unless they curtail
oil production to raise

258
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:53,770
the prices of gasoline and
oil to protect oil producers

259
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:56,440
in his home state of Louisiana.

260
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,360
Donald Trump responded
to that by calling

261
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,400
the Saudis threatening
to withhold military aid.

262
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,850
The Saudis responded.

263
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:04,220
They clamped down the taps
and the price of oil went up.

264
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:07,300
If you go and you look up the
cover of Fox Business, Bloomberg

265
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:10,240
Business on April 1,
2020, you will see people

266
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,250
praising Donald Trump for
his negotiating skills

267
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,090
because he saved
the US oil industry.

268
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:18,190
Fast forward two years when the
price of oil was really high.

269
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:21,900
Myself, Susan Wild,
and Tom Malinowski,

270
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:27,060
because we're cheeky,
introduced the exact same bill,

271
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,850
but swapped one word and
said the US should with

272
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,318
withhold military aid to Saudi
Arabia unless they ramp up

273
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:34,110
production so that we
lower the cost of oil

274
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:35,630
to American consumers.

275
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,650
Senator Cassidy said
clearly we don't understand

276
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:38,760
how energy prices work.

277
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,843
At that point we had a
Democrat in the White House

278
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:44,022
and it was not deemed
appropriate to threaten

279
00:12:44,022 --> 00:12:45,730
to withdraw military
aid from the Saudis,

280
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,070
and so we didn't do anything.

281
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:50,550
So it's hard for me
not to argue that we

282
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:53,700
have a bipartisan consensus
to prioritize energy producers

283
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,260
over energy consumers.

284
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,790
I'm not happy about that.

285
00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:00,990
I'm just saying that was
arguably the lesson of those two

286
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,220
moments.

287
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:06,890
You can also see this
in US electric markets.

288
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:09,990
When FERC Order 1000
was passed to try

289
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:12,840
to debottleneck some of the
transmission in the country,

290
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,760
prior to that, we were
building about $10 billion

291
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,210
a year of transmission wires.

292
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:19,830
Almost instantly that
doubled to $20 billion.

293
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:22,450
Virtually all of the
wires that were built

294
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:25,750
were built to
enhance reliability,

295
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,000
to get power to places where
there were some shortages

296
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,100
and bottlenecks.

297
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,690
Virtually none was to lower
the price on the grid.

298
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:35,020
So if you're sitting at
two points on the grid

299
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:39,110
where one spot is paying
$90 a megawatt-hour,

300
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:42,423
another place is awash in wind
paying $30 a megawatt-hour,

301
00:13:42,423 --> 00:13:44,590
you would think there would
be an economic incentive

302
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,060
to build that wire, except
that to build that wire,

303
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:50,307
you need the approval of the
person sitting there at $90.

304
00:13:50,307 --> 00:13:52,390
There's an old saying in
the power industry, which

305
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:55,383
is patently true, that asking
a utility for permission

306
00:13:55,383 --> 00:13:56,800
to interconnect
to their system is

307
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,290
asking a man to date his wife.

308
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:01,030

309
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:03,970
It might be in the
national interest,

310
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:07,330
but that's not going to be the
fulcrum of the conversation.

311
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:12,730
And so we've got this huge
challenge in our electric sector

312
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:17,830
as well of what happens
if you are a utility that

313
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,990
has a return on
equity you have to hit

314
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:22,910
and the utility regulator wants
to make sure you stay solvent,

315
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,910
and what you know is if
the price of electricity

316
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:27,368
falls because a bunch of cheap
solar, a bunch of cheap wind

317
00:14:27,368 --> 00:14:29,050
comes onto your grid,
you're not going

318
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:30,560
to hit your return
on equity targets

319
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,940
and that's going to-- what
do you do in that case?

320
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,550
I'm not-- I'm doing my best to
argue the other side of that

321
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:39,910
equation, but this conversation
around "do we prioritize energy

322
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:43,410
producers or consumers"
is a political question.

323
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:46,780
And the reason why that's
become a political question

324
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:55,700
is because over the last 20
years, for unrelated reasons,

325
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:59,990
we went from being a
country, wherever you lived,

326
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:02,770
you were no more likely to
have Democratic or Republican

327
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:03,740
representation.

328
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:06,850
Tom Daschle out in the
Dakotas is a senior member

329
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:08,050
of the Senate.

330
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:12,340
Henry Hyde used to represent
my seat in suburban Chicago.

331
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:15,050
The way that our
country has evolved,

332
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:17,740
if you live in rural America,
you are almost certainly

333
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,490
represented by a
Republican today.

334
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:21,380
If you live in urban,
suburban America,

335
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,470
you're almost certainly
represented by a Democrat.

336
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:27,280
And the parts of
our country that

337
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:30,460
dig coal, drill
oil, drill gas tend

338
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,270
to be represented
by Republicans.

339
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,943
The parts of our
country that benefit

340
00:15:33,943 --> 00:15:35,360
from having cheap
energy that they

341
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,235
can turn into higher-value
goods and services

342
00:15:37,235 --> 00:15:38,910
tend to be represented
by Democrats.

343
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:44,150
And so if we were to actually
embrace clean energy, which

344
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:46,430
is also to embrace
cheap energy, it

345
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:50,720
would present a massive wealth
transfer from energy producers

346
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,450
to energy consumers, from
red America to blue America,

347
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:58,255
and that has become a huge
political lightning rod.

348
00:15:58,255 --> 00:15:59,630
And I think one
of the challenges

349
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,255
that we've tried to
do in the Inflation

350
00:16:01,255 --> 00:16:04,580
Reduction Act is to make sure
that we know that we're creating

351
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,030
more wealth than
we're destroying,

352
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:10,160
but how do we make sure
that everybody gets a slice?

353
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,390
If we follow George Bush's
advice and make the pie higher,

354
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,430
how do we make
sure that everybody

355
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:18,090
gets a slice of that pie?

356
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:20,420
And I think that's a
political challenge

357
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,110
we have to be sensitive to.

358
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:26,150
We can respect where people come
from, even as it sounds crazy,

359
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:28,160
that that's even a debate.

360
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,860
And the last thing I'll say on
that, and then we can hop down,

361
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:35,230
is to watch in really
very close time what

362
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:38,500
happens with the LNG pause
that's underway right now.

363
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,300
The Biden White House--

364
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:43,900
the Natural Gas Act says that
the Department of Energy cannot

365
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:47,560
approve a natural gas
export facility unless

366
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,270
it's in the national interest.

367
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:52,133
There's been this surge
of LNG export capacity

368
00:16:52,133 --> 00:16:53,800
and the Biden White
House said that they

369
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,360
were going to go
through and review

370
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,390
whether the additional capacity
was in the national interest.

371
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:02,920
Those plants that are
held up by that pause

372
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:06,609
represent enough CO2 to
essentially basically

373
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:09,560
match and exceed the current
total CO2 emissions of Europe.

374
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,700
It is a huge carbon bomb
that's sitting there.

375
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:16,359
If we-- every time there's
been a outage at an export

376
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:19,210
facility in the United States--
the Freeport facility in Texas

377
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:22,040
is the one that's happened now
twice, once for maintenance,

378
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,599
once unplanned, the price of gas
in the United States has fallen.

379
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:29,860
Unsurprisingly, more domestic
supply equals lower price.

380
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:32,890
Why would you want to
build something that's

381
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:35,480
a climate disaster and
raises the price of energy

382
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,300
in the United States?

383
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,305
Well, are we doing an
energy policy that's

384
00:17:39,305 --> 00:17:40,930
prioritizing the
interests of consumers

385
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:43,450
or prioritizing producers?

386
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:46,480
The White House has paused
that until after the election.

387
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,980
At some point in
the lame duck, they

388
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:50,170
will make a decision on that.

389
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:52,700
I have no inside information
about how that goes,

390
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,950
but it's a really,
really big deal.

391
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,710
And I don't know where
they'll sit on it,

392
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:02,600
but just understand those
to be political questions,

393
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,980
not fundamental policy
questions to understand

394
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,750
how it's going through,
and to the extent

395
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,820
that you choose to
be engaged on that,

396
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,770
understand where
the equities lie.

397
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:13,360
So I hope that's
helpful as I tried

398
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,570
to be very big
picture at the start,

399
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:16,250
and I'm sure we'll
get nerdy and wonky,

400
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,487
but look forward to the Q&A.

401
00:18:18,487 --> 00:18:21,966
[APPLAUSE]

402
00:18:21,966 --> 00:18:30,430

403
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:31,750
That's great.

404
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,620
And I will open it up soon.

405
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:37,360
I just had a couple of
questions to start with.

406
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,900
You hit on some
pretty big points.

407
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:42,320
I guess I'd love to hear your
perspective on the first one,

408
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,560
which is that we've
largely decoupled

409
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,940
our growth from energy.

410
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,200
What has led to that?

411
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,470
What are the main causes?

412
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:52,010
And was it policy-driven?

413
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:54,850
Was it technology-driven?

414
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:57,880
So I think the
biggest thing we did

415
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,295
was a commitment to
competitive markets, which

416
00:19:01,295 --> 00:19:03,920
I don't think we could do in the
current political environment.

417
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,920
But in the 1992
Energy Policy Act,

418
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,670
we created wholesale markets
that said for the first time,

419
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:12,340
we will set the
price of power based

420
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:16,580
on the lowest-cost generator
that clears the market stack.

421
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:19,610
And prior to that point, it
was just a cost recovery game.

422
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:22,690
And almost instantaneously,
the nuclear fleet

423
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:26,110
went from 60% to 90%
on the same asset base.

424
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:28,730
A ton of people built
combined-cycle gas plants.

425
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:31,640
20% of the entire US power
grid was built in 10 years

426
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,940
after that bill was passed.

427
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:36,860
200 gigawatts of-- I mean,
just shockingly large numbers.

428
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:39,115
And most of the companies
that built those went

429
00:19:39,115 --> 00:19:41,490
bankrupt because it led to
the price of power collapsing,

430
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:42,290
and then they didn't
make the money

431
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:43,665
that they had in
their pro forma,

432
00:19:43,665 --> 00:19:46,410
but we were left with all
these assets that were built.

433
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:49,370
And then when fracking
happened, all of a sudden you

434
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:52,280
had a ton of underutilized
high-efficiency gas

435
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,700
turbines that could compete
the Dickens against the coal

436
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,340
industry.

437
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:00,030
And so the coal industry was
basically dead to rights by '95,

438
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,980
it just took them 15
years to realize it.

439
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,840
And so you've seen the collapse.

440
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,440
And yes, there have been a
lot of state issues with RPSs,

441
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,150
and the huge decline
in solar and wind costs

442
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:14,450
have made a difference there as
well and that surge of capacity.

443
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:17,660
But I think that was probably
the biggest single piece that

444
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,680
drove that along.

445
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,575
Were you living in that
industry at the time?

446
00:20:20,575 --> 00:20:23,355

447
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:26,270
I got out of college in '93.

448
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:28,410
So I was not working
in the industry.

449
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:31,970
Full disclosure, my dad
testified before the Senate

450
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:35,360
in 1976 on what became
PURPA, and then built

451
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,250
the third-qualifying facility
in the country in Trenton,

452
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:44,210
New Jersey in 1979, so I kind
of grew up in this space.

453
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,000
A little fun fact.

454
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,310
The plant manager of
that plant in Trenton,

455
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:50,237
New Jersey, QF number 3, was
a guy named Don Lebowitz.

456
00:20:50,237 --> 00:20:52,070
His son Jon changed his
last name to Stewart

457
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:53,542
and went into comedy.

458
00:20:53,542 --> 00:20:55,310
[LAUGHTER]

459
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:56,880
Yeah.

460
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,980
Oh, interesting.

461
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,150
Yeah.

462
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,300
That'll be our next guest.

463
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,410
Yes, yes, yes.

464
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:06,740
Backing up a little bit, I
guess one question I had is,

465
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:09,990
you did have this industry
life before Congress.

466
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:13,830
So what asset was that--

467
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:17,720
or is that in DC, having
been in this industry--

468
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,590
or been in energy?

469
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:23,190
I would imagine that's why
you focused a lot on energy.

470
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:23,690
Yeah.

471
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:28,247
So, I mean, let me be
philosophical for a moment.

472
00:21:28,247 --> 00:21:30,830
One of the best pieces of advice
I got when I came to Congress

473
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:34,070
was Jamie Raskin said to me, "Go
around and ask your colleagues

474
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:37,770
why they ran because this
job makes you really broad,

475
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:39,900
but the reason you ran
is where your depth is.

476
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,330
And if you find out
where people's depth is,

477
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:44,830
then when bills come up and you
want to know what you should

478
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,890
work on, that's the
area to go through."

479
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:50,300
And I say that, number one,
because it's great advice,

480
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:54,770
but also because
being the guy who

481
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:58,400
has raised a couple of hundred
million dollars, deployed--

482
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,700
fought with all the fights
in the utility industry,

483
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,737
got scars in my back
from doing that,

484
00:22:03,737 --> 00:22:05,570
understands how energy
markets work gives me

485
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:08,730
a depth that certainly
other members don't have.

486
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:11,100
Every member has depth
that I don't have as well.

487
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:15,590
And I think Congress
at its best has

488
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:19,220
a group of members who represent
the diversity of industries

489
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,990
and experiences in
America to go bring that,

490
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:25,800
and you try to be the person
who can bring that vertical,

491
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,370
if you will.

492
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:26,870
Yeah.

493
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:29,970
And diving a little bit
deeper into that vertical,

494
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:33,280
so one of the
things that we often

495
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,050
think about is, what
is the right role

496
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:37,540
of the federal
government through FERC?

497
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:41,260
And what is the right role of
the RTOs, the independent system

498
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:44,150
operators of large
wholesale markets?

499
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:46,990
And what is the right
role for states?

500
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,910
Which have their PUCs.

501
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:52,020
And where do you
fall in on that?

502
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,710

503
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:56,440
If I had a clean
sheet of paper, I

504
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,660
wouldn't design anything like
the balkanized system we have.

505
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:04,550
So the right role, clearly
what we're doing is not right.

506
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,330
I mean, the numbers are insane.

507
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:10,560
We've got about 1,300 gigawatts
of generation in this country.

508
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:14,270
There are currently 2,000
gigawatts in the queue waiting

509
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,290
to interconnect.

510
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:20,210
Of that 2,000 in the queue,
there's 1 gigawatt of coal,

511
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:24,170
85 gigawatts of natural gas,
and all of the rest is storage

512
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:25,340
and renewables.

513
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:28,730
It is insane that those
can't come online,

514
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:32,240
and a big part of the problem
is the RTOs and the ISOs that

515
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,040
have horrible
governance structures

516
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:39,440
and are captured by their
membership, essentially.

517
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:44,760
And I think we could do a
much better job of essentially

518
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,760
holding them to account.

519
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,150
Like, yes, you have
to have reliability,

520
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:50,660
but you also should be helping
your states meet their meet

521
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,355
their decarbonization targets.

522
00:23:52,355 --> 00:23:54,480
You should be shortening
the interconnection queue,

523
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,500
not extending it.

524
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,420
You should be decongesting
those nodes in your system

525
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:01,820
that cause prices to fall.

526
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,620
And I think they've done a
terrible job of doing that.

527
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:09,630
FERC is arguably the only
place that can fix that,

528
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:12,330
but even at FERC, they
can't reach into the states.

529
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:14,730
And a lot of these
issues are state-level.

530
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:16,500
Ultimately state
jurisdictional issues.

531
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,912
As we were joking
over lunch, tell me

532
00:24:19,912 --> 00:24:21,620
where your opinions
are on states' rights

533
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:24,560
and I will find another place
where you contradict yourself.

534
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,640
It depends on where you sit.

535
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,120
But we can do a--

536
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,810
we need to do a much better job
on putting the consumer first.

537
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:37,980
And for those who aren't as
deep as Representative Casten,

538
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:40,820
in some places you could build
a solar farm or a wind farm

539
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:44,250
and it won't be
five to seven years

540
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:48,720
before you could turn it on to
interconnect into the system.

541
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,530
And so how do we fix that?

542
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:53,440
We recently put a paper in
Science that we'll send you,

543
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,360
but on some thoughts on how
to do that, do you have--

544
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,060
other than FERC throwing
more weight around,

545
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:05,040
which they seem to be
reluctant to do, what is the--

546
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:05,620
Well--

547
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:06,340
Is it a bill?

548
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,110
Is it--

549
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:10,145
So, I mean, my general theory
of the case and the theory

550
00:25:10,145 --> 00:25:10,770
that informed--

551
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:14,250
Mike Levitt and I have this bill
that CETA, the Clean Electricity

552
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:15,160
Transmission Act--

553
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,670
I think what it stands
for-- that fix this.

554
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:19,410
And our thesis of
the case, which

555
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:21,970
I think differs from some
other bills out there,

556
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:24,820
is that if you fix
the profit incentives,

557
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,880
the permitting problem is easy.

558
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,842
If you don't fix the
profit incentives,

559
00:25:28,842 --> 00:25:30,300
the permitting
problem is a mandate

560
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,500
where you're
compelling people to do

561
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,640
something that are against
their economic interest.

562
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:37,680
And so right now in the
current rule structure--

563
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,740
I mean, personal story, I used
to run a utility in Upstate New

564
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:41,880
York.

565
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,110
I never--

566
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,585
When did that happen?

567
00:25:44,585 --> 00:25:46,460
It was a subsidiary of ours at--

568
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,120
OK.

569
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:52,290
I never made as much money in
that company, or me personally

570
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:55,500
in my bonus, as when the
polar vortex hit and spiked

571
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,730
the price of power on that
system and all of a sudden

572
00:25:57,730 --> 00:26:00,370
we could make a lot of
money selling power.

573
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:03,210
It would not have been in
my personal self-interest

574
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:05,860
to decongest that node.

575
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:11,540
And so I'm not--

576
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:15,060
I mean, trust me, I'm God's
gift to the American people,

577
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,320
I'm not at all selfish.

578
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,050
[LAUGHS] I'm also really glad
I got that bonus that year.

579
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:25,820
[LAUGHS] How do we, I
think, as regulators, how

580
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:29,180
do we change the
incentives so that if I

581
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,260
can lower the cost
to my consumers,

582
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,970
that's not a zero-sum
conversation?

583
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:37,730
And one of the things that we
did when we ran that entity was

584
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:40,190
we got New York State to
regulate us as a for-profit

585
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:43,790
cooperative so that we got a--

586
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:45,900
once we hit a target
return on capital,

587
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,600
we had to share $0.50 of every
dollar with our customers.

588
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:52,120
And so instead of the current
utility model where you get

589
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,620
a guaranteed recovery on your
capital and everything else is

590
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,600
a pass-through, but there are
pass-throughs at certain rates

591
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,700
and you can find ways
to game that system,

592
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:02,600
we had to look back at the end
of the year and say we exceeded

593
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,912
our target return and we're
going to exceed it by 50% beyond

594
00:27:05,912 --> 00:27:07,370
that, and you keep
the other $0.50.

595
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:09,700
And it just created a
much better alignment.

596
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:12,270
We did that because
it was the only way

597
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:14,250
that we knew to have
an incentive to invest

598
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:16,530
in efficiency and conservation.

599
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:18,900
I think you could imagine
all sorts of structures

600
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:23,545
like that at the state,
local, RTO, national level.

601
00:27:23,545 --> 00:27:25,170
Performance-based
rate-making, I think,

602
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:27,093
is the broad umbrella
for that idea,

603
00:27:27,093 --> 00:27:29,010
but there's a lot of
different flavors of that

604
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:30,160
that could go get it done.

605
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,160
And it just makes the
permitting problem easier,

606
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,770
because now you both have
an economic incentive

607
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:36,570
to build this stuff.

608
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:38,010
Instead of saying,
well, I'm going

609
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:42,960
to fund a astroturf grassroots
operation to convince you

610
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,783
that wind turbines cause cancer
so that you file a NEPA ruling

611
00:27:46,783 --> 00:27:48,700
and prevent people from
bringing this wire on,

612
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,770
we've all seen that
game played out.

613
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:51,270
Yeah.

614
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:54,120
And is that a
bipartisan issue in DC?

615
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,410
Fixing--

616
00:27:55,410 --> 00:28:00,046
It is bipartisan to oppose
competitive markets.

617
00:28:00,046 --> 00:28:01,960
[LAUGHTER]

618
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,140
I mean, I mean it.

619
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:06,730
Nobody comes to Washington and
says "My industry needs to be

620
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:07,850
more competitive."

621
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:11,440
And I think our
best regulation has

622
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,410
made industry more competitive,
but it's always hard to do it.

623
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:18,850
There's a great line--

624
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:21,490
Justice Brandeis, who is--

625
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:25,028
basically made the Sherman
Antitrust Act what it is.

626
00:28:25,028 --> 00:28:27,070
The act was passed by
Congress, but then Brandeis

627
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:29,653
had these various rulings, and
he's got this great line in one

628
00:28:29,653 --> 00:28:32,835
of his rulings that he said.

629
00:28:32,835 --> 00:28:35,948
"When you reach points of
great wealth inequality,"

630
00:28:35,948 --> 00:28:37,990
as we are right now, but
he was writing this back

631
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:40,970
in the '20s, he said, "you
basically have three choices.

632
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:44,780
You can either have government
takeover the capital,

633
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:47,920
which is to embrace communism;
you can have capital takeover

634
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,150
the government, which
is to embrace fascism;

635
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:53,150
or you can embrace competition
and market discipline."

636
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:56,140
And we as a country
have succeeded

637
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,120
when we've embraced door 3.

638
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:02,830
We have forces on both sides
of our political divide pushing

639
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:04,900
for doors 1 and
doors 2 right now.

640
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,900
And it's really hard to find--

641
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:10,310
I mean, again, nobody comes in.

642
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:14,200
Google does not come in and
say, "We really control too much

643
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,270
of the search space and we're
able to price uncompetitively."

644
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:20,170
That's not a conversation
that ever happens.

645
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:22,930
Well, I think you're seeing that
on the issue of tariffs, right?

646
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:25,930
Tariffs-- the international--

647
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,850
lowering international
trade seems

648
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:30,340
to be potentially
a bipartisan issue.

649
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:32,750
Well, we certainly are at
a protectionist moment.

650
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:34,030
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

651
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:36,200
And that pendulum
swings back and forth,

652
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,830
but I think there's a separate
issue than the support

653
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:40,030
for competitive markets.

654
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:41,900
That's always been, I
think, a lonely space.

655
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:42,460
Yeah.

656
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:45,010
One more question,
then I'll open it up.

657
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:50,500
You mentioned that we run this
huge risk of basically sending

658
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:53,090
money from red
areas to blue areas.

659
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:55,660
And you also mentioned
the Inflation

660
00:29:55,660 --> 00:30:00,050
Reduction Act was one of the
first pieces of legislation

661
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:05,000
I saw that admitted that and
embraced it and tried to fix it.

662
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,420
How do you think that's going?

663
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:11,480
And will that provide
actual further support

664
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,950
for the Inflation--

665
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:15,980
So I want to just brag a
little bit on myself here.

666
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,840
I was on the Climate
Committee for four years

667
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,920
and we created the set of
700 policy recommendations

668
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,310
about what to do.

669
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:26,190
300 of those became law in
the Inflation Reduction Act.

670
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:30,470
And one of the handful of
things that I really insisted on

671
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:32,780
in our climate
report was that we

672
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:35,210
have to expand the definition
of environmental justice

673
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:38,360
communities to include
those communities that

674
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,912
have historically been
hurt by pollution,

675
00:30:40,912 --> 00:30:43,370
but also those communities that
are going to be left behind

676
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:44,550
in the transition.

677
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:46,635
And I'm just I'm
particularly proud of that

678
00:30:46,635 --> 00:30:49,010
because when you look at where
the investments in the IRA

679
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:51,280
are going right
now, they are going

680
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,530
to a lot of these communities.

681
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:54,410
And so as we think
about whatever happens

682
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:58,830
in a future political
cycle, it really

683
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:00,840
matters that there's a
battery manufacturing

684
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,970
facility in Marjorie
Taylor Greene's district

685
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:09,600
because she now has
constituents pushing for that.

686
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,320
One of my theories of Washington
is that losers will always

687
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,720
cry louder than winners cheer.

688
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,430
Because if you have
something to lose,

689
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:20,118
you know the stakes of
keeping that policy in place.

690
00:31:20,118 --> 00:31:21,660
If you have something
to gain, you're

691
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,493
probably not even paying
that much attention

692
00:31:23,493 --> 00:31:24,600
to the policy debate.

693
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,600
And so by creating a
whole lot of communities

694
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,920
around the country that see
clean energy as an employer,

695
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,750
as a provider of jobs,
as the thing that

696
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:38,280
kept the Walmart open, not as
just the thing that stealing

697
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,130
jobs from our
community, it matters

698
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:42,477
to build a political will.

699
00:31:42,477 --> 00:31:44,560
But it also matters because
at the end of the day,

700
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,780
we're all Americans.

701
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:50,570
I mean, I could think of
every great political speech.

702
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:52,570
"We are not red America,
we're not blue America,

703
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:53,680
we're all Americans."

704
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,230
If you want to go
back behind that,

705
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:58,460
Thomas Paine said that the--

706
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,630
our lesser distinction
varies with the place;

707
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:02,280
our great title
is as Americans."

708
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,563
We've got to make sure that
we're lifting everybody up

709
00:32:04,563 --> 00:32:05,730
or we're not doing it right.

710
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:06,230
Yeah.

711
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:10,890
And just to plug MIT work,
when Brian Deese, who's now--

712
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:11,565
Yeah, yeah.

713
00:32:11,565 --> 00:32:13,850
--a Climate Fellow here,
and when he came here,

714
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:16,130
he created the Clean
Investment Monitor.

715
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:17,667
It's a very slick website.

716
00:32:17,667 --> 00:32:18,750
You can go to the website.

717
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:23,960
He did that joint with CEEPR,
the center that I direct.

718
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,510
And it's showing
with actual data

719
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:30,335
that a majority of the money
is going into red districts.

720
00:32:30,335 --> 00:32:31,370
Yeah, yeah.

721
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:33,710
Now we have this thing
called the Battery Belt.

722
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:34,285
Yeah, Yeah.

723
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:35,660
No, I will say,
one of the things

724
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:40,820
that is a bit of a challenge
for a lot of us is the--

725
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:44,120
if it's going to red districts
because we prioritize

726
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,710
going to communities that
are going to be left behind,

727
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:49,610
that's a positive if it's
going to red districts

728
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:51,470
because those are
districts that have

729
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:55,107
lower environmental permitting
standards, lower labor

730
00:32:55,107 --> 00:32:56,690
standards-- because
they're also going

731
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:58,080
to a lot of
right-to-work states.

732
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:02,912
And I think there is a challenge
of we don't want to leave people

733
00:33:02,912 --> 00:33:05,370
behind, but we also don't want
to have a race to the bottom

734
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:07,140
on local zoning standards.

735
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:09,540
And I think we're
going to have to see

736
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:12,480
more data to know how much
from column A and how much

737
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,650
from column B, but I don't
think it's 100% either.

738
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:16,110
Good point, yeah, yeah.

739
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:18,600
Well, I'm happy to
open it up for--

740
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:22,210
I have more questions, but
why don't we take a few hands.

741
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:25,540
And you want me to call on them
or do you want to call on them?

742
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:28,050

743
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:31,010
The first one I saw
is that lady there.

744
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:31,510
Hi, lady.

745
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,177
Do we have mics?

746
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:33,780
Or what--

747
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:34,810
I can speak loudly.

748
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:35,530
Can you hear me?

749
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:36,183
Yes.

750
00:33:36,183 --> 00:33:36,850
You can hear me.

751
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:37,920
That's what matters.

752
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,950
OK, so three quick questions.

753
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:42,400
That's more than I asked.

754
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,090
Come on!

755
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:45,780
[LAUGHTER]

756
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:48,395
So [INAUDIBLE].

757
00:33:48,395 --> 00:33:59,110

758
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:00,215
Not putting the--

759
00:34:00,215 --> 00:34:00,715
Is it on?

760
00:34:00,715 --> 00:34:01,000
Yes.

761
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,500
It's on.

762
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,560
OK, there we go.

763
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,240
You mentioned Brian Deese.

764
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,910
Your take on the clean
energy Marshall Plan

765
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:09,460
proposal, number one.

766
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:13,719
Number two, is great power
competition with China

767
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,489
and the domestic
content provisions

768
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:18,580
in the IRA helpful or hurtful?

769
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:21,310
And then number three, how do
we think about hyperscalers

770
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:26,889
and them opening up the
dialogue with nuclear energy?

771
00:34:26,889 --> 00:34:30,236
So I'm not familiar with the
first or the third question,

772
00:34:30,236 --> 00:34:31,694
so let me just take
the second one.

773
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:36,400

774
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:40,960
So there's a protectionist
moment in China.

775
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,030
Part of, I think, the
China conversation

776
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:45,790
relates to what I
was saying about what

777
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:47,153
is US industrial policy?

778
00:34:47,153 --> 00:34:49,942

779
00:34:49,942 --> 00:34:54,820
I think in hindsight, we did
a pretty good job in the IRA,

780
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:57,010
but I think in hindsight,
we should have said--

781
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:59,530
instead of saying, you
get this tax credit

782
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:01,840
only if you have 100%
domestic content,

783
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,590
we should have had
some phase-ins.

784
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:06,890
And if you look how we did EV
and solar, on the solar side,

785
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:07,630
it's a stacked.

786
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:09,353
On the EV side, it's
an all-or-nothing.

787
00:35:09,353 --> 00:35:11,020
And I think we should
have had something

788
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,550
that acknowledged that--

789
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:17,530
we were speaking earlier,
how many MIT students

790
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:20,810
over the last 30 years
were foreign nationals,

791
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:24,422
got a PhD, maybe even got a
patent, applied for a visa,

792
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:25,880
and we said, no,
you can't get one?

793
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,040
And so they went back
to their home countries.

794
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,080
They learned how to
scale up over there.

795
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:33,020
And now we're saying, well, we
want this content to be here,

796
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:35,690
but we don't actually have the
skillsets to scale up here.

797
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:38,990
And I think in hindsight,
we should have said,

798
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:43,100
we'll give you a five-year
subsidy incentive,

799
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,680
but we got some
clawbacks, and you're

800
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,263
going to have to
build a factory here.

801
00:35:46,263 --> 00:35:48,050
And you could have
imagined ways,

802
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:51,610
I think, to recognize that that
hollowing-out of manufacturing

803
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:58,720
in the US can't come back
immediately, so that's an issue.

804
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:04,000
There is-- I think there
are larger and very thorny

805
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,160
conversations about
the US and the PRC

806
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:11,570
as far as industrial espionage
and control of supply chains.

807
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:12,920
Those are very real.

808
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,970
There are issues about
the long-term strength

809
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:18,690
of the Chinese economy that I
think are vastly overstated.

810
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:20,740
I would much rather be
running the US economy

811
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,450
than the Chinese
economy right now given

812
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:24,110
some of the trajectories
of where things are going.

813
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:26,402
And I think we've I think
we've gotten very comfortable

814
00:36:26,402 --> 00:36:29,860
with demonizing the threat
of the Chinese economy,

815
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:35,920
but their forward trajectory
is not very positive right now.

816
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,230
Would you say the
same thing about a lot

817
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:42,650
of the fear among my colleagues
that work in transportation

818
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:47,780
is China's potential
dominance of EVs and minerals,

819
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,980
are those things we
should guard against?

820
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:53,120
We should-- the Milton
Friedmans of the world would say

821
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,740
embrace it.

822
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,550
Let them sell us cheap EVs.

823
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:58,700
Where do you--

824
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:01,418
I mean, if I'm just a
purely economic purist,

825
00:37:01,418 --> 00:37:02,960
like, I want us to
do the stuff where

826
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,710
we have the maximum value-add.

827
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,500
I'm much more
interested in us doing

828
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:10,860
the high-value-add manufacturing
than running the mine.

829
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:13,310
And yeah, the mine
is-- those mines

830
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:15,065
and the processing
cells are probably

831
00:37:15,065 --> 00:37:17,190
going to be near where the
geological deposits are.

832
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:19,292
So personally, I
worry less about that.

833
00:37:19,292 --> 00:37:21,750
I'm not saying that those supply
chain issues don't matter,

834
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:25,240
but I think--

835
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,960
there is a certain,
shall we say,

836
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,757
cynicism in supporters of the
fossil fuel industry saying,

837
00:37:30,757 --> 00:37:32,590
I'm really concerned
about getting resources

838
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:34,970
from politically dangerous
parts of the world.

839
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:38,538
[LAUGHS] And all else
equal, I'd rather

840
00:37:38,538 --> 00:37:40,330
be getting the materials
to build something

841
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:42,455
that operates in the US
for 20 years than the stuff

842
00:37:42,455 --> 00:37:45,260
that we need every hour
of every day pulling out.

843
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:54,370
So I guess that's my
economic theory of the case.

844
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:56,150
Well, there's actual
support for that.

845
00:37:56,150 --> 00:38:00,400
I do think that there's a--

846
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,655
it's easier for us than
some of our allies,

847
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,280
and I think there's
a lot of challenges

848
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,290
as far as how do we manage
inbound and outbound investment?

849
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:13,630
The German economy is hugely
tethered to the Chinese economy.

850
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:16,620
They make the machine tools that
go and manufacture over there.

851
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:19,190
And so I was in
Frankfurt last week.

852
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:23,090
All the buses in Frankfurt
are BYD Electric Buses.

853
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:24,840
To talk to the
Germans about, well,

854
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,170
would you put
tariffs on BYD Buses?

855
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:29,210
They're like, no,
because then we'll

856
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:31,950
get tariffs going in the back
side on exports from Germany.

857
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:35,210
And so there's a
tension in Europe

858
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:37,800
where I think we are
struggling with saying, well,

859
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:41,330
what if we export to Germany and
then that content goes through,

860
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:42,120
vice versa?

861
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:42,810
How do we--

862
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:45,060
And this is not to say we
need to decouple from China,

863
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:47,580
but where you have
concerns and controls,

864
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:49,680
I think some of the
relationships with our allies

865
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:55,130
are challenging at the moment.

866
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:57,000
I think the first hand I saw--

867
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,500
OK.

868
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,208
--sorry to make you
walk all the way back

869
00:38:59,208 --> 00:39:01,195
there is in the back row there.

870
00:39:01,195 --> 00:39:16,550

871
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:18,320
Maybe we turn them
on and leave them on?

872
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:18,620
Oh, is it-- OK.

873
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:19,340
Yes, there we go.

874
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:20,430
Awesome.

875
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:23,040
So first off, thank you so
much, Representative Casten,

876
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:23,900
for being here.

877
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:26,540
It's just really cool to hear
someone in the energy space

878
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,500
speak.

879
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,420
I also have multiple questions.

880
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:30,630
Just two this time, though.

881
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:33,155
So I guess the
first question is,

882
00:39:33,155 --> 00:39:36,680
you talked about how
energy and clean energy

883
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:39,680
isn't a competitive
market, but if you

884
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:43,280
were to vastly oversimplify it
and say, for whatever reasons--

885
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,450
economic, scientific
policy, whatever,

886
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:48,710
you're going to be bullish
on one aspect of clean energy

887
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:51,420
and short one aspect, what
are you being bullish on

888
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:52,530
and what are you shorting?

889
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:57,620
And then the second question
is, I guess, sort of related.

890
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:02,510
So what would you advise a
smart, or at least a not stupid

891
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:05,540
young person to do who's
interested in clean energy

892
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:07,890
either in a policy
or a science realm?

893
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:09,975
Thank you so much.

894
00:40:09,975 --> 00:40:12,390
I'm speaking to a room
of not stupid people.

895
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:16,085
[LAUGHS] We all
jump over low bars.

896
00:40:16,085 --> 00:40:19,670

897
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:22,695
So to your second question--

898
00:40:22,695 --> 00:40:24,320
you have to remind
me of your first one

899
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:28,048
because I've forgotten, but
I remember the second one.

900
00:40:28,048 --> 00:40:32,060
My general advice
is, you're going

901
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:34,580
to get out of here and you--

902
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:37,430
you're an MIT student, which
means that you are crazy smart

903
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:39,590
and you're going to have
a ton of opportunities.

904
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:41,310
And you are really
good at learning.

905
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:43,020
You also don't
know that much yet.

906
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:47,240
And once you get out
into the world from here,

907
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:50,840
smart people are a dime a dozen.

908
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:54,530
So find yourself, whether
it's in a policy or a business

909
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:57,980
environment or whatever is
interesting, just find yourself

910
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:01,640
in a room where you feel like
the dumbest person in the room

911
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:04,790
is the single best thing
that you can happen that--

912
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:08,090
I didn't-- I'm not going to
say I made all the best life

913
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:11,600
choices, but all the choices
that I think I got right were

914
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:15,785
the ones where every day I got
into work and was sitting there

915
00:41:15,785 --> 00:41:17,910
saying, these people are
so much smarter than I am,

916
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:20,327
and I'm learning from them,
and they're actually paying me

917
00:41:20,327 --> 00:41:23,086
to learn, which is insane.

918
00:41:23,086 --> 00:41:26,200
And then as doors
open from that,

919
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,070
just be brave enough
to walk through them.

920
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:34,230
Because whatever you're
doing in any sector,

921
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:36,510
being the person
who was, A, smart,

922
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:38,892
and then was like
consistently learning

923
00:41:38,892 --> 00:41:40,350
is just going to
open opportunities

924
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:42,820
to 10, 20 years from now
that you can't predict,

925
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:46,860
but you don't have to do
it all in your first job.

926
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:48,010
On your first question--

927
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:50,490
I feel like this is where I
should put the disclaimer.

928
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:52,000
I am not an investment
professional,

929
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,500
I'm not giving
investment advice.

930
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:56,986
[LAUGHTER]

931
00:41:56,986 --> 00:42:02,970

932
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:07,570
I guess I'd say that, broadly
speaking in the energy industry,

933
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:10,150
it's very easy to predict
what's going to happen,

934
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:13,290
it's very hard to
predict when because it's

935
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:15,420
such a capital-intensive
industry

936
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:17,500
and it takes a long
time to build things,

937
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:20,050
and once the things are built,
they run for a long time.

938
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:22,350
And so you can just
look at the system

939
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:25,720
and say, OK, what assets
are hitting end-of-life?

940
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,190
What assets are new?

941
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:29,473
What assets are in a
state of good repair?

942
00:42:29,473 --> 00:42:31,390
What assets are not in
a state of good repair?

943
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:34,620
What assets have the potential
to ramp up and provide

944
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,760
a bunch more than they're
providing right now?

945
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,520
Which ones are
currently maxed out?

946
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,950
And I think if you just take
that in aggregate, the coal

947
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:43,650
industry is dead.

948
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:45,690
All the plants that
there are shutting down.

949
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:51,150
This huge surge of renewables
that's dominating the pipeline

950
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:54,420
is going to be what the
grid is in the future.

951
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:58,090
Electric vehicles are the
fastest-growing vehicle segment

952
00:42:58,090 --> 00:43:00,390
not because we got woke,
it's because they're

953
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:02,710
crazy fun to drive.

954
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:04,510
And they have no maintenance.

955
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:07,660
And so everything
that flows from that,

956
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:09,720
I think you can make a
reasonable bet that those

957
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:10,420
are going to come through.

958
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:12,290
Is it going to go at
a predictable pace?

959
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:12,790
No.

960
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:15,670
There will be political
backlash one way or the other.

961
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:20,310
I mean, a lot of the opposition
to woke investing in Washington

962
00:43:20,310 --> 00:43:22,920
is mostly because
those old industries

963
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:25,590
are getting their butt
kicked in the market.

964
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:28,260
If you just look at--
forget about the market

965
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:30,990
value of ExxonMobil, look at
their price earnings ratio.

966
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:35,050
It's sits at 8 to 9
on a consistent basis.

967
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:38,340
First solar, Tesla,
NextEra, those companies

968
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:40,830
are running 20 or 30
or 40 times multiples.

969
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:43,480
That's telling you that
capital markets are saying,

970
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:47,470
I trust company A with
my money, and company B,

971
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:49,900
you are in cash stripping mode.

972
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:54,723
And so you can see where that
investment is going to come.

973
00:43:54,723 --> 00:43:56,890
And then just start
handicapping, what does it mean?

974
00:43:56,890 --> 00:43:59,760

975
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,880
I was in Denmark over the
summer where they have--

976
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,600
in this little parcel of
ocean between Denmark,

977
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,050
the Netherlands,
and Germany, they

978
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:12,460
are bringing on-- they've got
15 gigawatts of offshore wind

979
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:14,200
tenders open right now.

980
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,820
That's-- what's the New England
power grid, 25 gigawatts,

981
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:17,320
I think?

982
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,510
This is a huge amount
of offshore wind

983
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:21,280
being built in this tiny spot.

984
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,780
And the Danish
government is saying,

985
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:26,780
we don't have paths
to sell that out,

986
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:29,810
which means the price of power
is going to collapse in Denmark.

987
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:32,410
And they're trying to
find a way to-- can

988
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:34,910
we attract steel mills or
hydrogen manufacturing?

989
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:36,970
Because if we don't,
some crypto knucklehead

990
00:44:36,970 --> 00:44:38,170
is going to come in
here and mine Bitcoin

991
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:39,587
because it's going
to be so cheap.

992
00:44:39,587 --> 00:44:40,695
What is the future?

993
00:44:40,695 --> 00:44:42,320
Like, I don't know
how to predict that,

994
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,710
but these are real
problems that are

995
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:47,650
going to happen because you've
got so much cheap energy coming

996
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:49,290
in there.

997
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:51,470
So I'm not predicting how
that will walk through,

998
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:53,860
but I think dealing
in a world that

999
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:57,580
is awash in very cheap energy
is a really interesting world.

1000
00:44:57,580 --> 00:45:00,195
But there will be,
like all transitions,

1001
00:45:00,195 --> 00:45:01,570
some people make
a bunch of money

1002
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:03,653
and some people will build
some really cool assets

1003
00:45:03,653 --> 00:45:05,880
and they will go bankrupt.

1004
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,120
All right, I'm going to--

1005
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,287
Whoa, that's a lot of hands.

1006
00:45:08,287 --> 00:45:10,140
I'm going to limit
to one question.

1007
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:13,270
And I'll call-- we'll go here.

1008
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:14,130
Is that Kurt?

1009
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:16,730
Yeah, Kurt?

1010
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:17,590
Boston Marathon.

1011
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:20,300
Love it.

1012
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,120
Thanks.

1013
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,000
I have a question.

1014
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,940
Thinking about
your constituents--

1015
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:26,833
and I ask in part because I grew
up in Crystal Lake, Illinois.

1016
00:45:26,833 --> 00:45:28,250
I would have been
in your district

1017
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:30,210
if I hadn't moved away in 1985.

1018
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:31,820
It's great to see you.

1019
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:33,070
I no longer have Crystal Lake.

1020
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:36,008
I used to before redistricting,
but redistricting

1021
00:45:36,008 --> 00:45:37,050
moved a little bit south.

1022
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:38,930
But it's a lovely community.

1023
00:45:38,930 --> 00:45:40,430
Anyway.

1024
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:44,810
This space is moving so fast
and there's so much information

1025
00:45:44,810 --> 00:45:46,603
for people to keep up with.

1026
00:45:46,603 --> 00:45:48,020
And I'm wondering
what perspective

1027
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:51,530
you might have on what
sort of literacies

1028
00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:55,490
you wish your constituents had
and constituents more broadly

1029
00:45:55,490 --> 00:45:57,680
in our representative
government ought

1030
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,840
to have to just be more
effective in moving

1031
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:00,790
this stuff forward?

1032
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:04,880
I want to believe that we can
move in the direction of valuing

1033
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:10,370
what the consumers need in a
more balanced way, for instance.

1034
00:46:10,370 --> 00:46:13,472
I mean, that's a deep
political philosophy question.

1035
00:46:13,472 --> 00:46:16,700
I think it is hard to look
at some of my colleagues

1036
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:19,100
and have a very high view
of the American voter.

1037
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:22,292
[LAUGHTER]

1038
00:46:22,292 --> 00:46:24,120

1039
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:27,750
My own constituents
are exceptional.

1040
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:31,560
At least 53% of them
in the last election.

1041
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:34,820
[LAUGHTER]

1042
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:37,820
I mean, I think my
philosophical answer

1043
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:39,560
is I think that's a
give-and-take kind

1044
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:40,380
of conversation.

1045
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:43,310
I mean, my own
view of politics is

1046
00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:47,690
that you have this amazing
job where you have access

1047
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:49,970
to every professional you want.

1048
00:46:49,970 --> 00:46:52,280
I mean, last week I'm talking--

1049
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:53,880
I'm meeting with
Christine Lagarde.

1050
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,766
Before that, I'm
with Gary Gensler.

1051
00:46:56,766 --> 00:46:59,310
You can get any information
you want on any subject.

1052
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:01,790
And I think there's
a certain obligation

1053
00:47:01,790 --> 00:47:04,680
to go out and communicate
with your constituents,

1054
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,030
help them understand.

1055
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:10,750
And in so doing that,
trust their judgment.

1056
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:13,280

1057
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,530
If you agree with what I'm
saying and you like the way

1058
00:47:15,530 --> 00:47:17,790
I make decisions on that
and you vote for me,

1059
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:19,730
then I'm now empowered
to continue doing that.

1060
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:23,160
I haven't communicated,
I can't complain

1061
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,218
if you don't vote for me.

1062
00:47:25,218 --> 00:47:26,760
And if you don't
vote for me and I've

1063
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,050
told you what's really
valuable and important to me,

1064
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:31,510
then I'm probably not
the right representative.

1065
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:36,516
But I think that takes
like a two-way conversation

1066
00:47:36,516 --> 00:47:38,400
I'm hugely addicted
to town halls

1067
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,250
and I do them all the time.

1068
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:44,700
It is, frankly, been
very challenging

1069
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:48,280
since the war in Gaza because
they've been disrupted so often.

1070
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,340
And it makes me sad
because now you've

1071
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:53,380
got this two-way conversation
that doesn't happen,

1072
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:55,120
regardless of where
your views are,

1073
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:58,020
but if we can't have rooms
where those conversations can

1074
00:47:58,020 --> 00:47:59,920
happen even if we
disagree with each other.

1075
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,720
But I think democracy is weaker.

1076
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:05,350
So it's a very
philosophical conversation,

1077
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:07,240
but your job is not to
understand everything,

1078
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:09,930
but I think we should
maximize the opportunities

1079
00:48:09,930 --> 00:48:12,000
for two-way conversations.

1080
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,920
So the gentleman
in the gray shirt.

1081
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,000
Hi.

1082
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,410
Thanks for a great talk today.

1083
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:22,180
So I come from China,
and I feel something that

1084
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:23,390
is happening back in China.

1085
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:26,020
So the energy storage
industry in China

1086
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:28,870
is actually facing a problem
because the electricity

1087
00:48:28,870 --> 00:48:32,640
market in China is, let's
say, close to nothing.

1088
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,550
So even if it was
a cheap batteries,

1089
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:37,150
we need to make profits, right?

1090
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:40,910
So sole driving force for
storage installation in China

1091
00:48:40,910 --> 00:48:45,150
is that our wind or solar farms
must come with two or four

1092
00:48:45,150 --> 00:48:50,030
hours of storage capacity, and
this has been removed this year.

1093
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:53,210
So the energy storage industry
is facing some really serious

1094
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:54,670
challenges recently.

1095
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:57,130
So I guess my
question is that, do

1096
00:48:57,130 --> 00:49:01,300
you think with the right
upper-level policy or market

1097
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:04,240
design, even if the United
States are now building

1098
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:08,106
the energy system grids with
the more expensive components,

1099
00:49:08,106 --> 00:49:11,362
with the right policy with
the right [INAUDIBLE].

1100
00:49:11,362 --> 00:49:16,700

1101
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:23,020
So to repeat what we'd said
in our meeting beforehand,

1102
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:24,430
there's--

1103
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:27,820
I've not seen any model of
how the US can decarbonize

1104
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:30,420
without building more
transmission storage

1105
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:32,753
and nuclear than anybody
thinks is politically possible.

1106
00:49:32,753 --> 00:49:35,965

1107
00:49:35,965 --> 00:49:37,340
That doesn't mean
we can't do it,

1108
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:39,770
it just means we haven't
thought of the tools yet.

1109
00:49:39,770 --> 00:49:46,192
And I think from an energy
market design perspective,

1110
00:49:46,192 --> 00:49:48,220
I think it's an
open question, and I

1111
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:54,880
can argue both sides of this,
of should we design markets such

1112
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:57,640
that there is a sufficient price
spread between on- and off-peak

1113
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:00,460
pricing, that you can justify
the investment in energy storage

1114
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:04,010
system and we'll just have this
all captured in the system?

1115
00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:09,700
But at the expense of
that, have somebody

1116
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:11,457
on a fixed income
suddenly saying

1117
00:50:11,457 --> 00:50:13,540
that they've got to turn
their air conditioner off

1118
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:15,748
in the middle of a hot day
because the price of power

1119
00:50:15,748 --> 00:50:17,020
went so high?

1120
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:19,300
Or should we have
something like described

1121
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:22,640
in China that says we're just
going to mandate that you build

1122
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:26,810
these systems around here,
which is basically how we built

1123
00:50:26,810 --> 00:50:28,490
out the US power grid, right?

1124
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:30,710
We electrified
rural America, not

1125
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:33,890
by saying it is economic
to provide power

1126
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:37,387
to the end of the line in some
one-horse town in Nebraska.

1127
00:50:37,387 --> 00:50:39,470
We did it by saying we're
going to cross-subsidize

1128
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:41,930
across the whole system and
you'll recover your costs

1129
00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:42,900
from elsewhere.

1130
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:46,740
And I don't think anybody's got
the exact right balance there,

1131
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:51,420
and it's always going to be a
mix of capitalism and socialism,

1132
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:53,400
and sometimes
we'll get it right,

1133
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,550
sometimes we'll get it
wrong, sometimes we'll

1134
00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:58,105
create massive arbitrage
opportunities across the spread.

1135
00:50:58,105 --> 00:51:00,650

1136
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:05,360
But I don't think it's a
question of can we, it's

1137
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:06,600
we don't have a choice.

1138
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:07,490
We have to.

1139
00:51:07,490 --> 00:51:10,076

1140
00:51:10,076 --> 00:51:13,040
To say that we're not going to
decarbonize because we haven't

1141
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:16,410
invented the right economic
model is to give up,

1142
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:20,390
and I'm not willing to do that.

1143
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:23,660
Oh my gosh, we have
time for one more.

1144
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:27,270
But I'm going to make Tom mad
and I'm going to take two more.

1145
00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:30,770
So we'll do the gray sweater
there, and then Anja.

1146
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:32,280
Did you have a question?

1147
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:33,660
Gray sweater first?

1148
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:34,680
Hello, gray sweater.

1149
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:36,630
Yeah.

1150
00:51:36,630 --> 00:51:37,620
Thank you.

1151
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:42,880
My question was about the
higher prices and the PJM grid.

1152
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:47,050
And we talked a lot about how
energy is becoming cheaper,

1153
00:51:47,050 --> 00:51:49,170
but there's this
big spike there,

1154
00:51:49,170 --> 00:51:51,620
and how do we understand
what's going on there?

1155
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:55,725
Should we expect that
elsewhere in the short-term?

1156
00:51:55,725 --> 00:51:56,225
Yeah.

1157
00:51:56,225 --> 00:51:58,890

1158
00:51:58,890 --> 00:52:05,160
So when I say that energy
is becoming cheaper,

1159
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:09,810
I say that from the
perspective of a former energy

1160
00:52:09,810 --> 00:52:11,400
developer who--

1161
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:14,340
I don't know how to get a
plant financed unless you

1162
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:18,300
can say that this plant will
deliver power at a lower

1163
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:22,080
cost than where the system is
and will make a spread on where

1164
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,050
that market is.

1165
00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:26,430
And every renewable
generation technology

1166
00:52:26,430 --> 00:52:29,560
delivers a return on
investment on that thesis.

1167
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:33,460
Whether or not that leads
to lower prices to consumers

1168
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:35,630
is a question about the
regulatory structure.

1169
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:37,630
Are you going to give
people guaranteed recovery

1170
00:52:37,630 --> 00:52:38,740
on their capital?

1171
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:44,170
Because if you were to shift
from a totally amortized

1172
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:49,700
coal-intensive grid to a
100% solar and storage grid,

1173
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:53,057
you would go from a grid with
high marginal operating cost

1174
00:52:53,057 --> 00:52:54,640
to a grid with zero
marginal operating

1175
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:57,182
cost, but all of a sudden you'd
have to amortize the capital.

1176
00:52:57,182 --> 00:52:59,060
And if you let people
amortize that capital,

1177
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:00,080
you'd raise the price.

1178
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,913
If you didn't let them
amortize the capital,

1179
00:53:01,913 --> 00:53:03,430
they'd never make
the investment.

1180
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:07,580
Every market is grappling with
that in slightly different ways.

1181
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:12,340
And without speaking to
PJM versus any other grid,

1182
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:13,695
it does get into this tension.

1183
00:53:13,695 --> 00:53:15,070
This is what I
said about, are we

1184
00:53:15,070 --> 00:53:18,140
prioritizing consumers
or investors?

1185
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:22,690
Because PJM, like every RTO,
has done a really bad job

1186
00:53:22,690 --> 00:53:28,090
of bringing power to those
nodes where the price is high.

1187
00:53:28,090 --> 00:53:30,830
To bring it down, we've
been going back and forth

1188
00:53:30,830 --> 00:53:34,120
now for three years
on this SOO Green Line

1189
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:38,630
because Iowa is awash
in excess wind power,

1190
00:53:38,630 --> 00:53:43,000
Chicago has high-priced
power that the wind in Iowa

1191
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:43,980
would love to sell.

1192
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:46,430
They've got an HVDC line
that wants to run through.

1193
00:53:46,430 --> 00:53:48,940
And a lot of people
within PJM are not

1194
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:51,340
really keen to have a
bunch of cheap power coming

1195
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:53,620
into the grid.

1196
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:56,470
I'm sympathetic to it because
if you brought it in, then

1197
00:53:56,470 --> 00:53:58,910
you're going to say, well,
then why would somebody build?

1198
00:53:58,910 --> 00:54:01,220
And it's the challenge
of clean energy.

1199
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:04,970
It eats its investment thesis.

1200
00:54:04,970 --> 00:54:07,530
That's a really good
problem to have,

1201
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:10,430
but it's a problem,
especially in a world that

1202
00:54:10,430 --> 00:54:13,670
has rewarded utilities
for deploying capital,

1203
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:15,590
but has not necessarily
rewarded them

1204
00:54:15,590 --> 00:54:18,020
for lowering the cost of power.

1205
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:20,550
And that's a fixable problem.

1206
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:24,090
The RTOs and ISOs have some
ability to fix the problem.

1207
00:54:24,090 --> 00:54:26,490
The state utilities
regulators have some ability,

1208
00:54:26,490 --> 00:54:28,550
FERC has some ability.

1209
00:54:28,550 --> 00:54:30,590
No one is king.

1210
00:54:30,590 --> 00:54:34,010
If there's a way to run for
that job, I will take it.

1211
00:54:34,010 --> 00:54:38,660
But it's very balkanized.

1212
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:41,270
Thanks for giving me
the last question.

1213
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:43,700
I want to come back to
what you said initially

1214
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:47,570
about the decoupling between
the growth of the economy

1215
00:54:47,570 --> 00:54:49,920
and the carbon emissions.

1216
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:54,050
And I'm wondering if
part of that picture

1217
00:54:54,050 --> 00:54:57,080
is also the fact
that we've exported

1218
00:54:57,080 --> 00:55:01,140
carbon-intensive manufacturing
to other countries,

1219
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:05,160
and if we bring
manufacturing back to the US,

1220
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:09,650
will that reverse the trend,
at least in the short-term

1221
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:10,675
and to a certain degree?

1222
00:55:10,675 --> 00:55:13,730

1223
00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:15,650
There's certainly, I think--

1224
00:55:15,650 --> 00:55:17,235
and I've not parsed the numbers.

1225
00:55:17,235 --> 00:55:18,860
Certainly there are
some things that we

1226
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:20,450
don't make as much
in the US anymore

1227
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:23,120
that used to be made in the
US that are carbon-intensive.

1228
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,740
But I think if you
look at broad--

1229
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:27,650

1230
00:55:27,650 --> 00:55:30,540
total energy use in the
United States has not slowed.

1231
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:34,250
We've just shifted
to lower-carbon ways

1232
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:36,050
to generate that energy.

1233
00:55:36,050 --> 00:55:39,180
It is unambiguously true
that the nuclear fleet

1234
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:41,597
is generating a lot more
nuclear power per megawatt

1235
00:55:41,597 --> 00:55:43,180
of installed capacity
than it used to.

1236
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:44,730
It's unambiguously
true that we're

1237
00:55:44,730 --> 00:55:47,010
generating a ton
of renewable power

1238
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,460
that we didn't use to generate.

1239
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:52,320
And so a lot of that
is a legitimate shift.

1240
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:53,880
There is an export
problem that I

1241
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:55,797
think we have to be
really sensitive to, which

1242
00:55:55,797 --> 00:55:59,440
is that we-- as much
as I love Norway,

1243
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:02,160
I don't think we want
to become Norway where

1244
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,980
we have a zero-carbon
economy that's

1245
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:09,300
subsidized by exporting a ton
of fossil fuel to other people.

1246
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:12,270
I've had somewhat
heated conversations

1247
00:56:12,270 --> 00:56:14,550
with some of our
Executive Branch partners

1248
00:56:14,550 --> 00:56:17,730
that when we say the United
States is decarbonizing,

1249
00:56:17,730 --> 00:56:21,420
and that US contractors
should report on their Scope 3

1250
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:25,800
emissions, the US government is
not reporting on our own Scope 3

1251
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:30,280
emissions as we ramp up
those exports overseas.

1252
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:32,567
So I do think we need to be--

1253
00:56:32,567 --> 00:56:34,650
the numbers that I talked
about, about our economy

1254
00:56:34,650 --> 00:56:39,210
decarbonizing, I was talking
about energy consumption, not

1255
00:56:39,210 --> 00:56:41,890
energy production because
in that same period,

1256
00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:44,010
while coal use is--

1257
00:56:44,010 --> 00:56:47,100
oil use is flat, oil
production is growing.

1258
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:49,810
Natural gas use
is growing at 25%,

1259
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:52,350
natural gas exports
are up by 500%.

1260
00:56:52,350 --> 00:56:56,350
And so there's a
huge pressure for us

1261
00:56:56,350 --> 00:56:58,520
to export our carbon
emissions elsewhere.

1262
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:02,230
And some of the
conversations that I've

1263
00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:04,570
been having, we'll see
how successfully with some

1264
00:57:04,570 --> 00:57:07,150
of our executive
branch colleagues,

1265
00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:12,762
is if you invented the cell
phone, should you export,

1266
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:14,470
sell technology to
the rest of the world,

1267
00:57:14,470 --> 00:57:17,340
or should you export your
rotary phone technology?

1268
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:20,070
If we've figured out how to
grow our economy without growing

1269
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:22,410
fossil fuel use, should we
export the technologies that

1270
00:57:22,410 --> 00:57:24,120
have allowed us to do that?

1271
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:28,760
Or should we send
them LNG tankers?

1272
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:31,560

1273
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:34,750
And I think one of the--

1274
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:36,380
I think one of the
missed opportunities

1275
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:40,480
we had after Russia invaded
Ukraine, hugely important

1276
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:44,560
that we had the ability
to send LNG to Europe

1277
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:47,110
to get them off Russian gas.

1278
00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:51,940
Number one, we didn't
sell it to them at cost.

1279
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:54,370
We sold it to them because you
could make a lot more money

1280
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:56,813
selling that to a Rotterdam
hub than at Henry hub

1281
00:57:56,813 --> 00:57:58,480
and we made money on
the spread and that

1282
00:57:58,480 --> 00:57:59,730
brought a bunch of money back.

1283
00:57:59,730 --> 00:58:02,980
Number two, why didn't we
do a Defense Production

1284
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:05,366
Act for heat pumps?

1285
00:58:05,366 --> 00:58:09,890
Ramp up-- help get as much
efficiency in there as possible.

1286
00:58:09,890 --> 00:58:14,640
And looking backwards,
that makes me sad.

1287
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,900
Looking forward, that's
an amazing opportunity.

1288
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:21,370
And I think maybe that's like
my uplifting end here of we

1289
00:58:21,370 --> 00:58:23,440
have this opportunity
to have our cake

1290
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:27,260
and eat it, too, to massively
decarbonize and grow our economy

1291
00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:31,780
if we make the right choices
in these next very few years.

1292
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:35,000
That's the decisive
turning point.

1293
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
So that's on you all.

1294
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,240
Perfect time to stop.

1295
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:39,870
That was definitely
the last word.

1296
00:58:39,870 --> 00:58:42,190
[LAUGHTER]

1297
00:58:42,190 --> 00:58:45,570
I want to thank
Congressman Casten.

1298
00:58:45,570 --> 00:58:47,420
I want to thank
Professor Knittel.

1299
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:49,520
I want to thank all
of you for coming.

1300
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:51,690
We have a reception downstairs.

1301
00:58:51,690 --> 00:58:54,110
I hope you come down, and
maybe Professor Casten,

1302
00:58:54,110 --> 00:58:57,260
if his voice lasts, they'll be
happy to talk a little bit more.

1303
00:58:57,260 --> 00:58:59,420
I also wanted to just
advertise two more events.

1304
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:04,670
Tomorrow in this room at 5:00
PM, we have a discussion,

1305
00:59:04,670 --> 00:59:08,040
The Role of Fusion in a
Decarbonized Energy System.

1306
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:09,570
So I hope to see you there.

1307
00:59:09,570 --> 00:59:18,260
And then on Monday in 32-123, we
have the movie Switch On, which

1308
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:21,420
is a documentary about energy
access in developing countries,

1309
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:23,850
followed by a discussion
with Scott Tinker,

1310
00:59:23,850 --> 00:59:27,180
the Founder of the Switch
Energy Alliance, and Rob Stoner,

1311
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:30,050
the Founding Director of the
MIT Tata Center for Technology

1312
00:59:30,050 --> 00:59:31,340
and Design.

1313
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:35,042
So now please join me
in thanking Professor--

1314
00:59:35,042 --> 00:59:36,860
I mean Congressman Casten again.

1315
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:37,690
You're a professor.

1316
00:59:37,690 --> 00:59:41,040
[APPLAUSE]

1317
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:44,000
