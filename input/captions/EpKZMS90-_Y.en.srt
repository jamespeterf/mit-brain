1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,679
All right, our next speaker is Jesse

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,560
Angrates who's an assistant professor of

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:09,679
genetics at Stanford University and also

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:12,240
a member of the NNFC Center for Genomic

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,080
Medicine here. Jesse,

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,240
>> thanks so much. Really happy to be back

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:20,400
here at the Broad and uh see um so many

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,840
friends and familiar faces. Uh I'd like

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,480
to share today some of our um two recent

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,160
stories um trying to map the regulatory

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,320
wiring of the genome to link varants to

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,320
functions. So, building on this

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,800
beautiful framework that Molina laid out

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,239
um now 10 years ago, um we know that

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,399
each of these variants that we've

16
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,239
discovered regulate some gene in some

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,800
cell type to affect some pathway to

18
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:45,680
affect disease. And if we could map that

19
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,760
uh variant to function connection, uh we

20
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,000
might discover clues that help us

21
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,320
develop new drugs. Um there are of

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,399
course beautiful examples from uh this

23
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,079
community that have illustrated this

24
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:01,199
paradigm. uh one that I love is uh VJ

25
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,520
and uh Stuart Orcin and Dan Bower's work

26
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:06,400
to characterize variants associated with

27
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,680
cickle cell uh or fetal hemoglobin um

28
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,840
where they showed of course that there

29
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,560
are non-coding variants in aniththroidid

30
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,760
specific enhancer of BCLNA which BJ

31
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,720
showed is a repressor of fetal

32
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,920
hemoglobin um and that if you can if you

33
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,759
target crisper to cut at this enhancer

34
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,560
you can create a therapy for cickle cell

35
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,799
disease and I wanted to share this uh

36
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,920
example example uh to illustrate three

37
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:32,240
you know key points. Um one of which is

38
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,960
that most of these disease variants are

39
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,040
non-coding. Um these disease variants

40
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,840
tune gene expression in specific cell

41
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,159
types and this is proof of concept that

42
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,079
editing regulatory DNA has therapeutic

43
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,560
potential.

44
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:48,799
So we're working on a number of

45
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,320
different approaches to systematically

46
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:55,439
accelerate this process and uh um to

47
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,920
more rapidly convert variants to to uh

48
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,840
to functions to medicines. And I wanted

49
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,680
to share two particular stories. The

50
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,840
first of which is to think about how

51
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,079
could we interpret non-coding variants

52
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,840
by identifying all of the enhancers in

53
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,720
the genome and linking them to their

54
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,000
target genes and cell types.

55
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,239
So, of course, there are a few different

56
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,800
approaches to link non-coding variants

57
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,800
to their cell types and target genes.

58
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,480
Um, one might be to apply single cell

59
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,920
ETL approaches like we heard about

60
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,760
today. Um, the challenge here is power

61
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,239
and scale.

62
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,560
Um, we could also use crisper to go in

63
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,640
and edit variants or perturb enhancers

64
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,400
that contain variants. And of course

65
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,319
here there's a similar challenge is that

66
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,879
these non-coding sequences can have very

67
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:41,120
cell type specific effects and we can't

68
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,840
possibly crisper every possible cell

69
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,920
type in the human body. So what we need

70
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,000
instead or in addition to these two

71
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,760
approaches are really good predictive

72
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,519
models that would allow us to take a

73
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,640
particular non-coding variant and look

74
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,959
up its function across nearly any cell

75
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,360
type in the body and identify the cell

76
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:02,239
types in which that variant might act as

77
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:05,440
well as the target genes.

78
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,040
Um so one simple approach that I I

79
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,360
developed together with Charlie Fulkco

80
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:12,159
when we were both here at the Broad um

81
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:15,680
is called ABC or the activity by contact

82
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:19,440
model. And the idea here is that if you

83
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:22,480
simply estimate enhancer activity using

84
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,720
bulk DNA or K27 cell chipsseek data and

85
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,959
you multiply that by the 3D contact

86
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,640
frequency between an enhancer and its

87
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,440
target promoter which you can measure

88
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,879
with high, you can actually predict many

89
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,959
enhancer gene uh links and begin to

90
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:39,440
build these genomewide maps across many

91
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:42,239
different cell types. The challenge with

92
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,640
this model is that it's not 100%

93
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,480
accurate and it relies on these bulk

94
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,599
epigenomic measurements that are

95
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,120
difficult to acquire in the uh many

96
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,519
thousands of cell types and states in

97
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,519
the human body. So for this project we

98
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,680
teamed up with Robin Anderson's lab and

99
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:01,439
in a project led by Maya Sheth in my

100
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,760
group and Wayan Chu uh here um we

101
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,760
thought about could we use single cell

102
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,680
data to predict these enhancer gene

103
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,239
links instead. Could we leverage the

104
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,760
growing amount of single cell epigenomic

105
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:16,239
data uh to build predictive models to

106
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,919
learn enhancer gene links in any cell

107
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,560
type?

108
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:22,800
So the first step here was to build a

109
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,080
large gold standard data set. Good good

110
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,479
first step when developing predictive

111
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,240
model. Here we're using crisper eye to

112
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,000
perturb many different enhancers and

113
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,080
measuring their effects on target genes.

114
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,560
And for this study, we used u an

115
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,639
integration of many previous studies um

116
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,360
that was led by Andreas Gashwin in my in

117
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,280
my lab um where we integrated some of

118
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,919
the data we had collected with data from

119
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,759
Jason Dur's lab and Lars thus's lab

120
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,400
reprocessed and harmonized everything to

121
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:51,199
create a data set of about 10,000 gold

122
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,040
standard examples where um we've landed

123
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,800
crisper eye in a particular element and

124
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,919
very precisely measured the effects on

125
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,560
gene expression and the effect sizes of

126
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:04,080
these elements span a large range. range

127
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:06,479
um from zero to you know almost complete

128
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:10,160
repression and then you know the red

129
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:11,680
dots are the regulatory um uh enhancer

130
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,840
gene connections and the gray are the

131
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,840
ones where you perturb with crisper uh

132
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,400
we had good statistical power but you

133
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,919
don't see an effect so we can use this

134
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,120
data set to evaluate different

135
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,759
predictive models and the first thing

136
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,720
that we did was compare these crisper

137
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,479
data to various uh uh models that have

138
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,919
been previously developed to predict

139
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,479
enhancer gene regul population from

140
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:35,039
single cell data. And so here's a

141
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,960
precision recall curve predicting uh the

142
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,360
crisper data. The perfect model would be

143
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,440
up here. If you simply link every

144
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,080
element to the closest gene, you get it

145
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,880
right about half of the time. Um if you

146
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:50,400
link an elements to genes based solely

147
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:53,199
on distance, you get this curve here. Um

148
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:56,479
if you build sort of a um poor version

149
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:59,199
of the ABC model where you estimate

150
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:01,120
activity using attack only and you

151
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,360
estimate contact with a function of

152
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,080
distance, you can do slightly better

153
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,080
than distance alone but not particularly

154
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,400
uh well and it turns out it seems like

155
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,000
attackseek in particular is not a great

156
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,560
uh measurement of enhancer activity

157
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,039
compared to DNA seek or to K20 cell

158
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:20,240
chipsseek. And then in gray are a number

159
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:22,960
of other models that are based either on

160
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,880
uh correlation between accessibility and

161
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,960
gene expression across single cells or

162
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,360
cell types or based on regression models

163
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,199
that are trying to use uh accessibility

164
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,199
at multiple nearby peaks to predict

165
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,560
expression. And none of those models did

166
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,720
particularly well at predicting the

167
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,800
crisper data.

168
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,759
So the model that we developed is called

169
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,360
single cell E to G. And it works like

170
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,120
this. So we're going to take a

171
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,960
particular single cell data set that has

172
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,600
many different cell types. We're going

173
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:53,199
to look at one cluster or group of cells

174
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:55,360
at a time and within that one group of

175
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,600
cells we're we're going to compute a

176
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,520
number of different features. Uh first

177
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,840
we're actually going to compute the ABC

178
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,560
score from the pseudobul attack in here.

179
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:07,520
And then Whan developed an approach to

180
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,880
uh integrate um information about

181
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,000
accessibility gene expression

182
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,759
correlations with ABC that actually

183
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
strengthens the predictions of the

184
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,560
score. We also add in a few features

185
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,400
like distance um the class of the

186
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,960
promoter which we've shown tunes

187
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,800
responsiveness and other um features

188
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,400
that are sort of based on molecular

189
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,560
mechanistic studies of how enhancers

190
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,400
work that we thought would be important.

191
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,880
Um and then we train a very simple

192
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,800
logistic regression classifier directly

193
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,280
on the crisper data uh in cross

194
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,000
validation. So this is an eight feature

195
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,360
model. It's not uh you know a billion

196
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,080
parameter foundation model and

197
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:47,120
fortunately there's no um no chance of

198
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,880
it gaining sentience soon. Um so here's

199
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,479
uh here's the performance of this model.

200
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,400
Uh it actually does quite a bit better

201
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,639
than these previous approaches in cross

202
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,479
validation in the in the crisper data

203
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,599
set.

204
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:01,759
um showing that when we combine uh this

205
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:04,240
ABC score with other features, we can

206
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,560
indeed boost the performance and now

207
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,039
accurately predict uh crisper the

208
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,840
crisper data from a single cell

209
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:14,400
multihomem experiment.

210
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,720
One of the limitations of this analysis

211
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,319
and of many of our previous work is that

212
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,000
a lot of this crisper data is in a

213
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:23,599
single cell type in K562s. Uh and so we

214
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,919
were also wondering whether this would

215
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,680
generalize to other cell types. In in

216
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:30,560
theory, the model which we trained on

217
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,399
K562 cells should now be able to take in

218
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,399
multi-m data from another cell type,

219
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,760
transfer to that cell type and make cell

220
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,240
type specific predictions about which

221
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:41,200
enhancers regulate which genes. And so

222
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,959
to test this um we collected and again

223
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,120
aggregated a number of different studies

224
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:48,240
that we and others have have done since

225
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:51,279
we trained the model um and created a

226
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,200
held out data set that's about uh 4,000

227
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:55,440
examples across five different cell

228
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,399
types. And when we evaluate single cell

229
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,480
E to G in this data set it also does uh

230
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,480
quite well much better than distance or

231
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,320
the ABC model and much better than these

232
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,160
other simple correlationbased

233
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,839
approaches.

234
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,760
So we're now really excited that we have

235
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,320
a model that we can apply to many

236
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,880
different cell types and build genomwide

237
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,480
maps of enhancers. And just to

238
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,160
illustrate um what we've been finding

239
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,120
when we are starting to use these maps

240
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:23,120
to interpret variants um we've been

241
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,800
interested uh uh since moving to

242
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,519
Stanford in understanding the genetics

243
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,440
of heart development and heart diseases.

244
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,920
And in one study in collaboration with

245
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,800
Will Goodyear's lab, we collected a

246
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:37,200
800,000 cell single cell atlas of human

247
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,440
fetal heart development between 6 and 22

248
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:43,120
weeks of age across 41 different

249
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:46,000
samples. Um there are 90 different cell

250
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,480
types and states in this atlas. um

251
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,959
including all of the major cell types in

252
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,640
the developing heart as well as many

253
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,320
subtypes that we're starting to

254
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,560
recognize now that we have sufficient

255
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,120
depth and really deep attack sequencing

256
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,600
in the single cell atlas. So for example

257
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,680
among the endocardial cells if you

258
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,080
subcluster the endocardial cells you

259
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:08,080
find clusters of cells um that are

260
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:11,040
specific to particular spatial locations

261
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:12,880
in the heart. So the endocardial cells

262
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,200
along the the lining of the atrial

263
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,440
septum look very different than the

264
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,440
cells that are lining the inflow side of

265
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,360
the valve and those look different than

266
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,440
the outflow side of the valve. And so

267
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,240
they're very uh specific and in this

268
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,240
case spatially distinct um gene

269
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,720
regulatory programs at play in these

270
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,959
different uh cell types.

271
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,200
So here's an example where we are using

272
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,959
these single cell enhancer predictions

273
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,519
to interpret a variant that's associated

274
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:41,440
with atrial septile defect as well as

275
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,360
with uh various quantitative

276
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,680
measurements of valve structure. And

277
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,680
when we look up this variant across 90

278
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,000
different cell types in the developing

279
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,920
heart here are just a selection of

280
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,079
different cell types. We can see that

281
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:57,040
this variant um is in an intron of a

282
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:58,800
gene called GSR2. it overlaps an an

283
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,920
enhancer that's predicted to regulate

284
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:05,839
both GSR2 as well as this other gene w

285
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:07,600
9B um and in specifically in endocardial

286
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,399
cells in various locations in the heart

287
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,720
and most strongly in um endocardial

288
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:15,440
cells on the inflow side of the valve as

289
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,839
well as in the atrial septum. Um, just

290
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,480
as one sort of confirmation that this is

291
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,480
working, um, we cloned this sequence in

292
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,560
a mouse reporter assay together with Len

293
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,959
Pinocchio's lab. And I'll, it's a little

294
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:29,279
hard to see here, but basically this in

295
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:31,440
human enhancer sequence lights up in the

296
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,519
outflow tract here. And when you section

297
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,440
this, you see that indeed uh, this

298
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,200
enhancer is active in the endocardial

299
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,399
cells, which are the single cell lining

300
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,480
along here, the developing valve.

301
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:45,440
So this is a great example I think of a

302
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,519
variant um that we've puzzled over for a

303
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,399
long time and that we could only

304
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,800
interpret once we had really cell type

305
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,959
resolved predictions of the regulatory

306
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,200
genome. In this case we have no good

307
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,959
cellular models of endocardial cells and

308
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,399
certainly not of the different subtypes

309
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,399
that exist in these different spatial

310
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:05,200
locations in the heart. And so it's only

311
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:07,519
by looking at the uh cell types in their

312
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,040
native tissue environment in vivo with

313
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,959
these predictive models that we're able

314
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,600
to interpret and start to understand

315
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:15,040
what this variant is doing.

316
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,040
So we would love for you to try this

317
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,120
out. This model is generally applicable

318
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,560
to any you know single cell multiome

319
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,480
data set. We also have a version that

320
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,040
works with single cell attack only. And

321
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,279
of course, you know, as we expand these

322
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,959
data sets into many individuals in

323
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,560
health and disease, these types of

324
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,639
predictive models, as well as the one

325
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,959
that Yesper described earlier, will be

326
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,639
able to make inferences about what

327
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,880
variants are doing across many different

328
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:42,160
cell types and contexts. We've also

329
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,959
recently just uh made public an EDG

330
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,959
browser. So, if you go to

331
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,800
edg.stanford.edu,

332
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,800
this extends the open target interface.

333
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,880
You can type in your v favorite variant

334
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,440
and look up its predicted effects across

335
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,519
about 1,600 different predictions that

336
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,240
we've made across all of encode and many

337
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,680
single cell data sets. So let us know uh

338
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,839
how that works for you and we're we're

339
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:05,519
curious to see um what we can learn.

340
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,440
So in the second half of my talk, I'd

341
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,320
like to um share some of our work

342
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,880
starting to explore if we could rewrite

343
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,360
regulatory DNA to reprogram gene

344
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,440
expression in desired ways. And this is

345
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,160
work by a graduate student in my lab

346
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:23,600
named Mike Montgomery who just defended

347
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:26,240
um who was thinking about casi uh casvy

348
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,000
and this example of b1a

349
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:31,600
um where you know of course that

350
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,000
involves cutting at a particular tf

351
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,480
binding motif and in theory you could

352
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,680
also imagine adding a new TF binding

353
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,680
motif and you know uh would that

354
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,399
downregulate or upregulate gene

355
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,560
expression in a specific way. Um, of

356
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:49,120
course the genome knows how to turn

357
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:51,120
genes up or down. And if we wanted to

358
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,880
recreate that for various therapeutic

359
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,360
approaches, it would require us to have

360
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:58,320
a really good understanding um of where

361
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,639
to edit, which types of edits, uh, to

362
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,880
introduce as well as a better

363
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,720
understanding of how programmable this

364
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,040
all is.

365
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,440
So, um, we thought it was a good time to

366
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,600
start thinking about this um, uh, when

367
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,839
when Mike joined the lab because of a

368
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,079
few developments. One of of course which

369
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,399
was the introduction of prime editing

370
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:21,199
which for the first time made it really

371
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:23,600
efficient to delete or insert let's say

372
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:25,120
10 nucleotides at a time which is about

373
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,240
the size of a transcription factor

374
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:30,959
binding motif. Um there are also new

375
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,040
sequence-based models for uh for

376
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:36,959
learning the language of the genome and

377
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:40,079
how DNA encodes epigenetic states um

378
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:41,920
such as enfor uh that made us think that

379
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,440
perhaps we had a better chance of

380
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,399
figuring out what we should write into

381
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,160
the genome. And what was missing was a

382
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,000
high throughput screening approach that

383
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:53,519
would allow us to measure the effects of

384
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,959
all of these edits. um ways to adapt

385
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:58,480
these models to design uh edits as well

386
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,839
as a better understanding of how

387
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,959
programmable the gene regulatory

388
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,880
sequences actually are.

389
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:07,279
So Mike teamed up with a postoc in the

390
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,760
lab uh Gabby Martin to develop a method

391
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:12,000
that we call variant effects. And the

392
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,959
idea is that uh what variant effects

393
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,279
enables is to introduce hundreds of

394
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:20,399
edits into a particular enhancer or

395
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:22,639
promoter sequence and quantitatively and

396
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:26,000
precisely measure the effect of each of

397
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:28,959
those edits on gene expression even in

398
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,360
cases where editing is in inefficient.

399
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:34,000
So the way this works is that we'll uh

400
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,240
design a library of PEG RNAs that will

401
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
recruit the prime editor to a particular

402
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,480
enhancer promoter, introduce many

403
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,519
different edits, um create a population

404
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,199
of cells, uh including hetererozygous

405
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,760
and homozygous edits of each of these

406
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:50,320
different sequences. Then we're going to

407
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:52,320
use RNA fish to stain cells based on

408
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,800
their expression of this nearby gene of

409
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:58,079
interest, sort them into bins, and then

410
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:00,560
sequence the cells in each bin to read

411
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:02,160
out the distribution of edits in each of

412
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,000
those expression levels. So, for

413
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,839
example, if you have an edit that

414
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,839
decreases expression, you'll see that

415
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,480
that edit has a much higher frequency in

416
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:13,360
the low expression bin um and a lower

417
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,600
frequency in the high expression bin.

418
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,320
And so this enables looking at hundreds

419
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,399
of edits in one element. Um we're

420
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:23,839
looking at hundreds of thousands of

421
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:26,240
single um of single cells carrying each

422
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,759
edit. Sort of uh sort of allowing us to

423
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,079
average over a lot of the clonal

424
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,920
variation that can occur. Um this

425
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:34,160
accounts for inefficient editing because

426
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,320
we're sequencing the edited site and

427
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:39,199
directly reading out the edits that are

428
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:41,519
created. Um, and there's other tricks

429
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:43,680
that we use to get precise precise

430
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,600
effect size estimates which is really

431
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,279
what distinguishes this method versus

432
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,199
many of the others that have been

433
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:54,639
developed.

434
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:58,000
So uh to illustrate um that this works,

435
00:16:54,639 --> 00:17:00,160
we took a particular gene um PPF which

436
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,040
we were interested in for its role in

437
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:06,959
inflammatory diseases and just as some

438
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:10,319
positive controls, we designed small uh

439
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:13,039
four base edits right at the first um

440
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:14,559
splice donor in PPAF which we thought

441
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:18,480
should break splicing and lead to

442
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:20,319
nonsense decay. And so first we did this

443
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,319
the oldfashioned way. We introduced each

444
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:25,439
of these PEG RNAs one at a time into

445
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:27,919
cells, picked clones, isolated and grew

446
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:31,200
up those hundreds of clones and measured

447
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:33,679
their effects by qPCR. And indeed um

448
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,799
each of these edits decreases expression

449
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:38,640
of PPF by about 80%.

450
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,919
compared to many wild type clones.

451
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,360
Although you can see that there each of

452
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,280
these dots is a clone, there's quite a

453
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,520
bit of variability which is just sort of

454
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:48,000
how uh the the the amount of variation

455
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:51,280
that's introduced um when creating

456
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,360
clones of this particular cell line.

457
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,520
So now we can do the same experiment

458
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:58,240
with variant effects where we're going

459
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:01,120
to introduce uh these three edits as a

460
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:04,960
pool. And so here for example each of

461
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:08,640
these edits um is present at between 10

462
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:11,520
and 15% frequencies with 40% total

463
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:15,200
editing in the pool of cells. We sort

464
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:19,840
them uh using RNA flowfish against PBF

465
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:22,160
sequence uh by PCR this edited site and

466
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,919
then look at the frequency distributions

467
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,160
of each of these different edits across

468
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:28,559
the different expression bins. Um, and

469
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:31,120
so for example, uh, compared to the

470
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:33,360
reference, each of these edits is much

471
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:36,160
more frequent in the low expression bin

472
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,919
versus the high expression bin. We can

473
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,840
plug these into sort of a maximum

474
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,640
likelihood estimator to figure out what

475
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,799
the original effect sizes would be and

476
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,799
learn that uh, according to this

477
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:49,679
estimation, each of those variants does

478
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:51,120
indeed uh, decrease expression by about

479
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:54,080
80%.

480
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:56,240
um both in the sort of poolled format as

481
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,480
well as when we do this individually.

482
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,919
And here each dot is one of the

483
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,679
biological replicates of this

484
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,600
experiment. So basically one pool of

485
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:06,320
cells that's been independently edited.

486
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,080
And so these are much tighter because in

487
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,919
each of these pools, we're looking at

488
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:12,799
many hundreds of thousands of clones

489
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:15,120
carrying the same edit.

490
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:17,600
So we repeated the same type of analysis

491
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:20,799
across edits of many different effect

492
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:23,120
sizes. And here's sort of summing up um

493
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:26,400
a lot of TC, a lot of like tens of

494
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:28,720
thousands of clones and many qPCRs uh to

495
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,960
show that across um many different

496
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,280
edits, the effect size that we measure

497
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,440
in clonal cell lines with homozygous

498
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,039
edits matches the effect size that we

499
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,440
estimate with variant effects in this

500
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:42,080
sort of poolled screen that includes

501
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:44,799
cells of many different genotypes. So

502
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,320
this was very uh satisfying and you know

503
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:48,559
hopefully that means that in the future

504
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,320
we don't have to individually edit quite

505
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,160
as many of these and that we can trust

506
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,400
the effect sizes that come out of this

507
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:57,280
experiment. If the experiment says that

508
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,559
this you know edit leads to a plus 100%

509
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,400
effect on expression or doubles

510
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:03,640
expression then we can in fact believe

511
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,640
that measurement.

512
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:09,360
I'll skip over some of the um I'll just

513
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:12,000
just really briefly uh the math for this

514
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:14,400
is involved and just for you know future

515
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,320
reference a few of the key pieces are

516
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,520
that we have to use a precise editor

517
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:21,039
here we're using PE2 rather than PE3

518
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,679
because if you start throwing in

519
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:26,880
unexpected edits um that creates

520
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:28,640
correlations between uh edits due to the

521
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,799
you know a single editor creating two

522
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,240
different alals in the same cell. So in

523
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:35,039
order for this to work, you do have to

524
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:37,280
use a precise editor um that only

525
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:39,520
creates a single the single desired

526
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:42,240
edit.

527
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:44,799
Okay. So now we that we have this uh

528
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,480
variant effects tool um we decided that

529
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:48,640
to take it for a spin and see if we

530
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:52,000
could start to reprogram gene expression

531
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,200
in in a specific way. So we tried a

532
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,120
couple of different strategies and the

533
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:58,320
first strategy was let's look at the

534
00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:00,559
promoter of the gene and we had

535
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,960
previously done some experiments to find

536
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:06,640
a few really efficient PEG RNAs that

537
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:08,880
worked with up to 80% 90% efficiency and

538
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,039
so we took one of those PEG RNAs and we

539
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,480
decided we would just insert a bunch of

540
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,640
different transcription factor binding

541
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:18,400
sites into this particular site in the

542
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:20,799
promoter. Um here we chose these 41

543
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,960
different sequences to match the

544
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:24,559
consensus sequences for transcription

545
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,360
factors that we thought were active in

546
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:30,480
this particular cell line.

547
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,400
So we clone these into the PPF promoter

548
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,840
um do the pulled prime editing measure

549
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,840
each of those effects. You know for

550
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:40,280
example maybe we're inserting a motif

551
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,280
for Mick or for Foss

552
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,840
um and here's the results of this

553
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,760
poolled experiment. So the effect size

554
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,760
on PPF gene expression across two

555
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,360
biological replicates of the experiment,

556
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,240
the replicates are really highly

557
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:54,640
concordant. Um, and many of the uh

558
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,640
variants do in fact manipulate gene

559
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,280
expression but not by particularly

560
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:02,799
impressive amounts. Um, so for example,

561
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:06,320
inserting a McMax motif decreases

562
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:08,159
expression of PPF by about 10%. um but

563
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,720
maybe not exactly what we were looking

564
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:14,480
for in terms of uh thinking about

565
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:17,120
potential therapeutic applications.

566
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,280
So we explored a second strategy um

567
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:22,400
which was to leverage computational

568
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:25,280
models to design stronger edits than we

569
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,840
could trivially think of uh ourselves.

570
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,200
And in this particular analysis, I'm

571
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,200
going to show you work that was done

572
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,480
using the informer model developed by

573
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:37,760
ZAB and and and David Kelly um at

574
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:40,320
Calico. Um and this was work by Johannes

575
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:43,039
Linder who at the time was a postto in

576
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:46,240
lab and then moved on to Calico himself.

577
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:49,280
Um and the idea between this behind this

578
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:52,000
particular model is that it is using a

579
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:56,080
few hundred kilobases of DNA sequence to

580
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,919
predict um different measurements around

581
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:01,840
the promoter. In this case, we're going

582
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:04,720
to look at the predictions of PPAF cage

583
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:07,520
or gene expression in uh this particular

584
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,840
cell type. And what Johannes did

585
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,840
together with Mike is to use the

586
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,520
informer model to create um what's

587
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,600
called a simulated kneeling design

588
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,919
process where we would take the wild

589
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,080
type sequence of the promoter. We would

590
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:22,559
probabilistically choose to either

591
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:26,240
insert a base, delete a base or swap a

592
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:28,000
base um create a new edited sequence,

593
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,640
score it with the informer model and

594
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,280
then accept edits with the desired

595
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,679
effect with some particular probability.

596
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:38,000
And the particular uh novelty of this

597
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,919
approach is that um we're using this

598
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,760
iterative process but also constraining

599
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,120
it to only edits that should be

600
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,280
efficiently delivered with prime

601
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,120
editing. So instead of redesigning the

602
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:49,440
entire promoter, we're only going to

603
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:51,120
tweak a few bases here and there and see

604
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,799
what we can do with very small edits

605
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,039
that that should be very efficient with

606
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:57,600
prime editing.

607
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:59,679
Okay. So in this experiment we targeted

608
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,919
five different high efficiency sites in

609
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:03,440
the PPF promoter ran the design

610
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,760
procedure tested them with variant

611
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,360
effects and again two biological

612
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,520
replicates. The effect sizes are really

613
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:12,559
highly correlated and we did actually

614
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,480
get a small number of edits that lead to

615
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:17,679
up to a two-fold increase in gene

616
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:19,919
expression or as low as a um I guess

617
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:22,640
this would be a seven-fold decrease. So

618
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:24,880
for example, if you insert a Zeb one

619
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,880
motif, which is a known repressor, you

620
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,960
can reduce expression quite dramatically

621
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:33,360
at this like really highly expressed

622
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:36,720
gene. Um, and if you insert um, you

623
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:38,720
know, a composite elk one MIB binding

624
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,559
site, you can increase expression. And

625
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,080
this is also a good example of the model

626
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:44,159
doing something that we like we didn't

627
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:47,200
trivially think of ourselves. In this

628
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:49,360
case, it's inserting about 10 base pairs

629
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,679
and it's creating this composite motif

630
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:55,039
using a few of the sort of endogenously

631
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:57,200
encoded nucleotides in the genome um on

632
00:24:55,039 --> 00:25:00,240
each side. So, it's actually creating a

633
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:02,400
a composite uh element that uh wouldn't

634
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,400
fit uh in the 10 base pair constraint

635
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,799
that we gave it.

636
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,960
So, we can in fact turn expression up or

637
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:11,679
down by very large amounts with very

638
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,600
small edits. Um there's another preprint

639
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,520
from Keith Jung's lab that observes

640
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,200
something similar. And so we think that

641
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,880
this could be really useful in the

642
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,559
future for both understanding gene

643
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,720
regulation, the principles how you turn

644
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:24,480
genes up and down, but also potentially

645
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,880
for gene therapies for certain types of

646
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,240
diseases. Um one type of disease that

647
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,159
we're thinking about are hloins

648
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,320
sufficiencies where you inherit one loss

649
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:34,240
of function variant from one parent and

650
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,000
you have one good copy of the gene

651
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,000
meaning that you have 50% the normal

652
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,840
dosage. And because these are loss of

653
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,440
function and variants, different

654
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,279
patients with the same disease will all

655
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,360
have different variants. And so if you

656
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:46,960
wanted to trivially like correct the

657
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,360
mutation, you'd have to have individual

658
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,039
editors for each person. But instead,

659
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,360
maybe you could instead imagine a

660
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:55,679
therapy that upregulates the good copy

661
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:58,559
of the gene by twofold, restoring the

662
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:00,880
proper dosage, and the same gene therapy

663
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:02,080
uh reagent could be useful for for many

664
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,919
different patients with the same

665
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:06,799
disease.

666
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:08,880
So there's a long way a long road toward

667
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:11,039
uh realizing that one of the challenges

668
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,880
is that while we were ultimately

669
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,799
successful in finding edits that

670
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:17,520
upregulated gene expression the

671
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:19,919
predictive models still aren't amazing.

672
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,600
So here's a comparison of the measured

673
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,520
effect on gene expression from variant

674
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,279
effects with the predicted effect from

675
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:27,039
informer. And you can see that the

676
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:28,960
single edit that upregulated gene

677
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,919
expression quite a bit actually informer

678
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,000
doesn't think it should have done

679
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,760
anything. So there's a lot more to do

680
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,760
here to figure out, you know, how to

681
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,559
improve the models, how to improve the

682
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:40,320
design procedure, um will it work

683
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:42,400
differently to edit promoters versus

684
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,799
enhancers. We're interested in digging

685
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:47,360
this into this further, but for now, we

686
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:49,520
have an initial platform combining this

687
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,039
variant effects uh experimental method

688
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:54,159
with sequence design that we think will

689
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:56,480
be really useful for exploring this.

690
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:58,080
So uh to summarize um we're really

691
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,919
excited about understanding the

692
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,679
regulatory genome to accelerate this

693
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,760
process of connecting variance to

694
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:06,400
functions to therapeutics. Um would like

695
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:08,400
to thank everyone in my lab as well as

696
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,159
our collaborators for their support

697
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,440
including um seed funding from the

698
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,600
variant to function initiative here at

699
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,740
the broad over eight years ago. Thanks

700
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:22,999
very much and I'll take any questions.

701
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:22,999
[Applause]

702
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:27,840
a terrific talk. Uh

703
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:30,159
question. I'm gonna ask a question then

704
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:32,640
they'll get organized there. But you

705
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,720
snuck something in there that was early

706
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:37,679
on. You said that attack is not so good

707
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:40,480
in the E2G DNA is much better and I

708
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:42,480
think you've told me that K27 acetle is

709
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,000
maybe better

710
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,360
which is disturbing because a lot of us

711
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,880
are using deep learning models to

712
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:50,000
predict attack and we were hoping then

713
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,840
to be able to predict E to G from that.

714
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,279
Um what are we missing in the attack?

715
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:57,600
What's the problem?

716
00:27:53,279 --> 00:28:00,480
>> Yeah. uh I don't know for sure but what

717
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:03,600
we suspect so the specific statement is

718
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,600
that if you simply count attack reads in

719
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,919
a peak

720
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:10,640
um versus counting DNA seek reads in a

721
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,080
peak DNA seek seems to be a better

722
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:15,360
estimate of activity when you plug it

723
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:17,600
into these models um and I think that's

724
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:20,480
because when you have really dense TF

725
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:22,960
binding in the most active enhancers the

726
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,720
TN5 enzyme is just bigger than DNA seek

727
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,520
and so it can't get in and make as many

728
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:30,640
cuts. Um, and so it ends up missing out

729
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:32,720
on the really high activity elements.

730
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:35,520
Um, but hopefully that information is

731
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,720
still there once we add in sequence and

732
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,279
use sequence models to start

733
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:41,520
interpreting um, you know, which

734
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:42,720
transcription factors are binding and

735
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,720
you know, we're going to have to learn

736
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,640
how to infer which transcription factors

737
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,640
confer enhancer activity versus

738
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,640
accessibility.

739
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:56,640
>> Um, that was a really good talk. Thank

740
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:59,679
you. Um I was confused about this last

741
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:02,320
uh edit where the nformer model thought

742
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:06,240
it shouldn't do anything but it did uh

743
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:09,440
it doubled uh activity. How did it end

744
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:11,120
up in your test set actually if didn't

745
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,360
think it would do anything but you used

746
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,200
enfor to pick the test set right?

747
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:18,080
>> Yeah. So I didn't explain this detail

748
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:20,240
but we designed edits to activate the

749
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:22,159
gene in two different cell types. So in

750
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,559
this case it thought that this variant

751
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:27,919
should activate in the other cell type

752
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:29,679
but it actually did um more strongly in

753
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,200
this one.

754
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:34,880
>> Okay. Thanks.

755
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:36,799
>> So I have a question about the uh gene

756
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,360
edits. Let's say for some variance you

757
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:41,039
tested to uh try to upregulated the gene

758
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:44,000
expression you see maybe less than

759
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:46,000
twofold or effects is weaker. Do you

760
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,679
think it due to let's say for the WP

761
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:52,159
cells two alles did you test some ads

762
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:54,559
using let's say hetererozygus with you

763
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:58,240
know the gene was downregulate first and

764
00:29:54,559 --> 00:30:00,480
then try to upregulate it to the uh to

765
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,960
restore the gene expression will effect

766
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,080
will be larger compared to the wild type

767
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,000
context

768
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:09,600
>> yeah that's a good question um I guess

769
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:14,880
it um it comes down to whether yeah

770
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:18,320
there's uh nonlinearity in the promoter

771
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:20,480
that controls how it responds um to

772
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:23,600
different levels of gene expression. As

773
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:25,840
far as we can tell from

774
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,919
other studies where we've synthetically

775
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:30,480
combined enhancers and promoters in many

776
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:33,279
combinations is that most promoters

777
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:35,840
don't seem to saturate um and that you

778
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:39,200
can always turn them up farther with

779
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:41,760
enhancers. Um but certain promoters are

780
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,279
just intrinsically less responsive. So

781
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,440
there there must be some point where

782
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:47,279
like the pelraases are filing, you know,

783
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:50,399
firing so quickly that you can't turn up

784
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:53,200
a gene far uh farther. Um but it doesn't

785
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:56,240
seem like we've hit that point for most

786
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,200
human promoters.

787
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:01,440
question.

788
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:03,600
>> Hello Jesse, I'm wondering in the SC E2G

789
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:06,880
model, how to you how how do you

790
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:09,440
incorporated the bulk high data in the

791
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:12,399
single cell attack and RNA seek data

792
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:14,559
because the the cells are heterogeneous

793
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:17,360
sample if you measure high C there are

794
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:20,320
mixture of many structures but how to

795
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:23,039
use that to predict the specific cell

796
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:27,600
type specific enhancer and promoter.

797
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:29,120
>> Yeah. So in to estimate contact in ABC

798
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,880
there are a few different ways. The best

799
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:34,559
is if you have really deep let's say

800
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:36,559
micro C or intact IC in your exact cell

801
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:39,039
type that leads to a boost in

802
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:42,000
performance. If you don't have that then

803
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:45,600
what we do is we use an average high-C

804
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,840
map across 40 different human tissues

805
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,840
which will capture basically the the you

806
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:52,559
know average relationship between

807
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:54,880
distance and contact as well as let's

808
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:56,799
say conserved CTCF boundary elements

809
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,640
that create specific loops at longer

810
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:00,480
distances. So in all of these

811
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:05,840
predictions, we're using an average a

812
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:08,799
cell typed average high-C map uh um

813
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:13,519
in com which is the same in combination

814
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:14,960
with cell type specific attacking data.

815
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:16,380
>> That's great. Thank you Jesse.

816
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:24,169
>> Thanks a lot.

817
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:24,169
[Applause]
