1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:06,560
So I'm uh Mark Shirley, chief strategy

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:11,120
officer for Evolo. I'm here representing

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:14,639
uh Jimmy Roas in MIT class of 2016, our

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:18,320
founder and CEO. He's at investor in

5
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:20,640
Bent in uh New York City.

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:24,960
So couple things that we're working on

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,800
here as we uh develop water electrolysis

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,560
equipment. It's really about trying to

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,039
change the entire electrochemical

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:34,239
industry. Uh couple of things, number

11
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:37,520
one, constraints on the grid as we're

12
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:39,840
hearing make it difficult to access the

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:43,600
large amounts of electricity that are

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:46,800
needed for uh electrolysis. And

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:49,520
secondly, many of these devices have

16
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,239
require critical materials which are not

17
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,879
made in this country and are difficult

18
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:58,559
to get a hold of. and the manufacturing

19
00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:01,120
is is uh challenging. So when we set out

20
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:04,799
to start Evolo, we wanted to build a

21
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:07,280
platform of uh chemicals that we could

22
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,560
make by electrochemistry by making the

23
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:13,680
lowest cost electrolyers out there. So

24
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,280
starting with hydrogen and uh or water

25
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,360
electrolyers. I'll talk some more about

26
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,040
that going into the market, but there

27
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,799
are lots of things you could make

28
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:25,600
ammonia, CO from CO2. So you could do

29
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:29,520
carbon capture and then turn that CO2

30
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:33,840
into CO and make other chemicals ethane,

31
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:36,479
ethanol, methanol, etc. And then finally

32
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:40,079
you can do refining processes like

33
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:43,439
lithium to lithium hydroxide and uh

34
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,960
improve the uh friendliness of those

35
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,600
processes.

36
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,159
So how does it work? First of all on the

37
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,320
left side we make everything all the

38
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,439
repeating components by rollto-roll

39
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:58,079
processing. Think newsprint. Okay, I

40
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,240
know newsprint is going out but when you

41
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:03,520
see the speeds at which those components

42
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:06,240
are made uh typically today electrolyer

43
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,879
manufacturers do not make them by

44
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,200
newsprint or or by roll to roll. They

45
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:14,319
stamp them or something like that. It

46
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:18,319
greatly reduces the cost factory. Number

47
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:20,000
two, we use all common materials. It's

48
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:23,120
stainless steel. There's a little bit of

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,560
aluminum. The top and the bottom are

50
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:29,120
made out of plastic. Uh the materials in

51
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:33,360
the electrolyer cells are stainless

52
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:35,760
steel, a little bit of of hydrocarbon

53
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,720
membrane and so on, which greatly

54
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,040
reduces the materials cost as well. such

55
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:45,360
that you're able to look at a cost for

56
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:48,879
electrolyer stack below $200 a kilowatt,

57
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:51,120
maybe even below 150 or $100 a kilowatt.

58
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:54,400
And then the last piece is because we

59
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,200
design it in such a compact form, it's

60
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,760
got the highest power density of any uh

61
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,080
water electrolyer on the market, you're

62
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,760
able to operate that directly with

63
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,519
renewables

64
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:09,200
um and connect it to a solar array. In

65
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,000
fact, some of our first projects are

66
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,920
looking at that. And by going off-rid,

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,959
you greatly reduce not only the cost of

68
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:21,760
the electricity, but likewise the cost

69
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:24,480
and time to connect to the grid.

70
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,239
So, let me talk a bit about that. Uh,

71
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,560
our product, we just had a press release

72
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:32,720
on this yesterday, direct connection to

73
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,319
solar. Uh the the panel on the left, I

74
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,159
won't go through the details, but all

75
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,720
the parts that are exed out are things

76
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:42,000
you don't need if you go straight from

77
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:44,239
the the PV array from your photovoltaics

78
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,560
all the way to the electrolyer.

79
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,599
And that greatly reduces the capital

80
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,400
cost of the system. Not only that, but

81
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:55,360
you're also avoiding long equipment lead

82
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,159
times, interconnect cues, uh, grid

83
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:01,599
connection fees, backup, uh, power

84
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:04,400
supply charges, etc. Don't have to do

85
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,239
that. It makes smaller scale projects

86
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,640
very economical, and I'll talk some more

87
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,959
about this. Materials handling is one.

88
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,280
In warehouses, you've got a rooftop with

89
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:16,320
lots and lots of area. You can drive

90
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:19,359
anywhere from 3 to 10 megawws of

91
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,759
electrolysis capacity making tons per

92
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:25,759
day of hydrogen which can go anything

93
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:28,960
from materials handling to uh short uh

94
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:32,400
duration uh fleet fueling so on and so

95
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,000
forth. Uh and so uh one of our first

96
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,600
projects, I'll say a bit more about

97
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,759
this, is a major warehouse operator, one

98
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:43,280
of the largest in the world, who wants

99
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:45,759
to do rooftop solar for truck fleets and

100
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,360
materials handling forklifts near the

101
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,080
port of Long Beach. So they would run

102
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:53,440
back and forth to get material from the

103
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:56,160
port and then break that into loads

104
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:59,440
which will go to other warehouses

105
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:03,120
utilizing hydrogen in the trucks as well

106
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:05,440
as in the forks. Um and so we're looking

107
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:09,440
to install about six megawatts of that

108
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:12,800
on a single project in 2026 and hundreds

109
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,720
of megawws following on behind. So what

110
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,600
are kind of the areas which look

111
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,800
promising? uh warehouses in logistics as

112
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,199
I mentioned uh in sustainability where

113
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,360
people are reducing natural gas usage

114
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:29,280
even in applications which typically

115
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:32,080
aren't appreciated for hydrogen use

116
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:37,600
thermal oxidizers or certain kinds of

117
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:41,360
heat high value heat uh you can utilize

118
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:44,320
hydrogen if you make it low cost enough

119
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:47,120
and then likewise in future stages

120
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,840
chemicals being made from these

121
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,600
electrolyers in a way that greatly

122
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,720
separates them not just from the natural

123
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:57,120
gas usage that typically goes into them.

124
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,520
But now they become distributed. You can

125
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,440
make them for example ammonia which is

126
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:05,759
highly toxic. You can make it where you

127
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:09,039
use it in the agricultural areas.

128
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,400
I'll uh stop there and see if there are

129
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:13,680
any questions.

130
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:16,240
>> Thank you Art. So, I'll start with one,

131
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:20,960
but um please pose your questions to the

132
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:23,840
chat or the Q&A tab. So, um why is Abola

133
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:27,520
wanting to adapt the water electrolyers

134
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:31,039
to the manufacturer of other chemicals?

135
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:35,199
>> Well, twofold. So, we set out to make a

136
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:38,080
better electrolyer stack and with a

137
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:40,400
better manufacturing process and in

138
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:43,120
doing so, we focused on hydrogen first.

139
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,520
But the truth is with a change in uh

140
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,840
some materials with a change in some of

141
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:51,039
the catalysts you could make any one of

142
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:54,400
those uh reactions happen within the

143
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:57,199
same stack. So the idea here was start

144
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,599
with hydrogen as a near-term opportunity

145
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:02,720
and you see some of the projects that uh

146
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:04,639
we're working on but likewise develop

147
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,840
the technology such that you can apply

148
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:10,400
it in a broader range of electrochemical

149
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:13,440
devices. So it forms a platform to be

150
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:16,240
able to do these reactions.

151
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,440
>> Thank you. And um what could you expand

152
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,039
a little on what you call the real

153
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:23,039
problem holding back green um hydrogen

154
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,680
from mass adoption?

155
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:28,960
>> Uh you you see it every day in the press

156
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,759
that hydrogen projects get cancelled and

157
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:34,080
and they never reach a final investment

158
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,639
decision and move ahead. The big

159
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,319
challenge is is that in particular the

160
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,880
sachs which can make up a large

161
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:43,599
proportion maybe a third or more of the

162
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,840
cost of an electrolyer plant. They're

163
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:49,840
too expensive to make by existing

164
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,520
techniques. Uh and they have poor uh

165
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,160
efficiency in terms of converting

166
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:57,440
electricity into hydro and water into

167
00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:01,039
hydrogen and oxygen. So what we see is

168
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:04,800
as a way to derisk the entire process

169
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:07,680
have a more reliable uh manufacturing

170
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:11,120
process through roll-to-roll processing.

171
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,680
Likewise to make it less artistal if you

172
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,720
will where things are made by hand and

173
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,039
more in a professional manufacturing

174
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,240
facility where human hands don't touch

175
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:25,360
the stacks at all. And we find that as

176
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:28,160
we engage customers here, their real

177
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,160
issue is I can identify a stack that

178
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,519
works for my needs. I can't get enough

179
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:37,200
of it to manufacture to be manufactured

180
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:39,839
in the time frame. Uh some manufacturers

181
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,800
take up to two years to make the

182
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,880
electrolyer stacks for a single project.

183
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,480
So that becomes a real limitation when

184
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,279
you're trying to do larger and larger

185
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,440
projects going forward.

186
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:53,839
>> Okay. And um just quickly connected to

187
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:57,120
that, what is um another thing that you

188
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:59,120
look for when um you're looking for uh a

189
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,480
partner?

190
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:06,160
>> So we uh deal with a lot of project

191
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:09,440
developers. These are often very large

192
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:12,080
private equity funded or you know they

193
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,320
from wealth management systems etc.

194
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,560
trying to develop these projects of

195
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,760
perhaps hundreds of megawatts. We're

196
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:22,320
looking at uh engineering partners who

197
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:25,360
can do the engineering work to design

198
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:28,399
those largecale uh processes.

199
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,320
And uh likewise on the smaller scale

200
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,880
like the the warehouse and logistics

201
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,200
part we're looking for people who can

202
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:38,399
package these systems in the graphics

203
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,640
you see on the right. We make the stacks

204
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,360
that's all we make. Other people can

205
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,920
build the packages which are then

206
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:50,320
deployed at a number large number of

207
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,320
locations around the world.
