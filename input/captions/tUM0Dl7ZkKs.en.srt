1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:05,120
hey hello everyone I'm glad that this uh

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:09,040
the questions transitioned nicely uh

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,920
between Liz and me and you might see uh

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,040
some Echoes of Liz's presentation

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,879
probably because I'm a student of of

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,600
Liz's and uh Liz formerly held my job

7
00:00:15,879 --> 00:00:19,840
before she went to the White House so um

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,279
there's a lot of parallels here today

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,240
and uh just to get started I want to

10
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:26,640
tell you the story of of Sam Seer this

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,080
is Sam he is a New Hampshire

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,960
manufacturing worker and he had been

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,759
working in manufacturing for few years

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,920
uh before he entered his current job the

15
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,200
one that he's performing in this picture

16
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,079
um and and he he in those few years of

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,120
manufacturing in New Hampshire he had

18
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:42,760
never seen a robot and that experience

19
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,360
was actually quite typical because only

20
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:47,079
about 12% of American manufacturers have

21
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,320
any robotic Technologies at all only

22
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:52,039
about a third have advanced software so

23
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,359
Sam's experience in manufacturing wasn't

24
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:55,760
the type of manufacturing of the future

25
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:57,920
or Advanced manufacturing that we

26
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,199
typically think of it was manufacturing

27
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,719
that looked a lot like it did in the

28
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:06,600
1970s in the 1980s so Sam went from that

29
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:08,840
relatively you low paying uh relatively

30
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,680
analog job into this new firm and he

31
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,040
started seeing all sorts of robots at

32
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,240
his current company a company called

33
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,600
hypertherm that makes um Advanced

34
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,439
cutting tools so they Machine Tool

35
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,560
manufactur they export all over the

36
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:22,799
world and what Sam faced when he saw

37
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,400
this robot he he was a little bit

38
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,040
excited because he liked technology but

39
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,960
he was also a little bit fearful because

40
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,079
he thought that maybe this robot would

41
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,159
make his work less relevant it would

42
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,439
allow him to use less of his mechanical

43
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,360
skills so what he thought was that

44
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:38,799
really when this robot came into the

45
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,759
factory the the factory itself faced a

46
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:44,119
fork in the road they could create a job

47
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:47,119
for Sam that increased productivity so

48
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:49,320
that allowed Sam to do his tasks faster

49
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,439
but also turned Sam into a little bit of

50
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,960
an automaton he wasn't really solving

51
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,200
problems or providing his own skills on

52
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,920
the factory floor he was really just

53
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,960
checking to make sure that the robot was

54
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:01,600
doing what it was supposed to do and

55
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,399
that uh that fear was that Sam's work

56
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,439
would not just be uh Le you know less

57
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,479
frequent the jobs less available but it

58
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:11,720
would also be more commodified and his

59
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,080
job would be lower quality but there was

60
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,280
an alternative and this was actually the

61
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,879
alternative that Sam's employer uh

62
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,280
adopted where Not only was the robot

63
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:22,680
able to add more productivity but it

64
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,760
also improved the quality of the jobs

65
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,040
for people like Sam their jobs became

66
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:29,239
higher wage they became more of a cell

67
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,040
leader where they were uh supervising an

68
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:32,720
automated system system trying to solve

69
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,640
problems when the system broke or

70
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,920
thinking about ways that the system as a

71
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,560
whole could become more productive now

72
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,080
how did they do it I think the the

73
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,519
really interesting question and this is

74
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,040
a question that starts with some of the

75
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:47,400
trends that Liz identified and Zooms in

76
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,080
on operational strategies to realize

77
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,800
them at the company level was that

78
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,360
hypertherm Sam's employer is really a

79
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,959
special sort of company it's an

80
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,840
employee-owned Cooperative uh by being

81
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,440
employee owned Sam said that every time

82
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,360
he saw parts on a tray he saw them as

83
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,760
dollar signs because he got a share of

84
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,040
the profit so Sam was motivated not just

85
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,519
to try to make the processes more

86
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,319
productive he was also motivated to find

87
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:14,159
ways to improve those processes

88
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,000
incrementally another really special

89
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,959
thing that hypertherm did was they set

90
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,200
up an internal training institute so

91
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:20,599
knowing that they were going to adopt

92
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,879
these robots they realized they needed

93
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:25,360
to create new jobs for people to operate

94
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,080
the robots and fix them so they they

95
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,280
offered those new jobs to people like

96
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:31,239
Sam and then they also offered classes

97
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,680
across the street from the factory to

98
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:35,239
fill those jobs and what I want to

99
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,400
illustrate here is that this this

100
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:39,200
choosing the right path I would say not

101
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,519
just the the right word not the left but

102
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,760
also I would say the normatively better

103
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,239
path of more productivity and higher

104
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,959
quality jobs with robots doesn't just

105
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,480
say doesn't just mean increasing wages

106
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,360
for people who are who are operating

107
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:56,360
robots or supervising these automated

108
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,519
systems it also means creating these

109
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,760
other types of incentives and other

110
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:03,560
types of support systems like a training

111
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:06,760
institute to support workers like Sam

112
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,840
going into this path so I use this as an

113
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,720
illustration of what uh my colleague

114
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:13,239
Julie Shaw and I call positive sum

115
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,159
automation automation that not only

116
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:18,239
improves the short-term performance of

117
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:20,840
The Firm but also improves the long-term

118
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,840
capabilities of the firm including the

119
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:25,160
quality of jobs for workers and the

120
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,800
incentives for workers to contribute to

121
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,560
continuous Improvement and contribute to

122
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,240
Innovation on the factory floor that's

123
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,520
the important part of the more creative

124
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,320
work that comes out of this positive sum

125
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:37,960
automation uh equation now you know we

126
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,759
had been working on this for for the

127
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:42,960
past four or five years and uh two years

128
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:45,440
ago with the release of chat GPT we

129
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,120
started to wonder does this positive sum

130
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,680
automation framework still hold up in

131
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,680
the era of generative AI like Liz said

132
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,639
um in 2020 there was a a really uh

133
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:58,520
Landmark study that suggested the the

134
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:00,039
fear of robots and and displacing jobs

135
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,680
is really misguided the f focus should

136
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:03,440
be on the quality of work that's really

137
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,360
the jumping off point for for my

138
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,919
research but now there's all sorts of

139
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,479
different discussion of of what

140
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:10,720
generative AI might mean both for

141
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:13,479
productivity on the one hand but also

142
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,600
for the threat to to the quality of work

143
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:18,400
for people like Sam and so so we looked

144
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,319
at these kind of the headlines that were

145
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,520
coming out of commentators about this

146
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:25,160
technology as hypotheses that we wanted

147
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,639
to test did did generative AI suggest it

148
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,280
was going to have a lead to a different

149
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,080
sort of productivity boom than

150
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:32,960
Technologies in the past like let's say

151
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,120
industrial robots were jobs really at

152
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,080
risk are white collar workers now now

153
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,080
threatened by these tools and then

154
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,199
finally you know what skills are really

155
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,800
relevant you know if you were creating a

156
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,479
training institute to support workers to

157
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,319
work with gener AI what would that

158
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,479
training institute teach so what we did

159
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:50,960
a little more than a year ago was we

160
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,840
convened a group of about 60 companies

161
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,639
to start studying their early

162
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,400
applications of generative AI how is it

163
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,520
affecting their demand for skills and

164
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,400
really trying to understand what could

165
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,520
we learn about these hypotheses and we

166
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,280
all what I'll share with you today to to

167
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,520
get started are some of the studies some

168
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,759
of the evidence that we can apply to

169
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,000
these hypotheses and and what I'm you

170
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,800
know that just to give you a preview of

171
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,800
the conclusion I think that a lot of

172
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,360
these hypotheses are are overblown and

173
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,759
not really what we should be concerned

174
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:19,479
about and instead I think that the more

175
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:22,400
important area for both our research and

176
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:25,560
I think for uh for managers to consider

177
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,919
is not necessarily a shortage of jobs

178
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,800
which has kind of been the narrative

179
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:30,520
around generative AI but a shortage of

180
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,479
skilled workers and this is kind of the

181
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:35,080
second set of uh the second storyline

182
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:36,759
that one that Liz already emphasized but

183
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,360
I'm going to dive into a little bit more

184
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:39,960
piecing apart you know going back to

185
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,560
some of the questions that you had about

186
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,960
technology adoption in the US versus

187
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,720
other countries and also skill

188
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,520
development and and Workforce education

189
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,160
in the US so I'll start with this

190
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:50,880
generative AI story line and I think try

191
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,639
to pick apart some of the assumptions

192
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,199
that we've made and then I'll I'll pivot

193
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,319
to this question of the labor shortage

194
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,360
in you know industrial skill intensive

195
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:02,919
jobs and what we can do about it so to

196
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,400
get started you know early on in the

197
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:06,800
discussion of generative AI this is a

198
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,720
discussion of uh the adoption of robots

199
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,360
as well there is this consideration that

200
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,960
productivity is just going to go up and

201
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,680
up it's going to be a transformation of

202
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,919
productivity such that we might not need

203
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,960
to employ nearly as many workers as we

204
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:21,400
had in the past now there's a really uh

205
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,919
terrific uh book by by Robert Gordon an

206
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:25,360
economist from Northwestern he was uh uh

207
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,120
he was my economics professor as an

208
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,680
undergrad he's a very grumpy person and

209
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,319
this is quite a grumpy book um if you're

210
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,840
interested in reading it it you might

211
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,919
want to um you know uh you know bring

212
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:38,160
your optimism to to the read but the

213
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:40,319
what he argues essentially is that the

214
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,919
even though we've had you know

215
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,800
innovations that have transformed

216
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,720
consumer experiences the personal

217
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,960
computer the internet um these

218
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:50,479
Innovations have not had nearly as big

219
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:53,080
of an effect on productivity as previous

220
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:55,039
generations of of Innovations so what he

221
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:57,599
shows and this is you know what other

222
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,720
economists have confirmed is that

223
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:02,360
productivity growth in previous eras

224
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:04,520
before 1970 before the kind of Rise of

225
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,599
digital Technologies were far greater

226
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:09,080
than productivity growth afterward and

227
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:10,479
what Eric bolon at Stanford and others

228
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,360
call they call this the productivity

229
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,960
Paradox because we predicted and

230
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,520
anticipated that these digital

231
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:19,240
Technologies would have a huge impact on

232
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,720
our productivity and overall prosperity

233
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,879
and in some ways they have had a

234
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,440
transformative impact but it hasn't been

235
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,360
measured in the productivity numbers um

236
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,000
one I think you know the cartoonish

237
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,039
explanation for this might be that um

238
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,200
even though these uh these tools have

239
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:36,599
allowed us to do some tasks faster in

240
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,120
email is much more uh productive let's

241
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:40,839
say than writing a letter or sending in

242
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,320
aax but they've created other tasks that

243
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:44,279
are less productive and they've also

244
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,320
been sources of great distraction that

245
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:49,880
have made us uh less productive overall

246
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:52,399
so the one big question for us is like

247
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:54,240
the productivity Paradox is pretty clear

248
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,240
for the personal computer and for the

249
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,279
internet is it going to La is it going

250
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:02,279
to be uh persistent for generative AI

251
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,880
now now what I want to emphasize here is

252
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:04,959
that when we talk about generative a

253
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,440
we're talking about something very

254
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,839
different than other automation

255
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:11,240
Technologies I think sometimes the you

256
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:14,120
know generative models get L uh lumped

257
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:16,160
in with narrow AI things like um you

258
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,880
know detecting anomalies on a radiology

259
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,320
scan and they also get lumped in with

260
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,959
other automation Technologies like

261
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,800
robotic process automation software

262
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,480
that's used in finance and Healthcare or

263
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,200
industrial robots like the kinds that

264
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,800
Sams uses on the factory floor what's

265
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,320
really different about this set of

266
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,959
Technology

267
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,040
is that if you think about their

268
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:36,600
reliability at performing a task versus

269
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,959
their flexibility at performing a task

270
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,600
they they perform very differently than

271
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:42,760
robots so if I give a robot or a CNC

272
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,720
machine a task I program it to do a task

273
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:47,240
it can do the same thing over and over

274
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,200
again very reliably as long as I give it

275
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:52,680
a dedicated power source and uh you know

276
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,720
an unchanging work environment however

277
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,920
it takes a lot of human skill and it

278
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,040
takes a lot of effort in some cases to

279
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:01,000
get the to train the robot or train the

280
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,839
machine to do a new task so we could

281
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,959
think about these as highly robust

282
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:06,519
systems that aren't very flexible now

283
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,880
what I think is exciting about these

284
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:11,360
Technologies is the role for the human

285
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,040
and the role for the worker is typically

286
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,920
to make things like industrial robots

287
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,279
more flexible and one of the great

288
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,800
things we have as humans or one of our

289
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:19,959
human capabilities is flexibility that

290
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:22,200
we can solve problems and adapt a

291
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:24,880
technology to new situations this is one

292
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,600
reason why you know Engineers have

293
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,200
really thrived working with robots and

294
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:31,120
they they can demand a high wage for

295
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,600
that sort of job generative AI is really

296
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,320
the inverse in a lot of the ways it's

297
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:37,040
been used so far it's highly flexible in

298
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,800
the sense that it can answer all sorts

299
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,880
of questions in different languages and

300
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:45,040
different formats like videos and um and

301
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:46,920
images but the the technology itself

302
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,160
isn't very robust it's designed such

303
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,519
that you can give it the same prompt

304
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,519
over and over again and it'll give you a

305
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:54,200
different answer and and my favorite

306
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,200
illustration of this is what's called

307
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,480
the strawberry problem has anyone uh

308
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,839
heard of the strawberry problem or

309
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,120
encountered this themselves I'm seeing

310
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:03,360
some no head so apologies for the review

311
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:06,399
but I still find it fun every time um it

312
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,399
comes up so um this is a known problem

313
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:12,920
to to open AI it's a problem with chat

314
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:14,279
GPT where if you ask uh the chat GPT um

315
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,639
how many RS are there in the word

316
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:18,320
strawberry it will give you uh

317
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:20,120
invariably the wrong answer it will say

318
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,680
that there are two RS rather than three

319
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,959
and if you follow up and say well which

320
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,800
letters are the RS it'll give you the

321
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,519
right answer it'll identify three Rs in

322
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,120
Strawberry it can spell the the word

323
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:30,880
correctly and if you go on you can give

324
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,000
it the same question with the same

325
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,839
wording or with slightly different

326
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,200
wordings and sometimes it'll say two RS

327
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,320
sometimes it'll say three Rs now what's

328
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,880
the most what's remarkable about this

329
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,160
issue I think is that not just that it

330
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,800
gets a very simple uh question wrong of

331
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,600
course you know if you've played around

332
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,440
with these tools they get

333
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,959
extraordinarily complex questions right

334
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,000
and they they have uh very high

335
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:53,880
capabilities but what I think is so

336
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,480
interesting is that all of the the

337
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,519
Brilliant Minds at open AI know about

338
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,440
this problem they've known about this

339
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,600
problem for a long time and they can't

340
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,720
fix it and it's because this tool is a

341
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,079
black box that they can't necessarily

342
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:09,200
given the the flexibility of the tool

343
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:11,360
they don't necessarily uh have the the

344
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,040
knowledge or of the internal workings of

345
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,839
the system to make it more robust so

346
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,480
there really is this trade-off between

347
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,440
flexibility and robustness with these

348
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:22,199
tools now I want to show how this plays

349
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:24,279
out in in more serious examples than

350
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:26,959
just the the strawberry illustration so

351
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:29,240
this is um some some tables from a paper

352
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:31,160
from a colleague um and collaborator

353
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,920
mind Kate Kellogg along with others

354
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:35,560
where they studied the use of generative

355
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,959
AI with Boston Consulting Group

356
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:39,839
consultants and what they did was as you

357
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:42,199
can imagine in a typical experimental

358
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,800
setup they gave one group of Consultants

359
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:47,320
access to chat GPT to do a few tasks

360
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,120
they gave the other group of Consultants

361
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,600
access to kind of their typical you know

362
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,519
computer internet browser to do the

363
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:55,120
tasks one task was essentially

364
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,199
developing a business plan a go to

365
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,680
market strategy for a new shoe typical

366
00:12:57,199 --> 00:13:01,639
Consulting task the second task

367
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,839
was to evaluate the market opportunity

368
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:05,920
of multiple different products using an

369
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,720
Excel spreadsheet of financial data as

370
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:11,600
well as transcripts of interviews now on

371
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,839
the first task the group with uh

372
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,040
essentially the chat GPT equivalent did

373
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:18,040
extremely well they were far faster you

374
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:20,320
know more productive at doing this task

375
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:23,800
and they also were judged by a party of

376
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,720
experts to do um a higher quality job at

377
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,839
this task and what was remarkable and

378
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,639
they found this in in more studies than

379
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,839
just with the BCG Consultants is that

380
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:33,639
the least experienced Consultants

381
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,240
actually got the biggest Boost from the

382
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:37,279
chat GPT this seemed to be a skill

383
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:39,360
leveler that the the biggest benefit of

384
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,920
the tool was for the most Junior people

385
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,120
so if we were just looking at this

386
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:46,120
result this result's been replicated in

387
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,120
customer service settings in writing um

388
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:51,440
this would be you know a game Cher

389
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:53,680
really U an incredible benefit however

390
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,480
when they looked at the other task the

391
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,959
task where you had to analyze tabular

392
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,880
data along with

393
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,880
transcripts the group with generative AI

394
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,680
in particularly the group with

395
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,440
generative AI that had been trained on

396
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:06,639
where generative AI was weak they were

397
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,920
more likely to get the the answer wrong

398
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,320
they were more likely to lead you in the

399
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,160
wrong direction and when they went

400
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,120
through essentially the the transcript

401
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:15,600
of how the BCG Consultants were

402
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,720
interacting with the tool they realized

403
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,160
that the it wasn't just that they were

404
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,360
the the algorithm was giving them the

405
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,680
wrong answer it was that the algorithm

406
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,519
was very persuasive that when you

407
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,199
followed up with the um well you

408
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:28,680
followed up with questions about why the

409
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:31,360
answer was um was the way it was uh chat

410
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:33,759
GPT like tool gave you a very convincing

411
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,360
argument for the wrong answer so this

412
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:36,880
was really the the challenge that they

413
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,399
identified in this paper which I think

414
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,839
is relevant to a lot of operators is

415
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:42,720
where is the frontier where this

416
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:44,440
technology has a comparative advantage

417
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,639
for the goto Market strategy it's pretty

418
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:48,240
clear that this tool can make workers

419
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,759
more productive and it can be beneficial

420
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,320
as helping workers climb the learning

421
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:54,160
curve but for the other example with

422
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,759
more you know uh more of an analytical

423
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,519
case it wasn't clear initially whether

424
00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:00,000
this tool would be uh a comparative

425
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:02,279
advantage or not not it turns out that

426
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,880
it actually LED workers astray so the

427
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:06,759
question is you know what are the use

428
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:09,440
cases where this tool can actually be

429
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:12,399
beneficial and one of those use cases

430
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,480
that that I think is um that that we've

431
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,079
seen the most adoption among our uh

432
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,560
working group has been in software

433
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,519
engineering and the use of tools like

434
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,040
GitHub co-pilot are there any users

435
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,759
within your organizations using GitHub

436
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,839
co-pilot for software engineering

437
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:26,120
benefits okay in the questions please

438
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,920
let me know if your experience has been

439
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,560
much different than this but this is the

440
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,680
first real you know randomly um you know

441
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,399
randomized control study of the use of

442
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:36,519
GitHub co-pilot to improve software

443
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,279
engineering productivity and who better

444
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:40,079
to study then Microsoft which is one of

445
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:41,720
the pioneers of these Technologies along

446
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,399
with Accenture which uses it on a high

447
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,519
variety of projects and then they had

448
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:46,600
this Anonymous company that they say is

449
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,480
a large company let's just take their

450
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:51,399
word for it um so some of these

451
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,000
co-authors are are Microsoft employees

452
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:55,199
for Microsoft research and some of them

453
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,240
are our colleagues at at MIT and what I

454
00:15:55,199 --> 00:16:00,160
think is is interesting and this is just

455
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,519
maybe to give you um you know I'll just

456
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,199
give you the skepticism with which I

457
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,319
read these results now is that the

458
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:07,600
headlines associated with these studies

459
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:09,600
only looked at this fourth column this

460
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,279
fourth column right here which pulled

461
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,720
the results of three very different

462
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:15,079
companies and how they Ed GitHub

463
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:18,440
co-pilot and of course the the results

464
00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:20,519
that they shared were that the GitHub Co

465
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:22,160
that using GitHub copilot led to

466
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:25,519
significantly more builds for software

467
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:28,560
Engineers a boost in productivity um of

468
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:30,240
of you know 30 plus% and I think that is

469
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,800
a really exciting finding I actually

470
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,440
given some of the anecdotal uh

471
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,800
information from our working group

472
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,959
members I thought it might be higher

473
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,160
because there are a lot of people very

474
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:39,720
excited about GitHub co-pilot but then

475
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,120
when you look at the the tables this

476
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,959
table in particular you realize you know

477
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:46,000
the pool data are actually masking a

478
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:47,759
really interesting story that at

479
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,279
Microsoft where you might expect

480
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,880
productivity to be very high given the

481
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:53,360
familiarity with these tools there was

482
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,360
no significant increase in in builds

483
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,279
there was just a significant increase in

484
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,279
poll requests and trying to you know

485
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:01,040
starting work and an Accenture where

486
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,880
there was which is really driving this

487
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,240
result there was a significant increase

488
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,160
in builds but also there was a decline

489
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:09,640
in the success so there's a tradeoff

490
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:12,039
between productivity and the quality of

491
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:14,640
the work that was being produced so I

492
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:16,280
think what's happening here and really

493
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,880
why I think we we should be skeptical of

494
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,880
these sorts of sites is there's a big

495
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,400
heterogeneity not just in how companies

496
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,959
are using these tools but the

497
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,199
individuals within companies and how

498
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,480
they're using these tools so what we've

499
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:30,799
we've seen and started to see is that

500
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:32,160
expert users users who know what a

501
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,640
software system should look like who

502
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,000
know what they want to produce they're

503
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:37,080
able to use these tools very

504
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,480
productively because they can see if

505
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,760
it's not giving them what they want and

506
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,720
they can adjust course so if if they're

507
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,960
a domain expert and they can interpret

508
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,360
the information that a GitHub co-pilot

509
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,240
or a chat GPT gives them that can be a

510
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,280
real comparative advantage but for a

511
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,919
junior developer who might not know what

512
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,919
they're supposed to produce it might

513
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:56,960
make them faster at trying to do a task

514
00:17:54,919 --> 00:17:59,200
but the build success rate might be

515
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,360
lower so this is I think just continuing

516
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,840
to look at this tradeoffs not just in

517
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,280
which tasks are for a competive

518
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:06,080
Advantage but for which workers these

519
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:08,559
tools might be a competive Advantage as

520
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,240
well and then finally and this is I

521
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,240
think hot off the presses this is from a

522
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,480
a graduate student at MIT and it's

523
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,960
really a fantastic study so I would I

524
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,919
would uh invite you to to look further

525
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:22,720
if you're thinking about this in your um

526
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:24,679
company so I I had um been looking among

527
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,640
our 60 companies for use cases related

528
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:29,320
to Innovation and R&D and that's where

529
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,440
I'm most excited about this technology

530
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:33,480
I'm hoping that this technology might be

531
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,320
able to discover new drugs that are very

532
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,440
that have a high impact it might be able

533
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:39,159
to discover new materials that allow for

534
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,400
more environmental resiliency that sort

535
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:43,080
of thing and that has been the promise

536
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,480
that I think the U the folks who are

537
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,240
developing these technologies have sold

538
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,679
us on and this is the first real study

539
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:52,159
to estimate how these Tech how these

540
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:56,880
technology tools are translating into

541
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:59,840
Innovation and what Aiden finds is that

542
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,679
there's actually was he he studies I'll

543
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,760
give you this um the setup of the study

544
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,840
first so you can we can interpret the

545
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:07,240
findings together he looks at the

546
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:09,600
introduction of these tools in an a big

547
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:12,840
R&D team at a materials company where

548
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,520
the main uh R&D engine is identifying

549
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:17,000
new materials and then translating them

550
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:19,480
into useful products so if you look at

551
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,840
this you know uh the left set of figures

552
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:24,799
here this is the kind of the key finding

553
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,960
on productivity where he looks at a huge

554
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:29,760
boost when you at this dotted lines when

555
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,440
they adopt the AI tools a huge boost in

556
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,480
the discovery of new materials really

557
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,000
noticeable you know 40% increase and

558
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,960
then as a result of finding these new

559
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,039
materials there's a huge boost in in

560
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,320
patentability now for those of you who

561
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:42,600
deal with the patent system this isn't

562
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:45,080
very surprising you know you can patent

563
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:47,200
just about anything um if you if you

564
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:49,000
have the right team as this company does

565
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,520
um but really what I think the where the

566
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,159
rubber meets the road is do these

567
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,840
materials are they actually useful do

568
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:56,200
they translate into product prototypes

569
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,120
and his finding is that they do although

570
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,200
at a far lower rate than the materials

571
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,559
that were discovering

572
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,240
so he finds and I think this is really

573
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:04,880
important that there does seem to be

574
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,159
some promise that that there were more

575
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,520
new products developed after the

576
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:12,159
introduction of of AI at this company

577
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,640
now let's getting back to our discussion

578
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,520
about work what's the impact on the

579
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:18,440
worker he has a a you know a fascinating

580
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:21,600
result so here's how workers say their

581
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:23,440
jobs change these are R&D workers phds

582
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,080
Highly Educated people they say they

583
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,799
spend a lot less of their time

584
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:29,679
generating new ideas and a lot more time

585
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:31,919
trying to exercise judgment or to

586
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:34,000
interpret the ideas of the algorithm and

587
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:36,080
a lot more time just running experiments

588
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,120
and overall their job satisfaction

589
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,280
plummeted about 80% of the workers say

590
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:42,880
they hate this so it's making them more

591
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:44,400
productive but they can't stand it

592
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,640
because the thing that they really liked

593
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,919
about their job in the first place they

594
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:49,240
weren't doing anymore they like to

595
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:50,679
generate ideas they wanted to keep that

596
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:53,240
part of their Work Sharp that's why they

597
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:55,360
got into science so it's it's a really I

598
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:57,080
find it a a fascinating but almost

599
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,600
confusing finding from an R&D

600
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,679
perspective like do you adopt this Tech

601
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,799
technology if you know that you're going

602
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:03,600
to face this tradeoff or I think more

603
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:05,360
relevantly how might you adopt this

604
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,080
technology to get the benefits of

605
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:10,120
improved productivity but not the costs

606
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,440
of an unhappy Workforce that feels like

607
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:14,000
they're not exercising the muscle that

608
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:17,320
got them into this environment in the

609
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,320
first place okay so I've been I'm going

610
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:21,279
to back up so I've been interested in

611
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,640
this question of how workers think about

612
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:24,640
these tools and under what conditions

613
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,559
workers might want to work with these

614
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,679
these types of automation Technologies

615
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:31,559
and look at them as as a positive for

616
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,400
their job quality and now I'm going to

617
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:35,559
give you some data that were um

618
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:37,799
collected before Aiden released this

619
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:40,320
paper and I think you know might uh

620
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:42,679
provide some Nuance to what he found so

621
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,799
we had a a survey of about 9,000 workers

622
00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:45,799
across industry so nationally

623
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:48,000
representative survey and we asked

624
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:50,120
workers a bunch of questions about um

625
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,799
you know whether they the whether

626
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:53,440
Automation and new technology had a

627
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:54,960
positive impact on various aspects of

628
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,760
their job and really what we wanted to

629
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:00,080
know was are there certain strategies

630
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:02,400
that can f a worker from being resistant

631
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,400
to new technology to embracing new

632
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,799
technology and I I just will give you

633
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,360
this is you know published I can share

634
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:09,919
it with you but I'll give you a few

635
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:12,559
overview findings to to shed some light

636
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:14,840
so first you know we expected given this

637
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:16,640
Narrative of Technology being against

638
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:18,279
workers that workers might be more

639
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:21,600
resistant than not to to new

640
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:23,000
technologies and we asked them about not

641
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,880
just the impact of new technologies on

642
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,559
their job security but on various

643
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,400
aspects of their work you can see safety

644
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:31,240
autonomy Etc and I was very surprised to

645
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,080
find how positive workers were about

646
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:35,279
Automation and new technologies so the

647
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:36,600
Net score is the percentage of workers

648
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:39,120
that were in favor that thought these

649
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,039
new technologies were positive versus uh

650
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,120
you know the difference between the

651
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:44,960
positive score versus the negative score

652
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:46,120
and you could see that all in all of

653
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,480
these categories workers were more

654
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:50,039
positive than negative and for things

655
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,440
like upward Mobility workers really

656
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:53,120
associate new technologies and

657
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,520
automation with helping them move up in

658
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,919
their careers and workers who who

659
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,679
prioritize upward mobility and education

660
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,120
who are really motivated by that are the

661
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,320
most likely to be champions of new

662
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,360
technology so that's one of the big

663
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,000
findings here one of the second findings

664
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:08,480
and what I think is important for for

665
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,520
many of you as as managers and operators

666
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,799
is that there seem to be ways to design

667
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:14,279
jobs to get Workers to embrace

668
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:16,080
technology more and this is what kind of

669
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:20,039
brings this you know links it to Aiden's

670
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:21,480
paper so I expected early on with this

671
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:23,640
survey I thought you know the workers

672
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:26,120
who are in the most routine jobs who

673
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:27,760
might be most vulnerable to um to

674
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,159
automation those are going also going to

675
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,960
be the workers that are resistant think

676
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:32,080
of like the Lites the the ones who broke

677
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,279
the machines were the ones that thought

678
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,360
that the machines would be taking their

679
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:37,480
jobs but that's not what we found at all

680
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,480
actually we found that your level of

681
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:41,720
routine tasks in your job did not

682
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:44,120
predict how open or closed you were to

683
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:46,279
automation instead it was your level of

684
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:48,559
problem solving so if you look at

685
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:50,360
workers in physical industries that had

686
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,919
a high level routine tasks but low

687
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,559
problem solving you could think of

688
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,360
workers who are kind of that automaton

689
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:57,000
the left fork in the road of adopting

690
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,240
new technology they were the most

691
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
negative about the impact of automation

692
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:03,600
new technology but if you have high

693
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,240
routine tasks and high problem solving

694
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,320
you're the most open to new technologies

695
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,799
now in retrospect I probably should have

696
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,320
thought of this in advance but it does

697
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:14,240
seem like if you have high routine tasks

698
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,760
you both see a role for Automation and

699
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,760
new technologies in your job it might be

700
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,159
able to help you get rid of the drudgery

701
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,320
and you're pretty secure that you're

702
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:23,840
still going to be able to solve problems

703
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:26,520
at work so I feel like the the challenge

704
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:29,480
for Aiden's R&D scientists was that they

705
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:31,919
might have been in a low essentially low

706
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:33,480
routine tasks and high problem solving

707
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:34,840
and in some ways they were taking away

708
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:38,039
some of their problem solving that they

709
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:39,880
were able to do all right so I'm I can

710
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:42,399
come back to this but I think you know

711
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:44,559
the the big story here is that although

712
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:46,000
generative Ai and and AI Technologies in

713
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:47,760
general seem like they're presenting new

714
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,279
challenges for work we actually have a

715
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,200
lot of experience with these types of

716
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,480
human in the loop problems some of our

717
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,520
experience comes from issues like

718
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,080
Aerospace there's a lot of actually uh

719
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:58,440
manufacturing examples that can help us

720
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,720
manage these human Loop challenges and

721
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,799
what we you know teach when we teach our

722
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:04,200
students automated systems we can draw

723
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:05,799
on that historical data um to help them

724
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:08,880
think about how to design a job with

725
00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:10,200
with generative AI for example okay all

726
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,080
right so now I want to get to the second

727
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:15,000
piece and which really builds off of of

728
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:19,360
Liz's presentation which got me excited

729
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,919
so irrespective of you know this the uh

730
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,000
the excitement about generative what are

731
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:26,559
we going to do about all of these jobs

732
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,799
very skilled jobs in heavy industry that

733
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,279
are going to come online over the next

734
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:31,440
10 years so as Liz mentioned you know

735
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:33,120
there's been more than a tripling of

736
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,320
manufacturing Construction Construction

737
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,960
of new energy facilities in States like

738
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:40,080
Texas and then you see a lot of I think

739
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,200
well-founded concerns that we just don't

740
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,000
have the people we don't have people

741
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,399
interested in these industries we don't

742
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,720
have people who are attracted to these

743
00:25:44,399 --> 00:25:48,399
sorts of jobs and it's a real problem I

744
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,679
talk to manufacturers frequently

745
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:52,279
favorite part of my job is to go out to

746
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:54,080
factories and I started asking a

747
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:56,000
question about how fast do you think you

748
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,760
could grow today and a lot of

749
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,320
Manufacturers I could double in size

750
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,799
today then you ask the next question

751
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,919
well why aren't you doing it it seems

752
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:03,159
like that would be the rational thing to

753
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,600
do if you could double say well I can't

754
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:07,480
find the people to do it and that seems

755
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,399
like a real a real problem there's

756
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:11,279
something really broken that we can't

757
00:26:09,399 --> 00:26:12,880
mobilize the people and I want to kind

758
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:16,720
of first unpack that problem and then

759
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:18,120
suggest a potential resolution so first

760
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,840
I think Liz actually responded to these

761
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:22,600
relatively well so but there are some

762
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,679
voices out there um that say hey we

763
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,039
don't we shouldn't really be focused on

764
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:28,480
manufacturing relative to other

765
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:29,840
Industries um you know uh I all I like

766
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,600
wolf in the financial times he calls it

767
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,120
manufacturing fetishism I didn't know it

768
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,279
was a fetish of mine but I certainly

769
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,640
think that uh manufacturing is very

770
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,360
important and I think we should

771
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:42,039
emphasize the reason it's important is

772
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:43,760
not only is it the most uh you know the

773
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:46,720
highest paying set of jobs for people

774
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:49,640
without a forear degree it's also one of

775
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,279
the only types of uh of Industry that

776
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,960
brings in money to an economy from

777
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,880
outside it's one of the only tradable

778
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:58,279
Industries whereas retail is really just

779
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:00,200
recycling um uh recycling money within

780
00:26:58,279 --> 00:27:02,360
an economy manufacturing particularly

781
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:04,679
manufacturing that exports has a huge

782
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:06,600
positive spillover effect on any

783
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:07,919
Regional or national economy that's why

784
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,240
it matters is that's what gives it

785
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:12,480
really the multiplier effect um so

786
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,799
here's what I I want to give as another

787
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,360
reason for manufacturing manufacturing I

788
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:18,120
think for the last about 100 years has

789
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:19,960
been really core to the American dream

790
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:22,000
so if we look at the map of where

791
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:24,640
manufacturing has grown versus

792
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,240
disappeared over the last 40 years you

793
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,960
could see and and including you know a

794
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,200
little kind of uh rivulet through

795
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,760
through Texas the the orange and the red

796
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,679
are the places where manufacturing has

797
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,600
strengthened as the economy has

798
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,880
de-industrialized and these are also the

799
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,240
parts of the country where the middle

800
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,480
class is strengthened where there's been

801
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,320
been strong upward Mobility so here just

802
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,440
Maps manufacturing growth with up upward

803
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:47,480
mobility and you can see that same

804
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:49,600
central part of the country has high

805
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:51,080
upward Mobility meaning the the next

806
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,880
generation is doing better than the

807
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,399
generation before and it's the extent to

808
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,000
which they're doing better um and

809
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:58,799
they've also done that in part because

810
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,519
of access to to manufacturing job there

811
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:02,399
also seems to be some link to two-year

812
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:04,399
degrees but um just to give you a sense

813
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:05,880
like this is why I you know I think it's

814
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:07,480
partly why Liz talks about manufacturing

815
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,399
it's why I think manufacturing

816
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:11,120
industrial jobs are so important so if

817
00:28:09,399 --> 00:28:14,440
they're so important what can be done

818
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:16,200
next um you know just a a review here's

819
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:18,279
what's happened to manufacturing job

820
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,279
openings over time you can see the spike

821
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:22,240
in the green line which is job openings

822
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:24,519
during covid also the spike in in

823
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,240
turnover which is the gry line uh but it

824
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:27,679
wasn't just a CO problem it was actually

825
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,480
manifesting for about 10 years before

826
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,720
that that we saw tripling in job

827
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:34,519
openings between 2010 and 2018 so

828
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:36,200
long-standing problem and it's a problem

829
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:39,720
that I've heard a lot of employers

830
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:41,360
respond to not by investing in kind of

831
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,000
public goods like you know community

832
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,919
colleges or Vocational Technical

833
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,600
institutions they've actually started

834
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:50,039
just hiring anyone who they think can

835
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,720
can uh can perform the job show up on

836
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:53,679
time and perform a basic set of skills

837
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:55,480
and they say We'll train you on the job

838
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:57,039
the problem for that is it often takes

839
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,120
between one and three years then for

840
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,760
these workers who comeing off the

841
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:02,000
streets to get fully self-sufficient on

842
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:04,480
the job so this hire for will train for

843
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,919
skill strategy puts firms behind the

844
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,080
eightball from the jump because they're

845
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:10,080
not really uh prepared to run an

846
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,200
internal training organization if they

847
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,480
don't have a training institute like

848
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,399
hypertherm does so they end up with this

849
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:16,840
High turnover cycle and bringing in

850
00:29:15,399 --> 00:29:19,080
people without really the skills to do

851
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:20,840
the job so it's just constantly a a

852
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,320
really a negative feedback cycle that's

853
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,919
been a problem you know one of the

854
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,200
reasons why we've seen this this goes to

855
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:28,559
the question from I think it was Mr

856
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:30,200
Thompson right that um this question of

857
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,919
or actually sorry you had a question

858
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:34,200
about education your question about

859
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:36,440
wages kind of decoupling wages so on the

860
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:38,279
manufacturing side and this goes there's

861
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,720
a difference industry by industry but we

862
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:41,519
take manufacturing overall just

863
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:44,080
production workers the wages are the

864
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:46,480
pink line here that before about 1981

865
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:48,159
1982 that recession there was this very

866
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,120
positive equilibrium where wages were

867
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:51,840
going up technology adoption was going

868
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:53,440
up productivity was going up but then

869
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,679
something happened in the early 80s

870
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,880
where now adjusted for inflation in

871
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,799
manufacturing that pink line has been

872
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,480
pretty flat and and what's happened is

873
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:02,240
that that pink line was flat for a few

874
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,960
reasons one was downward pressure from

875
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,679
foreign competition so a lot of

876
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:07,080
manufacturers in you know Industries

877
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,840
like you know textiles some extent

878
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:10,320
Metals said this is a race to the bottom

879
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:12,240
the way that we compete we need to keep

880
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,120
our costs low we can't give ra raises to

881
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,200
our workers there's also this move this

882
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:17,240
Geographic move where a lot of

883
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,760
manufacturing is moving south lower

884
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,799
partly attracted by lower wages in the

885
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:22,320
South so that's another downward

886
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:24,720
pressure but even in Auto for example

887
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,720
the this came up during the auto strike

888
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,440
um you know a couple years ago that auto

889
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:31,640
workers wages spite having a union they

890
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,360
they've been flat for the um for about

891
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,919
the last 20 years and their productivity

892
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:37,080
has been flat so I think even more

893
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:38,919
concerning about the wages here is that

894
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:40,760
productivity and this is I'll take you

895
00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:43,279
the green line right here has been

896
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:45,080
declining since 2010 so overall

897
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:46,559
manufacturing is not just short of

898
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:49,080
workers it's not becoming more

899
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:51,360
productive um one thing to attribute to

900
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:53,080
that is this red line that technology

901
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:55,399
adoption has been flat goes to your

902
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:57,080
question about tech why is uh American

903
00:30:55,399 --> 00:30:58,880
Technology adoption kind of fallen

904
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:00,279
behind other countries this is showing

905
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,360
that it's not just about robotss it's

906
00:31:00,279 --> 00:31:03,760
about overall Capital expenditures have

907
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:07,000
been flat when adjusted for inflation

908
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:09,080
since about 2000 okay just to to break

909
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,200
it down a little more I think it's

910
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,919
important that when we talk about

911
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,960
technology adoption being flat here's

912
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:15,840
some uh kind of summary statistics of

913
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,679
how manufacturers how many manufacturers

914
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,799
have adopted VAR pretty basic

915
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:21,120
Technologies of of modern industry it's

916
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:22,639
also that when you don't have the

917
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:25,120
Technologies you're not going to hire

918
00:31:22,639 --> 00:31:27,200
workers who have advanced technical

919
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,519
skills so fewer than one in five

920
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,480
production jobs

921
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:32,240
have any digital skill requirements at

922
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,039
all that ranges from you know

923
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,720
understanding machine learning

924
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:37,159
algorithms to just operating Excel that

925
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:39,039
they they don't they don't require those

926
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:42,519
skills this is consistent with the hire

927
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:45,000
for will train for skill Paradigm now

928
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:46,519
you know we talked about flat wages I

929
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,600
want to put you in kind of the position

930
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:50,720
of Sam Seer again that when he's looking

931
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:53,320
at a job in manufacturing if he were

932
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:56,000
looking at that job in 1960 coming out

933
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:57,240
of high school he could make 40% more in

934
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,799
manufacturing than he could make in

935
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,279
alternative IND alternative Industries

936
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:02,360
like going to work at Target or going to

937
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:04,600
work Target didn't exist but um going to

938
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:07,039
work at another um in another field

939
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:09,240
today he makes about 2% more in

940
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:11,200
manufacturing than than any other um

941
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,919
industry on average in Massachusetts he

942
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,760
would make negative on average in

943
00:32:12,919 --> 00:32:16,440
manufacturing versus other Industries in

944
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:18,120
Texas it's a little bit more so in Texas

945
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:20,120
he'd make about 10% more on average in

946
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:22,760
manufacturing than other industries that

947
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:24,159
includes um oil and gas folks without a

948
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,519
without a college degree but you could

949
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:27,960
look at kind of these these big markets

950
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:30,080
like California Illinois Massachusetts

951
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,840
in Florida you make less on average in

952
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,120
manufacturing than you do in other

953
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,240
Industries so that negative

954
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:38,279
manufacturing wage premium is a huge

955
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:40,000
problem if manufacturers hope to recruit

956
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:41,760
more workers it can no longer be a race

957
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,200
to the bottom to recruit workers it

958
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,600
needs to be creating better jobs while

959
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,519
adopting new technology becoming more

960
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:50,679
productive okay so this wage problem is

961
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:52,200
huge now Liz mentioned this the idea of

962
00:32:50,679 --> 00:32:54,399
uh recruiting new workers isn't just a

963
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:56,120
growth in factories it's also um what I

964
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:58,399
think of as a retirement bomb that is

965
00:32:56,120 --> 00:33:00,279
like slowly ticking and about to

966
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:02,600
here is kind of the a nice illustration

967
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:04,639
of the the retirement bomb in the cliff

968
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:06,880
um I was you know I was plotting this

969
00:33:04,639 --> 00:33:08,519
for uh for a journalist doing a a story

970
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,679
on the Aerospace and I was a little bit

971
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:11,559
shocked by how dramatic this was I

972
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:13,200
didn't I didn't think it was going to be

973
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:15,399
so dramatic so here's just an age

974
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:18,519
distribution of manufacturing workers in

975
00:33:15,399 --> 00:33:22,080
2000 versus 2021 2022 now what this

976
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:23,960
shows is in 2000 before the real

977
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,679
collapse of American manufacturing

978
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,960
employment manufacturing look like a

979
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,480
pretty healthy industry pretty normally

980
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:31,600
distributed um age you have most of your

981
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:33,639
workers are in their you know late 30s

982
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,960
early 40s and then you have a good crop

983
00:33:33,639 --> 00:33:37,840
of young workers and then some older

984
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:40,760
workers that are are retiring but now

985
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:42,080
what you see is the vast majority of the

986
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,760
or the the really the plurality of

987
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,159
manufacturing workers are nearing

988
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,440
retirement so that's when when we think

989
00:33:45,159 --> 00:33:48,440
about the retirement Cliff retirement

990
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:50,240
bomb whatever you want to call it that's

991
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:51,559
the workers that it's not just the

992
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,120
number of the people but it's all the

993
00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:54,840
knowledge that they possess about

994
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:57,080
manufacturing operations the expertise

995
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:59,679
they have that needs to be translated

996
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:02,519
now this little blip in hiring of young

997
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:04,720
people is I think encouraging it means

998
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:06,679
that there there is now uh something of

999
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:09,399
a population that can inherit that

1000
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:11,720
knowledge but really what we want to see

1001
00:34:09,399 --> 00:34:14,839
to absorb the retirement of this of this

1002
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:16,440
group is a much bigger peak in the in

1003
00:34:14,839 --> 00:34:18,639
the 20s and 30s of of workers in

1004
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:20,800
manufacturing so this is just like I

1005
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,480
should be keeping you know National

1006
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,760
leadership up at night because this just

1007
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:27,560
is not a recipe to compete um you might

1008
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:30,599
have heard uh Paul mer luuy who is the

1009
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:32,399
uh founder of andril a new large defense

1010
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:33,800
manufacturer you might disagree with

1011
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:36,720
Palmer lucky on a lot of things but one

1012
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:38,560
of the things that he points out is that

1013
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:41,280
because there are a lot of single Source

1014
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:42,800
defense contractors with uh experts in

1015
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,440
this category in their late 60s who are

1016
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,839
retiring they now have to call experts

1017
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,240
out of retirement because they're the

1018
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:51,159
only ones who know how to operate

1019
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:53,240
certain machines or produce um or or

1020
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:55,879
produce certain items so it feels like

1021
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:57,320
we have a lot of um you know old

1022
00:34:55,879 --> 00:34:59,079
machinists and tool and die makers that

1023
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:00,839
might be treated like uh NFL

1024
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:02,800
quarterbacks being paid you know a

1025
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:04,720
million dollars to come in and do

1026
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,960
something that only they or you know a

1027
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:09,119
dozen people like them can can do to

1028
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:12,400
support um the national

1029
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:14,480
interest all right so now I want I I

1030
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,920
want to give a little bit of of Hope and

1031
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,920
I I think optimism because there are a

1032
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,240
lot of very smart people like like Liz

1033
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,760
and others who have worked on policies

1034
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:23,960
to support industrial revitalization and

1035
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:26,640
Prett support on on the workforce side

1036
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:28,240
so here's someone and and I mentioned

1037
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,119
Sam Seer before we did a short

1038
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,560
documentary on him and hypertherm which

1039
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:33,000
uh I I'm happy to share if if you're

1040
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,839
interested in learning more about how

1041
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,800
they operate and we've also done a short

1042
00:35:34,839 --> 00:35:38,960
documentary on uh this guy named Colin

1043
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,880
Cutz who uh runs a small manufacturing

1044
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:43,480
shop in Ohio and what Colin has done and

1045
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,560
I think he he's tried to become an

1046
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:47,560
evangelist for this this sort of

1047
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:49,079
activity is he's essentially said we

1048
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,880
just need to create a better sort of

1049
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:52,160
manufacturing job he's realized that

1050
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,680
this race to the bottom isn't going to

1051
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,720
work he's also realized that new

1052
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,240
technology is necessary so what he's

1053
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:59,160
done is he's automated every piece of

1054
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:01,520
equipment in his shop and he's really

1055
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:03,240
started his machinists at $30 an hour

1056
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:05,400
which is about double the median wage

1057
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:07,079
for machinists in Ohio and he showed

1058
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,119
that this model can be profitable he's

1059
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:11,359
tripled in size over the last six or

1060
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:13,440
seven years a lot of that relies on him

1061
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:15,480
having some software expertise and being

1062
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,240
able to take the risk to integrate new

1063
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,920
software and to take on jobs that he

1064
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:20,599
doesn't necessarily know will be

1065
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:22,560
profitable at the outset so he's taken a

1066
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:25,319
lot of risks to get there but part of

1067
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:26,760
what he's done in Ohio is now develop a

1068
00:36:25,319 --> 00:36:29,000
collective really start to lead a

1069
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:31,079
collective of uh like-minded

1070
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,200
manufacturing firms that are pooling

1071
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:34,800
their resources to start train the next

1072
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,839
generation of machinists to enter into

1073
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,920
these higher wage jobs so this is what

1074
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:40,359
he's demonstrated that this High wage

1075
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:42,440
high technology equilibrium for

1076
00:36:40,359 --> 00:36:43,359
manufacturing can exist and I I think

1077
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:46,319
it's really the only way for

1078
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:48,440
manufacturers to compete um another real

1079
00:36:46,319 --> 00:36:49,960
benefit which I think is a testament to

1080
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:51,359
some of the policies that that Liz

1081
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,839
talked about is there's been an

1082
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:54,560
extraordinary growth in foreign direct

1083
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:56,560
investment why is foreign direct

1084
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:58,520
investment important so just to you know

1085
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,720
underline it like in the three years

1086
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:03,280
before covid there were only about 12

1087
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:05,680
billion uh Factory projects that tripled

1088
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,880
and then overall since about 2010 you've

1089
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,240
seen more than a a doubling of foreign

1090
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:11,000
direct investment while overall

1091
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:13,280
investment manufacturing has been pretty

1092
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:17,119
flat so foreign direct investment is is

1093
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:19,160
huge about 40% of new large American uh

1094
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:20,319
manufacturing projects are foreign owned

1095
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:22,240
um you might think of that that as

1096
00:37:20,319 --> 00:37:24,280
concerning for maybe national security

1097
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:26,520
reasons or others but actually it's it's

1098
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:28,920
quite a good thing for workers cuz when

1099
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:32,040
uh foreign companies invest in in the US

1100
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:33,720
they typically not only hire uh you know

1101
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:35,319
they hire people at higher wages they

1102
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:37,400
also invest more in new technology and

1103
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:39,800
they're more productive and that that

1104
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:41,359
productivity gain isn't just for the for

1105
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,720
forone factories themselves when they

1106
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,040
have American suppliers their

1107
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,640
productivity spills over to their

1108
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:48,040
American suppliers you might think of

1109
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:49,440
that as like when Toyota moved in and um

1110
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,880
helped their suppliers adopt lean

1111
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:55,000
practices that was a benefit for their

1112
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:56,680
suppliers as well okay um I'm going to

1113
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,560
end with with a little you know just

1114
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:01,480
another piece of kind of good optimistic

1115
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:04,119
news this is um on the on the left this

1116
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:06,160
is a woman named Kathy Walker who is is

1117
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:08,480
from Kentucky and she works in Eastern

1118
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:10,920
Kentucky in in Appalachia and next to

1119
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:13,560
her is the founder of of hos one of the

1120
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:16,640
largest American Machining companies um

1121
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:18,880
jeanos who has started a a network of

1122
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:20,319
training institutes um kind of like

1123
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,480
hyper thms but not linked to any one

1124
00:38:20,319 --> 00:38:24,079
company to train the next generation of

1125
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,280
machinists he I think part of the

1126
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:27,240
interest is he wants them to know how to

1127
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:30,160
use hos equipment but it's actually a

1128
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:33,160
very very uh beneficial system and and

1129
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:35,880
they partnered about 5 years ago to set

1130
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:37,440
up one of these institutes in uh in

1131
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:39,160
Appalachia in Eastern Kentucky where

1132
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,280
there's really no manufacturing to speak

1133
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:42,800
of and what was really interesting is it

1134
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,280
was it was kind of a bold move because

1135
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,599
normally they do this next to employers

1136
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:49,280
who are ready to hire the workers out of

1137
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:52,040
the system but you know Cathy had seen

1138
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:54,280
this this community really fall apart in

1139
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:56,040
the opioid crisis with the closure of

1140
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,760
coal mines but what she knew was that a

1141
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:59,599
lot of these workers who were under

1142
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,119
underestimated their whole lives had a

1143
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:02,520
lot of mechanical skills they had a lot

1144
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:04,359
of latent mechanical skills and they

1145
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:06,839
wanted to work if given the opportunity

1146
00:39:04,359 --> 00:39:08,079
they fixed their own cars they they did

1147
00:39:06,839 --> 00:39:10,599
they developed a lot of these skills out

1148
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:13,520
of necessity so what she did was she

1149
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:15,040
hired um someone who who's ex-military

1150
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,160
this is one of the head trainers who

1151
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,359
just came out of the military he was

1152
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,160
actually a prison guard after the

1153
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:21,200
military and they set up what was

1154
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:23,760
essentially like a military boot camp

1155
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:26,119
for manufacturing Machining it was heavy

1156
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:29,640
on discipline and professionalization

1157
00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:31,040
and it was also teaching the the folks

1158
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,000
many of whom were former coal miners

1159
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,119
some of them whom were formerly

1160
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,040
incarcerated to to apply their

1161
00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:38,440
mechanical skills to specific jobs that

1162
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:40,280
they need as machinists and now they

1163
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:42,560
have you know 100% placement rate for

1164
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:44,960
their graduates and jobs and they won't

1165
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:47,720
uh take any employers to recruit from

1166
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,200
their graduates who offer less than $25

1167
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:51,079
an hour which is really kind of a

1168
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:53,359
transformative wage for a lot of these

1169
00:39:51,079 --> 00:39:55,960
workers and much higher than the typical

1170
00:39:53,359 --> 00:40:00,000
wage in in Kentucky so this has been

1171
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:02,240
really kind of a a a a beacon of and a

1172
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,880
model for a lot of manufacturing

1173
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:06,160
education particularly in the South and

1174
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,240
the big question is like how would you

1175
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:10,040
set up the organization called eami the

1176
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:12,880
Eastern Kentucky Advanced manufacturing

1177
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:14,280
Institute um and and they have a lot of

1178
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,200
public officials come through and wonder

1179
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:17,720
like how do we get an eami on every

1180
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,760
corner or in every manufacturing

1181
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:21,720
Community how would we replicate this

1182
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,960
and I think we don't have a good model

1183
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:25,480
for this right now to scale up a really

1184
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,839
uh Strong high performing training

1185
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:29,119
institute but we do have one from

1186
00:40:26,839 --> 00:40:31,640
history so just to end I'm going to give

1187
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:35,079
you the story of what we did um as a

1188
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:38,079
country in the early 1940s right before

1189
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:41,040
um even before we went into World War II

1190
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:42,640
that in the previous um in the previous

1191
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,400
World War I we actually really struggled

1192
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:46,760
to mobilize our industrial base and we

1193
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:50,040
struggled um to train workers we only

1194
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:51,880
trained um about 30,000 workers during

1195
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:54,560
um during World War I and then there was

1196
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:55,880
a concerted effort partly motivated by

1197
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:58,960
former Auto

1198
00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:00,760
Executives um that went into uh into

1199
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,520
public service to to mobilize the

1200
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:05,079
industrial base and partly motivated by

1201
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:06,720
Sydney Hillman who was a labor leader

1202
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:09,280
and led the unions and got the unions on

1203
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:10,720
board to participate in um in the

1204
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:13,800
mobilization of workers and what they

1205
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:16,040
did was they set up essentially a field

1206
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:18,920
uh network of hundreds and hundreds of

1207
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:20,800
people who went to every you know high

1208
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:23,000
school that had a shop every Community

1209
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,599
College every college and they gave them

1210
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,800
the resources to train more and more

1211
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:28,880
workers as well as they had these huge

1212
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,599
public campaigns to get tens of

1213
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,640
thousands of workers into these

1214
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:34,359
facilities across the country every week

1215
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,119
and it was a guarantee that these

1216
00:41:34,359 --> 00:41:38,440
workers would have jobs at relatively

1217
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:40,680
High wages and they produced in in a

1218
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:42,800
matter of about 18 months to two years

1219
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:44,160
more than three million workers um if we

1220
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,280
did this today even though we have a

1221
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:48,119
much larger population um we could

1222
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:50,800
mobilize in relatively short order of

1223
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:51,920
the workers we needed to um to fill many

1224
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,599
of the gaps that we have in

1225
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,560
manufacturing and to to staff all the

1226
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:57,240
factories that are coming online so it's

1227
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:59,240
it's possible but it really needs some

1228
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:01,319
kind of national effort and National

1229
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:03,520
commitment from folks like Hilman who

1230
00:42:01,319 --> 00:42:06,119
were in labor as well as folks uh in

1231
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:07,760
manufacturing like uh Walter nudson who

1232
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:08,880
who led the war production board so I

1233
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,839
think there's there's historical

1234
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,720
precedent I think there's a lot of

1235
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:13,839
energy today and I'm I'm hopeful that um

1236
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:17,270
the future of work at least in this

1237
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:21,119
sense will be bright um thank you very

1238
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:24,280
[Applause]

1239
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:26,480
much question raise your hand if you

1240
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:28,160
have a question we have one over here

1241
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:31,319
got it

1242
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:34,160
thank you uh my name is Matthew Safi I'm

1243
00:42:31,319 --> 00:42:37,839
a strategy manager uh in area of cloud

1244
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:41,720
Ai and Manufacturing for dasol system so

1245
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:44,920
um I was really U impressed with the the

1246
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:48,160
slide that you had U unemployment

1247
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:52,160
productivity um and

1248
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:54,119
wages okay yes so uh what I was trying

1249
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:56,960
to understand here is what happened in

1250
00:42:54,119 --> 00:43:00,000
1980 and I try to imagine what project

1251
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:03,480
what going to happen in future so the

1252
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:07,200
Tipping Point in 980 was that um we had

1253
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:10,280
high high interest rate we had oil

1254
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:12,160
crisis we had increase in

1255
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:15,079
Automation and we have dere

1256
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:18,680
regularization uh and also we have

1257
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:20,760
increase in decentralization or Global

1258
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:23,000
globalization this is actually a real

1259
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:25,119
match with what we are right now so we

1260
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,160
have increased in automation because of

1261
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:28,559
the AI and everything else is the same

1262
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:33,280
High interest rate and everything else

1263
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:35,760
checks out so what I see is that we're

1264
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,280
going to have the same Trend declining

1265
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:40,359
uh Trend in

1266
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:42,599
wages increase in productivity and

1267
00:43:40,359 --> 00:43:45,599
decrease in uh

1268
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:47,280
unemployment increasing unemployment So

1269
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:48,720
based on the factor that I mentioned

1270
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:51,280
what do you think do you think is it

1271
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:52,640
what we're heading to no I I I diagnos

1272
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,800
the problem in the early ' 80s quite

1273
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:57,280
differently um I think part of this is

1274
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:59,559
driven by the the collapse or loss in

1275
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:01,119
competitiveness of a few us Industries

1276
00:43:59,559 --> 00:44:04,680
um that was kind of a mounting problem

1277
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:07,880
in the 1970s and then really kind of um

1278
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:09,200
was exacerbated in the 1981 1982

1279
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:10,680
recession which was quite acute in

1280
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:12,599
places like Pitts so the two industries

1281
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:15,119
were metals and Automotive um Automotive

1282
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:16,960
losing a lot of competitiv to Japan

1283
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:19,480
um and metals particularly steel doing

1284
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:21,440
the same so you see in like 1981 1982

1285
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:23,480
Pittsburgh just loses its industrial

1286
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:25,599
base in a matter of of two years

1287
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:27,800
unemployment 18% right really

1288
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:29,920
extraordinary uh hits similarly with

1289
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:32,920
Automotive that Detroit goes through the

1290
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:35,359
the biggest crisis until like 2009 2010

1291
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:37,559
so that's really the the early part of

1292
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:39,640
the Cascade of of loss of manufacturing

1293
00:44:37,559 --> 00:44:41,520
competitiveness that leads to a much

1294
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:43,760
more conservative mindset for

1295
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:45,319
manufacturers a second factor which I

1296
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,359
think is related a little bit to kind of

1297
00:44:45,319 --> 00:44:48,680
the interest rate environment that you

1298
00:44:46,359 --> 00:44:51,599
mentioned is that the public markets in

1299
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:54,720
the US start to be a lot more focused on

1300
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:56,280
Pure Play companies not these old school

1301
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,280
manufacturing conglomerates so they

1302
00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:01,640
encourage a lot of of the breaking off

1303
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:03,280
of different um different parts of

1304
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:05,640
manufacturing Enterprises and they're

1305
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:08,480
less likely to support the the stock the

1306
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:10,839
growth of the stocks of um you know of

1307
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:13,400
of the um traditional asset heavy

1308
00:45:10,839 --> 00:45:15,359
companies so this is I think consistent

1309
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:18,160
with the rise of private Equity buyouts

1310
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:19,920
of manufacturers in the 1980s um that's

1311
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:22,160
like why you see just a much more

1312
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:24,480
conservative pattern of behavior not

1313
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:26,480
just on kind of worker wages but also on

1314
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,559
Capital expenditures so I I look at it a

1315
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:30,119
little bit different and why

1316
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:31,520
manufacturing stop competing also today

1317
00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:34,079
you mentioned generative AI the

1318
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:36,640
automating leading to less unemployment

1319
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:38,480
I I don't see that is a an issue in the

1320
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:40,079
short to medium term maybe long term

1321
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:42,319
maybe I don't have enough imagination

1322
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:44,599
but right now you see a very tight labor

1323
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:47,720
market and you see you know uh below

1324
00:45:44,599 --> 00:45:50,000
replacement rate um you know uh you

1325
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:53,280
population growth so I I don't think we

1326
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:55,079
have an environment for um you know a

1327
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,520
loose labor market in in the near term

1328
00:45:55,079 --> 00:45:58,160
there might be cyclical stuff like we

1329
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:59,640
see in the last quarter of contraction

1330
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:04,440
of manufacturing but I don't think

1331
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:04,440
that's a long-term issue okay one more

1332
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:13,160
question hi Will Fraser unique Ventures

1333
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,800
I I noticed you chose hypertherm as one

1334
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:16,640
of your examples that's a Dartmouth they

1335
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,760
School of Engineering spin-off and I'm

1336
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:20,440
at Dartmouth as well as an MIT Alum so

1337
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:23,119
do you see different patterns with

1338
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:25,119
University spin-offs and with startups

1339
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:27,400
in terms of adoption of Technology some

1340
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:29,480
of the uh wage and growth grow patterns

1341
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:31,400
and things like that that would be uh

1342
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:33,520
indicative of of maybe some positive

1343
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:36,079
directions

1344
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:37,200
there yes I'm going to give a I have a

1345
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:38,480
much longer answer than I think I'm

1346
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:40,240
going to be allowed to give so I'm happy

1347
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:42,319
to talk to you more about this after so

1348
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:45,880
yes my wife went to Dartmouth as well um

1349
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:48,359
and and it's it's great up there um so I

1350
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:51,079
think there are a few re so so this what

1351
00:46:48,359 --> 00:46:53,520
I'm really concerned about is the

1352
00:46:51,079 --> 00:46:55,240
essentially the conservatism of

1353
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:57,119
manufacturing Enterprises and I think

1354
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:58,440
the the financial environment for those

1355
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:00,240
Enterprises one of the reasons for

1356
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:01,680
conservatism that if you're a small

1357
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:04,319
family held business you're not going to

1358
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:05,800
risk the family farm on your your growth

1359
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:07,160
pattern um if you're bought by private

1360
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:09,079
Equity there's a short-term incentive to

1361
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:10,000
try to capture um Returns on the

1362
00:47:09,079 --> 00:47:11,359
business and then if you're in the

1363
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,000
public markets there's an incentive to

1364
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:16,520
Offshore and to reduce assets so none of

1365
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,640
that is a recipe for long-term growth of

1366
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:20,680
American industrial base now what I'm

1367
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:23,000
doing right now is trying to study

1368
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:25,559
alternative mechanisms for doing that I

1369
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,920
think there are three so one alternative

1370
00:47:25,559 --> 00:47:29,800
mechanism is what danaher has

1371
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:32,400
Illustrated over time like a more

1372
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:34,079
traditional Diversified conglomerate

1373
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,400
model where it's a private you know

1374
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:37,240
Daner is not public held but you could

1375
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:38,960
have a privately held version of this

1376
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:41,359
which is a holding company for the long

1377
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:43,240
term that's sharing expertise across

1378
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:45,520
diverse manufacturing operation so

1379
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:47,240
rebuild manufacturing is a company that

1380
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:49,119
in part came out of MIT has a lot of MIT

1381
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:51,400
alums didn't really come out of MIT but

1382
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:52,880
is I think an exciting model of what

1383
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:54,960
this what's possible there and they're

1384
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:57,559
still early but I'm following their

1385
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:59,359
course the second model is Venture

1386
00:47:57,559 --> 00:48:01,480
Capital based so we've seen much more

1387
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:03,280
Venture not a ton but much more Venture

1388
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:05,280
going into manufacturing startups a lot

1389
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:07,280
of them focus on uh start with new some

1390
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:10,800
new technology that might be you know a

1391
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:13,000
stepwise Improvement in productivity but

1392
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:15,040
um I I think there it's a super mixed

1393
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:18,760
bag as it is for a lot of venture but I

1394
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:21,359
do think that um the the what encourages

1395
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:23,800
me is that a lot of the folks who were

1396
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:25,599
at Tesla or SpaceX and saw step-wise

1397
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:27,520
changes in manufacturing processes are

1398
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,760
now partly because they've been turned

1399
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,920
off by the management strategies of

1400
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:32,839
those companies leaving to start their

1401
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:34,839
own manufacturing Enterprises that are

1402
00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:36,800
applying those that knowledge in other

1403
00:48:34,839 --> 00:48:38,680
areas you'll probably recall like in in

1404
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,520
semiconductor early on with Fairchild

1405
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:42,520
semiconductor William Shockley he was an

1406
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:44,000
Elon Musk type character who turned off

1407
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:45,480
the very smart people around him and

1408
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,800
then they called them the trader 8 that

1409
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:49,920
went on and started you know Intel and

1410
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:51,240
and um and and other various important

1411
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,440
semic companies so I think we could be

1412
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:56,520
getting something like that with Tesla

1413
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:58,480
and SpaceX spin-offs the third is you

1414
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:59,960
know Li mentioned this a little bit is

1415
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:01,440
this is a huge problem for the

1416
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:03,680
Department of Defense and the Department

1417
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:05,319
of Defense realizes that if they scale

1418
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:07,559
up confli if they're in a scaled up

1419
00:49:05,319 --> 00:49:09,280
conflict we have about nine months of

1420
00:49:07,559 --> 00:49:11,200
you know of War material with our

1421
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:13,240
current industrial base that's not a

1422
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:17,520
good strategy to have it's not not good

1423
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:19,520
to be um so so dependent and beholden um

1424
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:21,640
without internal capability so so the

1425
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:22,839
question is like what are the mechanisms

1426
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:24,920
that the department of could get

1427
00:49:22,839 --> 00:49:26,359
insurance in that sort of situation so

1428
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:28,280
they don't have to invest a ton right

1429
00:49:26,359 --> 00:49:29,520
now building up capacity but they know

1430
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:30,559
they could scale up quickly the only

1431
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,960
reason we could scale up quickly in the

1432
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:34,319
40s was because we already had so much

1433
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:36,319
so many industries that were exporting

1434
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:38,319
that we can then rely on for for the war

1435
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:40,000
so one option that that I find really

1436
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:41,599
interesting but is is very half-baked at

1437
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,079
the moment is buying options for

1438
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:46,960
manufacturing uh capacity so you could

1439
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:48,599
essentially buy an option from the dod

1440
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,160
could buy an option to scale up their

1441
00:49:48,599 --> 00:49:52,920
contract and they would need to you

1442
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:54,960
could as a factory um have build up the

1443
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:56,880
capacity that you could prove I would be

1444
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:59,119
able to scale up in the instance of

1445
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:01,319
crisis and that would give you some some

1446
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:03,119
risk Capital to invest in other things

1447
00:50:01,319 --> 00:50:04,520
from the look on your face you're I

1448
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:06,880
think correct that it's a half-baked

1449
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:09,440
idea but this is something that is um

1450
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:11,240
intg IDE it's an it's an intriguing it's

1451
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:13,200
it's it's wild right it's a very

1452
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:14,960
different it's a very different idea of

1453
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,599
how it's been done before but I do think

1454
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:18,200
the the problem is so severe that you

1455
00:50:16,599 --> 00:50:20,160
need to you know cons at least consider

1456
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:22,220
