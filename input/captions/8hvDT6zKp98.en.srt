1
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:17,600
We are trying to make our way through

2
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,359
these four as yet intractable dilemmas.

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,960
Um the last time we met we talked about

4
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,199
the curse of the familiar, the edtech

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,039
Matthew effect. Um today we're going to

6
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,680
be looking at the trap of routine

7
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:30,240
assessment. Um the anybody want to try

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,559
to articulate the sort of the the core

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:36,520
puzzle that's at the that's at the heart

10
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:36,520
of the trap of routine assessment.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,399
What do you got Dana? um kind of along

12
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:51,039
the lines of, you know, teachers are

13
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:53,920
teaching students a subject and they um

14
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,920
schools have like such an emphasis on

15
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,000
like final exams and what they're

16
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,840
preparing for these standardized tests.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,160
Um but we're also fighting with the idea

18
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,840
of like what a computer can grade. So if

19
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,680
you're trying to standardize some sort

20
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,920
of way of grading something, you can

21
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,080
only really focus on teaching students

22
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,799
things that computers can do. But if a

23
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,320
computer can already do it, then why why

24
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,760
is that the emphasis of what we're

25
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,360
teaching students? So, it's kind of the

26
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,119
idea that like if you look at the ven

27
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,000
diagram, there's like this whole other

28
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:25,280
half of the subject that ultimately we

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,200
probably should be focusing on. Um, but

30
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,360
we are really only talking about that

31
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,439
overlapping aspect of what students were

32
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,680
saying should learn because we can

33
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,520
assess it. Good that that that the

34
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,439
technologies we have for assessment sort

35
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,799
of constrain what it is that we can

36
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,159
assess at any kind of scale. Anybody

37
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,960
want to add what what else seems

38
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:45,960
important to Dana's um initial offering

39
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,960
there?

40
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,040
I think something you brought up in the

41
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,560
reading as well is that there's like a

42
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,759
connection to the labor markets, right?

43
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,200
So schools are supposed to help us

44
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,560
prepare us for the labor market, but

45
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,159
we're learning these routine things that

46
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,439
are being taken over by automation. And

47
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,039
how is that actually doing what the

48
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,680
school is supposed to function for?

49
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:13,200
Okay, good. So, so, so schools operate

50
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,840
in in between a couple of different

51
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,480
things. One is like like what do we need

52
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,720
kids to do changes over time as we

53
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,640
develop new technologies. Um there's

54
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,480
some you know like like none of you

55
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,760
should teach your stu well I mean you

56
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,760
shouldn't teach your students to operate

57
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,360
a loom on the basis that will be a

58
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,720
source of gainful employment for them.

59
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,080
Although there probably are a small

60
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,840
number of people who are like very

61
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,000
profitable, you know, small business

62
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,200
loom operators and particular kind of

63
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,400
thing, but like generally speaking, like

64
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,920
not a good bet. Um uh and so, you know,

65
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,360
it makes sense that as technologies come

66
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,680
along, we change the kinds of things

67
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,640
that we teach to young people. Um and

68
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,599
and computers uh you know over the you

69
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,519
know in various ways once a decade over

70
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,599
the last 10 years like cause new kinds

71
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,920
of problems for us to as as computers

72
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,720
capacities expand what we think about

73
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:03,920
teaching people um changes at the same

74
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,280
time as computers technologies expand

75
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,319
there's maybe new or different kinds of

76
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,040
ways that we can use them for

77
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,800
assessment. Um and so those two things

78
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,959
are kind of interplaying with each other

79
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:16,319
uh all the time. Um any any We got some

80
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,239
seats up here. There's plenty plenty of

81
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:21,840
room. Kadus, nice to see you.

82
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:23,680
Um other other introductory things that

83
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,440
seem important, Omar. Yeah, that's like

84
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,800
that's not to say that and you mentioned

85
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,879
this in in the reading. Um like we're

86
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,239
not trying to say don't teach like time

87
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:35,040
tables and stuff like that where it's

88
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,720
like stuff that's uh yes, computers can

89
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,879
assess that, but stuff that students

90
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,720
need fundamentally to build on for other

91
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,959
more complex tasks that they will learn

92
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,519
now more. Good. that makes this even the

93
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,280
the whole conversation even more

94
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:49,360
complicated because there's stuff that

95
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,519
we need people to be able to do in their

96
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,000
lives. We there also might be a class of

97
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,640
things that's called like stuff that you

98
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,799
need to learn in order to be able to do

99
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,319
those complex things like even though

100
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,840
computers can do those simpler things

101
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,280
there. So there's there's some class

102
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,720
there's some class of things that

103
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,959
computers can do that we just don't need

104
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,319
humans to ever do anymore. Um, I think I

105
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,239
joked with you all that one of the first

106
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,640
times I talked with my students at MIT

107
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,799
about large language models, somebody

108
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,799
said, uh, I'm using large language

109
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,120
models to do the latte formatting of our

110
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,720
of my papers. It's like great. Never

111
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,079
think about that again. Like if no

112
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,520
student ever thinks about that again for

113
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,240
the rest of their lives, we're probably

114
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,000
fine as a civilization. Um, but like

115
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,360
single different single digit

116
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,800
multiplication is not like that.

117
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,960
Singledigit multiplication can be

118
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,240
trivially done by computers, but it's

119
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,000
actually quite important for human

120
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,000
beings to learn. So there's sort of some

121
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,120
complexity in those kinds of things.

122
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,080
Um, anything else that people want to

123
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:47,600
add to just the like the initial framing

124
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,440
of the trap of routine assessment?

125
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,440
I guess just to add on even more, there

126
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,840
is this aspect that our society values

127
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,759
these routine assessments. Um, so that

128
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,479
like even though you're trying to change

129
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,560
this and branch out and expand what we

130
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,560
teach students, they're still always

131
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,080
constrained by the market itself. Um,

132
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,360
and ultimately like teachers have to

133
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,120
fight against that and let your own

134
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,120
independent wishes. So as much as we

135
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,600
think, you know, you can just do it, you

136
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,639
can't actually. Good. So, so I mean I

137
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,400
think you could go to almost any

138
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:18,240
educator and say something along the

139
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:20,320
lines of like are standardized tests a

140
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,680
good mechanism for capturing all of the

141
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,520
important things that students should

142
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,199
know. And the answer is like clearly

143
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,360
not. There's almost no educator in the

144
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,840
world who believes that to be the case.

145
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,120
Um there's more debate over the question

146
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,720
of do standardized tests capture some of

147
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,759
the important things that we want

148
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,759
students to know. Um how and then and

149
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,360
then a sort of follow-on problem that

150
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,039
there's then this class of stuff which

151
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,400
is like pretty important for students to

152
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,720
know but we're not very good at

153
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,800
assessing. Um, and it's hard to

154
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,880
prioritize those things in education

155
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,880
systems because it's hard to reward

156
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,320
students and reward educators for

157
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,240
teaching things that we don't know how

158
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,479
to measure um or don't know how to

159
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,400
measure in some kind of systemic way. We

160
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:03,280
don't know how to how to measure with

161
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,360
the kind of of of fairness that we would

162
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,360
want to use for high stakes assessments

163
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,120
for things like graduation exams or

164
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,199
college entrance exams or other kinds of

165
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,360
things like that. So the so all of these

166
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,440
are parts of systems that get wrestled

167
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,240
with every day by educators at all

168
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,479
different kinds of levels. Um in in in

169
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,440
the United States, teachers are are

170
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,800
unusually responsible for wrestling with

171
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,560
these issues because we don't have

172
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,000
something like a national curriculum. We

173
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,840
don't even really have something like

174
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,560
national entry exams or something like

175
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,479
that. Um where you know where like the

176
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,919
whole system kind of has to work

177
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,120
together to respond to some of these

178
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,759
things. Teachers in the United States

179
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,520
have sort of unusual discretion. um for

180
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,520
for thinking about these kinds of

181
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:47,280
challenges. Uh I thought the place that

182
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:50,560
I would start with you all um is uh a

183
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,880
little bit towards what Tai suggested um

184
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:56,720
and and we're probably going back um

185
00:06:52,880 --> 00:07:00,000
20-ish years to the last to one of the

186
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,720
last times computers really got

187
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,639
educators and labor economists quite

188
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,800
upset. Um, so we're in another one of

189
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,199
these moments right now with LLMs where

190
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,560
people are pretty stressed out like like

191
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,919
how is this going to change the labor

192
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,759
market? How is this going to change what

193
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,360
we expect of our students? How should

194
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,639
this change school systems and things

195
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,880
like that? And to me it's always helpful

196
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,199
to remember like oh we've done this

197
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,360
before you know like the introduction of

198
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,639
personal computers into most households

199
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,800
in the United States that was a big

200
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,319
deal. It was a big change in the capac

201
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,000
like the introduc introduction of

202
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,759
personal computers into workplaces that

203
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,759
was a big deal. the introduction of the

204
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,880
internet um you know broadband internet

205
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,880
connection in these spaces like that was

206
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:40,319
a big deal that that evoked all of these

207
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:43,520
questions in the past. Um and uh one of

208
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:46,080
the best summary pieces to read from for

209
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,800
probably what was like the sort of like

210
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:51,039
2015 summary from this debate is a paper

211
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,199
called dancing with robots um by two

212
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,039
economists. One who is here Frank Levy

213
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,440
um and another who was at Harvard who is

214
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,879
actually my adviser Richard Mine. Um,

215
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,280
this was based on another book they

216
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,599
wrote called The New Division of Labor.

217
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,280
Um, and the original research for the

218
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,360
new division of labor is like kind of

219
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,120
right when personal computers are really

220
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,960
starting to widely spread in workplaces

221
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,800
and people's homes and things like that.

222
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:16,879
Um, an early bet that economists made

223
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,240
was something like e one of the things

224
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,800
economists think about all the time is

225
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,400
like what do jobs require? And um

226
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,080
education economists then start thinking

227
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,520
about like okay what do jobs require and

228
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,840
how do you teach people the things that

229
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,479
the jobs that we actually have require

230
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,880
um that you know um computers are going

231
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,479
to complement highwage workers and

232
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,479
they're going to replace lowwage

233
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,959
workers. That was like a pretty early

234
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,519
bet that a bunch of economists had had.

235
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:42,880
Um and there was something about that to

236
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,120
Frank Levy and Richard Maneine that

237
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,880
didn't smell right. They were like h I

238
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,920
think it's going to end up being more

239
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:52,240
complicated than that.

240
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:55,120
Um so they thought a lot about the

241
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,120
specific kinds of things that people did

242
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,839
in jobs and how those jobs were

243
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:03,519
changing. Um how many of you have ever

244
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:05,320
checked in to get on a flight by talking

245
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,760
directly to a human

246
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:09,360
being? Okay. So it looks like people how

247
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,040
how many of you the majority of times

248
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,640
you get on a flight you check in with a

249
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:15,760
machine. Okay. So we so so look this

250
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,880
actually surprised I'm surprised that

251
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,800
almost everyone in the room who raised

252
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,240
their hand said that at least once. Um

253
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,720
you know when I first put together this

254
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,320
slide like 15 years ago something like

255
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,320
that like this was a pretty novel

256
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,160
experience. So you know when I when I

257
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,600
was in college you would you would not

258
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,279
interact with a machine at all to get

259
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,360
onto a flight. Um you would have like

260
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,800
called the airline or called a travel

261
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,160
agent to buy a ticket. You would have

262
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,279
like a physical ticket. You would take

263
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,440
that physical ticket. You would show it

264
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,959
to a human being. Um now the interesting

265
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,800
thing about those conversations with

266
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,720
human beings was that they were highly

267
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:48,240
standardized. They were highly routine.

268
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,080
So post 911 it would be uh you know like

269
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,680
who are you? This is my ID. Like where

270
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,800
are you going? This is my ticket. Do you

271
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,760
have a ticket? Yeah, this is my ticket.

272
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,680
Where are you going? This is where I'm

273
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,040
going. Um uh do you have any bags with

274
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,080
you? Yes. Did you pack your bags

275
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,000
yourself? Have they been in your

276
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:03,760
possession the whole time? Yes. Um and

277
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
then off you go. So the like over, you

278
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,160
know, the vast majority of times that a

279
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,080
person went to a ticketing agent to have

280
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,800
a conversation with them like highly

281
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,839
structured, highly routined, we know

282
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,279
what kinds of questions we're going to

283
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,800
get as passengers, we know what kind of

284
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,720
inputs we need, we have the the

285
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,720
conversation successfully, we move on.

286
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,160
Um, and so as computers, you know, as

287
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,760
computing technology becomes more

288
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,440
sophisticated, as user interface becomes

289
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,720
more sophisticated, as all these things

290
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,399
become less expensive, someone's like,

291
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,959
"Hey, we can just program those

292
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,959
conversations into a machine." Um, and

293
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,720
so now overwhelmingly you have that

294
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,240
exact same conversation. You just push

295
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,760
the buttons to say like, "Yes, I have a

296
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,959
ticket. Yes, this is me. Yes, my bags

297
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,519
have been in my possession the whole

298
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:43,200
time." Um,

299
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:45,680
however, there, you know, for as long as

300
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,880
we've had kiosks, there has always been

301
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:51,440
a number of cases in which the kiosks

302
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,440
can't respond to the demands of the

303
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,360
moment. Um, so there's something really

304
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,200
weird about your ticket. there's some

305
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,200
problem that's gone on with your booking

306
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,079
that the machine hasn't anticipated or

307
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,320
can't understand. Um, or you have some

308
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:06,320
kind of communication issue. Um, for

309
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,839
some reason a human being can't

310
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,000
communicate with the kiosk. Maybe their

311
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,079
glasses are broken that day. Maybe they

312
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,160
are like trying to travel, they don't

313
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,760
speak the language that the kiosk is in.

314
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,440
You know, they're like so angry at the

315
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,440
airline for what they've messed up they

316
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,720
just go banging on the kiosk. And then,

317
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,480
you know, so you got to think a lot like

318
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:26,240
there's one person behind this row of

319
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:28,320
kiosks whose um whose job it is to have

320
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,480
all the conversations that the kiosk

321
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,760
can't have. Um if you're a labor

322
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,279
economist, like that's a pretty

323
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,519
interesting question. Like what is that

324
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,920
human being doing that we couldn't

325
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,360
program into all of those machines? That

326
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,800
that was the kind of question that Frank

327
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,240
Levy and Richard Main were kind of

328
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,000
asking. Like like in a world where

329
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,920
there's lots of kind of work that we can

330
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
put on computers, what is it that humans

331
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,519
are still good at? um in economist term

332
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,519
like what is it that humans still have a

333
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:55,519
comparative advantage over computers

334
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,800
around um here is another funny example

335
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,240
of which I think I wrote about in the

336
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,079
book about how some of these things

337
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,519
change. Um so in something like

338
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:07,120
1987 my parents bought a cabin in

339
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:08,560
Vermont um which had an old boiler in it

340
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,839
um like a hot water heater that was

341
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:13,680
attached to a tank um and my mom passed

342
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:16,880
away. I inherited the house. So sometime

343
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,720
around 2007 um about 20 years later this

344
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,880
boiler dies and I'm responsible for it.

345
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,320
Um the original boiler was inst

346
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,560
installed by this guy named Dan

347
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,800
Mastersonson who lived on Masterson Lane

348
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,639
um in Bethl Vermont. Um and I was like

349
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,399
trying to find a plumber to replace this

350
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,519
hot water heater and the guy I found was

351
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,519
Dan Mastersonson who lived on

352
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,800
Mastersonson Lane in uh Bethl Vermont.

353
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,720
So a guy had been a plumber for 20

354
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,959
years. Um and we decided that instead of

355
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,560
doing an old school hot water boiler

356
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,720
we're going to install one of these uh

357
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,320
on demand systems. Um, so this is like a

358
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,839
very beautiful picture to me. Um,

359
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,440
because there's no hot water tank that

360
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,720
can freeze. Like it just like heats up

361
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,160
the water exactly when you need it. Like

362
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,680
you can see how nicely all these pipes

363
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,000
are. The last building had pipes all

364
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:56,000
over the place, things like that. Um, so

365
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,519
Dan installs this system. Dan, as you

366
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,480
can imagine, now is like getting towards

367
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:02,560
the end of his career as a plumber. Um,

368
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,000
and I say, "Great, Dan, like show me how

369
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,200
to use this system." He's like, "Well,

370
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,040
you walk in here and you open this

371
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,160
little door. Um, and when you look at

372
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:12,639
the system, it should say good."

373
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,880
I was like, "All right, Dan, what do I

374
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,079
do if it doesn't say good? You guys

375
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,920
can't see this?" Well, he's like, "See

376
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:20,399
this little button that says R? Push

377
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,360
that." Um, so that's the reset button. I

378
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,360
was like, "All right, I can push the

379
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,959
reset button." Like, "Well, what do I do

380
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,959
if that doesn't work?" He's like, "You

381
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:29,360
see this electrical outlet up here? Just

382
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:31,120
like unplug it and plug it back in." I

383
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,519
was like, "All right, I will recycle the

384
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,519
power in my hot water heater if that

385
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,440
doesn't work." And I was like, "Okay, so

386
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,639
it doesn't say good. I've hit R. I've

387
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,639
unplugged it. It's still not working.

388
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,240
Then what do I do?" He says, um, there's

389
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,959
one guy in the upper river valley of

390
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,480
Vermont who has flown to Scandinavia,

391
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,000
um, to get the training on how to

392
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,519
reprogram these systems. And so, if

393
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,200
those two things don't work, go find

394
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:55,680
that guy. Um, and I tried to imagine

395
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:58,399
like Dan Masterson probably in like

396
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,519
1970, 1975, something like that, like

397
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,160
going through his plumbing

398
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:04,320
apprenticeship training. Um, and like he

399
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,760
learned how to solder pipes together and

400
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,519
how to do some basic electrical stuff

401
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,160
and things like that. like if you like

402
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:12,000
if he went to the same training now like

403
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,079
you have to be an apprentice computer

404
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,000
programmer to be a plumber. And not only

405
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:20,320
that, um the systems are designed to

406
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,240
solve all of the easy problems. Like if

407
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,320
a problem is easy, it'll just like solve

408
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,920
it itself on reboot. The things that you

409
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,320
have to be able to solve as a computer

410
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,760
programming plumber are the the

411
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,120
illststructured problems like when the

412
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,199
system can't figure out what's wrong

413
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,959
with itself and can't correct itself. Um

414
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:36,720
and those kinds of things. So, so not

415
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,320
all I mean the reason I'm trying to

416
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,639
bring these two cases to your attention

417
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,720
is we could say all right um there are

418
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,880
some classes of jobs that are going to

419
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,639
disappear and be replaced by computers

420
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,760
like there used to be I mean the other

421
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,680
thing about these people if you're just

422
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,519
think about this in a broader social you

423
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,760
know there used to be six people behind

424
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,880
this desk um and they wore uniforms

425
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,399
maybe they had a college degree maybe

426
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,320
they had associates degree they probably

427
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,760
made a middle class living like you like

428
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,680
you could make a decent living as a

429
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,320
person who checked people into airlines

430
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,560
and most of those jobs are gone Um and

431
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,279
even in places where jobs remained

432
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,360
they're being transformed by you know

433
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:14,160
what the capacities computer offer in

434
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:17,199
these systems. Um so one of the cool

435
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:19,920
things about the research in uh the new

436
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:22,160
division of labor is that they basically

437
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:25,279
go the department of labor collects all

438
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:27,760
of these uh uh names of jobs and the

439
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:29,680
description of jobs. Um and they do an

440
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:32,160
analysis of those descriptions to see

441
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:36,240
how they're changing over time. Uh and

442
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:39,760
what they find is that you can you can

443
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:41,839
break jobs down into maybe four

444
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:44,000
categories. Um one of those categories

445
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,519
would be routine manual jobs. So that

446
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,360
involves jobs that are like lifting,

447
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:50,160
moving things around, stuff like that.

448
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,079
Routine cognitive work. Um so that would

449
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,759
be things like filing and stuff like

450
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:56,079
that. That would be things like having

451
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:58,759
standardized conversations to check

452
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:01,519
people into a airline.

453
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:03,920
Um, two others are what they call

454
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,519
illststructured problem solving. So,

455
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,360
solving any kind of problem where like

456
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,880
you don't know what inputs you need, you

457
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,240
don't know what the outputs look like,

458
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,000
you don't know what the correct answer

459
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,079
with, you're sort of solving that as

460
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,959
you're figuring out the problem or

461
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:19,440
complex communication tasks that require

462
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:21,519
um like figuring out like any kind of

463
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,440
solving the problem requires talking to

464
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,880
people. Some of that could be like

465
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,320
marketing and sales kind of thing,

466
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,639
figuring out what people want, but other

467
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:31,120
that could be like a home health aid um

468
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,360
does a ton of complex communication. Uh

469
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,839
and their and their basic thesis was

470
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,759
that things that are routine are

471
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:40,639
disappearing from the American labor

472
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:42,720
market. Um this is a huge problem if you

473
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,959
want to have a stable society. Um like

474
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:48,079
in the 20th century there were many many

475
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:50,320
people who performed routine labor for a

476
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:52,399
reasonable middle class wage and like

477
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,639
had a perfectly suitable life doing it.

478
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:58,720
Um some of the kinds of jobs that are

479
00:16:54,639 --> 00:17:00,399
growing are like service jobs that don't

480
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,680
really require rout like they're a

481
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,440
little bit of routine manual work, a

482
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,720
little bit of routine cognitive work and

483
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,959
they pay like the absolute minimum wage

484
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,760
possible. um that's a little bit less

485
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:14,240
concerning today where you know you can

486
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,160
get jobs doing um doing service work

487
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,839
that pay you know you can work at some

488
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,319
place in McDonald's and make $15 an hour

489
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:22,079
$17 an hour things like that um but when

490
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:24,240
there was a surplus in the labor market

491
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:26,000
10 years ago 12 years ago like all those

492
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,679
people would have been paid $725 or

493
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
whatever the federal minimum wage was at

494
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,280
the time um but the two kinds of jobs

495
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
that were growing were things that

496
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,360
required non-rine analytical skills um

497
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,360
and social skills some of this was

498
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,559
updated by this guy David Atur who's

499
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:44,080
economist uh who's here now as well. Um

500
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:46,840
so if you're if you're an educator, the

501
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:49,679
thing you got to be thinking is like man

502
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:51,440
um we have a we have a different job in

503
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,280
front of us. Like it's not sufficient to

504
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,320
prepare people to do jobs that require

505
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,840
routine cognitive work or routine um uh

506
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,360
uh manual work because those jobs are

507
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,280
disappearing as a part of the labor

508
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,799
market. And even when the same job title

509
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,960
exists, even when like they're still

510
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:07,200
plumbers, but plumbers are increasingly

511
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:10,280
called upon to do ill ststructured

512
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,320
problem solving and to do um complex

513
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:14,000
communication. This was an update of

514
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,400
this, I guess, from 2012. This is just

515
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,160
another like, you know, um here's a 2 by

516
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,919
two where jobs that require social

517
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,720
skills are here. Jobs that require math

518
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,240
skills are here. Um these are the the

519
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,760
jobs that are in green are the ones that

520
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,760
are growing. The jobs that are in red

521
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,039
are the ones that are disappearing. And

522
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,440
you can see that they're sort of

523
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:33,200
clustered in the in the things that

524
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,120
require social skills are growing and

525
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,679
the things that require fewer social

526
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:40,440
skills are disappearing. Um truck

527
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,480
drivers is one that that uh people are

528
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:45,280
often particularly at the time people

529
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,280
were pretty this was like 2015 2017. You

530
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,400
know there 3.5 million truck drivers in

531
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,840
the United States. That's about one in

532
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,840
every hundred Americans is a truck

533
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:55,600
driver. Um and uh pro probably 10 years

534
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:58,640
ago was was some of the like the

535
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,720
headiest time where computer scientists

536
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,799
believe that like it was reasonably

537
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,320
possible to replace all of those people.

538
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,760
Um that you would be able to develop

539
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,919
artificially intelligent systems that

540
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,080
would be able to drive trucks. So like

541
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,440
um Uber went to Carnegie Melon and

542
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,559
bought their whole robotics department.

543
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,000
They didn't actually pay for the

544
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:16,320
robotics department. You just pay each

545
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,120
individual faculty member um to go leave

546
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,799
and and join your company. Um and and

547
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,559
this didn't you know that like there's

548
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,760
still 3.7 million truck drivers in the

549
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,120
United States or however many there are

550
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,679
because we this turned out to be a much

551
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:30,160
harder problem than we thought. Um but

552
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,919
this is the kind of angst that exists in

553
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,120
society when these new systems are

554
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,679
developed. Like what would it you know

555
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,520
what would it be like um if uh you know

556
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,720
there's all like what if every kid in

557
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,840
school today who's destined to become a

558
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,360
truck driver we have to find something

559
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,480
else for them to do? Like that's pretty

560
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:47,760
challenging thing to think about. Um uh

561
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:49,600
this was another 2017 example. I don't

562
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,799
know. I was glad to go back and revisit

563
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,919
this um because you know there's lots of

564
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,760
things that are going on today about

565
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,360
like man LLMs are going to like replace

566
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,960
all this work that people are doing like

567
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,720
but for the last two decades we've been

568
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,919
building software that replaces the work

569
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,360
that people is doing. Like there's all

570
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,799
kinds of machine learning based systems

571
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,080
that can do what lawyers do and things

572
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,679
like that. You don't necessarily need

573
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,919
LLMs to do it although maybe it will

574
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,480
sort of accelerate uh some of these

575
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,640
kinds of things.

576
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:16,480
Um, so when I when I was giving this

577
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,919
talk to educators seven or eight years

578
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,120
ago or something like that, uh, this

579
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:20,880
would be the point where I would say

580
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,280
like, imagine you could go into your

581
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,320
school today, imagine going to the any

582
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,520
of the Cambridge public schools,

583
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,679
Somerville public schools, whatever it

584
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,600
is, and grab every homework assignment

585
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,840
that had been given out that day. Um, so

586
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,360
go to all the classrooms, collect every

587
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,200
single assignment that was given out and

588
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,159
put them in a big pile and start going

589
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,000
through them. um start classifying those

590
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,919
homework assignments like how many of

591
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,760
them require some kind of ill

592
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,600
ststructured problem solving or expert

593
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,679
thinking? How many of them require some

594
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,280
kind of complex communication? And how

595
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,600
many of those homework assignments ask

596
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,360
people to do the kinds of routine work

597
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,679
that we no longer need human beings to

598
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,440
do? Um and my like most educators

599
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,880
confronted with that question be like ah

600
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,880
I think we're doing a whole lot of the

601
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:04,240
routine stuff. Um and conceivably those

602
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,480
you know that's something that we should

603
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,799
be uh that we should be revisiting as

604
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:11,520
the world is changing. Um how many of

605
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:13,640
you encountered the idea anywhere in

606
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,760
your study of education of 21st century

607
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,679
skills? Is that a thing that people

608
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,280
still discuss or I Courtney when you

609
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:22,159
were ever working on products did people

610
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:25,440
talk about 21st century skills in your

611
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:28,320
um no I was most in like ELA and medical

612
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:31,200
so yeah you might have had some where

613
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:33,840
where did you encounter so um in the

614
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,679
nonprofit space in India for education

615
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,400
there's a lot of people that are trying

616
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:41,039
to do 21st century skills it was a buzz

617
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,880
word I think a while ago

618
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:45,039
yeah once you're like 25 years into a

619
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,679
century the idea of 21st centur skills

620
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:50,080
becomes like it was it was it felt more

621
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:52,960
urgent in 2004 2005 what were you gonna

622
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:55,280
say just stem in general I think came

623
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,960
out of that yeah there there was sort of

624
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,679
this notion that like okay now that we

625
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,919
have computers saturating our workforce

626
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:04,240
there's some new set of skills that

627
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:07,919
we're going to have to teach um young

628
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:10,400
people how to do um and uh it it was

629
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,520
kind of interesting because if you like

630
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,039
there I don't know there were probably

631
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,039
like a dozen different organizations

632
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:16,720
that came up with lists of 21st century

633
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:19,520
skills. Um, for a while there was this

634
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,400
thing called the five Cs like uh

635
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:24,240
communication, collaboration,

636
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,840
creativity, critical thinking. There was

637
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:30,080
a fifth one, maybe it was the four C's.

638
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:31,919
Maybe I four C's, five C's, some H

639
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,200
four the the four C's, something like

640
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,679
that. almost it was interesting because

641
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,840
actually if almost all of those lists at

642
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,280
some point cite me and Levy's work like

643
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,679
the only people that did sort of like

644
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:43,280
original empirical analysis were these

645
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,919
two economists and then everyone else

646
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,440
kind of freestyled on top of that. Um,

647
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:50,240
but there was, you know, I think there

648
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:52,320
was something s significant there. Um,

649
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,320
that you could kind of tell by I mean

650
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,480
these this I think the new division of

651
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,000
labor is 2005 or something like that,

652
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,400
but like 20 years ago, you could have a

653
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,960
sense that like, man, um, we're going to

654
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:06,080
need uh, you know, we're going to need

655
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,919
many, many more people with far more

656
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,559
cognitive skills than we've ever needed

657
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:12,240
before to to fill our labor market. like

658
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:13,840
we're just going to need more people who

659
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,760
can do expert thinking, ill structured

660
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,280
problem solving, complex communication

661
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,559
than we've ever needed before in the

662
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,640
history of the American education

663
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,080
system. Um, and that's a sort of

664
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,880
stressful thing to contemplate. So

665
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,559
that's like one set of fundamental ideas

666
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,679
like like a way of thinking about what

667
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:32,880
do we want people to know? Um a kind of

668
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:35,039
analysis that uh um people will be doing

669
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,480
in the labor market, you know, education

670
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,240
economists, labor market economists in

671
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,880
the next 5 years is something like well

672
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,960
okay how do LLMs change this equation?

673
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,039
Um how does generative AI change this

674
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,880
equation? Does it simply accelerate

675
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:49,280
trends that have already been existing?

676
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,039
Is there some kind of like new set of

677
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,640
answers to these questions? You know are

678
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:56,159
there like are there further are there

679
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,919
different classes of skills? um this uh

680
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:00,000
um David Atur who's one of the people I

681
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,600
just mentioned just wrote a I don't know

682
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,440
what he I think he wrote a I think he

683
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,640
wrote a working paper that was then

684
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,400
quoted in the New York Times or

685
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,159
something like that. Um he's actually

686
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,000
he's he's been a person who for decades

687
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,600
has been saying like oh computers are

688
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,720
like pretty bad for the middle class.

689
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:16,240
Like a figure like

690
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:17,360
this this is a bad figure for the middle

691
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,200
class. Like this is where the middle

692
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,720
class existed. Um these people are

693
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,480
disappearing. These are like either rich

694
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,240
folks getting rich or poor folk the

695
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,320
service line is poor folks getting poor.

696
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:29,760
Um but um he just recently came out with

697
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,720
something which is like actually um LLMs

698
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,240
are going to be good for the middle

699
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,840
class. Generative AI is going to be good

700
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,520
for the middle class because there's

701
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,320
going to be a whole class of jobs that

702
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,520
people can do with AI support um that

703
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,600
they wouldn't have been able to do

704
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,720
without like graduate training or

705
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,000
something like that and now they're

706
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,039
going to be able to do it with these

707
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,320
sort of systems that are helping them.

708
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:51,279
Um and then there's another economist

709
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,720
here Darren Asameloo um who was like I

710
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:54,159
don't know David I think in the New York

711
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,520
Times article he's like oh that's pretty

712
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,120
optimistic I'm not sure that's going to

713
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,159
work out. Um but these are the kinds of

714
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,600
things that people are wrestling with

715
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:03,360
now.

716
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:07,279
Um the the heart of the trap of the

717
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:10,240
routine assessment um is that the kinds

718
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:13,440
of things that computers are good at

719
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,279
assessing it almost exactly overlap with

720
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,520
the kinds of things that computers are

721
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:18,640
good at doing. Um and those are the

722
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,200
kinds of things that we don't need

723
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,600
people to do anymore. um the kinds of

724
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:26,320
things that we can build tools that are

725
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:29,360
good at assessing human performance are

726
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,960
almost always very closely overlapping

727
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,080
with uh the kinds of things that

728
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,120
computers are good at, the kinds of

729
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,240
things you don't need them to do

730
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:38,000
anymore. So here are a couple of

731
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:40,000
examples. Um here's a framework um for

732
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,080
mathematical modeling. So one of the big

733
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,840
changes in the common core state

734
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,799
standards that came about 15 years ago

735
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:49,200
or something like that um was that we

736
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:50,400
wanted to teach students not just to do

737
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,919
procedural kinds of things in

738
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,679
mathematics but to be able to conduct

739
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:55,279
exercises in mathematical modeling and

740
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,440
that those exercises in mathematical

741
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:58,799
modeling um you can think of it having

742
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,880
kind of five steps like first you have

743
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:02,400
to find some problem in the world um

744
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,159
what is an interesting thing to view

745
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,440
then you have to set that up as a model

746
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,919
you have to you know whether that's an

747
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,200
equation or a schematic or a table or

748
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,320
whatever it is you have to take a

749
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,159
problem and they have to frame it in

750
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,679
some kind of way. Then probably once

751
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:16,080
you've developed that model, you have to

752
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:18,240
compute some kind of solution inside

753
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:21,600
that model. Then you have to sort of

754
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,760
explain your solution in terms of the

755
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:26,159
real world. So was it 27 board feet or

756
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:28,400
was it 27 kittens or was it you know 27

757
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:31,039
acres? Um and then you have to be able

758
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,400
to sort of explain why your solution

759
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,840
makes sense. Like why did you follow a

760
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,919
series of reasonable mathematical steps

761
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:39,360
to come up with that solution? Um, of

762
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:42,720
those roughly five steps, um, what what

763
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,720
do we have technologies to

764
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:49,279
evaluate? What what have you of of those

765
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,480
five things, what have you ever been

766
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:54,880
tested on? I want to say three. Yeah.

767
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,480
Computing the solution. The only thing

768
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,880
the only thing of those five steps that

769
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:01,039
we can like reliably get computers to do

770
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,360
is evaluate whether or not you can

771
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:05,520
compute a solution. If you use

772
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,600
mathematics in your profession, which of

773
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,600
those five steps will you almost never

774
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:12,159
actually

775
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:13,600
do? Computing the solution. Um, like a

776
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,360
computer can't tell you which problems

777
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,960
are interesting. A computer can't tell

778
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,080
you like, oh, this would be a good

779
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,679
problem to think about through this kind

780
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:22,080
of equation or through this kind of

781
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:24,240
formula or through this kind of framing.

782
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,679
Um, a computer like is not that good at

783
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,799
taking the outputs and being like, okay,

784
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,000
this is what it means for the real

785
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:29,919
world. And computers are really not

786
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,919
particularly good at explaining to you

787
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,760
why what just happened mathematically

788
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,919
makes sense. But the one thing that you

789
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,360
will assuredly do if you're a

790
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,360
professional mathematician is have the

791
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,520
computer do the math. Um the computers

792
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:44,880
are like significantly more reliable

793
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:47,360
than you are at those kinds of steps. Um

794
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,679
so there's there's if if you go and sit

795
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:52,480
down for any mathematics exam that's

796
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:54,880
given in a standardized way at any level

797
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,200
um you will spend the vast majority of

798
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:59,520
your time computing. Um, if you're a

799
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,799
mathematician, you'll spend almost not

800
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,080
really a mathematician, but if you're a

801
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,520
person who uses mathematics in their

802
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,960
work, you will spend almost none of your

803
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,640
time computing. You will spend almost

804
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:09,279
all of your time doing those other kinds

805
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:12,559
of things. Um, that's a real problem.

806
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:16,880
That's a real problem. Um, a a useful

807
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:18,320
concept to um that uh that people who

808
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,559
study, psychometricians, people who

809
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,559
study testing, um they have a they have

810
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:24,159
a term for how we misunderstand math

811
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:25,520
tests and it's called or tests in

812
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:27,679
general. It's called the reification

813
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:30,720
fallacy. Um, reification means sort of

814
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:33,039
the naming of something. Um, if you call

815
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:35,039
something a math test, people will think

816
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:37,200
it's a math test. But calling something

817
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:38,720
a math test doesn't make it a math test.

818
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,399
Um, so for instance, every time you take

819
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,840
a math test, you need to know something

820
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:43,039
about language. You probably need to

821
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,880
know something about test taking

822
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:46,240
strategies. Um, there's probably a whole

823
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,440
bunch of other like cultural things that

824
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,120
you need to know to function at a test.

825
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,960
And the test is effectively evaluating

826
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:53,360
all those things. Um, the other thing is

827
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,360
a test can like there's no test that can

828
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:57,279
say that you know all of eighth grade

829
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:59,840
algebra. Um, the way we take that would

830
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:01,679
take you forever. Um, instead what we do

831
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,200
is we sample out of a domain. We say

832
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,679
here's all the stuff that might fit in

833
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,880
eighth grade algebra and like we're

834
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,080
going to pick some of this stuff and

835
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,919
some of this stuff and some of this

836
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,760
stuff. Um, a way you could think about

837
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:14,320
this problem is that we over sample

838
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:17,200
computing and we under sample all of

839
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:19,520
these other kinds of things. Um, now

840
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,000
what? Um, well, maybe let's do let's do

841
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,279
one more that's like this. Um, here's

842
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,720
here's one of my very favorite

843
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:27,520
paragraphs that's ever been written

844
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,279
about computer programming by Hal Abson,

845
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:32,480
who's here, and some of his colleagues.

846
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:34,880
Um, this is from a a computer science

847
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,960
textbook. Um, first we want to establish

848
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,480
the idea that computer language is not

849
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,039
just a way of getting computer to

850
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:43,200
perform operations, but rather that is a

851
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:45,120
novel formal medium for expressing ideas

852
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,559
about methodology. Thus, this is

853
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,559
probably the key sentence. Thus,

854
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:51,360
programs must be written for people to

855
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:53,440
read and only incidentally for machines

856
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,880
to execute. Second, we believe that the

857
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,320
essential material to be addressed by a

858
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,679
subject at this level is not the syntax

859
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,360
of particular programming language

860
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:01,279
constructs, nor clever algorithms for

861
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,960
computing particular functions, nor even

862
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:04,799
the mathematical analysis of algorithms

863
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,320
and foundations of computing, but rather

864
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:09,120
the techniques used to control the

865
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:12,159
intellectual complexity of large

866
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:14,559
software systems. Um why would it be

867
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:16,320
important for programs to be written for

868
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:20,000
people to read and only incidentally for

869
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:22,080
machines to run? People are the ones who

870
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,279
are maintaining the code. Can't

871
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,480
understand it. And how are they going to

872
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:26,159
maintain it? People have to be able to

873
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:29,159
maintain it. What else? What might folks

874
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,159
say?

875
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,480
Yeah. The way you add new features, the

876
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,080
way you collaborate, the way you build

877
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,440
large complex systems is that you build

878
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,679
a system that people can read and

879
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,039
understand what it's doing. um uh when

880
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:43,600
you can't read and can't understand what

881
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:47,279
it's doing. Um now when you when you all

882
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:49,440
take introductory computing classes um

883
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:51,279
and you submit your homework assignments

884
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,720
and they're automatically graded, what

885
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:54,000
are the kind of characteristics of your

886
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,399
programming that those systems are good

887
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,440
at grading

888
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:01,360
sort of the output of whatever occurs?

889
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,960
Okay. So, um the the assignment

890
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,559
presupposes some kind of engineering

891
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,399
test and figures out whether or not you

892
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:08,559
pass that test, like but did your spell

893
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:12,559
check dictionary detect the misspelled

894
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:14,720
words or not? Um uh if it passed a

895
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:17,200
series of randomized test cases from

896
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,720
input to output. Okay, good. So, similar

897
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,159
kind of thing like we we throw a b we

898
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,360
throw a bunch of possible inputs in this

899
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,480
system. Does it all come up with the

900
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,240
outputs that it's supposed to come up

901
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,880
with? Other kinds of engineering tests.

902
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:29,039
Dana just going to say like sometimes

903
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:31,440
they'll implement like a time like does

904
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:33,200
your code does your code run fast

905
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,480
enough? Good. So there could be a you

906
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,080
know that's one kind of efficiency

907
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,840
metric. I think there are other kind of

908
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,120
efficiency metrics that maybe have you

909
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,559
ever done things where you like you only

910
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,760
have a certain number of lines or a

911
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:44,559
certain number of characters or

912
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:45,919
something like that to try to

913
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:48,320
generate some parsimony or something

914
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:51,279
like that. Some classes here do have

915
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:54,720
like these like style checkers. I'm not

916
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:56,799
too sure what they check exactly, but um

917
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,880
they check for certain like stylistic

918
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:01,679
choices you made in your coding, but a

919
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,240
lot of them also depend on you to have

920
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:05,679
like to have like correct

921
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:07,840
computationally code to then give you

922
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:09,840
the style point. Yeah, good. You know,

923
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,760
and I think the style starts getting at

924
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,200
the sort of programs must be written for

925
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:15,760
people to read. Now, they probably don't

926
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,360
check things like did you name your

927
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,960
variables and your functions something

928
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:21,120
sensible that somebody else would be

929
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:23,120
able to to understand later on or other

930
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:25,200
kinds of things like that. Um, but you

931
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:28,320
could think of those style guides as

932
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:31,039
like like initial, you know, like we

933
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:33,120
have pretty good tests for the kind of

934
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:35,279
incidentally for machines to execute.

935
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:38,640
That's kind of our like our efficacy,

936
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:40,799
our efficiency evaluations. um you know

937
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,240
in some in some ways like the style

938
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:43,919
checkers you're describing also they

939
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,840
might be kind of silly but like another

940
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,679
way to think of them is like as a as a

941
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,360
reasonable first step towards these

942
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:52,080
kinds of things like what are all the

943
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:54,399
machine readable parts of style um that

944
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:56,640
we can get a computer to evaluate and

945
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:59,600
how over time would we build

946
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:01,440
increasingly sophisticated um style

947
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,360
checkers, computer assessors that would

948
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,000
just do a better and better job year

949
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:08,159
after year of pull of evaluating more

950
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,440
and more features of code that have to

951
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:10,640
do with humans understanding and

952
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,080
communicating with each other rather

953
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:15,000
than just machines. What were you going

954
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:17,279
to say? Uh I was just going to add that

955
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,120
uh basically I've been a part of a

956
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:21,000
course where they also do like design

957
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:23,360
checks for the code on

958
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,600
top. So they're checking like are you

959
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:28,480
writing good efficient loops? are you

960
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,919
writing redundant code? But even so, I

961
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,320
really feel that within this

962
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:34,799
introductory like programming space,

963
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:37,279
they're mostly checking for how well the

964
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:39,679
students are overfitting to the given

965
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:41,760
problem space already. Like what they

966
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:44,000
want to test for is problem solving, but

967
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,480
that's just really hard to do. I think

968
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,519
good. So that you that it's very

969
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:51,600
difficult. So a in the solution of any

970
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:53,360
given problem, it's very difficult to

971
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,200
detect for something that would be sort

972
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:58,000
of like generalizable problem solving

973
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,679
skills. And even worse, it's essentially

974
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,799
like so far it's proven more or less

975
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:04,559
impossible to design assessment machines

976
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:06,480
that can detect something like

977
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:07,919
generalized problem solving skills. Like

978
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,839
to some extent like anytime we build

979
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:12,000
these things, you know, the our most

980
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:14,399
sophisticated assessment tools sort of

981
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,800
like work best on particular problems

982
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:18,320
that you've like fit them to work on and

983
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,200
other kinds of things like that and they

984
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:24,320
work less well um on more generalizable

985
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:26,000
kinds of things. Um what are what are

986
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,839
some other domains that we could think

987
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,599
of that are sort of maybe I'll have you

988
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:32,800
chat with each other for a minute. Um

989
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:34,399
talk about talk about two things. Um

990
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,320
what what are what are just other

991
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:38,800
domains that you can think of that are

992
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:41,119
like this where computers can sort of

993
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:43,119
test something in the domain but they

994
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:45,599
may not be able to capture like the most

995
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:47,919
important or like big important classes

996
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:49,200
of things in that domain. Um think about

997
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,960
that for a few minutes. That might be

998
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,800
like the sort of putting a pessimist's

999
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,480
hat on to think about that. Um, and then

1000
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:58,400
put on your optimist hat for a minute or

1001
00:34:54,480 --> 00:35:00,320
two and say like in the next 5 years,

1002
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:03,599
where do you think we're most likely to

1003
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:05,280
see the most progress um in sort of

1004
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:07,040
thwarting the trap of routine

1005
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:10,160
assessment? Like where are we most

1006
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:12,720
likely to develop um assessment tools

1007
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:14,480
that actually evaluate people on things

1008
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,400
that we really care about and want human

1009
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,839
beings to be able to do? Um turn to the

1010
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,200
person uh next to you or a couple people

1011
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:22,560
and talk about those two things for

1012
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:24,320
three or four minutes. Ready? Go.

1013
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:26,480
Let's do let's do the let's do the first

1014
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,320
one first. Um what are what are some

1015
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,880
domains that you could think of where it

1016
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:32,240
seemed like ah we were like we really

1017
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,839
are having a hard time using computers

1018
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:38,560
to get at the important stuff here

1019
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:40,240
like essay writing or short stories or

1020
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:43,599
anything to do with like writing in

1021
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:47,119
literature. Great. And that's pro like

1022
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:50,079
that's probably one of the most studied

1023
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:52,720
most examined domains. Um and again it's

1024
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:55,680
a place where like we have a like at

1025
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:57,920
least the baseline in that field is

1026
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:00,960
pretty well understood. Um so some of

1027
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:03,040
the very worst assessment like just like

1028
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:06,160
the most disappointing kind of

1029
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:08,640
assessments we do is people's long form

1030
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:11,280
essay writing on standardized tests. Um

1031
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:14,800
there's a guy here named Les Pearlman um

1032
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:17,359
who used to um joke about the quality of

1033
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:19,320
standardized writing assess assessment

1034
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:21,920
by noting that that he could pretty

1035
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:23,440
reliably score essays from across the

1036
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,680
room um because you just hold them up

1037
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,119
and see how long they are. Um and just

1038
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,800
by glancing them he could be like oh

1039
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:30,560
that's two that's a three that's a five.

1040
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,800
Um he also wrote pretty early on a

1041
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,680
pretty fun piece of software. um there

1042
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,280
are all these companies that were

1043
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:37,680
creating automated essay graders. And so

1044
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:40,880
he got a group of MIT students to make

1045
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:43,119
software that generated nonsense text um

1046
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,839
that did really well on these automated

1047
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:47,200
essay scorers. Um which was just it it

1048
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:48,640
was pretty fun to read these things

1049
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,640
which just were like complete

1050
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:53,440
hallucinations of madness and then you

1051
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:57,200
know some system would be like five. Um

1052
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:59,680
but uh um we we we actually have

1053
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:01,440
developed software tools. Um so think

1054
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:03,119
you know when like the GRE essays are

1055
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,800
scored or things like that. So humans go

1056
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,960
and score them. It's incredibly

1057
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,720
disappointing how they do that. Um they

1058
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,800
read them all very quickly. They score

1059
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,560
them holistically. The people who do the

1060
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,000
scoring are like not particularly well

1061
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:16,000
paid, not particularly well trained. As

1062
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,920
you might imagine, like it's enormously

1063
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,079
boring to read essays over and over

1064
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,920
again about like, you know, who is the

1065
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:24,240
person in your life that inspired you

1066
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:26,640
the most or, you know, I don't whatever

1067
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:28,880
other ridiculous questions they ask. Um,

1068
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:32,800
and and but anyway, you can train those

1069
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:35,040
people to be reasonably uh similar in

1070
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:38,240
their scoring to one another. Um, and

1071
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:39,839
not only that, but for a given question,

1072
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,839
like if we ask people over and over

1073
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:43,119
again, who is the, you know, person that

1074
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:45,680
inspired you the most? you have a bunch

1075
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:47,599
of humans evaluate it. You feed all of

1076
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:51,200
those essays into some kind of machine

1077
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:53,520
learning algorithm. We can build um

1078
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:57,599
machines that are roughly as reliable as

1079
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:59,920
those humans. Um so um we can we can

1080
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:02,480
create automated essay scoring tools

1081
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:04,240
that do a reasonably good job that that

1082
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,960
predict what a human would score an

1083
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:08,560
essay about as reliably as two humans

1084
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,920
would would predict what the other

1085
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:12,160
person would score the essay. Like about

1086
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:14,160
as reliable as two people are. um it

1087
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:16,880
doesn't those systems don't work for

1088
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:18,640
shorter answer things. Um so you have to

1089
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,400
you have to be in the realm of a few

1090
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,000
hundred words before these systems

1091
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,920
become reliable. They're also not very

1092
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,839
useful for novel questions. If you

1093
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,839
invent a new essay question you want to

1094
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:29,280
give someone, you can't take one of

1095
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:30,640
these algorithms off the shelf and run

1096
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,720
it against the system and have it work.

1097
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:34,800
you have to like you know have which is

1098
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,000
which is why like I don't know I don't

1099
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,440
know how they do it exactly with essays

1100
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,079
but these standardized test companies

1101
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:42,000
like you know some fraction of the test

1102
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,760
that you take every time you take it um

1103
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,280
is not scored and it's just used for

1104
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,040
development for these kinds of things

1105
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,599
like that you know so you're somehow

1106
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:52,320
like we've convinced you to pay $75 to

1107
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:55,040
do voluntary work for giant test making

1108
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:57,440
companies and things like that um but

1109
00:38:55,040 --> 00:39:00,720
yeah that's a that's a you know um that

1110
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,920
is a domain in which pe People will also

1111
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,680
disagree. Some people will be like,

1112
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,359
"Man, it's great that we have these

1113
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:07,760
systems because if you have tools that

1114
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:09,280
can automatically score essays, then you

1115
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,880
can encourage people to write more

1116
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,960
essays." Like, if we didn't have these

1117
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,880
machines that could score essays, like

1118
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,839
we uh they wouldn't be on standardized

1119
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,040
tests. And if they wouldn't be on

1120
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:18,160
standardized tests, then teachers

1121
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,599
wouldn't assign them, and then we would

1122
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,960
teach less writing. And so, like, even

1123
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:22,320
as crappy as they, you know, maybe there

1124
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,680
are some critiques about their concern,

1125
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,200
maybe there are some concerns about

1126
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:29,119
their quality, but they're still good

1127
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:30,400
for the system. Um but uh but yeah,

1128
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:31,680
clearly not everything that is important

1129
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,160
about writing is captured in those

1130
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:36,000
things. Like sort of closely related is

1131
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,760
like language learning. You can very

1132
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,160
easily assess whether someone knows a

1133
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:42,560
lot of vocab or verb conjugations or

1134
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:44,400
grammar or whatever by by a computer.

1135
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,920
But like that's not really the point of

1136
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,440
language learning. Like language

1137
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,760
learning is a lot of it's about like

1138
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:52,160
speaking and listening and and writing

1139
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,839
and stuff. And like especially like the

1140
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,280
speaking and listening part like you

1141
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:57,119
probably it's probably going to take a

1142
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,560
long time for computers to do that well.

1143
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:00,720
Especially like when you have

1144
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:03,599
variability due to like accents and

1145
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:05,599
regional stuff like it would be hard to

1146
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:07,839
assess whether or not someone really is

1147
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:09,680
fluent in a language by simply

1148
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:11,280
interacting with good. And you know

1149
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:13,920
language learning is such an interesting

1150
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:16,000
subject in general uh because it shifts

1151
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,599
so much in the middle of it. Um there

1152
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,680
there aren't that many things that like

1153
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:21,119
like you know the kinds of things you do

1154
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,400
when you teach social studies to third

1155
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:23,359
graders is not that different from the

1156
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,720
kinds of things that you do when you

1157
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:25,839
teach social studies to 12th graders. I

1158
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,520
guess it's more complicated but it's

1159
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:29,280
along the same lines but the initial

1160
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:31,200
learning of a language sort of more like

1161
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,960
a math or a science and then the later

1162
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,560
parts of a language is more like a

1163
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,640
humanities or a social science or

1164
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:39,440
something like that which is cool. Um,

1165
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:41,280
in the book I write a bunch about um,

1166
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:45,440
automated automated pronunciation

1167
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:48,400
detectors. Um, which to me I think are a

1168
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:50,000
great example of advances in language

1169
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,560
learning, especially when you think

1170
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,320
about the classroom contexts in which

1171
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:56,000
people learn to pronounce things. So,

1172
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:58,240
like take yourself back to your middle

1173
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,640
school Spanish class or whatever. Um,

1174
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:02,560
and there's 26 kids in the room and

1175
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:04,720
there's one teacher and the teacher

1176
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:08,079
walks up to you and goes, "Hola, kumo

1177
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:09,520
estas." And then you respond and and

1178
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:10,960
maybe the teacher gives you some

1179
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,240
feedback about their pronunciation.

1180
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,720
Maybe they're just whipping around the

1181
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:17,440
room, but you're getting at best like

1182
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:19,680
126th of that teacher's attention for

1183
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:22,400
that pronunciation evaluation exercise.

1184
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:23,920
It's extraordinarily inefficient. Um I

1185
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,160
als I remember this a lot because I'm

1186
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:28,240
both bad at language learning and bad at

1187
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,920
pronouncing things. Um and you know so

1188
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,560
teacher like I would say stuff and the

1189
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:34,160
teacher would just like nod at me like

1190
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:36,240
okay go on to the next word like clearly

1191
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,839
I'm not learning this. Um but it like

1192
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,359
you know I can open up a computer that

1193
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:41,200
has an automated pronunciation detection

1194
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:43,280
and I can just you know mispronounce

1195
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:45,040
poor favore over and over and over and

1196
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,560
over again. And this thing doesn't care.

1197
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,599
It'll listen to me say it as many times

1198
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,960
as it want. you know, as they get

1199
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:50,640
better, they might be able to find they

1200
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,079
can at least give me examples of correct

1201
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,680
pronunciation. They might be able to

1202
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:56,160
fine-tune my pronunciation. Like, that

1203
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:58,319
seems like, you know, a place where

1204
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:00,880
computational assessment might really be

1205
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:02,560
a whole lot better um than human

1206
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,240
assessment, like in a domain that's

1207
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:06,720
pretty important. What was your example,

1208
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:10,079
Sabrina? I was going to say using

1209
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:11,560
computers to analyze art. like it can

1210
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:13,520
tell you about the color

1211
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:16,640
compositions, time period that it's

1212
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:19,119
from, um what makes it objectively

1213
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:22,720
appealing to look at, but it doesn't

1214
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:25,720
necessarily go into the artist's

1215
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:30,240
background or like the

1216
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:33,839
emotional message behind it or um why it

1217
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:36,000
was created in the way that it was. I

1218
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:38,400
think with art there's like it's usually

1219
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,880
not like the surface level which I think

1220
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:43,599
that the computer is like really good at

1221
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:46,400
hitting. Um but maybe the overall

1222
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:48,560
meaning message is missed entirely.

1223
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,480
Yeah. I it's it you know I mean there

1224
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,839
are AP studio art classes and things

1225
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,160
like that where you can submit a

1226
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:55,760
portfolio and I don't I've never I never

1227
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:59,160
thought about it before you brought it

1228
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:01,920
up. Um, but to my knowledge, there's no

1229
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:03,760
application of software in evaluating a

1230
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,839
student's art portfolio. But it's a kind

1231
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:08,560
of fun exercise to start thinking about

1232
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:12,079
like what could you assign an AP studio

1233
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:14,880
art student that could be graded by a

1234
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:18,160
computer that people would generally

1235
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:19,760
think is fair. Um, now clearly like

1236
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,440
abstract painting or something like

1237
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:24,480
that, like probably no one will think

1238
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:26,160
that's fair. um certain kinds of still

1239
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:28,960
life like where the where the task is

1240
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:30,800
like like reproduce this bowl of fruit

1241
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:33,119
as closely as possible to what the bowl

1242
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:35,119
of fruit actually looked like I would

1243
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:37,599
imagine I would trust a computer to do

1244
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:39,520
that as well or better than a human

1245
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:40,319
would you know but I'm not an artist

1246
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,400
maybe there's something about still

1247
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:44,240
lives I don't understand but the only

1248
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,839
application I can think of and I am very

1249
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:47,760
biased because I do a lot of photography

1250
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:49,119
is detecting and even then it's

1251
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:52,480
difficult detecting if something's been

1252
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:54,800
like altered in any sort of after the

1253
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:56,800
um like Photoshop and I know Adobee's

1254
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,400
working on like their own thing to like

1255
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,920
detect. What would what would what would

1256
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,760
be a thing that you would want a novice

1257
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,280
photographer to be able to do pretty

1258
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,760
well that a computer could tell whether

1259
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:08,160
or not they could do it well? Whether or

1260
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,520
not a photo is I think the most

1261
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,920
fundamental thing is like whether or not

1262
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:14,160
a photo is exposed properly without

1263
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:16,400
having to do any digital alterations.

1264
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:18,800
Yeah. Yeah. No, it's and again, you

1265
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:21,440
know, if you can get a computer that can

1266
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:23,839
do that evaluation, then you can then

1267
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:25,760
you can have all of the photography

1268
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:27,520
students get more formative feedback.

1269
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:29,520
Um, maybe you can get them to have more

1270
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:31,520
high stakes feedback. Maybe, you know,

1271
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:33,440
we could admit students into arts

1272
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:35,200
colleges based on their photography

1273
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,720
portfolio or we can just ask them more

1274
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:40,240
questions in their portfolio. We can say

1275
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:42,640
like, humans, go see like whether their

1276
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:44,960
intimate portraits like evoke the

1277
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:46,319
character of the person. Um, and don't

1278
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,160
waste your time figuring out whether or

1279
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:49,839
not they can expose photos correctly

1280
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,760
because like we got machines that can do

1281
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:54,800
that. Um, yeah, that's a that's a neat

1282
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:56,400
example. Um, so where were you most

1283
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,000
optimistic? Where do you feel like

1284
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,839
there's going to be the most improvement

1285
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,760
in the next five years and where are

1286
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:04,760
those improvements going to come from?

1287
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,760
Um,

1288
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:09,280
I sort of have a followup. Oh, sure.

1289
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:12,480
Yeah. Yeah. Um, sorry. I was just

1290
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:15,359
thinking that if if the photo photos

1291
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:18,800
exposure level is detectable by a

1292
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:20,800
computer and then so you begin to not

1293
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:23,599
have humans evaluate that on admission

1294
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:25,599
tests anymore then soon you'd have to

1295
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:27,599
drop that right from the test like that

1296
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:29,280
portion of the value because students

1297
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:31,200
would then have access to these kinds of

1298
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:33,520
softwares as well which means they would

1299
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:36,000
never submit a photo that was not

1300
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:38,800
exposed. That is a great description of

1301
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:42,240
the trap of routine assessment. um that

1302
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:44,240
if if computers can detect performance,

1303
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:46,560
then computers can probably do that

1304
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:47,760
performance. Um if we if we can build a

1305
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,960
machine which tells whether or not a

1306
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,720
photograph was taken with the correct

1307
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,160
exposure, then we can just build cameras

1308
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,359
that will only take photographs with the

1309
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,880
correct exposure and then we don't need

1310
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:56,640
to teach humans how to do correct

1311
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,480
exposures anymore. And so that is like

1312
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:00,400
part of this loop that educators are

1313
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:03,200
sort of constantly wrestling with,

1314
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:05,200
constantly thinking about. Um, and a and

1315
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:09,880
a thing that makes this so hard for

1316
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:12,720
educators is it's really hard to predict

1317
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:14,040
um when your old high school friends are

1318
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:18,040
going to call you.

1319
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:22,240
Um, it's it's really

1320
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:27,119
hard. I won't say anymore. um uh it's

1321
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:29,040
it's really hard to predict um like in

1322
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:30,560
what ways these kinds of disciplines

1323
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:32,800
will change like like how will

1324
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:35,920
photography change over the next five

1325
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:37,280
years um is a really hard thing for for

1326
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,640
photography educators to guess right

1327
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,160
now. So um I was think I've been

1328
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,599
thinking about this a lot because we I

1329
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:44,319
shared this paper that we published with

1330
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:46,240
you um that's called that was generative

1331
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:47,280
AI and K12 and MIT perspective. I didn't

1332
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:49,599
share with you all. I shared it with my

1333
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:51,839
students. Um, and uh, one of the claims

1334
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:54,400
that we make in there is like we can be

1335
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:56,079
pretty sure that computer programming is

1336
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,280
going to change and that co-pilots are

1337
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:58,720
going to be a really sort of central

1338
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,160
part of computer programming and so

1339
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:01,119
computer science teachers should

1340
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,760
probably start thinking about how

1341
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,119
they're going to change their

1342
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,720
instruction. But I was just at a

1343
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:06,400
conference the other day um, where

1344
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:08,079
someone from Cornell Tech stood up and

1345
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,079
was like and the whole premise of the

1346
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:11,119
conference was how should what guidance

1347
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:12,160
should we give to computer science

1348
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:13,920
teachers to change their instruction?

1349
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:15,760
And this woman stood up and was like do

1350
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:17,119
not do that. you have no idea how

1351
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,720
computer science you how computer

1352
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:20,720
programming is going to change. You have

1353
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:22,880
there's no reason to give any new advice

1354
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:25,760
to teachers right now because we have no

1355
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:27,359
idea what that would be. Um and uh I

1356
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,280
started thinking more and more like well

1357
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:30,640
yeah like in part because I've been

1358
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,640
hearing from people who teach

1359
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:34,880
introduction to computer programming

1360
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:36,720
that their early efforts to incorporate

1361
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:39,280
co-pilots in instruction were going

1362
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:41,200
pretty poorly. um that basically like

1363
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:42,640
people like students were using them and

1364
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,920
then like week four, week five would

1365
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,440
roll around and they're like these

1366
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,720
students are totally confused. Like they

1367
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:48,319
haven't learned fundamental things they

1368
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:50,240
need to learn and that I talked to other

1369
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:52,480
software engineers who are saying things

1370
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:54,560
like every hour you save programming

1371
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:56,800
with a co-pilot will cost you an hour in

1372
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:58,480
quality assurance later. Um that the

1373
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,760
things like like you solve little

1374
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:01,520
problems but you end up creating bigger

1375
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,520
runs for some of the reasons that Hal

1376
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:05,839
has on the screen right here. And so

1377
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:08,000
then you start saying like, man, maybe

1378
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:09,839
we don't know like may like it's pretty

1379
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,640
it's pretty hard to think about how you

1380
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:14,480
should change um you know the like some

1381
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:16,160
people might say like why are we

1382
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:17,680
assessing computer programming at all

1383
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,960
anymore like the bots are just going to

1384
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:21,359
do it for us and then other people be

1385
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:22,800
like I'm not so sure about that like we

1386
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:25,839
might actually need people doing this or

1387
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:27,760
doing parts of this. Um it's a you know

1388
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:29,920
the other thing I think about a lot um

1389
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:32,160
is that his like historically educators

1390
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:34,160
are not very good at this. Um, so if you

1391
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,359
read like in the 19th century, the 20th

1392
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,319
century, like in you know, in the 19th

1393
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:38,240
century, there were a whole bunch of

1394
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:40,000
people who were like fervent believers

1395
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:41,520
in diagramming sentences. Did any of you

1396
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,640
have to diagram sentences when you're in

1397
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:46,000
elementary school? You know, subject,

1398
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:47,200
predicate, adverb, all these kind. I

1399
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,280
mean, there are people who went to their

1400
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:51,040
graves believing that like if we didn't

1401
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:53,599
teach young people what the pl perfect

1402
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:55,200
was, like then, you know, society was

1403
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:57,680
going to collapse. And they were totally

1404
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:59,359
wrong. They laugh at them today. But

1405
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:00,480
there's all kinds of stuff that you and

1406
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:02,000
I would sit down with a bunch of

1407
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,599
curriculum developers and be like, "Man,

1408
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,480
it's incredibly important that kids in

1409
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:08,720
2024 learn X." And some fraction of

1410
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:11,680
those things are absolutely going to be

1411
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:12,880
vital in 20, you know, 75. And some of

1412
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:14,480
those things that we would like

1413
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:16,400
passionately defend right now, people in

1414
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,480
2075 would be like, "Can you believe

1415
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:20,079
those folks 50 years ago thought that

1416
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:21,680
people needed to learn X?" Like what

1417
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:23,040
kind of mor, you know, those like the

1418
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,480
knuckleheads who believed in the Plue

1419
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:26,160
perfect in the 19th century or something

1420
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,839
like that. Um these are they're very

1421
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:29,280
difficult things to predict. All right,

1422
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:31,280
let's talk about more optimistic things.

1423
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,559
What are other things, Dana, that um we

1424
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:34,160
had a really interesting conversation

1425
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:37,200
where we were saying if you go back to

1426
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:40,800
what you were talking about earlier in

1427
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:44,720
how AI can help teachers inspire or I

1428
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:46,800
get AI can inspire teachers um with new

1429
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:48,480
homework assignments. Um but then we

1430
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:52,800
brought up this weird like edtech

1431
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:55,520
Matthew effect where um AI only pulls

1432
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:58,160
like specifically like say Chad GBT is

1433
00:49:55,520 --> 00:50:01,280
only pulling from existing literature on

1434
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:03,680
the subject um other than the initial

1435
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:05,359
time that it like maybe accidentally

1436
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:07,520
puts in a random word and starts going

1437
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:09,680
off the walls and makes something crazy.

1438
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:12,160
It's really only pulling from what is

1439
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:14,480
already out there. So in the idea of

1440
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:16,000
bringing up um the middle class and the

1441
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:18,000
teachers with new inspiration, you

1442
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,240
almost have to pull ahead the elites to

1443
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:23,200
then produce the literature that is

1444
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:24,800
necessary to then inspire AI with new

1445
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,960
things that will then trickle trickle

1446
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:28,079
down to the middle class um for them to

1447
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:31,680
use. So it was almost like this

1448
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:34,960
interesting idea that AI can be useful,

1449
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:37,119
but it needs to have the right like

1450
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:38,720
literature to back it up. Um, and

1451
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:40,960
there's like this that interesting

1452
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:43,440
dilemma of like who is going to create

1453
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:45,920
that and how do you inspire people to

1454
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:48,240
push them ahead in that sense to help

1455
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:50,559
the the little guy? Yeah. What what kind

1456
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:51,520
of training data gets used is enormously

1457
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:54,240
important. We were talking about this

1458
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:56,880
with one of our guests from WPI who was

1459
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:58,400
saying that uh maybe whoever was doing

1460
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:01,920
that presentation can explain it better

1461
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:04,960
than I can, but that uh um uh like as

1462
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:08,559
LLMs generate more code and that code

1463
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:10,880
has problems with it um then future LLMs

1464
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:13,599
will pull in all that buggy code and

1465
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:14,880
suggest more bad code like you know like

1466
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:16,240
me. Yeah. Do you want do you want to say

1467
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:20,040
more about what the what the problem is

1468
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:24,319
there? So uh I used it

1469
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:27,760
to anyway so it was that LLMs are

1470
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:31,680
trained on copilot uh on GitHub code. So

1471
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:33,760
they essentially get all of uh the badly

1472
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:36,640
written code that copilot generates. So

1473
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:38,720
when students are generating that code

1474
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:41,839
uh they are essentially going to

1475
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:45,920
generate the same bad code and they're

1476
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:48,720
not going to fulfill the needs of what

1477
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:52,800
is required from the question as in uh

1478
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:55,200
when you uh give someone an assignment

1479
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:58,640
uh there the ways to test it is to give

1480
00:51:55,200 --> 00:52:00,480
them uh some test cases but those test

1481
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:05,400
cases essentially do not solve the

1482
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:08,720
entire problem. Uh so teaching students

1483
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:10,800
uh how to build those test cases that

1484
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:13,119
covers the entire input space is more

1485
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:16,559
important than for them to be able to

1486
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:18,480
write code. Good. Yeah. And so um uh

1487
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:19,920
that was a I mean who knows if if what

1488
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:21,839
Shay just said is true, but that's a

1489
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:23,280
great kind of claim about the future.

1490
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:25,200
you know, building certain kind of test

1491
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:27,280
cases is going to be more important to

1492
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:29,040
the future of computer science than um

1493
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:31,040
you know, being able to write certain

1494
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:32,559
lines of codes or or knowing certain

1495
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,839
other programming principles or things

1496
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:35,920
like that. Like this is exactly what

1497
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:38,240
educators are wrestling with every time

1498
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:40,319
there's some new technological change.

1499
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:41,920
Um you know, do we still teach kids

1500
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:43,280
spelling in an age when we have spellch

1501
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:44,720
check? Do we still teach kids

1502
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:46,000
computation in an age where there are

1503
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:49,599
computers? These kinds of things come up

1504
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:51,520
over and over again. um or avo um

1505
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:54,800
something that maybe could be an

1506
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:55,960
optimistic outcome is that like software

1507
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,079
is a

1508
00:52:55,960 --> 00:53:00,640
languageoriented I mean discipline and

1509
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:02,240
that's kind of why like top language

1510
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:03,920
based model is so good at doing it but

1511
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:05,920
there are things that aren't like analog

1512
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:08,480
circuit design is very visual and right

1513
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:11,200
now signal processing like training

1514
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:13,280
machine learning models with like images

1515
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:16,240
and things is a lot more difficult so

1516
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:17,760
for at least a few decades hopefully

1517
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:20,160
analog circuit design and other things

1518
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:23,040
that are related to hardware will be um

1519
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:26,800
good skills probably to teach kids and

1520
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:28,960
to build like decent fields to work in.

1521
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:30,720
Also, even though there are co-pilot

1522
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:34,000
things for things like cadence that does

1523
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:35,920
like um layout for like semiconductor

1524
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,440
chips or whatever, I don't think they're

1525
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:42,000
good. I also don't know how they work.

1526
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:44,319
So a more strong emphasis on teaching

1527
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:48,400
kids kind of like the basics of how the

1528
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:50,640
things that they are I guess catering to

1529
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:53,839
if tattoo actually work. What I'm trying

1530
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:56,880
to say is that I hope that people like

1531
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:58,559
have this shift towards understanding

1532
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:01,200
how things work from the bottom instead

1533
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:03,680
of the top which is good because then

1534
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:05,760
you can build things from ground up.

1535
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:07,680
Wow. Great. Yeah, I like that. What were

1536
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:09,359
you gonna say? I don't know. I'm just I

1537
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:11,119
have a I have a disagreement with the

1538
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:13,200
analog circuit design, but that's just

1539
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:15,440
purely because anything because it's

1540
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:17,680
still a visual software that's doing it.

1541
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:20,400
So there is some translation that could

1542
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:21,760
be considered. It's like probably I do

1543
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,040
know a couple of analog circuit design

1544
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,960
softwares that just translate down to

1545
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:27,040
XML and you can just stick that XML

1546
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:30,000
which is a structured object oriented

1547
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:32,079
language into chat GP get new XML back

1548
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,760
validate that it's correct see it and

1549
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:36,800
it'll probably produce a correct circuit

1550
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:39,280
in some capacity. But can you like I

1551
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:40,559
mean where are you starting when you get

1552
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:42,079
like designing the amplifier or

1553
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:44,720
something?

1554
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:46,400
Um it's it's starting from you have well

1555
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:48,240
the same thing when you started now. Not

1556
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,760
nobody had code when it first started.

1557
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:52,079
You would have whatever data set of

1558
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:54,640
people has all their amplifier files

1559
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:56,559
that are all lined up whatever it is.

1560
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:59,200
Then you would ha then you would decide

1561
00:54:56,559 --> 00:55:00,559
okay let's get the let's get the textual

1562
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:03,200
representation of this in some

1563
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:04,400
syntactical language which XML was just

1564
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,559
one that came to my head but it could be

1565
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:08,400
anything that can represent the image in

1566
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:10,160
text form since that's all the software

1567
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:11,640
is doing since it's just the inputs and

1568
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:14,079
outputs where you connect from wire a to

1569
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:16,559
wire wherever it is and that can usually

1570
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:19,280
be limited and then you take that text

1571
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:21,200
train the LM on it you run it through it

1572
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:23,040
you get some out you then say okay

1573
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:25,040
generate me an amplifier and it will

1574
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:26,079
generate you an amplifier with that XML,

1575
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:27,520
you put it back into the visual

1576
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:30,240
software. Now, look, you now have an

1577
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:32,240
amplifier. Okay. My new hope is that all

1578
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:35,400
of this becomes proprietary and they

1579
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:35,400
don't like,

1580
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,359
you know, and I think what's what to me

1581
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:41,040
what from an educator's point of view,

1582
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:43,040
what's so sort of challenging about

1583
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:44,640
these kinds of questions is like I know

1584
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:46,000
nothing about your domain and so both of

1585
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:48,480
the cases that you just made seem

1586
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,559
totally plausible to me. um and that

1587
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:52,880
it's really hard pe people seem to be

1588
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:55,760
really bad at predicting the kinds of

1589
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:57,119
things um that AI are going to be useful

1590
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,480
for in the future like which of these

1591
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:00,559
problems are solvable and which are they

1592
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:03,359
not um so you can imagine somewhere out

1593
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:06,960
there there are people who like run the

1594
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:08,799
you know AET engineering um uh

1595
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:10,799
curriculum certification kinds of things

1596
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:12,160
or people who are department heads or or

1597
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:13,520
people who are writing textbooks or

1598
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:15,760
things like that like which of this

1599
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:17,200
stuff do we want to keep because human

1600
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:18,559
beings we'll still need human beings to

1601
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:20,640
So you know for the three categories

1602
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:22,559
which of the stuff is like nah like in

1603
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:24,000
the future just AI will build the c like

1604
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:25,359
it'll just tell the a you know you'll

1605
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,960
tell some machine learning system AI

1606
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:28,079
system the kind of circuit that you want

1607
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:29,119
and it'll print it out and so you don't

1608
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:32,240
really know that need to know that much

1609
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:33,839
about it. B um yeah an AI will probably

1610
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:35,359
print out most of these things but it's

1611
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:37,599
still useful for humans to be able to

1612
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:39,119
understand this thing um because that

1613
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:40,559
gives you some kind of insight about how

1614
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:42,640
you would build other technology other

1615
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:43,760
things like that. Um or no there's no

1616
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:45,200
way computers are going to be good at

1617
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:46,720
this stuff. We still need human beings

1618
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:48,720
kind of primarily to do it. like those

1619
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:50,559
are at least three categories of things.

1620
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:52,000
Um, and it's really hard to predict sort

1621
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:53,680
of which things move into which

1622
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,480
categories. And it's very difficult to

1623
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:58,160
get education systems to be good um at

1624
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:59,520
doing new kinds of things, which is why

1625
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:01,760
like most of the schools that you went

1626
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:03,200
to um you know had very little computer

1627
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,880
science education and stuff like that,

1628
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:06,400
you know, because in the 19th century

1629
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:07,920
when we designed high schools, there

1630
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:10,319
wasn't computer science and so we didn't

1631
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:11,680
put it in the curriculum. Um and uh and

1632
00:57:10,319 --> 00:57:12,960
we're a lot better at doing the kinds of

1633
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:15,240
things we've done before than doing new

1634
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:17,680
kinds of things.

1635
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:19,839
Um all right good. Were there other

1636
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:22,960
observations or thoughts about that? I

1637
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:25,599
think it can technology can u bring

1638
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:27,640
about change in the legal system. So a

1639
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:30,559
lot of people

1640
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:33,760
um lawyers spend a lot of time reading

1641
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:36,799
stuff and building upon that uh for a

1642
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:39,119
specific case. So and that's what

1643
00:57:36,799 --> 00:57:41,520
determines their career. How big you get

1644
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:44,480
and is depends on how much you've read,

1645
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:46,400
how much you've experienced. So if all

1646
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:50,000
this knowledge is really available to

1647
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:52,079
them uh for a specific test case then

1648
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,319
probably it's going to make their lives

1649
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:56,559
much more easier. Yeah. You know I think

1650
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:58,880
some of the sort of framework that that

1651
00:57:56,559 --> 00:58:00,799
Levy and Maine offer also help us think

1652
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:02,000
about like what kinds of things will

1653
00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:03,839
lawyers need to be good at in the

1654
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,319
future. Like to me it strikes me as very

1655
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:10,319
unlikely that computers will have much

1656
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:13,040
impact on the part of trial lawyer work.

1657
00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:14,960
Um which is convincing juries of things.

1658
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:16,640
Um like like the people who actually

1659
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:18,960
like get in front of juries and try

1660
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:20,640
cases and things like that. Um like it's

1661
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:22,400
very unlikely that we'll have you know

1662
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:24,160
AI machines that generate scripts for

1663
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:26,559
them or things like that because that

1664
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:28,160
kind of persuasive complex communication

1665
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:30,720
seems to be the domain in which human

1666
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:33,200
beings are most specialized at. Um we

1667
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:36,480
probably like you know expert thinking

1668
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:39,680
seems to be the domain in which you know

1669
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:41,280
um like I'm sure you know like like are

1670
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:44,160
people going to write AI software that

1671
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:46,480
detects tax loopholes? Um absolutely

1672
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:48,160
like somebody is going to you know um

1673
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:49,680
you know come up with all kinds of new

1674
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:51,760
ways that you know they're much faster

1675
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:54,559
at humans at finding ways to defeat the

1676
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:57,440
tax code. Um but there probably still be

1677
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:59,200
human beings um who for instance recogni

1678
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:02,319
like who who are much better at machines

1679
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:04,799
at recognizing like oh well like this

1680
00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:07,119
part might be like stri slightly

1681
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:09,920
strictly illegal but because of the way

1682
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:12,319
or like like like un like its legality

1683
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:14,000
is not tested but I happen to know

1684
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:15,680
because of everything that I know about

1685
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,040
like the functioning of society that

1686
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:18,880
like this is a particularly weak point

1687
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:22,319
in the tax code and would be a good

1688
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:24,559
place to um you know uh uh shelter or

1689
00:59:22,319 --> 00:59:26,079
profits and those kinds of things. Um,

1690
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:28,480
and then there does seem to be some kind

1691
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:31,680
like the more the more a legal task

1692
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:34,319
veers into the routine category um the

1693
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:35,920
more it's it's uh hey we just need to

1694
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:37,440
you know know how many times in these

1695
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:39,040
documents these things are said or

1696
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:41,040
something like that. Um but it is I mean

1697
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:43,440
to me it's useful to recognize that like

1698
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:46,880
I mean people were people were stressed

1699
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:48,559
about that in in 2017

1700
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:50,720
um you know with the machine learning

1701
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:52,240
techn so like like there's still lawyers

1702
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:54,319
in the United States there's still law

1703
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:57,440
schools like our legal system has not

1704
00:59:54,319 --> 00:59:59,359
you know profoundly changed from um from

1705
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:01,680
what machine learning offered in fact I

1706
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:03,920
think like legal education has probably

1707
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:05,200
barely changed at all um on the basis of

1708
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:06,480
these things except maybe you could like

1709
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,680
take it I don't know this for sure I

1710
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,960
have no expertise in this but I assume

1711
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:10,240
you could like take an elective in

1712
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:11,680
computers in the law or something like

1713
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:13,240
that or machine learning and the law now

1714
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:16,640
that you wouldn't be able to do

1715
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:18,640
before. Do you guys some thoughts? Yeah.

1716
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:20,319
Uh in terms of the first in terms of

1717
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:22,160
when you initially say back about

1718
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:24,240
lawyers and being a and not being able

1719
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:26,079
to generate scripts. Yeah, I would very

1720
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:27,920
much agree. There was actually um

1721
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:30,240
there's actually a case where I think

1722
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:31,680
two lawyers got heavily sanctioned. I

1723
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:33,119
think it was with the airport where they

1724
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:35,440
pretty much just tried to generate an

1725
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:37,200
entire script purely through tax. I

1726
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:39,839
think it I think it was a filing and I

1727
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:41,599
think the filing included uh like fake

1728
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:44,000
citations and stuff like that which is

1729
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:45,119
really not the best.

1730
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,280
Yeah, and you could definitely see it

1731
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:49,280
where basically if you give it you could

1732
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:52,000
basically make a much better search

1733
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:53,520
database using if you happen to stick in

1734
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,440
all these thousands of cases where all

1735
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:56,880
the where all the lawyers are where all

1736
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:59,359
these lawyers are pretty much having

1737
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:01,760
decisions that change and ones and maybe

1738
01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:04,079
one that benefits your benefits your

1739
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:06,240
stance could have been ruled on earlier

1740
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:08,079
on earlier on in that year. Maybe it's

1741
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:09,680
for the specific county there something

1742
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:11,520
different. You can definitely I

1743
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:12,720
definitely see that in the future. I

1744
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:15,040
don't know even if within that five

1745
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:17,760
years. Yeah. Being a being able to like

1746
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:20,160
being able to do scans of precedents for

1747
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:21,359
a case or something like that. Um maybe

1748
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:23,599
one other domain we should talk about

1749
01:01:21,359 --> 01:01:25,680
before we head out is just um you know

1750
01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:27,359
one of one of the biggest places in

1751
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:30,000
which we will see pushes in the K12

1752
01:01:27,359 --> 01:01:32,799
education system with new tools will be

1753
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,319
in formative feedback for writing. Um

1754
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:35,839
there going to be many there are many

1755
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:37,520
many people right now who are building

1756
01:01:35,839 --> 01:01:39,520
systems so that like you assign students

1757
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:41,599
to write an essay they turn in the essay

1758
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:43,599
to you and or before they turn in the

1759
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:46,079
essay to you um you offer a bunch of

1760
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:48,319
formative feedback um and I'm very

1761
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:51,119
interested in the development of these

1762
01:01:48,319 --> 01:01:53,200
systems I was talking with the

1763
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:54,799
um someone who's building one at UC

1764
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:57,440
Irvine and I guess I was reading about

1765
01:01:54,799 --> 01:01:58,960
some others too. Um it struck me that

1766
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:02,240
one of the things that these systems

1767
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:06,240
have the capacity of doing um is saying

1768
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:07,680
something like here are 10 or 15 or 100

1769
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:10,559
things that I want you to check for

1770
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:13,520
every essay. Um does it you know does

1771
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:15,440
the does a paragraph start with a topic

1772
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:17,280
sentence? Um is there a transition

1773
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:18,640
sentence between does the paragraph seem

1774
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:20,559
like it has evidence? Does the

1775
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:23,040
introduction appear to have a thesis?

1776
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:24,160
Um, does the conclusion tie? You know,

1777
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:25,680
you can think about all the things that

1778
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:27,720
you've been ever been taught to write.

1779
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:31,599
Um, a thing that I'm really interested

1780
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:32,480
in is that I my hunch is I mean I

1781
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:34,559
thought about these a lot because a lot

1782
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:37,119
of what I do is grade writing um give

1783
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:38,960
feedback on writing is that like some of

1784
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:40,720
this sort of seems intuitively helpful

1785
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:42,880
to me like oh it would be great if I

1786
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:45,200
could just tell students like hey before

1787
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:47,119
you turn in your your assignment like go

1788
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:48,720
run it through this thing and make sure

1789
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:50,400
that the beginning of every paragraph

1790
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:51,760
has a topic sentence even better than a

1791
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,960
topic sentence some kind of mini thesis

1792
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:54,880
something that presents the argument of

1793
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:56,880
the paragraph. Um, but I was thinking

1794
01:02:54,880 --> 01:03:00,480
too like probably the most important

1795
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:04,640
thing that I do when I give feedback to

1796
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:06,799
someone, um, is figure out of the dozens

1797
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:08,480
of things I could comment on, which one

1798
01:03:06,799 --> 01:03:09,839
I will choose to comment on. Like one of

1799
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:11,359
the things I've learned about as a

1800
01:03:09,839 --> 01:03:14,400
writing teacher over the years is like

1801
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:15,680
it is really not helpful to tell someone

1802
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:17,119
everything they've gotten, you know,

1803
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:18,640
they can improve in their essay because

1804
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:20,000
that's just too much stuff to work on. I

1805
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:21,920
mean, you guys note that like I don't I

1806
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,359
mean, I I used to have people turn in

1807
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:25,359
printed essays and I used to like make

1808
01:03:23,359 --> 01:03:26,960
marks on them and things like that. Um,

1809
01:03:25,359 --> 01:03:28,960
but I found over the years like really

1810
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:31,039
what I want to do is be like these are

1811
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:33,839
the two things that you want to work on.

1812
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:35,599
Um, and how do I decide what those two

1813
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:38,079
things are? Like I sort of have in my

1814
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:39,599
head a model of people's developmental

1815
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:42,640
trajectory and some of that model is

1816
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:44,079
based on like all MIT students ever. Um,

1817
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:45,440
like you know when I see an essay that

1818
01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:46,640
looks like this, I'm pretty sure the

1819
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:48,079
next thing they should work on is blank.

1820
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:49,839
And then as soon as I've gotten like two

1821
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:51,200
pieces of writing from someone, then I

1822
01:03:49,839 --> 01:03:52,720
can be like, "Well, the thing you were

1823
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:54,240
working on last time was this. Why don't

1824
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:55,680
you work on it more? Here's like the

1825
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:57,359
next thing after that to work on or

1826
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:59,680
something like that." Um, that seems

1827
01:03:57,359 --> 01:04:01,839
like the kind of discernment. It seems

1828
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:05,680
way way easier to me to program a

1829
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:07,520
machine that can like find every kind of

1830
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:08,880
problem than it is to program a machine

1831
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:10,480
that can figure out like what are the

1832
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:13,359
next two problems you should be working

1833
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:14,559
on as a learner. um based on you know

1834
01:04:13,359 --> 01:04:15,920
who you are or where I think you're

1835
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:17,440
heading or what's important for my class

1836
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:20,079
or other things like that. I feel like

1837
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:21,920
that opens up the idea of um breaking

1838
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:24,480
out of the trap of routine assessment.

1839
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:26,079
Um if a computer can do those type of

1840
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:28,240
things, then maybe teachers can now

1841
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:30,799
focus more on what does revision look

1842
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:33,039
like? Um, so like a student, you know,

1843
01:04:30,799 --> 01:04:34,319
goes through an essay or writes an essay

1844
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:36,640
and then puts it through this machine

1845
01:04:34,319 --> 01:04:39,119
and the machine tells you like, oh, and

1846
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:40,880
these introduction sentences like they

1847
01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:42,480
could be stronger in X, Y, and Z ways

1848
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:45,359
and how do you develop those critical

1849
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:48,480
thinking skills to take something and

1850
01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:49,839
feedback and perform it or like change

1851
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:51,200
it in some way? Like you were always

1852
01:04:49,839 --> 01:04:53,359
saying like anything that you published

1853
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:55,280
was never your first draft. You said

1854
01:04:53,359 --> 01:04:57,280
like on day one, one of your good skills

1855
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:59,280
was being able to just like get down a

1856
01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:02,160
first draft, right? CHBT can do the same

1857
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:03,680
for you. But how do we teach people in a

1858
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:05,680
world where AI can give you that

1859
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:10,000
baseline? How do we elevate it to a

1860
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:11,359
status that like is like acceptable for

1861
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,359
like a human? Like I feel like there's

1862
01:05:11,359 --> 01:05:15,280
like AI can give us a baseline, but

1863
01:05:13,359 --> 01:05:17,119
humans take that imagination and

1864
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:19,200
creativity to that next step. And so you

1865
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:20,880
can kind of take the idea of like here's

1866
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:22,559
an essay. How would you change it to

1867
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:24,720
make it even better? Yeah. I you know

1868
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:26,720
for for these writing software

1869
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:28,400
developers I I mean a big well when I

1870
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:30,079
talk to them I think about like what is

1871
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:32,000
the whole system that you're

1872
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:34,720
constructing like not every capacity

1873
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:36,000
that you build will end up being useful

1874
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:37,520
not just because it doesn't work but

1875
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,440
because like using it is not that

1876
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:40,720
helpful you start thinking things like

1877
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:41,839
all right what if there is a what if

1878
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:44,640
there are these sort of you know

1879
01:05:41,839 --> 01:05:47,760
formative feedback systems um where I as

1880
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:51,039
an instructor can say like okay um you

1881
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:54,319
know start this package of uh um

1882
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:56,240
machines or something like that or or uh

1883
01:05:54,319 --> 01:05:58,640
I select in advance that I want the

1884
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:59,760
machine to give you know to give to

1885
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:01,039
automatically give you formative

1886
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:02,640
feedback on these things and then on

1887
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:04,000
this other class of things I want you to

1888
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:05,839
show me the feedback that you would give

1889
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,440
to a student but I will pick from those

1890
01:06:05,839 --> 01:06:08,880
things and then there'll be some way for

1891
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:10,960
me to sort of add to it like some of

1892
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:13,680
those sort of human machine combinations

1893
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:19,319
seem pretty exciting to me good um well

1894
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:19,319
why don't we wrap there for the Okay.
