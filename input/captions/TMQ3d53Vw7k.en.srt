1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:05,520
so my name is Ricardo herul and I'm here

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:08,559
on behalf of latinx at the broad

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,599
presenting our current Speaker Dr Diego

4
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:11,880
Fernandez and his talk title will be

5
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:15,120
called time peeping in the brain and how

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:18,080
our internal clocks shape mood so just a

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,640
reminder uh we are latinx at the broad

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:24,119
um Russell can you see my slides is it

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,880
being presented yep yep so it's called

10
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:28,720
latinx at the broad and we are here and

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,759
we work on behalf of latinx community at

12
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:34,000
the broad and we would like to promote

13
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:36,160
diversity building Community among

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,360
latinx broes and empowering members of

15
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,520
latinx community we have several events

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,559
and we like to Foster collaboration we

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,200
allow opportunities to network and

18
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:47,079
visibility for role models in diverse

19
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,559
communities we also like to promote the

20
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:51,199
research that we do in our communities

21
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:53,039
and highlight latinx and diverse

22
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:55,399
researchers so today we'll have our

23
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,840
speaker Dr Diego Fernandez speaking

24
00:00:55,399 --> 00:01:00,079
about timekeeping in the brain and how

25
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:02,480
our internal clock shapes our mood so

26
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,479
just as a brief introduction for Dr

27
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,400
Diego

28
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:08,040
Fernandez uh he's a neuroscience

29
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,439
researcher studying sensory biology and

30
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,119
circadian rhythms his lab is broadly

31
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:14,400
interested in understanding how the body

32
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:16,000
and brain encode environmental stimuli

33
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,759
such as daily changes in light and

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,040
feeding patterns and timely coordinate

35
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,360
physiology and behavior he obtained his

36
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,520
PhD dur um from the University of Buenos

37
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,840
cetes Argentina and worked in

38
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,680
identifying ishemic conditioning as a

39
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,600
strategy to amarate the damage caused by

40
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,000
ishemic retinal pathology ology such as

41
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,720
diabetic retinopathy his doctoral work

42
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,439
earned local and international Awards

43
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,759
including the PE award and the Eduardo

44
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,280
stto award in recognition of the best

45
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,320
national Works in Opthalmology and

46
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,079
Neuroscience respectively in addition he

47
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,439
had the honor of receiving the Ricardo

48
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:51,920
miledi Neuroscience training program

49
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:54,600
Fellowship he's currently at Cincinnati

50
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,360
at the division of

51
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,079
pediatric Opthalmology and he's going to

52
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,719
talk to us more about circadian rhythms

53
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:05,560
take it away Dr Fernandez okay thank you

54
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:07,840
Ricardo for the nice introduction and

55
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,840
for the invitation

56
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,640
I I really appreciate the work you're

57
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:16,519
doing I think that having these

58
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:18,599
communities is fantastic and I strongly

59
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:20,599
support you and your team on on

60
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:22,720
continuing on this

61
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:25,680
path

62
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:28,160
um for today's talk I put together some

63
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,000
of my work as a staff scientist when I

64
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,560
was a dni

65
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,040
and some new research we have here

66
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:38,560
Cincinnati Children

67
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:40,800
Hospital I opened the lab in 2023 it's

68
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:44,640
not even two years so if you guys have

69
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,760
any questions about starting a lab under

70
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,840
difficult conditions I'll be happy to

71
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:52,599
discuss at the end you have my email and

72
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:57,239
contact information so more than happy

73
00:02:52,599 --> 00:03:00,480
to help in anyways um the title reflects

74
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:02,640
part of the talk and as regard said we

75
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,799
are broadly interested in the connection

76
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:09,040
of the environment with the internal

77
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:12,680
rhythms in in in in the body so here is

78
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:16,760
the conceptual framework that we use for

79
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:20,159
ask questions to our animal model M

80
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:22,959
always with a translational idea in mind

81
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,840
trying to think how this fundamental

82
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,319
research that we do in the lab can

83
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,840
impact uh human health and in particular

84
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:32,920
in a pediatric hospital how this can

85
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,920
improve the quality of patients that are

86
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:38,319
for example in the niku OR in intensive

87
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:41,640
care units for a long period of

88
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:43,400
time as I mentioned we are trying to

89
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:46,120
understand the mechanisms that integrate

90
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:48,560
external signals and internal signals

91
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:51,159
that can be defined as time cues time Q

92
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,959
is something that um has a temporal

93
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:55,879
component okay if we think about changes

94
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:58,319
in light daily changes in light and

95
00:03:55,879 --> 00:04:00,640
temperature these are external time cues

96
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,239
affecting our Behavior internally there

97
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,959
are rhythms of

98
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:07,599
hormones pretty much every cell has a

99
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:10,079
physiological process that can be

100
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:13,200
associated with Cadian function or these

101
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:15,319
rhythmic daily changes so how these two

102
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,680
events that have a temporary component

103
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:20,040
are integrated to affect animal

104
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,479
physiology and ultimately affecting

105
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,560
behavioral responses is the main focus

106
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,960
of our

107
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,560
research from a fundamental perspective

108
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,759
we are always

109
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,520
thinking what what is the impact in

110
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:35,960
nature of these different time cues I

111
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,199
just picked one of my favorite behaviors

112
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:41,440
in nature orcas in the thousand of

113
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:45,240
Argentina where they are teaching other

114
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:48,120
animals how to catch these sea lions um

115
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,240
if you think about the different time

116
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,639
cues in the environment is is extremely

117
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:56,120
complex and all these variables are

118
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:59,199
affecting one simple Behavior simple in

119
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,960
terms of the the decision making process

120
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,360
and the effectiveness of the

121
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,000
behavior we can think about the time of

122
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,919
day so this is early in the morning

123
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,759
around 6:00 a.m. when the light has a

124
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,639
particular wavelength there is a

125
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,320
particular temperature there are social

126
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:16,960
structures of the orcas but also the sea

127
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:20,160
lies so all these components that also

128
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:22,520
have a learning component are impacting

129
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,680
animal physiology learning from the

130
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:27,840
experiences and anticipating what the

131
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:30,319
other animal is probably doing and

132
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:34,759
directing the actions the more

133
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:37,680
translational approach we can now apply

134
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:39,919
the same idea to shei workers as I

135
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,199
mentioned we're here in in a hospital

136
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:46,360
where we see every day um hundred of

137
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:48,639
people sheep workers that each week for

138
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,880
example they have different time of day

139
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,240
when they are here in the hospital I'm

140
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:57,039
assuming that most of them have social

141
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:59,479
cues family kids whatever they the

142
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,759
social structure is that is dictating

143
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:05,520
their Behavior so the consequences they

144
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:07,880
are exposed to abnormal time cues okay

145
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,080
light exposure for example feeding

146
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,039
patterns and social cues are completely

147
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,479
desynchronized and this is changing

148
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:18,800
every every week and they can be under

149
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:22,080
this uh irregular conditions for years

150
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:24,720
just to give you a few uh numbers uh

151
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,080
it's about 60% of total workers in the

152
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,080
US under different irregular life

153
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:32,280
conditions we have shift workers people

154
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:33,960
working at night rotating shift and it's

155
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:37,240
very interesting I recommend you reading

156
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:41,560
this report more than 40% of these

157
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:45,039
populations are minorities so it's a

158
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:46,960
it's a severe environmental stressor

159
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:49,800
there is impact in their physiology in

160
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:52,560
the long term in the lab we care about

161
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,000
the impact on the brain and in fact

162
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,360
there

163
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,080
is recent interest in in understanding

164
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,560
the connection of circadian rhythms

165
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:03,599
circadian disruption and mental health

166
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,919
and I highlighted here couple of

167
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:08,039
examples these are amazing groups doing

168
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:10,280
research in animal models but also in

169
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:12,919
humans where they are trying to

170
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,680
understand the link between Cadian

171
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:16,960
disruptions alterations in the clock

172
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:20,360
chains that dictate these rhythmic

173
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:23,160
functions and mental health I put few

174
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:25,520
examples here involving maor depression

175
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:28,360
schizophrenia bipolar disorder but in

176
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,160
all cases the remaining question the key

177
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:33,120
question here is whether the death

178
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,360
deficits in clock gen or in these cican

179
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,120
functions are parts of the ethology of

180
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,440
the pathologist or a consequence of the

181
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:43,560
disorder so we are trying to understand

182
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:46,560
whether this deficit trigger the the the

183
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:48,680
the brain disorders or they are part as

184
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:52,039
a consequence of the

185
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:53,919
disorders so in this slide I this is my

186
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:55,240
attempt to explain you a little bit more

187
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:58,919
about

188
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:02,280
blockchains um it's a fantastic process

189
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:04,879
in in in in in in the cells where

190
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:06,960
transcription factors in this case clock

191
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,120
and vml and again this is a very

192
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,400
simplified version so it's just to give

193
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,000
you a brief idea of the

194
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:16,599
mechanism transcription factors buy into

195
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,319
ebo regions inducing the expression of

196
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:21,280
per cry and other genes that are also

197
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:25,039
transcription factor that once in the

198
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,599
coplas they can bind form this complex

199
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,440
that eventually translocate into the

200
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:31,280
nucleus and with time there is

201
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:34,000
accumulation of them in the nucleus and

202
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,039
eventually they block and inhibit the

203
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,919
activity of clock and vount and

204
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:40,039
therefore they repress their own

205
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:43,560
expression so as you can see it's a

206
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:46,200
beautiful cycle where where cry genes

207
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:49,160
are actively controlling their own

208
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:51,839
expression so the result is we can

209
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,760
measure in the lab rhythms of these

210
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,760
genes so we have some positive and

211
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,800
negative Loops of the same cycle and

212
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,880
when we overlap then we see that

213
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,880
sometimes they have different faces or

214
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,079
the peak of expression is not at the

215
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:08,040
same time of day but what they have in

216
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:11,279
common is that the peak of expression is

217
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:14,079
always close to 24 hours this is why we

218
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:16,399
refer to them as clock jeans Cadian jein

219
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:19,680
circad DM close to 24

220
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:22,800
hours the reason why it's 24 is because

221
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:26,200
of the solar day okay so in mammals we

222
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:28,040
have this central dogma in chronobiology

223
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,760
where we Define Central clock in the

224
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:33,160
brain that oversees the rhythmic

225
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:35,360
function of peripheral clocks located

226
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:38,120
throughout the body and the central

227
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,760
clock in particular is detecting and

228
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:42,600
receiving information from the retina so

229
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:45,800
light information and changes in light

230
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:48,160
dark Cycles are aligning or affecting

231
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:50,760
the expression of the clock chain in the

232
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:53,120
central Pacemaker and therefore aligning

233
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:55,600
this clock with the environment the

234
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,880
result is that the scn communicates then

235
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,600
with peripheral

236
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:02,200
clocks controlling this organized uh

237
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,680
circadian

238
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,120
system I put a video here just to show

239
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,079
you some of the techniques that we use

240
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,640
in the LA this is a mouse line generated

241
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:13,120
by the tahash LA where one of the clock

242
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:17,760
chains per two is fused to the reporter

243
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:20,839
chain luciferase so we can see in xbo

244
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:23,279
preparations R micity of these U neurons

245
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:24,880
in the scn in the supermatic nucleus

246
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:28,000
that houses the central

247
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:30,399
pacemaker through neuronal and humoral

248
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,160
signals the central B maker communicates

249
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:35,279
with these peripheral clocks in order to

250
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:39,360
align their function with the external

251
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:41,160
lter cycle so this is a clear um U

252
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,480
structure where there is a hierarchical

253
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:46,839
order light affects the Central

254
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:49,600
basemaker Central basemaker then

255
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:52,880
virtually coordinates every cell in the

256
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:55,680
organism in recent years there's been

257
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,880
U an interest in in understanding more

258
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,560
about the gene expression the clock gene

259
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:02,399
expression in the brain in

260
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,600
I'll be talking about mice most of

261
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:07,600
during most of my talk and in this

262
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:09,600
review you can see that we have now a

263
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,880
deeper understanding of these different

264
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,519
clocks and eke keeping mechanisms in the

265
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:18,279
brain that are not exclusively located

266
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:20,600
in the supermatic MS okay so these are

267
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:23,000
several examples I'm not going to give

268
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:25,440
you more details about J is the

269
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,200
fascinated area of research if you want

270
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,560
to learn more but what we know is that

271
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,760
these different clocks are responding to

272
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,399
different environmental cues in this

273
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:37,320
review they highlight the impact of

274
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:39,200
light food activity different hormones

275
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,560
so it is clear that the environment

276
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,000
plays an active role in coordinating

277
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:45,600
these internal clocks in the brain and

278
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,639
the question is how now the central

279
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,519
pacemaker communicate with these

280
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:53,320
peripheral clocks located in the brain

281
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:55,639
in our lab we focus on the light effect

282
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:57,839
is one of the strongest time cues in

283
00:11:55,639 --> 00:12:00,560
nature and as I mentioned we have a

284
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,959
particular interest in in in populations

285
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,920
exposed to irregular light conditions as

286
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:09,320
shef workers or pediatric patients in in

287
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:12,959
nus where they are Overexposed to

288
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:15,199
light to Briefly summarize um the rinal

289
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:17,079
brain circuits involving image detection

290
00:12:15,199 --> 00:12:19,320
we can start with the retina where

291
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:21,800
classic photo receptors broad cones

292
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:24,000
detect light these signals are

293
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:26,360
ultimately roted to the gangon cells the

294
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,920
rinal gangon cells and these projection

295
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:32,519
neurons innovates areas in the brain

296
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:35,920
that directly involved in image forming

297
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:37,560
functions we visual animals so the

298
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:41,399
association between light and image

299
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:43,120
Waring processes is very direct but we

300
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:45,240
also know that there are projections to

301
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,839
other centers as I mentioned the Supra

302
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:51,800
asmatic nuc that controls picity in the

303
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:53,920
brain and the body but more importantly

304
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:57,320
uh these neurons that project to the

305
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:59,920
central pacemaker were identified about

306
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:02,120
20 years ago and they are subpopulation

307
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:05,199
of ganglin cells that are at the same

308
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:07,600
time photo receptors so we can Define

309
00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:09,480
them as a typical photo receptors or

310
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,680
intrinsically photosensitive rinal

311
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,959
gangling cells or

312
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,199
ipgs what is important to know about

313
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:19,040
these neurons is that they express a for

314
00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:22,360
a pigment that is called melanopsin opm4

315
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:24,240
so these animals expressing melanopsin

316
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:26,600
in this gangling cells can directly

317
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,399
detect light through the melanopsin

318
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,639
expression and roting this information

319
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,959
to the brain

320
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:35,760
they also have connections with uh

321
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:37,760
neurons that process Road cones signals

322
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,320
so at the end they are integrating Road

323
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,440
code information and melanops

324
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:43,120
independent

325
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:46,079
information this cocktail of light

326
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:49,199
detection signals is rooted to the brain

327
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:51,680
to the scn but also to other areas in

328
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:54,600
the brain as shown in this schematic

329
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,920
diagram of the mouse brain in I would

330
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,720
say the last 10 15 years many many

331
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,839
groups including us have been actively

332
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,519
working

333
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,959
in understanding more about this uh

334
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:06,759
connectivity of the iprgcs the melanops

335
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:09,880
in expressing Neons and different brain

336
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:12,759
areas that as you can see goes beyond

337
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:15,000
thec um you can probably pick your

338
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:17,399
favorite brain area and it's on the list

339
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,120
here what is important about this

340
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:22,800
circuitry is the fact that light can now

341
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:25,040
directly impact the function of brain

342
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,600
areas that play complete different roles

343
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:30,199
as an example we have the amigdala

344
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,920
probably involved in stress responses we

345
00:14:30,199 --> 00:14:34,839
have the lateral havena the peral gray

346
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:38,199
Superior calculus as I mentioned son

347
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:39,959
inserta so there is a variety of regions

348
00:14:38,199 --> 00:14:43,199
in the brain that are now detecting

349
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:44,440
light through the iprgc projections and

350
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,800
we know that these are different

351
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:50,160
populations of

352
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:52,839
ipas so we propos as a conceptual

353
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,199
framework for our studies that different

354
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:57,639
populations of neurons in the retina

355
00:14:55,199 --> 00:15:01,320
directly inovate brain centers that are

356
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:03,519
involved in driving distinct behavioral

357
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:06,120
responses we know a lot about the

358
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:08,240
connections with the scn and we are

359
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:11,120
getting more more information about

360
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,839
direct rinal projections to other brain

361
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,880
oscillators that can probably under the

362
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,199
control of the SCM so we have a

363
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:20,240
beautiful uh scenario where these

364
00:15:18,199 --> 00:15:22,279
centers can integrate external and

365
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:26,639
internal signals through rinal

366
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:29,279
projections and SC signals going back to

367
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:31,680
the idea of irregular light exposure we

368
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:34,120
can now hypothesize that the different

369
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:37,199
deficits Associated to irregular light

370
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:40,240
exposure as was extensively describing

371
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:42,319
shift workers is in fact the result of

372
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,440
different circuits in the brain that

373
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:46,839
receive information from the retina but

374
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:50,240
through par Ral

375
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:51,000
Pathways so to further explore this idea

376
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,040
this

377
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:58,079
hypothesis we characterize when I

378
00:15:54,040 --> 00:16:01,440
started my bog um different Pathways by

379
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:04,920
which light can impact different brain

380
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,959
centers in this direction we identify an

381
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:09,880
over region in the the brain that is

382
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:11,959
densely inovated by the retina um we

383
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:14,759
call this region the paven nucleus of

384
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:17,160
the dorsal Thalamus and here you can see

385
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:21,160
images of coronal sections of the mouse

386
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:24,160
brain and in this uh horizontal plane

387
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:26,759
where using CTV injected into the eye we

388
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:29,639
can now trace the projection of all the

389
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:31,639
gangling cells in the retina so you have

390
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:34,240
dense projections to the chenlate area

391
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:37,240
as expected visual centers connections

392
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:40,240
to the proctal area but also these

393
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:42,240
fibers that densely inovate the phb as

394
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:45,399
you can see most of the inovation and

395
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:48,040
most of the synaptic contacts are in the

396
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:50,600
dorsal thamus and only a few fibers

397
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:52,399
penetrate the lateral avend so we did

398
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,319
experiments to confirm that the

399
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,639
connections are mostly with thalamic

400
00:16:54,319 --> 00:17:01,279
neurons and we also confirmed that these

401
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:03,959
are mostly ipes we use a battery of of

402
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:06,240
tracing strategies to confirm that the

403
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:08,919
iprs the melanops in expressing neuron

404
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:11,480
represent probably more than 80% of the

405
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:14,360
rinal neurons innovating the

406
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:17,280
PHP so what about the neurons in the

407
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:19,880
dorsal Thalamus responding to light what

408
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:23,240
what is their function what do they

409
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:25,880
project we run a battery of tracing

410
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:29,480
experiments again where we use

411
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:31,360
um viruses adenos Associated viruses to

412
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:33,960
trace the projection of these light

413
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,720
detecting neurons in the dorsal Thalamus

414
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,840
and we found an interesting pattern of

415
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:40,480
connectivity with areas in the

416
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,720
prefrontal cortex the pedial cortex

417
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:45,080
dorsal Statum and nucleus

418
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:49,240
Acom it's important to mention that

419
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:51,480
these brain areas are um key centers

420
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:54,640
involved in the pathophysiology of major

421
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:57,960
depression so we have an interesting um

422
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,919
framework where light through the r to

423
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:02,559
the thalamus and now to the cortex can

424
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:06,280
directly impact circuits in the in the

425
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:08,240
cortex that process emotional responses

426
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:10,520
to changes in the

427
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,320
environment The Next Step was to

428
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,840
manipulate the squids and learn more

429
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:17,840
about the consequences of activating or

430
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:20,640
inhibiting these cells in in in adult

431
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:23,320
M so one of the one of the strategies

432
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:26,120
that we used is The Chronic manipulation

433
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:29,280
of the cells using dread and to do that

434
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:31,720
we use viruses together with

435
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,919
um functional and and behavioral

436
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,840
analysis and in particular we use

437
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:38,400
viruses that expresses the thread

438
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,559
receptor in particular the GQ receptor

439
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,400
in phb neurons that project to the

440
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:45,640
prefrontal cors okay so by using

441
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:47,480
retroviruses injected the prefrontal

442
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:50,320
cortex and greed dependent viruses in

443
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:52,960
the PHP we were able to induce the

444
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:55,200
expression of reporter genes to identify

445
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:58,799
the neurons and the injection site but

446
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:01,799
more importantly the GQ receptor in this

447
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:05,039
phb neurons and after four weeks of the

448
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:07,159
injections we gave animals CNO to cause

449
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:09,919
The Chronic activation of The

450
00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:11,840
receptors the idea here was to house

451
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:13,960
animals in normal lighter Cycles as

452
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,679
represented here there are no changes in

453
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,159
the

454
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:19,799
environment but we took advantage of the

455
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:21,280
fact that animals are active at night

456
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:24,080
and this is when they are drinking most

457
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:26,480
of the water and eating the food so we

458
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:29,960
had the CNO in the drinking room during

459
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:32,120
14 days we measured the volume consumed

460
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:34,679
and we confirm The Chronic activation of

461
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:37,280
these phb neurons project to the cortex

462
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:39,600
exclusively at night okay so we are

463
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:42,159
generating a model of overactivation of

464
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,200
these um centers during the day

465
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:46,360
responding to natural light or

466
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:49,880
artificial light in this case and at

467
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:51,400
night the activation induced by the C

468
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,840
what we notice is that this chronic

469
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:56,080
activations severely impact the behavior

470
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,960
of the animals I'm showing you a few

471
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,760
examples with run a battery of

472
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,840
Behavioral t

473
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:04,960
and it's interesting to see that the for

474
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:07,679
test showed increasing Mobility time and

475
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:10,400
less preference for sucros in the sucus

476
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:13,679
preference test in animals that receive

477
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:16,880
the chronic CNO in drinking water so

478
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:20,400
collectively this data suggest that mood

479
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:24,159
aspects of these responses related to

480
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:26,520
anonia or the helplessness that you can

481
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:29,640
associate with this different test is

482
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:33,039
affected by chronically activating

483
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:35,200
PHP what about silencing theal okay here

484
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:38,120
we can talk about sufficiency but what

485
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:41,159
is the the need for these neurons to

486
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:44,000
drive responses to irregular light

487
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:45,760
conditions as you can imagine using

488
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,360
irregular light patterns in nocturnal

489
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:50,520
animals is always challenging so we

490
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:53,080
decided to implement the regular light

491
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:55,679
pattern that it's called t7 cycle is an

492
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:57,320
ultradian light dark cycle that presents

493
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,480
light and dark at different phases of

494
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:01,640
the mouse activity

495
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:04,080
in some aspects this is similar to a

496
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:06,280
shiw walk pattern where people have a

497
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,960
regular pattern of activity and they are

498
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:12,400
exposed to light and dark independently

499
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:15,000
of their activity so this t7 cycle was

500
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:17,840
applied for two weeks and is causing

501
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,320
severe deficits in mold so we wanted to

502
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:23,000
test what is the consequence of

503
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:25,400
silencing the PHP in my house under this

504
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,240
conditions to do that we use the tetanos

505
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,919
toxin strategy again using aen

506
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:32,440
Associated viruses so we can inject

507
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:35,279
viruses induced tanos toxin in these phb

508
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:37,279
neurons that can obviously still detect

509
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:40,679
light the Rina and the connection with

510
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:43,400
these camic neurons is intact but now

511
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:45,840
the detection of light cannot be roted

512
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:49,039
to any of their targets including the

513
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:52,720
prefrontal cortex so in some way we are

514
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:55,080
blocking this light detection pathway

515
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,200
animals four weeks after the injections

516
00:21:55,080 --> 00:22:00,400
were exposed to regular or irregular

517
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:03,000
lighter Cycles D7 cycle for two weeks

518
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:05,320
and we confirmed that the deficits

519
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,159
induced in in control animals with the

520
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:10,480
Shan virus are not present when we

521
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:12,919
silence the phb as you can see the

522
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:15,000
immobility time in the forcing test or

523
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:18,840
the preference for sucros was not

524
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,600
altered by just by silencing the phb and

525
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:22,960
housing animals to the

526
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:25,080
t7 even though this data is not

527
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:28,279
confirming that the scn or other brain

528
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:31,919
centers are not involved it's sufficient

529
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:34,520
to to prove that the phb is necessary

530
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:37,520
for driving the irregular light effects

531
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:41,120
of light on mood and the deficits that

532
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:43,640
we observed in minus so we have a

533
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,679
combination of results suggesting that

534
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:48,559
this region in the thalos is both

535
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:51,559
necessary and sufficient to drive

536
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:53,400
deficits associated with irregular light

537
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:55,440
exposure what about the rest of the

538
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,360
brain so that's a key question in

539
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,400
understanding how the these circuits can

540
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:03,159
probably work in I know well using the

541
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,640
t7 here is an schematic of the activity

542
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:08,640
of animals where you can see that they

543
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:10,440
are uh in a free running condition as we

544
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:14,120
call basically is an animal that is

545
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:16,840
displaying a robust rhythmic activity

546
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:19,760
with no changes in sleep architecture

547
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:22,120
and we also found and this is also

548
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:24,919
previous data published by the hatal lab

549
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:28,080
that in the scn if we measure clock je

550
00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:30,679
by immune stain by by qpcr there's a

551
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:32,880
beautiful rcity of clockin that is

552
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:35,480
preserved in Animals House in different

553
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:38,200
lighting conditions so again this is

554
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:40,200
confirming that The Irregular light

555
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,760
pattern even though is affecting the

556
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,520
behavior of the animal and it's

557
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,640
affecting some of the Circadian aspect

558
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,679
of the behavior is not disrupting the

559
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:50,640
central clock we assuming that the

560
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,200
output signals are also preserved the

561
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,240
next question is what happens with the

562
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:58,039
PHP well this is what we found when we

563
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:59,120
measure the perue expression in the PHP

564
00:23:58,039 --> 00:24:01,760
in this

565
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:04,080
thalamic Center we found first of all

566
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:06,320
that there is a nice and significant

567
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,320
rhythm of clock gene expression

568
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:11,039
particular perue expression in the in

569
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:14,039
the dorsal THS but more importantly we

570
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:16,840
found that the t7 cycle disrupted the

571
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:19,039
reges as you can see there is no

572
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:21,400
significant changes and there is a up

573
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:24,880
regulation of the expression of this

574
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:27,440
protein that as I mentioned before is in

575
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,720
some way the negative Loop of the

576
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,640
feedback of clock gen so higher

577
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:35,559
expression of per two can lead to

578
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:37,760
massive deficits in in in in thousand of

579
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:41,159
genes that are regulated by these

580
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:43,279
transcription factors so to have this um

581
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:47,120
overview of changes and widespread

582
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:49,919
effects we run bulk sequencing uh by

583
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:53,279
dissecting the phb and we focus on two

584
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:56,720
time points what we call ct2 ct14 so

585
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:59,240
circadian time 2 and 14 that indicates

586
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:01,120
phases of activity and inactiv

587
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:04,600
we are using infrared sensors in the

588
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:07,320
cages these are house single house mice

589
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:09,720
so we can precisely detect the onset of

590
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:11,080
the activity and then dissect the tissue

591
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:13,720
at the time we

592
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:16,679
want but you are seen in the lower panel

593
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:19,960
is a volcano plot for animals where the

594
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:22,799
tissue was collected at ct24 in normal

595
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:26,279
lighter cycles and when we compare these

596
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:28,960
different expression profiles we

597
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:32,240
found multiple Gene displaying these

598
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:34,520
rhythmic functions as you can see we

599
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,720
highlighted only a few but there are

600
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:39,679
hundred of genes that are significantly

601
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:42,320
AB regulated at night or during the day

602
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:44,880
so again this is reflecting phasic

603
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,240
changes in the tissue responding to

604
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,200
changes in the

605
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:52,000
environment we can then use these

606
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:55,360
significantly um up or down regulated

607
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:59,080
genes to learn more about the genology

608
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:00,960
and as expected we found Pathways

609
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:04,159
associated with Cadian rhythms and

610
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:07,840
classic and and fundamental cellular

611
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:10,240
processes doing gen gen seed enrichment

612
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:12,480
analysis we see pretty much similar

613
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,679
deficits sorry not deficits similar

614
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:18,000
changes associated with Gava

615
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:21,080
glutamatergic signaling and fundamental

616
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,840
processes cell biology the next question

617
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:25,360
is what happens with tissue collected

618
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:27,880
from t7 samples well this is what we

619
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:31,240
observed when we compare the samples

620
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:34,000
collected that ct14 versus ct2 so active

621
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:37,000
phase versus inactive phase in this

622
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,840
scenario we see no changes in the

623
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,360
rythmic expression of these gen just to

624
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:44,320
be very clear this is not reflecting the

625
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:46,000
expression level the the amount of the

626
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,440
gene that we are measuring this is

627
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,679
quantifying how rhythmic is the

628
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:54,039
expression of these genes Depending on

629
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:56,279
time of there and as you can see none of

630
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:59,360
the genes that were significantly up or

631
00:26:56,279 --> 00:27:02,640
down regulated in normal conditions are

632
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:06,000
significantly different under t7 cycle

633
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:07,559
conditions so this is an interesting um

634
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,080
result

635
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:13,080
displaying the impact or reflecting the

636
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:15,159
impact that altering clock chains can

637
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:18,480
have through throughout the

638
00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:22,240
glutamatergic and and gabic signaling in

639
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:25,440
these damic centers by using ever scope

640
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:28,919
we were able to validate the results

641
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:31,200
this is um really interesting result if

642
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:34,919
you see at the rhythmic pattern first of

643
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,480
all it's not observing t7 samples but

644
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:38,679
more importantly there is no up

645
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,640
regulation of the jeans so the levels

646
00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:44,320
are quite similar but the most

647
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:46,880
significant effect is the uh alteration

648
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,880
in the rhythmic pattern across the day

649
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:53,000
night

650
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:54,760
cycle so it is clear at this point that

651
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,240
the light processing in the central

652
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:59,120
Pacemaker and at least in this

653
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:02,399
peripheral time keeping Center in the

654
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:05,519
brain is different so the way that the

655
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:07,799
clocks are responding to light are not

656
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:10,080
similar we have a good understanding of

657
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:12,360
the anatomy of the central clock that

658
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,080
when we started this project we had

659
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:16,640
really minor information about the

660
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:18,440
architecture of the dyamic areas

661
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:22,159
responding to light and in particular

662
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:24,039
within the PHP so we perform different

663
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:27,200
anatomical studies and histological

664
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:29,559
Analysis to characterize the anatomy and

665
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:32,519
the composition of the cell types that

666
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:35,039
form the PHP on the upper panel you are

667
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:37,480
seen a representative image of an animal

668
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:40,440
expressing the UR in G two neurons so

669
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:42,679
this is exclusively gabic cells in the

670
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:45,720
thalamus in green you can see now the

671
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:47,080
innovation of the retina that defines

672
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,720
the borders of the

673
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:52,320
PHP it's very interesting to mention

674
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:55,360
that as expected we

675
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:57,120
found um High expression of excitatory

676
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,880
glutamatergic neurons in the dorsal

677
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:02,640
pamus as previous

678
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:05,320
described and also the lack of G gabic

679
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:08,039
cells in most of the pamic centers

680
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:11,120
however there is a cluster of gavas that

681
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:15,039
is exclusively located in the PHP in

682
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:16,840
close contact with the retinal terminals

683
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:20,399
these gab Chi cells Express all the

684
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:22,080
classic markets of Gaba G one g 2 vat

685
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:25,039
and they are in close connection with

686
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:27,399
the rtina and by using Ravis virus

687
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:29,799
electrophysiology we confirm that they

688
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:32,480
are connected with these gavels and in

689
00:29:29,799 --> 00:29:35,640
fact we notice that moving from rostra

690
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:39,880
to color part of the PHP we see an

691
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:41,640
increase number of GIC cells this is um

692
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:45,159
strongly correlating with denser

693
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:48,159
inovation from the rtina so it's an it's

694
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:50,000
a paradigm where we can think now that

695
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:53,840
light detected by the

696
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:56,799
rtina U is affecting the circuit in the

697
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:59,919
dorsal thamus in particular these GIC

698
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:02,120
cells that when exposed to different

699
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:05,240
lighting conditions showed severe

700
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:07,640
deficits in the basic properties so what

701
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:09,840
we did here is patching neurons

702
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:11,120
collected from different time points and

703
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:15,080
different lighting conditions I'm

704
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:17,080
showing you data from the ct14 analysis

705
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:19,720
and we found that what in normal

706
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:22,320
conditions is um reflecting that most of

707
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:25,799
the neurons in the PHP are in a silent

708
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:29,320
state with low filing rate at this rest

709
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:32,080
state is inverted in must expose to the

710
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:34,159
t7 cycle for two weeks it's important to

711
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,760
mention that before performing all these

712
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:39,240
experiments mice were housed in constant

713
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:42,039
Darkness for one day so we are avoiding

714
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:46,519
any acute effect of light so as shown

715
00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:48,679
here these cabic cells have a drastic

716
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:51,320
change in their in their basic

717
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:53,480
properties after being exposed to the t7

718
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:55,760
cycle so the next question is what is

719
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:59,799
the consequence of manipulating these

720
00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:01,320
cells and for that we propos this model

721
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:05,320
where

722
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:07,760
um by activating G neurons we can

723
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:10,039
directly affect excitatory neurs and

724
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:12,399
therefore impact limic centers the

725
00:31:10,039 --> 00:31:14,799
output signals and in this paper that I

726
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:18,159
invite you all to to read and learn more

727
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:20,080
about it we explore whether using the

728
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:22,679
dread technology that I described before

729
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:26,440
but now focusing on gabic cells in the

730
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:28,720
phb is sufficient to induce um deficits

731
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:31,039
in Behavior so we have the confirmation

732
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,720
that by manipulating these thalamic

733
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:34,840
centers that are not directly

734
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:38,480
communicating with the cortex this is

735
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:41,519
sufficient to induce deficits in animal

736
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:44,919
behavior that is associated with mood

737
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:48,559
and and and and depressive behaviors in

738
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:51,080
particular so what about the GIC cells

739
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:53,559
in the thalamus okay as you can see the

740
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:55,960
phb is a tiny structure in this corner

741
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:58,039
in this uh area that is next to the

742
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:00,760
lateral havena with no connection with

743
00:31:58,039 --> 00:32:03,120
the the lateral havena but with dense

744
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:05,760
connections with local circuits in the

745
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:08,480
dors ofus what I'm showing you here is

746
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:12,080
an experiment where we use gotu cre

747
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:15,639
animals and we injected adenos viruses

748
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:18,440
to infect the cells and this virus is a

749
00:32:15,639 --> 00:32:21,039
cred dependent virus that expresses tdt

750
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:23,240
so we can trace all the axonal and and

751
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:25,519
projections of the cells but in addition

752
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:29,000
copying is fused to

753
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:32,799
gfp so by looking at this two pannels we

754
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:35,960
can precisely identify the the fibers

755
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:38,399
that inovate these Gaba cells in the phb

756
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:40,480
but also the synaptic contacts as

757
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:43,519
expected we found this dense inovation

758
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:46,600
and dense connectivity with principal

759
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:49,519
excitatory neurons in the phb also with

760
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:51,559
other gavic cells but in addition with

761
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:54,679
areas in the thamus that are next to the

762
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:57,120
phb so it's indicating a potential

763
00:32:54,679 --> 00:33:00,320
effect that goes beyond this light

764
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:02,240
Detective like light detection Ser in

765
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:04,559
addition we found that at least a

766
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,639
population of these cic cells we we

767
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:08,600
don't have an idea of the porc some of

768
00:33:06,639 --> 00:33:11,639
them at least have long range

769
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:14,960
projections as you can see here we found

770
00:33:11,639 --> 00:33:18,240
dense inovation to the pamic reticular

771
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,960
nucleus TRN as well as the Son inserta

772
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:23,000
and the controlateral

773
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:25,679
P so if you think about these few cells

774
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,559
inter neurons in the phb have these long

775
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:32,000
range projections connecting with the

776
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:34,279
thalamic particular nucleus Sona inserta

777
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,360
and Crossing to the other hemisphere of

778
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:40,480
the brain contacting controlateral phhb

779
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:42,760
neurons using RIS virus and different

780
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:45,159
tracing strategies we confirm that this

781
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:47,960
is a this is a vatal connection so it's

782
00:33:45,159 --> 00:33:50,480
a very interesting circuitry where a few

783
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:53,200
cells interneurons in the thalamus that

784
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:55,960
respond to light are now connected with

785
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,760
different centers in the brain that

786
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:59,559
process the information that commun

787
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:02,840
communicates the thalamus with the

788
00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:04,919
cortex so it's an interesting um

789
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:07,360
scenario where light can now have a

790
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:09,599
widespread effect not just modulating

791
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:11,960
centers that are directly involved in

792
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:14,919
light detection but also affecting

793
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:17,359
centers that control different functions

794
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:19,839
of thalamocortical

795
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:22,320
communication so in summary this is the

796
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:24,879
working hypothesis that we have

797
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,879
now independently of the central BAC

798
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:29,560
maker we have found that the population

799
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:32,359
of rinal neurons that Express melanopsin

800
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:35,240
these iprgcs inovate Gava cells and

801
00:34:32,359 --> 00:34:36,679
excitatory neurons in the thalamic PHP

802
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,919
these Gava neurons have local

803
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:41,240
connections modulating the function of

804
00:34:38,919 --> 00:34:43,919
excitatory neurons that connect with

805
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:45,720
limic centers including the accumbens

806
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:49,040
ventromedial prefrontal cortex and

807
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:51,800
thisat and in parallel these GIC cells

808
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:54,079
also have long range projections

809
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:56,879
affecting the Son inserta and the

810
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:59,160
TR looking at previous data we found

811
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:00,520
confirmation that the limic centers

812
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:03,359
connected with the

813
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:05,119
phb rhythmically Express clock chains I

814
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:07,560
have the references here these are

815
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:09,920
fantastic papers but at least to our

816
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:13,240
knowledge there is no evidences that the

817
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:15,920
TRN and Son insert showed any Cadian

818
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:18,760
rhythms or any Cadian function so this

819
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:21,359
is what we wanted to explore and this is

820
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:23,000
what we are currently doing and to do

821
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:26,640
that we are taking advantage again of

822
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:29,599
the gatu and Cherry animals as you can

823
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:31,920
see we can detect these garic cells that

824
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:36,320
are the majority of the neurons in the

825
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:38,200
TRN and the Sona inserta so this is um

826
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,880
inv validation that there is per two

827
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:43,440
expression is an antibod so just to

828
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:46,079
confirm that the same neurons the

829
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:48,720
neurons are or can be considered clock

830
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:51,680
neurons but we need to know more about

831
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:53,800
the rhythmicity of these centers to do

832
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,920
that we use micro dissection at

833
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:59,079
different circadian times so we are able

834
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:01,760
to section the brain and disect these

835
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:05,800
different areas and then run qpcr to

836
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:07,760
have this nice um plots where we use

837
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:10,920
four different time points across day

838
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:13,960
night cycle to confirm the rhythmicity

839
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:16,400
of clock chain expression in these two

840
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:19,359
gabic centers on top you can see the

841
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:22,880
rhythms for Sona inserta sorry for the

842
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:26,920
TRN lower panel is the rhythmicity of

843
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:30,560
perue in Sona insert so we have now a

844
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:32,560
confirmation that this is rhythmic this

845
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:35,319
is probably responding to changes in the

846
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:38,760
PHP and opens as you can imagine a lot

847
00:36:35,319 --> 00:36:42,319
of new questions and ideas for future

848
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:44,599
experiments we started doing ER scope to

849
00:36:42,319 --> 00:36:46,160
expand the analysis and learn more about

850
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:48,760
the anatomical and topographic

851
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:52,319
connectivity of these centers so you can

852
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:54,720
see um by using vat or different

853
00:36:52,319 --> 00:36:56,720
coverage markers together with different

854
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:59,240
blockchains we can validate the overe

855
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:01,440
expression not the overe expression the

856
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:05,079
the robust expression of clock chains in

857
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:08,880
the Gava cells and in fact most of the

858
00:37:05,079 --> 00:37:11,800
cells close to 100% of the cells in both

859
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:14,720
TRN son inserta as well as the PHP as we

860
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:17,760
previously found showed expression of

861
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:20,079
clock chains by using single cell

862
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,839
analysis we can delineate the borders of

863
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:25,280
these neurons and count the pcta of per

864
00:37:22,839 --> 00:37:26,160
two in this case the green dots so we

865
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,960
can

866
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:31,760
quantify the changes in gene expression

867
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:35,319
in these different cells prevaling this

868
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:38,359
nice phasic changes in in expression in

869
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:40,560
all these targets um these are only two

870
00:37:38,359 --> 00:37:43,880
points obviously we can expand to Four

871
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:45,599
Points points this is ongoing research

872
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:48,400
and we are also expanding the analysis

873
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:51,560
to other clock chains so this is the

874
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:55,160
summary of what we are currently doing

875
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:58,200
and is uh guiding me back to the

876
00:37:55,160 --> 00:38:01,200
original um conceptual framework what I

877
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:04,400
propose that environmental time cues

878
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:07,800
integrate are integrated with signals in

879
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:09,920
the brain in the system that guide the

880
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:13,480
temporal integration of these different

881
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:15,640
time cues to coordinate behavioral

882
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:17,480
outputs this is something that we are

883
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:19,280
investigating in the central Pacemaker

884
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:21,359
and in parallel in these different

885
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:24,359
timekeeping centers in the brain

886
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:26,520
including the PHP so from the data that

887
00:38:24,359 --> 00:38:28,400
I presented today we can make this

888
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:31,520
parallel correlat

889
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:35,720
and propose that in the PHP there are

890
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:38,240
GIC neurons that directly respond to

891
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:40,680
light the same for Relay neurons that

892
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:43,280
connect with limic centers through these

893
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:45,480
output signals what we found is that

894
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:48,800
gabic cells are essential for the

895
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:51,960
rhythmic oscillation of the phb circuits

896
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:54,560
and we also found that these gabic cells

897
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:57,160
have connections B directional

898
00:38:54,560 --> 00:39:00,240
connections with TRN son inserta and the

899
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:02,599
cont lateral PHP so this is describing a

900
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:05,560
network of garic cells within the

901
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:08,040
thalamus that can be working uh in

902
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:09,920
oscillation probably coordinated with

903
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:11,680
the scn or it could be completely

904
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,319
independent of the scn and this is part

905
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,839
of the the research that we are

906
00:39:13,319 --> 00:39:18,119
currently

907
00:39:14,839 --> 00:39:20,480
investigate so uh I invite you to read

908
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:23,200
more about our research I I didn't

909
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:25,960
include today but we are um in addition

910
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:27,920
to studying light focusing on the effect

911
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:30,720
of time cues

912
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:32,640
Associated to feeding uh rhythms and and

913
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,839
different food diets so this is a paper

914
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:37,240
we published few years ago where we

915
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:40,440
studied a similar conceptual framework

916
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:44,520
but now focusing on the impact of of

917
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:47,599
light and feeding responses so what we

918
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:51,119
found at the end is that the scn is not

919
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:54,599
drastically affected by the t7 cycle but

920
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:57,680
the phb is severely affected so the key

921
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:59,680
question is whether the phb has this L

922
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:01,720
mechanisms that are susceptible to

923
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:03,560
changes in the environment or whether

924
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:06,720
the consequences of the disruption are

925
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:10,800
in fact the deficits in this peripheral

926
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:14,359
network of cic cells that send abnormal

927
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:17,400
information to the PHP so we have now

928
00:40:14,359 --> 00:40:19,880
new questions to understand these

929
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:22,240
integration mechanisms within the PHP

930
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:24,920
but also expanding the idea to

931
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:26,720
widespread networks that detect changes

932
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:28,800
in the environment changes in the

933
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:31,960
internal systems and integrate these

934
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:34,960
signals to coordinate

935
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:39,400
Behavior so this is what I have for

936
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:41,240
today I want to um thanks all of you for

937
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:43,680
your attention thank you the organizers

938
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:45,520
again for the invitation I want to thank

939
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,240
the people in the lab as I mentioned at

940
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:49,920
the very beginning we are new lab so

941
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:52,040
we're looking for new people motivated

942
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,839
people if you have a question feel free

943
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:57,440
to reach out to us um if you want to

944
00:40:54,839 --> 00:41:00,160
learn more about our research all our

945
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:03,520
Publications are in the website so you

946
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:06,560
can download the papers and I'll be

947
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:08,640
happy to take any questions thank you

948
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:11,200
thank you very much Dr Fernandez uh just

949
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:14,480
to note that we have a survey that goes

950
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:16,000
out I will post it in the chat and we

951
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,760
will send you an email link for the

952
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,800
survey post survey because your feedback

953
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:22,440
is valuable um we have two questions

954
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:26,319
right now but please feel free to put

955
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:29,040
your questions in the Q&A first question

956
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:30,800
is um this lead to a better model of

957
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,520
emotional and circadian disregulation

958
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,079
and bipolar disorder could the

959
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:36,119
methodology developed in your studies

960
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:38,319
generate murine models that more closely

961
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:41,480
resemble bipolar disorder than the ones

962
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:45,040
we currently use also great

963
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:47,680
presentation thank you very much um this

964
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:50,200
is really a great question

965
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:55,440
um it's very challenging to have model

966
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:58,040
for bipolar this orders I feel like um

967
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:02,160
data from calling mlang and other groups

968
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:05,160
is showing how using human tissue is now

969
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:07,319
helping us even designing animal models

970
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:11,240
to study bipolar disorder and different

971
00:42:07,319 --> 00:42:13,160
mood disorders so um what we have in

972
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:15,119
mind here

973
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:17,920
is understanding more about the

974
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:20,400
integration of external cues and

975
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:22,520
internal cues is the first step in

976
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,720
Deering the ethology of these

977
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:27,440
pathologies so you can imagine we can

978
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:30,000
perturb clock chains but the question is

979
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:32,319
when to do that is this having an impact

980
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,000
during development or can we perturb the

981
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:37,640
genes in adult and obviously using

982
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:40,240
knockout models we we have the challenge

983
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:42,559
of having a drastic alteration in the

984
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:45,760
system so by manipulating the

985
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:47,760
environment and knowing the precise

986
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:50,960
alterations in these timee keeping

987
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:55,200
mechanisms in the brain we can probably

988
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:57,480
um design better models to attack these

989
00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:00,319
kind of questions and at least have

990
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:01,839
better models to Define what are the key

991
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:05,240
questions for understanding major

992
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:07,160
depression versus bipolar disorder but

993
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:10,200
this is a great question I would love to

994
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:13,400
discuss more so I'll be happy to keep

995
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:15,359
discussing later thank you yeah

996
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:17,520
excellent um so that was the two

997
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:19,160
questions we had online I did have one

998
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:22,920
question about your methodologies there

999
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:25,920
was a Lucifer Lucifer is assay with the

1000
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:28,280
oscillating circadian rhythm shown in

1001
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:30,559
the scn what time frame was that

1002
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:32,000
oscillating in was that like an a lapse

1003
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:36,359
time frame or was it

1004
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:38,280
just yes so this is a video that um we

1005
00:43:36,359 --> 00:43:40,480
are not using this animal for this

1006
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:45,119
question in particular this is a classic

1007
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:47,319
Model where um you can dissect the scn

1008
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:50,280
ideally you can do the same for PHP or

1009
00:43:47,319 --> 00:43:52,680
any other brain centers and then collect

1010
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:54,960
information across 24 hours for multiple

1011
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:57,119
days so when you see a peak of

1012
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:01,599
expression when you see this bright

1013
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:04,880
signal this is uh 24 hours so obviously

1014
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:08,079
it's it's not real time video each cycle

1015
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:08,079
again is

1016
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:13,520
24 um another question is like um

1017
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,000
extending on the bipolar murine model do

1018
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,880
you see other models that would be

1019
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:20,160
beneficial to look at for

1020
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:21,760
mood disorders like could you apply this

1021
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:25,200
like an anxiety disorder because it's

1022
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:28,000
affecting the lyic system um yes that's

1023
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:30,400
an interesting um

1024
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:34,079
question an interesting problem as well

1025
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:36,800
what we know is that um by activating or

1026
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:36,800
silencing the

1027
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:42,760
PHP we cannot interfere with other

1028
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:46,520
models of mood disorders so what we have

1029
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:50,920
tried is um exposing animals to social

1030
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:53,480
defeat or um models of of chronic

1031
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:55,839
exposure to the forun test and in these

1032
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:59,119
conditions that are known to cause mood

1033
00:44:55,839 --> 00:45:01,119
deficits and alterations in lyic centers

1034
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:05,079
there is no deficits in the PHP or in

1035
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:07,760
this particular C so right now what we

1036
00:45:05,079 --> 00:45:10,680
propos is that this circuit is dedicated

1037
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:15,319
to detect changes in light and when

1038
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:17,559
these changes in light are abnormal or U

1039
00:45:15,319 --> 00:45:20,359
distorted from the 24-hour cycle is when

1040
00:45:17,559 --> 00:45:23,599
the phb is affected and eventually the

1041
00:45:20,359 --> 00:45:25,160
lyic centers are also affected so at

1042
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:27,800
this point we cannot make strong

1043
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:29,880
connection between the different models

1044
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:33,319
looks like this is an independent

1045
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:35,280
pathway dedicated to detecting light

1046
00:45:33,319 --> 00:45:37,319
whether this is combining or

1047
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:39,960
accelerating deficits with other models

1048
00:45:37,319 --> 00:45:39,960
we still don't

1049
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:46,280
know another question is um there's a

1050
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:48,760
long history of circadian disregulation

1051
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:51,680
in disorders like schizophrenia bipolar

1052
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:53,680
disorder have you tried using any of the

1053
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:55,800
typical drugs used to treat this these

1054
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:57,520
disorders on your model to see if it

1055
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:58,520
influences circadian or regulates the

1056
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:02,240
Circadian

1057
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:05,400
rhythm great yes interesting topic yes I

1058
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:07,839
I didn't mention this in we haven't done

1059
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:09,839
this but there is a previous study from

1060
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:13,000
the hatar lab that alate run the

1061
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:17,079
experiments where um fluoxitine was able

1062
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:18,800
to restore the the deficit in mood

1063
00:46:17,079 --> 00:46:21,520
induced by irregular

1064
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:24,599
light unfortunately we don't have a lot

1065
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:27,520
of details to better understand whether

1066
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:30,720
fluxy things is restoring the micity of

1067
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:33,599
clockin or the the deficits that we saw

1068
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:37,920
using bog sequencing but what we know is

1069
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:42,119
that um if you treat animals with flatin

1070
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:44,480
you can restore some of the deficits um

1071
00:46:42,119 --> 00:46:47,520
probably through the effects on the lyic

1072
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:50,359
centers so we have no evidences that

1073
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:52,960
these drugs can directly impact light

1074
00:46:50,359 --> 00:46:56,040
detection systems or in this particular

1075
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:59,200
case the praven nucleus we know that

1076
00:46:56,040 --> 00:47:01,200
they impact lyic centers and this is why

1077
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:02,440
we think that they have an impact on

1078
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:06,319
animal

1079
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:10,480
behavior which opens probably another

1080
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:12,680
question or just to to expand my answer

1081
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:16,119
when we think about Chief workers or or

1082
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:18,680
people that have seasonal disorders

1083
00:47:16,119 --> 00:47:21,359
because of the changes in in light

1084
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:23,880
exposure um even though these treatments

1085
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:27,000
can be effective they are probably not

1086
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:28,640
affecting the root of the problem that

1087
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,839
why we think that understanding more

1088
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:33,760
about the circuit R is essential for

1089
00:47:30,839 --> 00:47:36,800
Designing better tools better treatments

1090
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:38,760
for uh targeting these Cadian centers

1091
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:41,280
these eke keeping mechanisms that detect

1092
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:44,520
light and eventually impact limic

1093
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:47,640
centers as well another question we

1094
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:49,480
have uh from Joanna again uh in fact the

1095
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:51,800
short seven-hour hyperactive Cycles you

1096
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:53,680
describe closely resemble the Circadian

1097
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:55,640
alterations we observe in some bipolar

1098
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:57,559
patients yes it would be interesting to

1099
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:59,440
see what chronic in by various

1100
00:47:57,559 --> 00:48:01,760
psychotropic drugs causes in these

1101
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:04,079
circuits for example The Chronic use of

1102
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:06,240
benzodiazapines in patients not only

1103
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:08,319
those with bipolar sorder but also with

1104
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:11,760
or without

1105
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:14,319
psychiatrics yes this is a an amazing

1106
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:16,319
comment and just to go back to the

1107
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:18,079
schematic this is not a real actogram

1108
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:20,400
but I'll be happy to share actograms

1109
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:24,040
later if necessary

1110
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:27,240
um what we saw what we seen most of the

1111
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:30,400
animal is when we use the t7 cycle the

1112
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:31,760
first couple of days you know it's

1113
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:34,319
difficult to understand what they are

1114
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:36,680
doing is is more a rhythmicity but

1115
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:39,160
eventually they display these robust

1116
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:40,720
patterns of activity and you can see

1117
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:43,599
that they are in free running with the

1118
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:46,160
period close to 24 hours and animals

1119
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:49,359
start the activity every day at the

1120
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:51,680
similar time but this is independent of

1121
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:53,359
the light dark cycle so it's an

1122
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:56,040
interesting dissociation from the

1123
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:59,319
environment in animals in mice as you

1124
00:48:56,040 --> 00:49:01,000
know uh if you present lights there is a

1125
00:48:59,319 --> 00:49:03,079
masking effect that blocks their

1126
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,880
activity it's not the case after a

1127
00:49:03,079 --> 00:49:09,440
couple of days under the t7 cycle and

1128
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:11,640
discussing with colleagues um I I saw

1129
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:13,960
actograms for patients with bipolar

1130
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:16,200
disorder that are quite similar so there

1131
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:18,720
is an interesting similarity in the

1132
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:21,040
output responses I'm not saying that

1133
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:23,839
this is a model for bipolar disorder but

1134
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:25,760
the output signals the output circadian

1135
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:28,680
responses are similar between the two

1136
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:31,119
CPS so there is definitely something to

1137
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:33,079
to explore in further

1138
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:35,640
details I mean some of your F changes

1139
00:49:33,079 --> 00:49:37,680
are actually quite dramatic between the

1140
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:42,000
Cycles it

1141
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:44,839
is yes we have um with the validation

1142
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:47,520
all the data is the Publications is very

1143
00:49:44,839 --> 00:49:50,280
interesting that we haven't seen an AB

1144
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:54,520
regulation of genes so at least by

1145
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:56,400
looking at um RNA scope and qpcr what we

1146
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:58,240
see is that the rhythms are flat but

1147
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:00,680
when look at the total expression of the

1148
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:03,880
genes is quite similar to control

1149
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:06,599
conditions so what we propose what we

1150
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:09,079
think is that probably the light is

1151
00:50:06,599 --> 00:50:11,480
affecting these clock chains that some

1152
00:50:09,079 --> 00:50:13,720
of them directly respond to light and

1153
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:16,520
these transcription factors then have a

1154
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:18,960
widespread effect impacting other genes

1155
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:21,799
as well so the result and we have

1156
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:24,240
analysis only at 14 days after the IR

1157
00:50:21,799 --> 00:50:27,160
regular light conditions but having a

1158
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:29,599
Time course would be essenti

1159
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:32,079
in understanding the multiple steps

1160
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:34,079
leading to this final scenario so what

1161
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:37,960
I'm showing you here is the like the

1162
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:40,520
final picture of the the entire event so

1163
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:42,960
looking into early steps would be

1164
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:45,119
fantastic to understand more about the

1165
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:47,119
impact of light on these clock chains

1166
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:49,079
and the different circuits responding to

1167
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:51,280
that time

1168
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:52,880
case do you find any other sub

1169
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:57,119
subpopulations of cells in the Single

1170
00:50:52,880 --> 00:51:00,400
Cell analysis within NE tissues like we

1171
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:03,400
have this is bulk sequencing um we're

1172
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:06,839
currently doing single cell um I don't

1173
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:09,640
have data to show you now but um by

1174
00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:14,319
doing a scope we found as I showed you

1175
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:16,799
before this cluster of gabic cells

1176
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:19,760
exclusively located in the PHP and the

1177
00:51:16,799 --> 00:51:22,559
rest of the cells are mostly

1178
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:25,280
excitatory so this is the classic

1179
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:27,400
pattern of expression in the thums if

1180
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:30,920
you look at the alen for example there

1181
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:33,440
are only a few markers that can identify

1182
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:35,480
clusters of cells in the thalamus most

1183
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:37,839
of the properties are associated with

1184
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:40,119
the connectivity not with the genetic

1185
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:42,480
Identity or at least to the knowledge

1186
00:51:40,119 --> 00:51:45,000
that we have

1187
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:47,440
right so I'll say that we are at the top

1188
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,839
of the hour and um thank you very much

1189
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:51,400
once again for your very interesting

1190
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:54,640
talk and very fundamental biology in

1191
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:57,319
terms of brain development and you know

1192
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:58,760
kind of esoteric markers for like mood

1193
00:51:57,319 --> 00:52:00,680
you know that's one of the hardest

1194
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:04,200
things doing Psychiatry research like

1195
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:07,079
how do you capture a thought you know um

1196
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:10,079
or hallucination so very much

1197
00:52:07,079 --> 00:52:12,680
appreciated yeah for the invitation I as

1198
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:14,599
I said the email is here people can

1199
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:18,240
check the website I'll be happy to chat

1200
00:52:14,599 --> 00:52:20,400
more and answer any

1201
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:21,799
questions sounds good thank you once

1202
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:26,240
again and I look forward to seeing you

1203
00:52:21,799 --> 00:52:26,240
in the future thank you very much
