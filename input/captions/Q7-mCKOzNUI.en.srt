1
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,639
Okay. So today we are going to turn from

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,480
the consumer side of the story to the

3
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,760
producer side of the story. Once again

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,160
in the first lecture we talked about

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,600
supply and demand curves. The last few

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,600
lectures we developed where demand

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,359
curves come from. Now we're develop

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,640
where supply curves come from. So we're

9
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,720
going to flip and explain where supply

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,720
curves come from.

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:34,960
So, and to do so, we're going to start

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,960
by talking about production

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:47,600
functions. Now, we all know

14
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:49,200
what firms, what consumers want. They

15
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,879
want to figure out the bundle of goods

16
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,440
that makes them as well off as possible

17
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,120
given their budget constraint. What do

18
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,160
firms want?

19
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,840
Firms want to maximize their profits. So

20
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,559
just like consumers want to maximize

21
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,439
their utility, firms want to maximize

22
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:07,960
their profits. And firm profits will

23
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:10,400
depend so they want to maximize

24
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,200
profits. And profits will depend on

25
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,200
three things. They'll depend on consumer

26
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,200
demand.

27
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,520
They'll depend on the cost of

28
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:28,640
production and they will depend on

29
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:37,920
competition. Now the first two, the

30
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,320
first and the third are things which are

31
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,680
largely out of the firm's control. Not

32
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,119
totally out of the firm's control. We'll

33
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,280
come back to how things like advertising

34
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,920
might affect demand and how things like

35
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,159
monopolies might affect competition. But

36
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,759
in the standard model, view them as sort

37
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,280
of out of the firm's control. Take them

38
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:57,680
as given. What the firm controls is the

39
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,560
cost of production. That's what they can

40
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,000
that's what's under their

41
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:06,880
control. So from the firm's

42
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:12,039
perspective, maximizing profits is the

43
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:12,039
same as minimizing costs.

44
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:18,480
Okay, the way to maximize profits is to

45
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:21,280
minimize costs and that's how the firm

46
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,680
produces as efficiently as possible by

47
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,599
minimizing

48
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,280
costs. Okay, once again in the real

49
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,040
world there's complications but in the

50
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,400
model and what'll explain most the real

51
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,360
world we just say

52
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,800
firms their goal is to minimize

53
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,080
costs. Now to understand how to minimize

54
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,560
costs we have to understand where a

55
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,920
firm's costs come from.

56
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,560
understand that we have to understand

57
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:47,440
what firms actually

58
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:50,640
do. So in this course, firms are simply

59
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:54,560
black boxes for much of the course.

60
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:58,239
They're simply boxes where inputs go in

61
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,760
and outputs come out and in the middle

62
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,280
is something called a production

63
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:05,599
function. Okay, that production function

64
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,800
is the magic that makes is the magic of

65
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:10,959
the firm. Okay. And technically what a

66
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,720
production function is, what a

67
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:17,120
production function is, it's a

68
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,120
description of what is technically

69
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,760
feasible for the firm to produce. Okay,

70
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,120
that's their production function. What

71
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,800
is technically feasible for them to

72
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,840
produce.

73
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:35,000
Okay. And essentially what this

74
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:39,200
production function does is it takes as

75
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,599
inputs two things. Takes as inputs uh

76
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,159
factors of production. It takes factors

77
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,360
of

78
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:46,879
production what we call factors of

79
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,360
production. I'll come back to what those

80
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,360
are in a

81
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:55,480
minute. Takes factors of production. It

82
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:58,080
puts it through a production

83
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:00,480
function which is a black box will

84
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:05,200
express as a mathematical function and

85
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,200
out comes a production of goods and

86
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:12,040
services. Okay. And that's the way we

87
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:14,560
model the supply

88
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:17,040
side. So what are these factors of

89
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,359
production? These factors of production

90
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,320
are what we call inputs into the

91
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:24,880
production process. The

92
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:26,400
inputs into production are of two types.

93
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,440
To make life easy, once again, obviously

94
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,880
in the real world there's a million

95
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,720
types of inputs in a production. But to

96
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,199
make life easy, we'll start with a model

97
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,759
with two types of inputs in a

98
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:38,160
production.

99
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:38,160
Labor and

100
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,600
capital. Labor and

101
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:47,759
capital. Okay. Labor. It's clear what

102
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,840
labor is. It's the amount of hours that

103
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,840
people work at your firm.

104
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,800
Okay. So, labor is literally how many

105
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,880
hours are devoted towards work uh at

106
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,520
your

107
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:01,160
firm. Hours are

108
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:04,240
provided by

109
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:06,240
individuals in the labor market. So now

110
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,880
people on the other side of the equation

111
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,400
instead of people wanting pizza and

112
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,720
cookies, now people are inputs into

113
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,240
production because they produce the

114
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:17,360
labor. So people produce labor. they

115
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:21,320
work at your firm and the price they

116
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:24,400
demand for that labor is the

117
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:26,080
wage. That is the price that they demand

118
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,280
for their labor. Where does the wage

119
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,120
come from? We'll talk about that in a

120
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,000
few lectures. Right now, we're going to

121
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,280
take the wage as given. Just in previous

122
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,240
lectures, we took the price of cookies

123
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,280
and the price of pizza as

124
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,479
given. And we'll tell you later where

125
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,080
they come from. Now, we're just going to

126
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,440
take the wage as given. I'll tell you

127
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,360
later where that comes from. By

128
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,759
proceeding in steps, we make it feasible

129
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:51,039
to model this in a in a reasonable way.

130
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:53,440
Okay, capital is more confusing. Okay,

131
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:55,520
capital is more confusing. This is

132
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,320
basically think of it as everything else

133
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,479
that goes in production. The machines,

134
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,919
the buildings, the land you build on.

135
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,560
Think of it roughly as machines. Think

136
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:06,400
of this black box as being workers and

137
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,720
machines come together to produce

138
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,080
something. The workers we call labor.

139
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,479
Labor. The machines we call

140
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:18,000
capital. And the price of capital we're

141
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,000
going to call the rental

142
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,880
rate. In other words, think of whatever

143
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,919
you use in production as rented. You

144
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:29,280
rent a machine. You rent a building.

145
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:31,039
Okay? In substance, workers, the wage is

146
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,440
the price you pay to rent an hour of a

147
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,720
worker's time, right? That's the way.

148
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,479
It's what the wage is. The price for

149
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,880
renting an hour of a worker's time. And

150
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:41,240
the rental rate is the price for renting

151
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:44,639
a unit of

152
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:46,880
capital. Okay. Now, later on we'll talk

153
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,280
about where that comes from, the fact

154
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,720
that firms actually own machines, etc.

155
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,720
But for now, this makes it easy and

156
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,400
allows for a parallel analysis between

157
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,800
workers and machines. They're both

158
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,599
things you

159
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:01,520
rent. Okay.

160
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:03,080
Now the production function is a

161
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,479
function

162
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:08,560
Q that

163
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:10,960
basically converts I'm sorry it's a

164
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:16,440
function f I'm sorry it's a function f

165
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:19,599
that converts labor and capital into

166
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:22,720
outputs. So the production function f

167
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:24,160
converts labor and capital into output

168
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,120
just like utility function. And once

169
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,880
again there's going to be enormous

170
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,319
parallels to the consumer theory. That's

171
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,160
what I drilled into you developing the

172
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,520
intuition of consumer theory. That same

173
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,680
intuition is going to carry over here to

174
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,080
producer theory. So just like the

175
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,520
utility function is a mathematical

176
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,720
representation of how goods turn into

177
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:43,039
happiness, the production function which

178
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,240
in some sense easy to understand is a

179
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,240
mathematical representation of how

180
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,440
inputs turn to outputs. Sort of easy to

181
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,560
understand. Utility function is a vague

182
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,280
thing. A production function is a

183
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,680
technology. We all know that. Okay, it's

184
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,479
the 20 007 contest. You've got some

185
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:59,039
inputs and you produce an output.

186
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:01,599
Okay, so production function is just the

187
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,080
technology that translates the inputs to

188
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:06,400
the

189
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:08,319
outputs. Let me highlight one thing.

190
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,599
Little Q I'm going to distinguish here

191
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:14,160
and if I get this wrong, you can catch

192
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:16,720
me. Little Q refers to a specific firm.

193
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,080
Big Q refers to the market. So I did my

194
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,720
supply and demand curves where I had big

195
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,720
Q. That refers to the whole market.

196
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:26,520
Little Q refers to a given firm within

197
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:30,199
the market. Okay? and we'll go over that

198
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:34,560
throughout. Okay. Now, these

199
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:34,560
inputs can be what we call

200
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:41,519
variable or

201
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:44,959
fixed. And what do we mean by what do we

202
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,519
mean by that? A varial input is an input

203
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:49,519
that can be easily

204
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:51,120
changed. A fixed input is one that is

205
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,680
hard to change at least in the near

206
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,640
term.

207
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:59,279
So the key distinction between whether

208
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:02,640
an input is variable or fixed is whether

209
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,640
you're talking about the short

210
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:09,480
run or the long

211
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:12,320
run. The short run is

212
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:15,040
defined as a period of time over which

213
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:18,000
only some good some inputs are variable

214
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:20,320
and others are fixed.

215
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,519
The long run is defined as a period of

216
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,399
time of which all inputs are

217
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:25,440
variable. That's it. That's the

218
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,800
definition. I'm not going to tell you

219
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,720
the short run is six months and three

220
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,480
days and four hours and long runs past

221
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,880
that. I can't tell you that. I can't

222
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,880
tell you what they represent except

223
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,320
theoretically. Theoretically, we define

224
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,600
the short run as a period of time which

225
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,519
some inputs are fixed and some are

226
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,680
variable. The long run is a period of

227
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,360
time over which everything's variable.

228
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,760
Think of the short run as days and the

229
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,200
long run as decades and sort of where in

230
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:51,560
between days and decades things lay in

231
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:56,959
depends. Okay. So what we are going to

232
00:09:51,560 --> 00:10:01,720
do is we are going to assume that labor

233
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:04,240
is variable and capital is

234
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,839
fixed. That is labor is something you

235
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,839
can adjust at any point in time. You can

236
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,320
always fire somebody and hire someone

237
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,200
the next day. Okay. Now, in reality,

238
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,480
that's difficult, but in in theory, you

239
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,760
can. Capital is harder to change. You

240
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,720
got to build a new machine. You got to

241
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:21,360
build a new building, etc. That's slower

242
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,160
to change. So, we're going to call labor

243
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,120
the variable input and capital the fixed

244
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:29,040
input. So, in the short

245
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:30,360
run, we get that labor will be variable

246
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,000
and capital will be

247
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:35,200
fixed. But in the long run, they're both

248
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,800
variable. Now, of course, once again, in

249
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,079
reality, this isn't so distinct. This

250
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,360
isn't so clean. You can't just fire

251
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,720
workers right away and replace them the

252
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,720
next day, especially in this labor

253
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,880
market with a lot of labor shortage. And

254
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,480
you can build machines pretty quickly.

255
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,160
Okay, so the short run long run

256
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,600
distinction is obviously not perfect,

257
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,760
but it allows us to essentially

258
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,360
distinguish the the concept of things

259
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,640
you can change quickly versus things you

260
00:10:54,360 --> 00:11:00,480
can't. Okay, let me pause there. There's

261
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,480
a lot of definitions questions about

262
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,320
that. Yeah.

263
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,480
No Q. No, it should not. Q Q is a Q

264
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,480
could be L plus K. That would be a

265
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,839
particular form of F. But just like you

266
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,680
can't tell me what form my utility

267
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,440
function is, I can't tell you what form

268
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,880
your production function is. This is

269
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,880
some rich function of how you translate

270
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:24,160
L and K to Q. So if Q is just L plus K,

271
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,920
that would be a predictable production

272
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,200
function, which would imply that another

273
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,279
unit of labor, another unit of capital

274
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,839
deliver. But what if a machine is five

275
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:34,720
times as good as a worker? Then it' be

276
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,320
L+ 5K. What if what if the effect of

277
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,760
machines and workers varies based on how

278
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,160
many machines and workers you have? Then

279
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,079
it's a richer function. So just like

280
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,279
utility isn't just cookies plus slices,

281
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,079
it's some function of cookies and

282
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:49,200
slices. Production is some function of

283
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,839
labor and capital. All right, good

284
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,640
question. Other

285
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:58,279
questions? Okay, so now let's talk about

286
00:11:54,640 --> 00:12:01,279
the short run. Let's talk about shortrun

287
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:03,160
production. And how do we think about a

288
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,959
firm's shortrun production

289
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,839
decisions? How do we think about a

290
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:09,680
firm's shortrun production

291
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:11,839
decisions? Well, in the short run,

292
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:15,959
capital's fixed. So, we can write our

293
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:18,639
production function as Q= F of L and K

294
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:21,519
bar. Capital's fixed in the short run.

295
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:23,760
Okay, that's definitional.

296
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,440
So what the firm is trying to ask is

297
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,279
look I can't change the machines I have

298
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,800
that's fixed in the future I could

299
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,720
change it but for my decision today I've

300
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,639
gone to work today September 20th I

301
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,800
showed up at work I have a decision to

302
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:38,240
make today which is how many workers do

303
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:40,959
I want today well the key input that

304
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,279
decision is going to be the marginal

305
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:45,680
product of

306
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:49,040
labor which is how valuable is the next

307
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:53,680
worker in terms of delivering output

308
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,680
which is going to be DQ

309
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:58,320
DL that is what is the marginal effect

310
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,399
of the next worker. Remember this course

311
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,800
always works on marginal decisions. What

312
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:06,120
is the marginal effect of the next

313
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,639
worker on output

314
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:10,200
produced?

315
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:14,600
Okay, we are going to

316
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:17,839
assume that in the relevant range

317
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,839
dqdl is

318
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:25,480
negative that is we are going to assume

319
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:27,839
diminishing marginal

320
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:30,320
products. This does not mean diminishing

321
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,760
total product. This does not mean once

322
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,120
again like with consumers more is

323
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,920
generally better. More workers are

324
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:39,800
better. But each worker given fixed

325
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:43,920
capital adds less to

326
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:45,200
output. Okay. Now this is hard to think

327
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,959
about and harder than it's easier with

328
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,800
pizza slices to have this intuition but

329
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,320
same intuition as pizza slices. So let's

330
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,880
do an example illustrates it. Let's

331
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,360
think about digging a hole. You want to

332
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,000
dig a hole and you have one piece of

333
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,279
capital, a

334
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,560
shovel. And that can't be changed in the

335
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,600
short run. All you can change is how

336
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,839
many people you have working on digging

337
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,079
the hole. So you hire the first person

338
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,000
and they're digging. You hire a second

339
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,240
person, you clearly you'll get faster,

340
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,320
more productive digging. But will it be

341
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,519
twice as fast? Well, maybe if you can

342
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,920
get them to if you can get them to

343
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,079
alternate shifts. One more 12, one to

344
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:20,399
other 12. How about the third worker?

345
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:22,000
Will be three times as fast? Maybe, but

346
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,279
probably not. By the time you're the

347
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,959
hundth worker, there's only one shovel.

348
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,560
What are they going to do? They're sort

349
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,079
of sitting around. You can rotate them

350
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,760
really quickly. And you're certainly

351
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,920
better off with a 100 workers than with

352
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,480
90 workers because you can rotate it

353
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,000
more quickly. But clearly the hundth

354
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,120
worker is not as valuable as the second

355
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,480
worker in terms of digging that

356
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:42,959
hole. So the idea of diminished marginal

357
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,279
product is given that you only have one

358
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:47,480
shovel, giving you fixed capital, each

359
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:49,920
additional worker does less and less

360
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,519
good. Okay, it's not quite as simple as

361
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,279
an intuition as diminishing margin

362
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,279
utility, which I think is sort of na

363
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,560
natural, but the and and you know it's

364
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,920
not always true. Like I said, you can

365
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,519
imagine the second worker might be as

366
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,360
good as the first worker, but in

367
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,800
general, each additional worker will add

368
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,600
less and less value if they're working

369
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,680
with the same number of

370
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:09,360
machines. Okay? Now, in the long run,

371
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,920
you could take more advantage. You could

372
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,120
add wheelbarrows and more shovels, and

373
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,680
you could add sorts of capital and then

374
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,680
make each worker more productive. But in

375
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,560
in the short run, with only one piece of

376
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:25,160
capital, that one shovel, there is uh

377
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:25,160
nothing else you can do. Yeah.

378
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,320
I'm sorry. Yeah, I'm sorry. It's

379
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,000
diminishing. Shouldn't say negative.

380
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,920
It's diminishing. My bad. It's

381
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,839
diminishing. My bad. It's not negative.

382
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,800
It's diminishing. Sorry about that. So,

383
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,480
we have diminishing marginal product. DQ

384
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,720
square or DL square is negative, but

385
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,120
DQDL is positive. Each additional worker

386
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,839
adds value. Add less and less and less.

387
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:53,519
Thank you for catching

388
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:55,360
that. Okay, other questions.

389
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,360
So diminishing marginal product in the

390
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,560
short run. That's all we're really going

391
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,720
to say about the short run. The more

392
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:03,839
interesting case is the long run. So now

393
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,839
let's talk about long run

394
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:09,680
production. The long run's more

395
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,240
interesting because now you can vary

396
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,759
both capital and labor. So now the

397
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,399
problem's going to look just like the

398
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,519
consumer choice problem. Consumer

399
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,639
choice, we never said you couldn't

400
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,639
affect number of pizza. You can only

401
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:23,600
change cookies. That's what I've just

402
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:26,160
done here. I've said you can't change

403
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,920
pizza, you can only change cookies. And

404
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,600
just as in that case, given a fixed

405
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,320
amount of pizza, each additional cookie

406
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,959
does less and less. Okay? Now, we're

407
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,240
going to vary both. And guess what?

408
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,519
We're going to choose a familiar form

409
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:42,120
for the production function. Let's

410
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:44,639
assume Q equals the square root of L*

411
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:48,160
K. Let's assume Q equals the square root

412
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:50,639
of L* K. familiar form but once again a

413
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,040
useful form in this context just as it

414
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:56,480
was in consumer

415
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:56,480
theory and let's go to figure

416
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:03,040
51 this

417
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:08,199
illustrates a set of combinations of K

418
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:11,520
and L which deliver the same amount of

419
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:13,439
Q look familiar it should look familiar

420
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:16,160
these look like indifference curves but

421
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:20,199
in this context we call them Isoquants

422
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:24,120
because we like making up cool words.

423
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:26,720
Isoquants. An isoquant is the

424
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:27,960
combination of K and L that delivers the

425
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,080
same

426
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:32,720
output. So all the features of

427
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,640
indifference curves that we liked apply

428
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,440
to

429
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:39,799
isoquants. Okay. Further out is

430
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:42,880
better. They slope down. They don't

431
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:44,200
cross. Okay. And basically what it's

432
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,039
saying

433
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:50,720
is it's about opportunity cost. That

434
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:52,559
basically as you have more capital for a

435
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,039
given for a given amount of money you

436
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:57,200
want to spend and less labor that's

437
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,640
going to affect how much you produce. If

438
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,000
it if the amount you produce stays

439
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,840
constant, you switch capital and labor.

440
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,039
You stay in the same isoquant. If you

441
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,360
can produce more, you move out to a

442
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,360
higher

443
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:09,200
isoquant.

444
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:10,320
Okay. Now here's a good question. It

445
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,960
relates to the earlier question was

446
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:16,200
asked about K plus

447
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:19,600
L. What determines the shape of these

448
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:22,960
isoquants. What determines their shape?

449
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,960
What underlying sort of notion? It's a

450
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,080
hard question. See if anyone's the

451
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:28,200
intuition. When are when are these

452
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,320
isoquants going to

453
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,520
be more bendy and when are they going to

454
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,799
be when are they going to be straighter

455
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,240
and when are they going to be more bent?

456
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:38,720
What's going to determine

457
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,720
that? Yeah.

458
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:46,520
Exactly. It's going to depend on the

459
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,760
substitutability of the different

460
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:50,919
inputs. The more

461
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:53,600
substitutable, the straighter is the

462
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:55,080
isoquant. The less substitutable, the

463
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,600
more bent is the isoquant. So for

464
00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:00,480
example, let's look at figure

465
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,840
52A. Here we have the production

466
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,600
function that was that was suggested

467
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,360
earlier. I like to think it's a

468
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,080
production function between this is one

469
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,280
where goods are perfectly substitutable.

470
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,480
Okay, I think it's a production function

471
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,559
between Harvard graduates and Beanie

472
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:17,679
Babies. Okay, perfectly nothing on that.

473
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:20,039
Come on guys, work with me here. Okay,

474
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:22,799
this is the this perfectly

475
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:23,760
substitutable. Okay, and bas No, no,

476
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,960
don't mean to offend the Harvard the

477
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,000
Harvard students in the class, they're

478
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,960
smart. They came over here to take

479
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,799
classes, so they're exempted. Okay, but

480
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,039
basically the idea is these inputs are

481
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,400
perfectly

482
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:35,919
substitutable. So it doesn't matter if

483
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,280
you have a unit of labor capital as long

484
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,480
as you have just matters the total

485
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,280
number of units you have in that term as

486
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,000
your production that would lead to these

487
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,120
straight downward sloping

488
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,520
isoquants. On the other hand, consider

489
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,919
something like figure 52B on the other

490
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,840
side of the

491
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:53,840
page. These would be nonsubstitutable

492
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,559
inputs so that the production function

493
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,080
is Q equals the min of X and Y. For

494
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:00,880
example, think of these like cereal and

495
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,480
cereal boxes. Okay? Doesn't matter how

496
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,240
much for every amount of cereal you got,

497
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,200
you got to have a box. If you only have

498
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,240
one box, it doesn't matter how much

499
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,200
cereal you have, it's just going to sit

500
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:12,799
there. Okay? You need more boxes. Okay?

501
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:15,120
So, just like the indifference curves

502
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:17,600
for this case were left shoe, right

503
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,559
shoe. This is you think of serial serial

504
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,360
boxes things which are

505
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:23,919
nonsubstitutable. They can't substitute

506
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:28,840
for each other at all. And in that case

507
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:30,440
you get these squared uh squared

508
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:34,960
isoquants.

509
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:34,960
Okay, questions about that uh

510
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,159
intuition. So it's the degree of

511
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:43,960
substitutability which determines the

512
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:46,400
shape of these isoquants. more

513
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:48,200
generally just we'll generally be in

514
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:51,360
between as I said nothing's ever at the

515
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:54,240
extremes we'll generally be in between

516
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:57,480
these two cases and we'll have an

517
00:20:54,240 --> 00:21:02,200
isoquant that looks like figure

518
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:05,159
53 and along that isoquant we have the

519
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:09,120
slope which is the

520
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:11,280
marginal the marginal rate of technical

521
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,400
substitution just to really mess you up

522
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,960
with consumers your margin rate

523
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,159
substitution margin rate of

524
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:18,720
transformation MRS and MRT now I'm going

525
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,120
to have MRTS okay which is the margin

526
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,200
rate of technical

527
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:25,440
substitution okay that is the margin

528
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,919
rate of technical substitution is the

529
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:31,120
rate at which effectively you can trade

530
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:33,720
off labor and capital to produce the

531
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:37,600
same quantity of

532
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:40,320
good so and essentially we can relate

533
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:43,840
this just as we can relate the MRS to

534
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,840
margin utilities yeah I'm sorry go ahead

535
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,400
Roger of technical

536
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:53,200
substitution margin of technical

537
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:55,760
substitution. Remember when we developed

538
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,120
the margin rate of substitution I used a

539
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,799
little proof to show you how it relates

540
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:02,960
to margin utilities. We can use the same

541
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:04,559
proof here which is let's ask let's ask

542
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,400
what happens you have a marginal

543
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:08,640
increase in labor and a marginal

544
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:11,679
decrease in capital so that you stay on

545
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:16,559
the same line. Okay. Well, we know the

546
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:17,880
So, we're asking where DL time MPL, the

547
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:23,039
marginal product of

548
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:24,240
labor, plus DK time MPK, just as a

549
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:26,200
marginal product of labor, there's a

550
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,720
marginal product of

551
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:30,640
capital. Okay, same intuition. It's

552
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,360
diminishing. One worker each additional

553
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:36,000
shovel does less and less good. Okay,

554
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,679
same concept there. That's equal to zero

555
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,120
along that indifference curve. It's an

556
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:43,840
incremental step along that indifference

557
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:45,679
curve. So solving this, this says that

558
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,240
this the slope of that indifference

559
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:53,640
curve DK

560
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:56,360
DL okay is equal to the

561
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:57,960
MRTS which is equal to

562
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:01,360
minus

563
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,360
MPL over

564
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:10,400
MPK. The slope of the indifference curve

565
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:12,000
is minus MPL over MK APK. Once again,

566
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,640
looks should look familiar from consumer

567
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:18,240
theory. Okay, it's the ratio of the

568
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:22,120
marginal products that determines the

569
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:24,919
slope of the indifference curve.

570
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:29,039
Okay. So for

571
00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:31,760
example, let's take our production

572
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:34,240
function we're using here, which is uh

573
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:36,679
square root of L * K. That's our

574
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:39,559
production function. Okay. Let's solve

575
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:42,320
for the marginal rate of technical

576
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:44,480
substitution. Well, we know what's the

577
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,760
marginal product of labor. The marginal

578
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:50,120
product of labor is the

579
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:52,360
derivative of this production

580
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:54,880
function with respect to

581
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:58,159
L. Okay, take the der of that production

582
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:05,400
function with respect to L and you get

583
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:09,039
0.5 * K over square root of K *

584
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:11,720
L. The marginal product of capital is

585
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:14,200
the derivative of this production

586
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:17,600
function with respect to

587
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,840
K. You take that derivative, you get 0.5

588
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:22,760
*

589
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:25,520
L over K *

590
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:28,320
L. So that the marginal rate of

591
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:31,039
technical substitution is the ratio of

592
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:34,960
these two the opposite ratio which

593
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:36,799
equals minus K over L.

594
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,720
In this case once again I don't want to

595
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:41,279
confuse people this is the this is for

596
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,960
for this production function that's a

597
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:45,200
marginary touchal substitution just like

598
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,520
for this utility function I got a

599
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,880
particular margin of substitution okay

600
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,320
that is I'm just showing you how to

601
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,480
develop it for a given production

602
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:54,200
function and that gives you something

603
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:58,159
like figure

604
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:59,520
53 okay figure 53 shows you the marginal

605
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:02,559
rate technical substitution for this

606
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:05,200
production function and you can see that

607
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:06,919
at for example a point like A you have

608
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,520
an MRTS of

609
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:13,120
minus4. That means that you have very

610
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:14,960
little labor and a lot of capital. That

611
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:18,080
means you give up four units of capital

612
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:20,320
to get one more worker. Why? Because

613
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:23,840
marginal products are diminishing. When

614
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:25,440
you've got four shovels and one worker,

615
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,080
you'd happily give up shovels to get

616
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:30,640
more workers. Okay? So, you want to move

617
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:32,880
to the right. Likewise, at point C,

618
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,799
you've got four workers and one shovel.

619
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,960
that's doing you no good. You'd happily

620
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:38,440
give up a worker to get a shovel. So you

621
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:43,440
want to move to the

622
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:46,320
left. Okay, so basically um that is how

623
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:48,880
we end up with with this marginal rate

624
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:51,520
of technical substitution. Okay,

625
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,520
questions about

626
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:55,320
that? Okay, once again parallel to

627
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,400
consumer

628
00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:00,559
theory. Now, now I'm going to talk about

629
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:03,120
two things which are are not parallel to

630
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:05,760
consumer theory. Let me just say by way

631
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:08,480
of introduction, producer theory is one

632
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:10,240
step harder than consumer theory. It's

633
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,640
all the fun stuff for consumer theory

634
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,799
plus one additional step. Okay? And

635
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,720
we'll talk about that step starting uh

636
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:18,240
two lectures from now. But for right

637
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,159
now, it's parallel consumer theory. But

638
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,919
here's a couple of wrinkles that arise

639
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:23,480
in the context of production that you

640
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:26,240
don't get in the context of

641
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:27,799
consumption. The first wrinkle is what

642
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:32,400
we

643
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:33,880
call returns to scale.

644
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,559
returns to

645
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:39,200
scale.

646
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:40,039
Okay, returns to scale are the notion of

647
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:44,520
what

648
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:46,240
happens when I increase all inputs

649
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,360
proportionally. It's not sort of an

650
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,559
interesting question for consumer

651
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,760
theory, but it's interesting producer

652
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:51,440
theory because I want to say what

653
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,799
happens if the firm gets bigger. When

654
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,240
you say in your mind, what happens when

655
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:55,600
a firm gets bigger? You're thinking what

656
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,360
happens when it just when everything

657
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,640
increases, when all inputs increase

658
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,480
proportionally is our notion of how a

659
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,480
firm gets bigger.

660
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,799
And so that's what we call return to

661
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,480
scale. Scale is basically when you scale

662
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:09,000
up everything or scale down everything

663
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:12,080
equally.

664
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:15,039
So the question is how does output

665
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:17,200
respond? For example, it could be that

666
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:22,159
when you double inputs, you double

667
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:28,000
outputs. It could be that f of 2 L comma

668
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:29,600
2 k equals 2 * f of l k.

669
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,960
We'll call this a constant

670
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:34,320
returnsto-scale production

671
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:36,000
function. Double output, double inputs,

672
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:39,080
double outputs. Sort of a natural

673
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,720
intuition, but it doesn't have to be the

674
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:44,640
case. Indeed,

675
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:46,640
typically we assume firms have we call

676
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,640
diminishing returns to scale. Decreasing

677
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:54,399
returns to scale. I'm sorry. Decreasing

678
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:59,039
returns to scale where f of 2 L comma 2k

679
00:27:54,399 --> 00:28:00,480
is less than 2 * f of l and k. That is

680
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:01,880
when you double inputs, you get less

681
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,200
than twice as much

682
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:08,399
outputs. Why is that? Well, think about

683
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,919
the idea that basically uh if you you're

684
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:11,120
still trying to dig a hole. There's one

685
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:12,320
guy with one shovel. You got two guys

686
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,880
with two shovels. They're in each

687
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,399
other's way. they can't quite work as

688
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,720
efficiently as one guy with one shovel

689
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:21,039
because you're still trying to dig one

690
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:22,799
hole. Okay? So, it's a decrease in

691
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:24,159
return to scale doubling the enterprise

692
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:25,120
or if you go to four guys with four

693
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:26,799
shovels, they're definitely going to be

694
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,039
just be way. They have to sit around for

695
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:32,399
a while. So, doubling the enterprise

696
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:34,640
doesn't double production. Of course, we

697
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:39,080
can also consider cases of increasing

698
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:43,960
returns to scale where f of 2L con

699
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:46,760
2k is greater than 2 * f of l and

700
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:49,360
k. Increase in returns to

701
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:50,720
scale that would might arise through

702
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,279
something like the fact that when the

703
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,799
firm gets bigger, it can specialize

704
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:56,000
more. So maybe as a firm gets bigger and

705
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,840
bigger, it can get better and better at

706
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,919
what it does and production can become

707
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:03,799
more and more efficient.

708
00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:07,120
Okay. So these this is an important

709
00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:09,200
concept because basically this is how we

710
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,880
think about economies growing. This is

711
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,559
the core of any model of economic

712
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,960
growth. If you take macroeconomics about

713
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:17,360
economic growth the core of any model of

714
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,240
economic growth is what is the returns

715
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:22,480
to scale for the

716
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:24,799
economy. Typically economists do not

717
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,440
believe that there's everywhere and

718
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:29,279
always increasing returns to scale. We

719
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,880
typically believe returns to scale may

720
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:33,360
increase initially as you specialize the

721
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,799
firm but eventually have to decrease.

722
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:37,679
And the reason we believe that or at

723
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:39,120
least believed that was that if there

724
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:40,799
was always and forever increasing

725
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,360
returns to scale, how many firms would

726
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:44,880
there be in the

727
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:46,000
economy? One. Because it could always

728
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,960
just do better by getting bigger and

729
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,480
bigger and bigger. Now, it turns out for

730
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,399
search engines, maybe that's not such a

731
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,000
bad description. We'll see in the trial

732
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:57,200
that's going on now where Google may get

733
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,960
broken up. So it may be that increasing

734
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,200
returns to scale may last longer than we

735
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,640
thought as economists but typically we

736
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,240
think of firms as maybe initially having

737
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,159
increasing return insurance to scale and

738
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,360
then eventually as they mature having

739
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:11,799
decreasing returns to

740
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:15,799
scale. Okay, questions about

741
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:15,799
that. Yeah.

742
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,399
Well, I'm going to get to that in a

743
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,679
second. Not necessarily. And I'm going

744
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,799
to get I'm going to get to that in one

745
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:26,080
second.

746
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:27,279
Okay, I want to because we haven't

747
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,240
talked about innovation yet and that's a

748
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:30,960
missing piece of this that I want to

749
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,399
turn to next. But other questions? So

750
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,159
I'm going to turn to last before I do I

751
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:37,120
just want to review where we are. So

752
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:38,880
basically just like we have utility

753
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,360
function and production function it

754
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,840
translates your inputs into your

755
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:46,080
outputs. In the short run labor's fixed,

756
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,120
capital's not this is just the only

757
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,720
reason I tell you short run case is to

758
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,360
develop the intuition of diminishing

759
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,960
marginal products. The ancient case the

760
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,240
long run was where it's just like

761
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,279
consumer theory. You're just like

762
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,039
consumer theory. You're trading off

763
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:58,640
pizza pizza and cookies to make you

764
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:01,200
happy. Here you're trading off labor and

765
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:03,159
capital to make a good. Okay. And it's

766
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,240
the same mathematics we saw

767
00:31:03,159 --> 00:31:07,760
before. All

768
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,799
right. And likewise, just as we had

769
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,000
marginal rates of substitution

770
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:11,520
determining the slope of the difference

771
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,919
curve, we have these marginal rates of

772
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:16,880
technical substitution determining the

773
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:19,120
slope of the isoquant.

774
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:23,520
Now let me come to the question here and

775
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:23,520
talk about a last topic which is

776
00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:32,760
productivity. One of the most exciting

777
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:35,120
topics in economics is thinking about

778
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:36,480
productivity. Okay. One of the most

779
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,919
famous and the idea of productivity

780
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,279
comes actually from a very famous

781
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:44,159
application from

782
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:45,760
1798 of the idea of uh decreasing

783
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:50,000
returns to scale or diminishing marginal

784
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:51,840
product. Thomas Malfus was a very I

785
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,480
think probably pretty depressed

786
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:56,200
philosopher given all the stuff he wrote

787
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,919
uh back in the

788
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,840
1700s and he said look think about the

789
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:02,760
production of

790
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:05,840
agriculture there's essentially two

791
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:09,919
inputs there's people and land the

792
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:11,919
people harvest the land he said in the

793
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:14,880
the difference between capital and land

794
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:16,799
is land is always fixed even in the long

795
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,480
run there's only so much land we got the

796
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:19,440
earth unless we go colonize another

797
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,360
planet which I don't think he was

798
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,000
thinking about back then there's a fixed

799
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,679
amount of land so that means that the

800
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,080
marginal product of labor must be

801
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:29,480
everywhere

802
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:32,640
diminishing that means that

803
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:35,120
eventually we're going to starve there's

804
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,720
only so much land as population grows

805
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:39,279
each worker's producing less and less

806
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,880
and less on the same amount of land and

807
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:42,080
eventually we starve through the

808
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,039
principle diminished marginal product he

809
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,720
didn't put it that way but that was

810
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:47,279
intuition basically a fixed amount of

811
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,559
land ever growing population each worker

812
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:50,000
produces less and less and less until

813
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:51,279
you can't feed yourself until you

814
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,640
produce less than actually needed to

815
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:56,159
feed yourself and people start to die

816
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:58,080
off. So Mthus actually said that there

817
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:00,640
would be cycle the world would be would

818
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:03,039
be marked by cycles of starvation that

819
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,399
essentially population would grow we'd

820
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:06,399
be unable to lose enough food. We'd all

821
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,679
a bunch of us would die off then we'd

822
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:08,880
have a small enough population we'd have

823
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,799
marginal product of labor that could

824
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,080
support production and we go back to

825
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:14,240
producing food again till we all died

826
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,480
off again. really not a very happy uh

827
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,640
picture of the

828
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:20,720
future. Now, since Mthus wrote that

829
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,440
book, the world population increased

830
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,880
roughly a

831
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:26,880
thousand%. Okay, roughly a thousand%

832
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,960
increase in world population and we are

833
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:32,159
fatter than

834
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:34,159
ever. Okay, so what did Mthus get wrong?

835
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:35,440
I mean, not there's not starvation and

836
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:36,640
let me be clear, there's horrible

837
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,320
problem starvation around the world.

838
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,559
Although let me also be clear the famous

839
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,640
economist of Marchen effectively won the

840
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:44,399
nob Nobel prize for an important

841
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,799
observation which is that there's never

842
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:48,080
been a famine in a

843
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:49,919
democracy. So we think about famines and

844
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,279
starvation all over the world. Remember

845
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:52,960
that's a political failure not

846
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:55,039
technological failure. There's never

847
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:57,279
been a famine in democracy. Famines only

848
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:58,559
happen when corrupt governments uh don't

849
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:01,360
spread the food they need to the people

850
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:02,880
who need to get it. So fundamentally we

851
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,880
have enough food despite the fact

852
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:07,600
population has gone up 10 times. gone up

853
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:11,440
a thousand% sorry 100 times. So what is

854
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:14,599
it? What's happened? What's changed?

855
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:18,240
What did Mthus mix miss? Yeah.

856
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:19,679
Technology. Mus the fact that we are

857
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:22,320
missing a key component of how we write

858
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:24,320
down our production function. We because

859
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,800
there's actually productivity

860
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,280
improvements in agriculture. What were

861
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,440
they? Well,

862
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:33,760
fertilizers, machines,

863
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:36,560
um basically in the long run we have and

864
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:38,639
eventually uh disease resistant seeds,

865
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:40,000
better land management practices. He

866
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:42,240
missed all the changes. He was right

867
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,839
that the amount of land is fixed, but he

868
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,359
missed the fact that the way we used

869
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:48,480
land will get more and more productive

870
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:50,720
over time. He missed all the technology

871
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:53,280
that was going to come. He missed the

872
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:54,119
productivity improvements that we were

873
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,280
going to

874
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:59,839
see. Okay.

875
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:03,680
actually world food consumption per

876
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:05,560
capita is actually up since 1950 despite

877
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:08,640
the fact that world population has

878
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:09,680
grown. So what this says is really we

879
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:14,079
should really think about writing

880
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:17,040
production functions as Q uh equals A

881
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:20,599
time F of L and K where A is a

882
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,599
productivity factor.

883
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:26,119
Okay, basically there's an extra piece

884
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:29,040
which makes the world more

885
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:29,800
productive. Okay, this is not just true

886
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,599
in

887
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:35,160
agriculture. Let's think of one of the

888
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:39,240
most famous examples which is car

889
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:41,839
production. Okay, basically before the

890
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:43,599
1900s, cars were made like other

891
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:45,680
customized goods. A single person or a

892
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:48,720
couple people make it together. And then

893
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:51,040
Henry Ford introduced the assembly line

894
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:53,440
where basically you had interchangeable

895
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,720
parts and you had a conveyor belt or

896
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,040
assembly line where people could just

897
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,400
specialize in putting this this screwing

898
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,160
this bolt in over and over and over

899
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,560
again and they could do it much faster

900
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:04,000
and they could specialize in it. Now

901
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,440
this seems pretty obvious at the time

902
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,440
but it was very pretty obvious now. It's

903
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,200
pretty radical at the time. He actually

904
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,359
cut the car cost of car production in

905
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,800
half almost

906
00:36:10,359 --> 00:36:14,320
overnight. That was a massive

907
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,320
productivity improvement. the same

908
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,000
number of workers could produce many

909
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,440
more many same number of workers and

910
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,760
same number of machines you can produce

911
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:24,160
many many more

912
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:27,359
cars. Okay. Now, but this innovation

913
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:30,480
didn't just end with Henry Ford. Okay.

914
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:35,200
Um the Indian company Tata produces the

915
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:38,160
Nano which is a $2,500 car. How is the

916
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:40,800
Nano so cheap? Well, it's basically much

917
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:42,800
lighter than other cars. It's much

918
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,240
smaller, but they do things like putting

919
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,079
the wheels way out on the edge instead

920
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:48,960
of under the car to create more room for

921
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:50,960
people to sit in. Okay? And they

922
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,920
minimize the parts that are used to make

923
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:55,200
it easy to exchange and easier to

924
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:56,880
repair. Innovation is going on. And of

925
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,640
course, we're seeing perhaps most one of

926
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,320
the most major innovations in our in

927
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:02,720
automobile industry in decades, which is

928
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:05,040
the electrification of the automobile

929
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,560
fleet. And if you don't think Tesla's

930
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,240
more innovative than an old Ford, you

931
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,520
haven't seen a Tesla, okay? despite what

932
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:13,040
we think about Elon Musk. It's a pretty

933
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:16,960
cool car. Okay. So, basically we are

934
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:18,720
seeing continuous continuous um uh

935
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,520
productivity improvements and that's

936
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:24,320
what the standard model

937
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:25,079
misses. Okay. is that basically now this

938
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:29,000
has

939
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:32,560
become a really important area in

940
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:34,480
economics because ultimately a or

941
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:37,359
product improvements become one of the

942
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,520
key determinants for countries in their

943
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:41,440
standard of

944
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:43,520
living. Okay. So with standard of living

945
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:45,359
think of it as how much stuff do we get

946
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:47,440
to consume per person? Think of it as

947
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:50,320
our standard of living. How much stuff

948
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:53,040
do we have per person? Okay. What's

949
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,440
going to determine that? three things.

950
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:57,079
How hard we

951
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:59,920
work, how many machines we

952
00:37:57,079 --> 00:38:00,760
have, and how productive we are with

953
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,040
those

954
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:05,920
inputs. Those are three things that'll

955
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:08,560
determine how much stuff we have. What's

956
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:11,200
great about productivity is these two

957
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:12,880
are expensive. Working harder is costly.

958
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,079
You got to work harder. It sucks.

959
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,359
Capital, you got to build a machine. You

960
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:17,599
need to use stuff to build a machine.

961
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:18,880
Productivity, boom, you got more. A

962
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:21,119
brilliant idea and suddenly, boom, you

963
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:23,760
got more stuff for everyone.

964
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:26,440
So productivity is is the magic that

965
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:29,520
makes economic growth happen almost

966
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:31,839
costlessly. Okay? And as a result,

967
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:33,480
productivity is the central determinant

968
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:36,320
of our standard of

969
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:38,560
living. And it turns out productivity

970
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,480
has changed. From World War II until

971
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:42,079
about

972
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:45,359
1973, US productivity grew at about 2

973
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:47,200
and a half% a year. What that meant was

974
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:48,880
working just as hard with just as many

975
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:51,560
machines, we could each consume two and

976
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:54,079
a half% more stuff every single

977
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:58,320
year, just magically through the growth

978
00:38:54,079 --> 00:39:00,800
in productivity. Okay. However, from

979
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:03,599
1973 until the 1990s, that fell to less

980
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,960
than 1% a year, which meant if we wanted

981
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:07,680
more stuff, we had to work harder, get

982
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:11,480
more machines.

983
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:13,839
Now one question people were asking was

984
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:15,920
basically you know the IT revolution

985
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:17,760
started in the late 80s but productivity

986
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,119
didn't increase people were saying well

987
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,800
where's the IT revolution there's a

988
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:22,240
great saying saying you can see the IT

989
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,560
revolution everywhere in life except the

990
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:26,079
productivity numbers but then suddenly

991
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,680
there was a boom from the mid 90s to the

992
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:30,480
mid 2000s productivity jumped up again

993
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:33,839
we thought aha the IT revolution is here

994
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:35,520
productivity rose to about 2.3% a year

995
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:36,800
but after 2005 it stopped and

996
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,440
productivity is back down again to a

997
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:41,200
little more than 1% a

998
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:43,119
year. So, we're basically not really

999
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,880
growing. We're not really innovating and

1000
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:47,079
developing and allow our standard of

1001
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,680
living to grow as fast as it used

1002
00:39:47,079 --> 00:39:53,040
to.

1003
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:56,000
Okay, this raises three key questions.

1004
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,000
The first question

1005
00:39:56,599 --> 00:40:04,720
is, you know, why why not long lasting

1006
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:04,720
effects of ET of it

1007
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:09,359
ET? Why did the IT revolution sort of

1008
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,640
cause this brief burst and then

1009
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:14,960
eventually kind of wear

1010
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:17,280
off? Is it because basically all our

1011
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:19,520
innovation is watching Tik Tok and not

1012
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,800
in making stuff? I don't know. But

1013
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,800
that's sort of one question we have,

1014
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,560
which is why is this incredible? You

1015
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,880
guys have no idea how different life is

1016
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:28,160
now than it was 25 years ago in terms of

1017
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,359
the internet and everything you have,

1018
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,480
but somehow we're not that much more

1019
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:31,880
productive as an economy. The question

1020
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:35,320
is why

1021
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:40,200
not? The second question this

1022
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:42,960
raises is where does productivity come

1023
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:45,440
from? Where does what's the where does A

1024
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:47,920
come from?

1025
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,359
And here this is a rich field of study

1026
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,280
because I said it was free. It's not

1027
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:53,119
free. It's not magical. Productivity is

1028
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,359
through real things. In the case of

1029
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:59,920
Henry Ford is through a brilliant

1030
00:40:54,359 --> 00:40:59,920
insight. So one place A comes from is

1031
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,720
education. As we educate people and make

1032
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:07,240
them smarter, make them more creative,

1033
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:11,720
they'll think of cool new

1034
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:14,800
ideas. Okay. Productivity comes from

1035
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:16,560
firm research and development.

1036
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,000
As firms do research and development,

1037
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,000
stuff that many of you may go on and do

1038
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,440
with your

1039
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:24,839
lives, okay, they think up new

1040
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:28,480
ideas, okay, and they develop new

1041
00:41:24,839 --> 00:41:30,680
products. It also comes from public

1042
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,880
research and

1043
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:35,040
development like the National Science

1044
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,160
Foundation. Some of you may have may may

1045
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,440
eventually get funding from the National

1046
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,560
SC may already have or may eventually

1047
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,400
get funding from the National Science

1048
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,680
Foundation for educations. The National

1049
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,040
Science Foundation funds a lot of

1050
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:45,760
research. The National Institutes of

1051
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:47,599
Health fund a lot of research. This

1052
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,960
turns out to be particularly critical

1053
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:50,560
because that's a lot of the basic

1054
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,920
research that gets done. Firms do what

1055
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,480
we often call applied research. They

1056
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,599
take basic ideas and turn them into

1057
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:57,760
products. But the basic research is

1058
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:59,359
often funded by government. And so

1059
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,520
that's where that comes from. So

1060
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:03,200
basically it there are things we can do

1061
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,480
as society to increase our productivity.

1062
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,880
We don't just sit back and let it

1063
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:09,359
happen. Having more educated population,

1064
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:11,359
more investments in R&D, the research

1065
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:12,480
and development by the way is R&D. Those

1066
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:14,839
can really make a difference in terms of

1067
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:17,079
how fast we

1068
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:19,400
grow. Third

1069
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:23,079
question, third

1070
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:26,599
point. How should we spend

1071
00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:29,200
productivity? And here's what I mean by

1072
00:42:26,599 --> 00:42:30,560
that. Imagine you have a cool new idea

1073
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:33,520
that can make things more efficient.

1074
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:35,920
Take Henry Ford's idea. He could do two

1075
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:38,160
things with that. One is he could make

1076
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:42,240
more cars. Two is he give people more

1077
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:44,240
time off. Right? If A goes up, you can

1078
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,000
reduce L and end up with the same amount

1079
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:47,440
of

1080
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:50,240
output. There's no reason an increase in

1081
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:51,839
A has to go into more Q. An increase in

1082
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:54,160
A could go into less L, which people

1083
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:55,200
like. They like time off. One thing

1084
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,480
we'll learn in this class, the hardest

1085
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,079
thing I teach in this class at MIT, the

1086
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,960
single hardest thing is in the real

1087
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:02,640
world, people actually don't like work.

1088
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,599
And we find this hard to believe, guys,

1089
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,839
but in the real world, people would

1090
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:08,560
rather not be at work than at work.

1091
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:09,920
Okay? And basically people would rather

1092
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,880
say well gee if you can make cars

1093
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:15,520
quicker why am I why am I working so

1094
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:16,800
hard and the answer is we don't know you

1095
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:19,119
know there's no clear question about how

1096
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,319
to spend productivity indeed the US and

1097
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:22,640
Europe have made radically different

1098
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:23,920
choices on this front decades since

1099
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:27,440
World War II where productivity has

1100
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:28,760
risen the US has largely put that into

1101
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,200
more

1102
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:33,680
goods Europe has largely put a lot of it

1103
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:35,359
into more leisure so a starting worker

1104
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:37,359
in Europe gets six weeks off a starting

1105
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:38,960
worker in the US gets two weeks off.

1106
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:41,440
Basically, people in Europe work from

1107
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:44,800
about 25 to 60 and then stop. People in

1108
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:47,520
the US work from like 20 to to 65. We

1109
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:49,599
work a lot more hours per week. The US

1110
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:51,280
has decided we want lot well, it's been

1111
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:53,440
decided, I don't want to say necessarily

1112
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:55,599
a conscious decision, but our society is

1113
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:57,040
one which evolved to be that all the

1114
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:59,040
productive improvements go into more

1115
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:00,640
stuff. Whereas in Europe, a lot of it

1116
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:03,359
goes into more time off. What's the

1117
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:04,960
better thing to have? Good question.

1118
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:06,240
Okay. When I was young, I probably

1119
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,480
thought stuff. Now that I'm older, I

1120
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,839
might think time off. Okay, but that's

1121
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:12,960
something we need to be conscious of

1122
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:15,280
that our society that societies can take

1123
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:17,839
different paths. The pandemic may have

1124
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:19,440
shook this up in the US. The pandemic

1125
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:20,720
was the first chance that people had to

1126
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,240
actually be at home and say, "Wait a

1127
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:25,680
second, maybe I don't want to work that

1128
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:27,200
hard." And there was a huge reduction in

1129
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:29,040
labor supply after the pandemic. A lot

1130
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,400
of people retired early. People aren't

1131
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,079
working as hard. People want to be in

1132
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:34,319
better jobs. People want to work from

1133
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:35,680
home. So the pandemic really shook

1134
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:38,160
things up in terms of people maybe

1135
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:41,119
starting to value their leisure uh more

1136
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:42,280
than maybe they did before. Okay, so

1137
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:44,119
that's the third

1138
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:46,680
question. The

1139
00:44:44,119 --> 00:44:50,480
fourth

1140
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:50,480
is who gets

1141
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:57,240
a that is which group in society

1142
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:59,000
benefits from more productive

1143
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:02,119
economy.

1144
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:06,079
Okay. So basically

1145
00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:08,720
um if you look at the period from World

1146
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:08,720
War II till

1147
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:15,599
1973 the average US income grew by 2 and

1148
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:17,760
a half% a year because of productivity.

1149
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:19,599
It turns out pretty much every group in

1150
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,720
society saw that increase. The poorest

1151
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:22,400
people saw their incomes go up about two

1152
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,599
and a half% a year. The richest people

1153
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:26,880
saw their incomes go up to about two and

1154
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:28,200
a half% a year. Since the mid1 1970s

1155
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,800
that has changed

1156
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:32,400
radically. Since the mid1 1970s

1157
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,319
virtually all of the benefit of

1158
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,319
increased productivity has gone to gone

1159
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:38,160
to the richest members of society, the

1160
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:39,000
people that own the capital and not to

1161
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:43,200
the

1162
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:45,960
workers. Okay. Basically, if you look at

1163
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:48,319
the purchasing power of a typical wage

1164
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:50,520
today, it's not much higher than what

1165
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:53,119
you could buy with that wage in

1166
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:54,800
1980. That is and we're the wage itself

1167
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:56,160
is higher, but goods cost more. We'll

1168
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,160
come back and talk more about inflation

1169
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,680
and things. The bottom line is the

1170
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,920
average worker can't buy that much more

1171
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:03,200
stuff than they could in

1172
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:06,000
1980. Meanwhile, the wealthiest have

1173
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:09,599
gotten incredibly wealthy. Um the share

1174
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,599
of wealth uh in the US um the share of

1175
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:16,680
income controlled by the top 1% of

1176
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:21,520
people in the US uh was uh 26% in

1177
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:25,200
1989. Uh and it's 35% today.

1178
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:27,200
Even more in 2021

1179
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:28,400
uh in the coming back from the pandemic

1180
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:31,040
in the year you know in the year after

1181
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:34,319
the pandemic as we readjusted to life

1182
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:35,720
the top 1% of earners saw their incomes

1183
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:39,079
increase by

1184
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:41,680
9% while everyone else saw their incomes

1185
00:46:39,079 --> 00:46:42,800
decrease. So the top 1% of earners were

1186
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:44,079
the only group that actually saw their

1187
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,440
income increase. Everyone else saw

1188
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:47,440
income decrease because inflation aid

1189
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:50,800
into people's wages.

1190
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:53,280
The bottom line is we also a doesn't

1191
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:54,640
magically go to everyone. Okay, it's not

1192
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,480
like a more productive economy so

1193
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:58,319
everyone benefits. That's determined by

1194
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,880
a set of decisions made by individual

1195
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:01,599
actors in the economy and by the

1196
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:02,960
government. And that's what we'll talk

1197
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:04,079
about later semester is how does the

1198
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,720
government think about those decisions

1199
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:08,720
or how do we think as society about how

1200
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:11,040
to spend the extra resources we get when

1201
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:12,640
the economy gets more productive. Okay.

1202
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:14,880
Okay. And that comes to the topic of

1203
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:16,160
economic fairness which we won't spend

1204
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,319
nearly enough time on but we will come

1205
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:20,200
back to towards the end of the semester.

1206
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:23,040
Okay. Questions about

1207
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:25,440
that? All right. Why don't we stop there

1208
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:27,520
and uh there's there's no section

1209
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:29,119
Friday, right? No section Friday.

1210
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:31,599
Remember the first problem set is due

1211
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:32,720
next Friday and the section you go to

1212
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:34,560
next Friday is the one you're going to

1213
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:37,560
stay in for the semester. Okay. Thank

1214
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,560
you.
