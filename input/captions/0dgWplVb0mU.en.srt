1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:11,000
it's a great pleasure to basically give

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,759
a a general background introduction to

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,560
what Victoria is going to talk about in

4
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:19,439
the the second uh more detailed part um

5
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:21,720
and what I'll I'll basically try to do

6
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:25,039
is is focus indeed on the the big

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,880
picture of how can we use and uh

8
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,560
computational amics to decipher the

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,560
chemical language of the

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,719
microbiome what is the the chemical

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,640
language of the

12
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:37,600
microbiome well um of course in

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,320
microbiomes in Animal microbiomes Plant

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,840
microbiomes Human

15
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:44,600
microbiomes uh we see that there's a lot

16
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,280
of interactions going on between uh

17
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,520
bacteria between bacteria uh and the

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,280
host uh between beneficials and

19
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,359
pathogens Etc uh and many of these

20
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:57,640
interactions are actually mediated by

21
00:00:54,359 --> 00:01:00,440
molecules uh very frequently specialized

22
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,800
metabolites but sometimes also uh

23
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,119
uh like primary

24
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,680
metabolites here you see some examples

25
00:01:04,119 --> 00:01:08,320
in in the in the context of a plant

26
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,799
microbiome where we know that for

27
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,840
example pathogens May uh produce

28
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,280
molecules like pathogenicity factors

29
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,280
that actually facilitate the infection

30
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:21,000
process um there may be other uh

31
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:23,360
bacteria that actually inhibit the

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,520
pathogens by making molecules that are

33
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:29,920
actually for example um antimicrobial or

34
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,759
antifungal U there's also interactions

35
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,280
between the microbes and sometimes also

36
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,720
the host actually interacts with the

37
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:39,320
microbiome itself through such

38
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,079
metabolites and these metabolites you

39
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,200
could consider them as the chemical

40
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:44,479
language of the

41
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,119
microbiome um and they fulfill all sorts

42
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,479
of rules so

43
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:51,240
traditionally um many people mainly

44
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:54,600
thought of like antibiotics as the the

45
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:57,280
key kind of function of um of these

46
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:01,240
kinds of metabolites and of course there

47
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:03,159
are many antibiotics and antim Rials uh

48
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:05,880
out there that do play a role in in

49
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:07,680
microbiome interactions but I think uh

50
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,360
recently it's become much more clear

51
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,640
that the whole range of different

52
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,599
functions of these molecules is also

53
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,319
much broader of course uh it's well

54
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:18,160
known that you have molecules involved

55
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,480
in communication like form sensing

56
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:24,040
signals for example but also for example

57
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,440
U molecules that had initially be

58
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,879
thought of as as toxins like doxy Rubin

59
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,640
is a cytotoxic molecule that is actually

60
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,000
an anti-cancer drug

61
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,800
was recently shown to actually play a

62
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,800
key role in in Fage defense so the

63
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,200
ecological role may actually be quite

64
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:43,959
different from the biological activity

65
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:45,360
that was initially U measured similarly

66
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:48,280
there is many molecules that are

67
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,360
involved in nutrient AC acquisition you

68
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:53,640
see here also at the at the bottom right

69
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:55,280
you see fenin which were traditionally

70
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,080
known as kind of weak

71
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,400
antibiotics um but Diane y's group from

72
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,440
CCH actually showed that there actually

73
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,040
Redux active molecules that play a role

74
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,720
in mobilizing

75
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:09,120
solubilizing nutrients like like

76
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,680
phosphorus so lots of different roles

77
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,319
that all of these molecules have and

78
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:16,159
that also explains why they're so

79
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:19,080
incredibly uh diverse so actually when

80
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:22,239
you look across uh bacteria in

81
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:24,640
microbiomes you see that many bacteria

82
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,560
that have basically the same 16s

83
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,519
sequence that are part of the same

84
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,280
species these bacterial strains can

85
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:33,319
sometimes have vastly uh different uh

86
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,720
metabolic capacities with regard to

87
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:39,360
these specialized uh metabolic functions

88
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:41,840
so they may make quite different uh

89
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,519
molecules so we can also see this by

90
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,879
looking at the way the production of

91
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:49,040
these molecules is encoded in in genomes

92
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:52,079
for example for secondary metabolites we

93
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:54,959
look at what we call biosynthetic Gene

94
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:57,519
clusters so these are clustered groups

95
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,280
of genes that are adjacent on the

96
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:03,159
chromosome and that encode for all the

97
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:06,159
entic Machinery to make these molecules

98
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:09,920
uh also to transport them out of the

99
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:12,760
cell U Etc and you see often there is a

100
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,959
a correspondence between the chemistry

101
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,440
of these molecules as well as the the

102
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,959
genes that are part of these Gene

103
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:21,720
clusters here you see for example uh

104
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,880
this this Moy in in blue cumarin Mortin

105
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,600
rubbery is shared with this other

106
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:29,240
molecule in semyon and you see also

107
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,080
between these Gene clusters U their

108
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,639
their Corr responding uh the

109
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,960
corresponding genes that are responsible

110
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,320
for making that part of the the

111
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:38,280
structure are also

112
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:40,199
shared so looking at the genes within

113
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:43,639
these Gene clusters can therefore tell

114
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:45,960
you quite a bit uh about the

115
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:47,919
chemistry and this also tells us if we

116
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,800
look at the genomes of these organisms

117
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,960
that indeed um yeah very frequently

118
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,520
these Gene clusters are gained or lost

119
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,639
within species or they horizontally uh

120
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,840
transferred and that actually leads to a

121
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:03,320
lot of ecological uh specialization

122
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:05,320
and because of this actually the the

123
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:08,639
whole repertoire of these molecules is

124
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:10,840
extremely diverse so there's really many

125
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,840
hundreds of thousands uh or maybe

126
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:16,199
millions of different bacterial

127
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:18,280
molecules uh out there and we recently

128
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:21,240
teamed up with the group of Nadin seat

129
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:23,400
in in tuban uh to basically do an

130
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:26,039
analysis for the secondary metaboli B

131
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:28,039
synthetic Gene clusters of how diverse

132
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:30,800
are they really and and what percentage

133
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:34,440
of all these molecules do we

134
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,919
already known and that was done uh by

135
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:39,080
basically identifying across publicly

136
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:41,600
available genomes all of these bi

137
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:44,400
synthetic Gene clusters then grouping

138
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:47,080
them into families through a clustering

139
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,400
algorithms and actually we Ed two

140
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,680
independently uh developed clustering

141
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:54,000
algorithms one in my group Big Slice and

142
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,680
one from The helal Institute

143
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,880
pharmaceutical research in Germany

144
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,240
called customatic but as you see they

145
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:02,960
actually gave similar results these were

146
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,520
used to group the gene cluster family to

147
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:08,599
group these Gene clusters into families

148
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:11,120
uh in a way that ideally all of the gene

149
00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:13,560
clusters in one family correspond to

150
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,520
Pathways that are making similar uh

151
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,199
molecules and we did that at the level

152
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,759
of granularity that was calibrated or

153
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:22,440
fine-tuned based on a database of

154
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:25,840
chemical structure called the natural

155
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:28,319
product Atlas uh so that in cases where

156
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,479
for a gene cluster the chemical product

157
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,639
uh was known we made sure that gen

158
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:35,520
clusters with uh chemical products that

159
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:38,080
are part of the same chemical classes in

160
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:42,039
NP Atlas would also end up in the same

161
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:44,039
family so uh in that sense Gene clusters

162
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:46,080
were clustered in at the same level of

163
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:48,800
granularity that the molecules were

164
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,199
clustered in NP Atlas as as chemical

165
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,880
classes so if we then do a rare faction

166
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,639
analysis we can predict how many of

167
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:58,120
these chemical classes are out there in

168
00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:00,120
the biosphere based on currently uh

169
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,960
available U gen

170
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,919
information and according to this

171
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:08,319
analysis you see that you end up with a

172
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:10,919
prediction of well between 70,000 and

173
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:13,400
100,000 different chemical classes of

174
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:15,160
which at the moment only two and a half

175
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:18,680
thousand are known and that equals

176
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:21,800
around yeah 3% of the the predicted

177
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:24,720
chemical space as being known yes can I

178
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:27,080
ask in this context for the max um what

179
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,879
environment are they covering and did

180
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,280
you was there some quality filtering

181
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:32,479
involved to where there only high

182
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:34,520
quality ones or also lower quality Max

183
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:37,199
so what was the genome assemblage

184
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:40,120
quality of those yeah so the analysis on

185
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,400
the left that was uh based on only Isola

186
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:44,800
genomes and then of course we also

187
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:48,159
checked and that's the analysis on the

188
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,039
right uh like if we look into metagenome

189
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:53,440
assembled genomes that may cover also

190
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:56,080
part of the uncultivated uh majority of

191
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,840
microbes um yeah does that actually

192
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,840
change the situation and of course it's

193
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,520
a bit difficult with mags because

194
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:05,199
actually very frequently these Gene

195
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:08,520
clusters are missed in mags because they

196
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,879
are uh often strain specific and if you

197
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,440
have a combination of strains in the

198
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:14,120
same metag genomes they will not be

199
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:17,599
correlated in terms of abundance with

200
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:19,960
other conts of the same genomes um but

201
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:22,560
yeah if we looked we looked here at uh

202
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:26,960
at several high quality Mac collections

203
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:29,039
that were available um at the at the jgi

204
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:32,279
and that's what what Satria did the

205
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:34,560
person who uh who worked on this um and

206
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:36,880
yeah basically what what he saw is that

207
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:39,399
of course in terms of known types of

208
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,000
gene clusters that are in this database

209
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:43,680
my big and I will tell a bit more about

210
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,399
that later of known bthe Gene clusters

211
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,640
with known products there're only

212
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:49,880
there's very limited overlap with uh

213
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:53,160
metag genome asemble genomes and there's

214
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:55,560
also quite a bit of quite a substantial

215
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:57,560
fraction of King Cluster families that

216
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,200
are only found in the metagenome

217
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,040
assembled genomes and not in any isol

218
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,320
genome know which would actually

219
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:06,800
indicate that maybe we know less than 3%

220
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,600
of everything that's out

221
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,880
there

222
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:14,399
yes so then the question becomes like if

223
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,519
indeed it's really the vast majority of

224
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,360
the microbial chemistry in these

225
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:20,839
microbiomes and in the microbial

226
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:24,320
biosphere that is yet unknown is how do

227
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:28,240
we mine that um that diversity how do we

228
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,959
figure out uh across these millions uh

229
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,320
of Gene clusters and these tens of

230
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:35,360
thousands of chemical classes that are

231
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,120
uh likely out there which are the ones

232
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:41,320
that really matter because of course we

233
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,680
can't go after them one by one because

234
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,560
well actually characterizing

235
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:47,200
structurally characterizing um one of

236
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,680
these molecules elucidating the

237
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,519
biosynthetic pathways that's uh yeah

238
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,440
that's at least like multiple PhD

239
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,000
projects and if you multiply that by

240
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,720
tens of thousands you can uh kind of

241
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,920
calculate that's a few centuries of of

242
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:03,279
work likely still with with current like

243
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:05,519
um biochemical Technologies but we'

244
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:09,279
really like to find out like where are

245
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:11,640
the the hidden gems inside um this

246
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,760
biochemical diversity and this is a a

247
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:16,079
picture that was made by an artist from

248
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,880
nature review genetics when we had a a

249
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:21,360
review there and it kind of nicely shows

250
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,839
the process of what we call genom mining

251
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:27,399
so we have the DNA sequence here that's

252
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:30,240
going in this m shaft uh and it's it's

253
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:32,839
lined by a lot of stuff but only some of

254
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,440
that stuff are the the hidden gems and

255
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:36,639
what what would be the hidden gems and

256
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:39,519
and I would say there there will be two

257
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:41,440
things uh two general categories that I

258
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:44,000
would I would see as important things to

259
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,519
go after one of them is how to find

260
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
those molecules that can really explain

261
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:51,680
mechanistically and functionally the

262
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,480
microbiome Associated phenotypes such as

263
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:57,519
phenotypes associated with with health

264
00:10:53,480 --> 00:11:01,079
and disease uh and second uh of course

265
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:02,839
also molecules that uh could lead to uh

266
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:05,720
for example the development of new drugs

267
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:07,880
or new prop protection agents or other

268
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:11,440
molecules of societal

269
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:13,880
relevance so in this process of minding

270
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,560
um the biochemical diversity of the

271
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:18,240
microbiome um I will lead you through

272
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,040
three three steps in terms of the

273
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,560
algorithms and tools that we use for

274
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:25,600
this first of all is the it's the

275
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,519
identification of these Gene clusters

276
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,639
second is how do we chart their

277
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:33,519
diversity across large data sets of many

278
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:36,279
genomes or metag genomes and thirdly how

279
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:38,560
do we start predicting uh functions and

280
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:41,079
that really boils down to prioritizing

281
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:43,760
that large diversity to the specific

282
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:44,600
Gene clusters uh and and molecules that

283
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,880
really

284
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:49,360
matter so let's start at the start like

285
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:52,200
the identification of these metabolic

286
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,200
Gene clusters um and this is something I

287
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:57,800
actually started with when I was a PhD

288
00:11:54,200 --> 00:12:01,040
student myself uh yeah a little bit over

289
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:04,920
15 years ago uh when there is just there

290
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:07,680
were just a few genomes uh available uh

291
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:10,399
and I was given one uh streptomyces

292
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,600
genome uh myself to to look for

293
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,440
biosynthetic Gene clusters and I was

294
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,079
doing it some kind of semi-manually by

295
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:18,440
doing like blast searches and and these

296
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:20,279
kinds of things and I found it very

297
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:22,399
tedious and and boring and I thought

298
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:24,519
okay it should be possible to to make

299
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,440
this more automated and actually at the

300
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:28,000
time there was a project here at the

301
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:31,680
broad Institute where people were

302
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,639
sequencing like 20 genomes and back in

303
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,839
those days like 20 genomes was like how

304
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:38,360
do you even start analyzing that right

305
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,920
uh that's that's just

306
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:43,760
impossible

307
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:45,959
um but uh we did start working on it in

308
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:49,560
collaboration with um group in in

309
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:52,600
Germany KY blin and and silmana um and

310
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:54,519
we basically used a general strategy

311
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,440
that is still being used in in many of

312
00:12:54,519 --> 00:13:01,120
the tools today simply because it really

313
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:03,440
allows a very precise tuning of the uh

314
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,480
identification of these Gene clusters

315
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:09,040
where you start with an input uh genome

316
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,680
sequence and then you use a rule based

317
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:14,399
approach uh it's basically by finding

318
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:17,680
specific combinations of protein domains

319
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:19,800
that are cooc adjacently in the same

320
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,560
chromosomal region on the same

321
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:25,880
chromosomal Locus within a defined uh

322
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:28,160
distance and that uh that specific

323
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:30,160
combination of domains is indicative of

324
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,440
the presence of a certain certain type

325
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,160
of bthe Gene clusters because these

326
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:37,160
domains represent like the key enzimatic

327
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:40,120
domains that catalyze the key reactions

328
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:42,480
for such type of pathway for example

329
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:45,480
here we have like three key domains for

330
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,480
a given pathway types A B and C and you

331
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:50,240
might then create a rule that says okay

332
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:52,839
if we find either or domain a with

333
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,560
either domain b or domain C then we're

334
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:57,440
going to trigger the detection rules

335
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:00,240
saying okay this must be this and this

336
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:03,680
um kind of pathway and these kind of

337
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:06,639
logical rules you can tune uh yourself

338
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:09,680
and and U and also fine-tune calibrate

339
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:12,240
in a lot of detail uh and in in a

340
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,279
relatively complex space it it really

341
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,160
allows you to manually kind of draw a

342
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:20,079
line around your data points uh so to

343
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:22,800
say to very accurately uh predict

344
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:25,600
well-known types of mice Gene clusters

345
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:28,160
of course this um may not be the the the

346
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,079
best approach for finding entirely novel

347
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,199
kinds of pathways

348
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:34,959
um but actually when we look at most of

349
00:14:32,199 --> 00:14:37,079
these types of gene clusters the type

350
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:39,560
the key the core enzymology is very well

351
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:42,360
defined and that actually makes this

352
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:46,000
generally more accurate than for example

353
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:48,480
um machine learning uh methods uh which

354
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,680
are very useful for finding Noel things

355
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:54,160
um but not so U much for for finding

356
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,759
these well-known types of gene clusters

357
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,240
based on relatively small amounts of

358
00:14:55,759 --> 00:15:01,399
training data so this is formalized uh

359
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:04,040
can I hi yeah can I ask a question

360
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:06,639
please um with these rules like how

361
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:08,279
often do you I don't know this kind of a

362
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,959
vague question but if you're just

363
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:11,440
looking within a genome sequence and you

364
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:14,000
have these rules versus when you're

365
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,440
looking in a metag genome and it might

366
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,120
be that A and B are in one bug and C is

367
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:21,560
in the other and now would that be

368
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,480
considered passing the rule or is this

369
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:26,800
all just within a genome sequence this

370
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,360
is all within one chromosomal Locus

371
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:32,120
within one region in a chromosome so

372
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,680
generally it kind of the Assumption is

373
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,839
that all of the genes are clustered in

374
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:40,000
the in the same genome in the same

375
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:42,759
genomic location and that is in bacteria

376
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:47,279
for these kinds of Pathways It's usually

377
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:50,519
the case and 95 99% to another part of

378
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:51,920
the genome like a b is here and C moved

379
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:54,920
somewhere like I don't know a million

380
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:57,639
bases away or something that's rare

381
00:15:54,920 --> 00:16:00,240
that's very rare in bacteria so actually

382
00:15:57,639 --> 00:16:02,079
uh evolution somehow tends to optimize

383
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,160
for the the genes to be very tightly

384
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:07,759
clustered probably because they uh

385
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:09,360
they're co-regulated in this way they

386
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,519
they move together because there is also

387
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,279
a lot of horizontal Gene transfer and

388
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,079
there's there's a couple of reasons why

389
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:17,040
why this is likely the case if you look

390
00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:20,240
at other organisms like plants actually

391
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:22,560
for example like maybe half of the bisy

392
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,120
synthetic pathways are not clustered in

393
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,519
plants and there we actually need to

394
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:28,440
rely on other things like coexpression

395
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:31,880
uh to connect these genes and you can't

396
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,880
just rely on the the co

397
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:41,319
localization so in uh so this anti-

398
00:16:38,319 --> 00:16:44,759
smash software which yeah uh I started

399
00:16:41,319 --> 00:16:47,399
working on as a PhD student is U well

400
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:49,040
actually has undergone many uh many

401
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:51,199
versions now we're about to release

402
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,399
version eight where not only does it

403
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:55,519
identify the bthe gene clusters but

404
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:57,560
there are also a range of different uh

405
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:00,000
follow-up analyses to to kind of

406
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:03,600
annotate the gene clusters in detail in

407
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:07,000
terms of the the enzymes encoded um

408
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:10,079
comparative genomics etc

409
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,919
etc so I was just saying that for for

410
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:14,600
most of the biosynthetic pathway types

411
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:18,280
we can actually very accurately detect

412
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:20,319
them in this way I think for for the the

413
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:23,559
majority of the the canonical secondary

414
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:26,280
metabolic pathways and and Gene clusters

415
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:30,160
we anti- smash detects them like with

416
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:31,919
more than 99% accuracy there are also

417
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,440
some kinds of Pathways that are actually

418
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:37,000
more tricky uh and more difficult and

419
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:39,360
that's because they don't very work very

420
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,120
well with this this kind of rule-based

421
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:45,919
concept because there is not uh domains

422
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:47,880
a b or c that are always uh present uh

423
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:50,320
and in particular this is the case for

424
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:52,480
the ribosomally synthesized and

425
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:55,559
post-translationally modified peptides

426
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:58,120
which also often play key roles in in

427
00:17:55,559 --> 00:18:02,799
microbiomes and these are also called

428
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:05,159
rips short so that's the abbreviation um

429
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:07,280
and the thing is how these these Gene

430
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:09,559
clusters are are put together is you

431
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:12,440
have this tiny precursor peptide

432
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:14,679
encoding Gene like a a gene that encodes

433
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:18,000
for the production of a small peptide

434
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:20,440
and then you have some transporter often

435
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,480
to to transport it out of the cell some

436
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:24,760
modifying enzymes but they could

437
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:27,280
actually be anything uh so that actually

438
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:29,000
makes them really diverse so there's not

439
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,000
of course within specific classes of

440
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,039
these rips you find the same modifying

441
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,480
enzymes um but it's becoming clear that

442
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:38,799
um yeah there is really many dozens or

443
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,400
maybe hundreds of these classes out

444
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,559
there that all use different modifying

445
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,880
enzymes so there is very little in

446
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:47,799
common in terms of protein domains

447
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:51,440
between like the full breadth of these

448
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:53,360
types of gene clusters and that makes U

449
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:56,480
these specific types of gene clusters is

450
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:58,919
actually more uh challenging uh to to

451
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,640
detect

452
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:02,320
yeah so these modifying enzymes they

453
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,120
they could be anything and also for this

454
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:08,559
reason we we actually came up with a

455
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:10,600
specific um like alternative way of of

456
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:13,039
approaching this to find these types of

457
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:15,039
gene clusters are we actually start with

458
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:16,919
a machine learning model that first

459
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:20,080
tries to identify these precursor

460
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:21,919
peptide encoding genes trained based on

461
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,679
all of the known precursor peptide

462
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,240
encoding genes and actually see that

463
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,520
there is a number of physical chemical

464
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:30,400
properties related to their amino acid

465
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:32,840
composition charge characteristics and

466
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:36,240
and others that actually sets them apart

467
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:37,960
from uh from other small genes um so

468
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,280
there are certain physical chemical

469
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:43,440
characteristics that these um peptides

470
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:48,000
they tend to have in order to to be

471
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:51,840
stable not to be protea uh

472
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,480
like degraded very quickly um and also

473
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,720
to be to be

474
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:59,559
bioactive and in in that way we can

475
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:03,600
actually separate uh Rel ly well

476
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:05,799
potential pre R precursor uh encoding

477
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,280
genes from other small genes but of

478
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:09,440
course there's so many small genes out

479
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,240
there that even if you can do this at

480
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,480
99% accuracy you'll get still a lot of

481
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:17,120
false positives so we had to also

482
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,080
combine that with other criteria uh and

483
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,720
we do that by also looking like are they

484
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:23,559
within an are these putative precursive

485
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:26,679
peptide encoding genes are they located

486
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:30,280
in an operon structure uh with uh with

487
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:31,960
other genes that are enzyme encoding and

488
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:34,039
we're not limiting ourselves in this

489
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:36,240
case to specific enzyme families but we

490
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:38,280
just want to see enzymes because that

491
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,960
indicates that there is something

492
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:43,320
enzymatic going on um and another

493
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,240
Criterion is that many of these Gene

494
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:47,640
clusters actually are flying in and out

495
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:50,440
of genomes so they're usually not part

496
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:53,720
of the core Genome of a species or a

497
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:55,919
Genus so that's why we can also measure

498
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:58,200
that with a like an orthology

499
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:02,120
conservation score saying if they're

500
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:05,440
part of the the core uh of a Pang Genome

501
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:07,320
of a species or genus then they're much

502
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,080
less likely to be rips because these are

503
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:11,240
often specialized functions that are

504
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:13,520
strain or species specific if they're

505
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:17,320
part of the accessory genomes they're

506
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:19,799
much more likely to be and if we combine

507
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:22,039
uh basically all these criteria and we

508
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:24,679
decate it by removing all of the stuff

509
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:29,200
that we can already identify with uh

510
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:32,000
with anti smash U that actually uh yeah

511
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,720
gives us um a data set that you that is

512
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,679
actually small enough to manually go

513
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:41,120
through and highlight uh basically

514
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:42,520
candidate uh new classes of rip M

515
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,480
clusters and we did this a couple of

516
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:48,159
years ago in strepto mes which is a

517
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:50,240
model bacterium for secondary metabolism

518
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:53,240
and already there in this one genome we

519
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:58,840
or in this one genus uh we found around

520
00:21:53,240 --> 00:22:01,279
40 to 50 candidate new classes of um of

521
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:03,600
rip biosynthetic Gene clusters and that

522
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:05,559
corresponds to actually thousands of

523
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,679
biosynthetic Gene clusters in these uh

524
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:09,880
in these genomes and by now we've also

525
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,600
run this on a range of other Genera

526
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:14,360
including Genera from the human

527
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:17,480
microbiome um and there is really a lot

528
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:19,919
uh toh to discover in this way still so

529
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:22,720
that's that's pretty exciting can I also

530
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:25,520
ask another question um is the ordering

531
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:27,600
of genes important and also what

532
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,159
strength the gene is on so can I have

533
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,480
basically have a bio synthetic Gene

534
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:34,120
claster with genes on different strands

535
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:36,559
and would that be considered um

536
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:38,400
somehow yes so sometimes my synthetic

537
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:40,440
Gene clusters can be pretty large like

538
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,679
some of the largest ones can be 100 or

539
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,480
200 kilobases uh and then you might have

540
00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:46,600
10 or 20 upper arms that are pointing in

541
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,039
different directions uh but they're

542
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:52,760
still clustered so yes that's totally

543
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:56,200
possible um the order of the genes um I

544
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:58,960
don't think there's actually been a a

545
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:01,520
good paper to quantitatively uh prove

546
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,320
this but actually quite frequently the

547
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:06,640
order also matches the order of

548
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:09,360
reactions um not always but more

549
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,640
frequently than not uh and this probably

550
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:14,320
has to do with like being able to

551
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,840
quickly make molecules that enzymes that

552
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,919
carry out the first steps need to be

553
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,440
synthesized first they start carrying

554
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:23,480
out the first reaction and then in the

555
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,480
meantime the next proteins are also made

556
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:33,840
Etc can I ask another General question

557
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:36,960
um if you look bacterial species where

558
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:40,360
more is known like eoli or and you try

559
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:42,679
to I don't know identify the fraction of

560
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:45,159
the genome that's biosynthetic Gene

561
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:48,159
clusters or that makes rips like what is

562
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:50,679
that fraction and then like how does

563
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:52,960
that fraction compare to just like the

564
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:54,720
average genome that you take I don't

565
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,279
know say in an environmental metagenome

566
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,440
sample and you try to like annotate

567
00:23:56,279 --> 00:23:59,880
things like how

568
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,400
much there like a really well studied

569
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:04,360
genome where we can annotate everything

570
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:06,520
compared to one where we know much less

571
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:08,600
I'm just trying to like so so all of

572
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:10,480
this is I don't know at a high level

573
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,760
kind of based around homology is that

574
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,440
kind of right yes so I'm just kind of

575
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:16,120
curious like how much we need to know

576
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:18,400
for an environmental sample you think

577
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:21,799
most of these enzymatic pathways are

578
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:24,159
actually uh pretty ancient so they're

579
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:26,960
it's really the same families of enzymes

580
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:30,600
that you find like in model organisms

581
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:32,880
versus uh cultivated ones although I am

582
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:38,440
sure that there will be stuff that is

583
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:40,039
very like um specific to a specific clay

584
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,240
um but then these are usually also less

585
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:43,919
widespread types of pathway so there are

586
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,880
stuff that we're missing probably in

587
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:49,080
this sense but if we look at like the

588
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:51,799
widespread General classes of bis

589
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:54,000
synthetic Pathways um yeah I don't think

590
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:56,880
there is a big difference in our ability

591
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,919
to annotate them in eoli versus um like

592
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:03,039
uncultivated ACO bacteria or

593
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:04,720
something thank and the like the

594
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:09,159
percentage of the genome devoted to it

595
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:11,559
it can range from like 1% to 20% uh or

596
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:13,840
yeah in that order of

597
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:16,559
magnitude

598
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:18,640
yeah so then at some point we also

599
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:20,799
became interested and and this was in a

600
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,840
collaboration with with Michael Fishback

601
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:25,159
who was currently at Stanford University

602
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:27,320
and I spent some time uh in his lab

603
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:30,840
about 15 years ago when I was a PhD

604
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:32,640
student and he um he basically came to

605
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:34,960
me and said well actually in the gut

606
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,960
microbiome there's so many of these

607
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:40,640
primary metabolic Gene clusters that are

608
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:43,080
also frequently strain or species

609
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:46,840
specific and really drive the ecological

610
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:48,360
ecological niches of uh of the bacteria

611
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:50,360
that that Harbor these types of gene

612
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:53,640
clusters for example you have Gene

613
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:55,880
clusters for uh converting primary to

614
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:58,520
secondary B acids their Gene clusters

615
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:04,399
for short chain fatty acids production

616
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:05,760
amino acid catabolism etc etc um so yeah

617
00:26:04,399 --> 00:26:07,360
that's basically what started the

618
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:10,200
project that Victoria will tell more

619
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:14,480
about where we made like another version

620
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:16,399
of U or flavor of of anti smash which

621
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,840
was called gut smash which is really

622
00:26:16,399 --> 00:26:22,880
focused on finding um all of the

623
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:25,399
well-known types of catabolic uh Gene

624
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,120
clusters and their their Pathways uh

625
00:26:25,399 --> 00:26:29,600
that are also relevant to to gut

626
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:32,080
microbiome research yeah Victoria will

627
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,559
tell a lot more about that in Heron in

628
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,960
the meantime we're also working on other

629
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:37,480
flavors for example uh we've been

630
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:40,960
recently building and that's about to

631
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:43,000
come out um risos smash which is for for

632
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:46,039
plant microbiomes where we actually look

633
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,480
at catabolic Gene clusters for the

634
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:50,679
catabolism of a root Exodus because like

635
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,440
plants they exud 20% of their

636
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:56,320
photosynthetic carbon uh to the

637
00:26:53,440 --> 00:27:00,799
rizosphere so actually a lot of organic

638
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:02,440
acid sugars um Etc they're exuded to

639
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:05,240
actually recruit and modulate their

640
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:07,720
microbiome so understanding like what

641
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:09,200
kind of um catabolic Pathways and Gene

642
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:11,679
clusters that the members of the

643
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:14,120
microbiome has and in this case also

644
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:19,080
tell us like how can plants recruit

645
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:19,080
which U microbes to their their

646
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:25,320
microbiome

647
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,880
okay that brings me to to The Next Step

648
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:29,200
um and that is really charting the

649
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,960
diversity of these Gene clust

650
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,320
um because of course you can identify

651
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,919
them in single genomes but of course

652
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:37,679
yeah generally we don't work with single

653
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:41,919
genomes not even with 20 genomes like in

654
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:44,880
uh 2010 but maybe 20,000 or 20 million

655
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:45,840
genomes um and for that we actually

656
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,559
together with International

657
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:50,640
collaborators build an extensive

658
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:52,600
software ecosystem of tools that are

659
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,399
interoperable with each other that

660
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:57,799
really allow this kind of large scale uh

661
00:27:55,399 --> 00:27:59,760
analysis I already mentioned briefly the

662
00:27:57,799 --> 00:28:01,960
the big slice clustering algorithm at

663
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:04,919
the start which groups Gene clusters

664
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:06,720
into families um in general we we start

665
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:09,200
with the the gene clusters that we can

666
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:12,480
predict or identify in genomes with anti

667
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:15,799
smash dut smash Riser smash um then we

668
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,559
have databases like mayic for known B

669
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:20,519
synthetic Gene clusters which at the

670
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:23,080
moment hosts about 3,000 Gene clusters

671
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:25,120
with known chemical products and then we

672
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:27,720
can start grouping these Gene clusters

673
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,880
into families with either with the

674
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:31,919
sequence similarity networking that's in

675
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,880
big scape or with vector-based

676
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:36,080
clustering approaches like in in Big

677
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:37,799
Slice when you do it with big scape you

678
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,440
get these networks where each node

679
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:42,120
represents one bis synthetic Gene

680
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:45,159
cluster or metabolic Gene cluster and

681
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:47,080
they're connected to each other uh if

682
00:28:45,159 --> 00:28:48,600
their Mutual similarity based on a

683
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:51,080
number of distance metrics and I'll come

684
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:52,880
back to that in a moment uh is higher

685
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:55,080
than a certain threshold and in this way

686
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:58,080
you can with graph clustering also group

687
00:28:55,080 --> 00:29:01,200
them into families to know which clust

688
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,880
ERS across a set of genomes are actually

689
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:06,360
closely related to each other and are

690
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:09,039
likely to encode for the same kind of

691
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:11,840
pathway so coming back briefly to this

692
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:15,080
this database of of known bog Gene

693
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:17,399
clusters uh this is also really fun

694
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:20,480
project which has really been uh an open

695
00:29:17,399 --> 00:29:23,960
science uh initiative so uh earlier this

696
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:27,080
year we actually ran like massive online

697
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:29,120
parallel annotation marathons so we had

698
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:31,679
like um

699
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:34,360
um halfday Zoom sessions with more than

700
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:36,159
250 people who all came online to

701
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:38,720
actually annotate all of these gen

702
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:41,000
clusters in a standardized way um

703
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:44,200
they're subdivided into teams based on

704
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,960
their expertise we had a review system

705
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:49,320
to actually ensure also the the quality

706
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,919
of the annotations and in this way we

707
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:55,600
can really get a lot of information that

708
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:57,320
is out there uh in the literature uh in

709
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,120
into this database in a standardized

710
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:02,559
format and it's really also the basis

711
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:04,720
for a lot of the um followup like

712
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:06,039
prediction algorithms that you can build

713
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:09,799
within this

714
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:11,720
space so then to to Big scape the the

715
00:30:09,799 --> 00:30:14,120
clustering of these Gene cluster

716
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:16,320
families the key trick that we employed

717
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:19,000
there is that we start by basically

718
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:21,120
translating the sequences of these Gene

719
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,600
clusters to strings of protein domains

720
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:26,440
to kind of have a small scale uh

721
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:28,200
representation of a gene cluster so you

722
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:30,039
do protein domain calling and then you

723
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:32,360
have let's say strings of protein

724
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:35,399
domains that represent a bis synthetic

725
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:37,880
Gene cluster um and in The Next Step

726
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:39,399
these P cluster representations they can

727
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:41,919
be

728
00:30:39,399 --> 00:30:43,960
um uh compared to each other using a

729
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:46,720
couple of different metrics the simplest

730
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:48,519
metric is just to say okay jard index of

731
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,760
the protein domains like if you have a

732
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:54,159
pair of these Gene cluster protein

733
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:55,880
domain strings what fraction of the

734
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:58,320
protein domains are shared between both

735
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:00,840
of them or are unique to either one or

736
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:03,919
to the other you can also do that with

737
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:05,519
pairs of adjacent protein domains which

738
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:08,840
tells us something about the

739
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:11,279
conservation of of order uh and that can

740
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:15,000
be done with uh also with triplets for

741
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:16,360
example um and then finally uh but also

742
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,880
importantly we want to have some

743
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:20,559
indication of how similar uh these

744
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,559
domains actually are to each other in

745
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:24,320
terms of sequence because some of these

746
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:26,600
protein domains can have very broad

747
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:29,080
functions and you actually need to know

748
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:30,799
how closely related are they really uh

749
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:33,279
in sequence because that tends to

750
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:35,279
correlate pretty well with the chemistry

751
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:38,480
and the catalytic activity of the

752
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:39,480
enzymes of course so this is done

753
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,919
sometimes you have different copy

754
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:43,600
numbers of the domains and that also

755
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:45,639
needs to be taken into account so yeah

756
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,320
we in case there's like two domains in

757
00:31:45,639 --> 00:31:49,480
one gene cluster and one domain in the

758
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:51,760
other Gene cluster we' regard like the

759
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:53,480
the best scoring pair of these uh to

760
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:56,039
take the the sequence identity between

761
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:58,799
them and the other uh we would basically

762
00:31:56,039 --> 00:32:01,159
give a zero so that the duplication

763
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:04,720
index is also taken into account and

764
00:32:01,159 --> 00:32:06,760
then for the sequence identity uh itself

765
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:09,159
U of course the sequences need to be

766
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:11,440
aligned and actually the the by far the

767
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:14,600
quickest way to do that is to align them

768
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:17,440
all against the Prof Mark of models with

769
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:19,039
which they were detected at first so

770
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,919
initially we did it using multiple

771
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:23,279
sequence alignment like muscle and math

772
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:25,240
type of sequence alignment but that

773
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:27,880
scales horribly because you have all

774
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:30,720
versus all comparison uh and it BAS

775
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:32,360
Bally takes a lot of time um but by

776
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,880
actually aligning aligning all the

777
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:36,799
sequences against um U the hit marov

778
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:39,760
model

779
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:42,840
profiles uh actually it it uh it's

780
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:46,039
almost linear in terms of runtime when

781
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:48,679
you go to larger samples so that makes

782
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:48,679
makes a big

783
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:53,080
difference and then we can visualize

784
00:32:50,919 --> 00:32:55,639
this of course so here is um an output

785
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:58,919
of uh first version of big scape where

786
00:32:55,639 --> 00:33:01,679
you get U this kind of uh

787
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:04,559
output for in this case 120 genomes you

788
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:07,399
see like an absence presence Matrix of

789
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:09,799
families of Gene clusters across uh

790
00:33:07,399 --> 00:33:12,200
different genomes can then also go to a

791
00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:15,840
specific type of Gene cluster like in

792
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:19,799
this case a type of Pathways related to

793
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:23,320
PKS poly ketide synthesis um and here

794
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:25,360
you can interactively really also in um

795
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:27,840
browse and and explore these kinds of

796
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:30,000
network for example also by typing in

797
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,840
keywords like the molecules that are

798
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,639
related to these known bthe Gene

799
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:37,279
clusters reference bgc's from my big and

800
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:39,519
it will highlight it in the network and

801
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:41,480
you you will immediately see which other

802
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:44,080
gen clusters from certain organisms are

803
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:46,840
closely related to this and you get a a

804
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:49,159
multilocus fenny also of these Gene

805
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:51,039
clusters to see what are the how they're

806
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:53,320
related and what are the key

807
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:57,399
similarities and

808
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:59,600
differences at the moment we're uh we're

809
00:33:57,399 --> 00:34:02,519
bringing out a second version of this

810
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:05,159
which is uh going to be a lot faster

811
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:07,919
about 10 times uh Faster

812
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:10,839
by through a number of additional uh

813
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:13,159
tricks and also through local storage of

814
00:34:10,839 --> 00:34:14,599
all the intermediate data uh you can

815
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:18,560
actually use this to hundreds of

816
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:23,000
thousands of uh Gene clusters easily um

817
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:23,000
so yeah basically without Ram

818
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:29,919
limitations okay I'll briefly skip this

819
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:33,679
this um because I want to have a little

820
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:36,040
bit of time to go for to the the last uh

821
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:38,240
part of my talk which is a bit of the

822
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:40,760
forward-looking part which is how do we

823
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:43,159
really predict which of these Gene

824
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:46,359
clusters actually matter what are their

825
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:47,800
uh what are their likely functions um

826
00:34:46,359 --> 00:34:50,720
and I think this is really one of the

827
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:52,599
key questions in this very large genomic

828
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:54,720
space so there's so many of these

829
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:56,119
metabolic Gene clusters out there which

830
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,760
have all sorts of functions and we

831
00:34:56,119 --> 00:35:01,119
really need to predict for example in

832
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:04,000
microbiome setting um which ones really

833
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:06,839
matter to explain a certain microbiome

834
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,040
Associated phenotypes this is really a

835
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:11,480
key challenge that I've been tackling

836
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:15,320
with my group as part of an ERC grant

837
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:17,560
that is U uh finishing next year already

838
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:18,880
uh it's called the decipher uh where

839
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:21,240
we've been following a couple of

840
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:23,480
different strategies to try to predict

841
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:25,800
functions of these my sythetic gen

842
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:28,359
clusters the first strategy that we've

843
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:32,079
been following is actually expression

844
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:34,240
based so sometimes you have um like a

845
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:38,680
range of samples and you have phenotypic

846
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:41,240
metadata on them for example um Health

847
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:43,680
disease metadata and you can actually

848
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:46,440
look at for example the expression of a

849
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:49,720
BGC and C is that associated with the

850
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:51,040
phenotype or not very simplistically and

851
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:53,880
in this case if you have the the

852
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:56,640
microbiome Associated phenotype here at

853
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:58,599
the left across samples and you see that

854
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:01,040
the expression of this red Gene cluster

855
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:03,160
corresponds much better to the phenotype

856
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:05,800
than the expression of the blue Gene

857
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:07,480
cluster so yeah from that you you might

858
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:09,760
think okay maybe the red Gene cluster is

859
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:10,480
more likely to be involved in mediating

860
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,960
that

861
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:15,480
phenotype but what you could also do is

862
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,960
actually use the Expression uh patterns

863
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:20,880
of other genes and other Gene clusters

864
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:22,560
either within the same genome or across

865
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:26,040
genomes of different members of the

866
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:28,160
microbiome and use these as uh as your

867
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:30,400
phenotypes so when whenever a certain

868
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:32,960
Gene cluster is expressed what happens

869
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:35,560
in the rest of the cell what happens in

870
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:38,400
the rest of the microbiome uh could that

871
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:42,760
be causally uh related

872
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:45,480
essentially and for this uh Zack writes

873
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:47,480
former post loock in my lab um developed

874
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:50,640
a tool called Coco Locus which generates

875
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:52,400
these coexpression networks of metabolic

876
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:56,920
Gene clusters and other genes in the

877
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:59,480
genome here the large uh nodes are the

878
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:02,640
gene clusters in a given genome and

879
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:05,560
they're represented by say an igen

880
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:08,560
Vector of the expression levels of their

881
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:10,319
constituent genes and all the gray

882
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:13,079
smaller notes there other genes in the

883
00:37:10,319 --> 00:37:15,800
genome that are strongly correlated in

884
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:17,319
expression uh with at least one of these

885
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:19,800
uh metabolic Gene

886
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:22,319
clusters and you can also already see

887
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:25,520
that there's groups uh forming of Gene

888
00:37:22,319 --> 00:37:28,560
clusters that tend to be uh coexpressed

889
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:30,680
and you can also um d into that further

890
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:32,480
by also including regulatory information

891
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:34,839
for example transcription Factor binding

892
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:39,000
sites and here you see for example and

893
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:41,319
this is work of of Hana who is down here

894
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,240
uh who actually annotated this this

895
00:37:41,319 --> 00:37:46,000
network and saw that like all of the

896
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:47,640
genes and the gene clusters over here

897
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,480
they all have binding sites for this

898
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:53,520
specific regulator called dmd1 which is

899
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,839
involved in in Iron uh response and

900
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:57,760
actually two of these three Gene

901
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:59,760
clusters uh these two two of these three

902
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:02,520
over there they're actually encoding the

903
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:04,720
bi biosynthesis of known cidera fores

904
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:06,760
which are iron Scavenging molecules

905
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:10,760
which also play a key role in like the

906
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:12,200
battle for iron between microbes and the

907
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:14,560
host and the

908
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:16,400
microbiome but at the same time she also

909
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,640
saw another Gene cluster in that same

910
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,240
part of the expression network uh of the

911
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,440
co-expression network which was an

912
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:26,160
unknown uh Gene cluster for which we

913
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:28,800
didn't know a function yet um and she

914
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:30,920
made crisper cast workouts of all of the

915
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:33,319
genes in that Gene cluster and it

916
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:36,160
actually turned out to be also involved

917
00:38:33,319 --> 00:38:38,880
in sad for biosynthesis which really uh

918
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:41,319
indicates that indeed uh you can use

919
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:43,720
this kind of inference uh to predict

920
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:46,079
functions for a gene cluster

921
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:47,920
specifically this uh Gene cluster which

922
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:49,960
you see over here it's the top Gene

923
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,599
cluster is working together with one of

924
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:55,000
the other Gene clusters to produce a

925
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:57,960
specific subclass of these well-known

926
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:01,359
sedor called desferoxamine

927
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:04,440
the the acid capped um deser

928
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:06,400
oxim and actually when you knock out

929
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:09,119
this Gene clusters then you see that

930
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:11,800
there's no effective production of these

931
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:15,599
sedera for in I think what is really

932
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:17,280
cool is that um not only can we predict

933
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:20,400
the function of a gene cluster but this

934
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:23,040
was also in a model organism serto color

935
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:25,400
which has been studied uh in terms of

936
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:27,640
its B synthetic Gene clusters for

937
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:30,240
decades and this specific pathway for

938
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:32,800
deser xamines is also a very well-known

939
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:35,480
model pathway for seder fores which

940
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:38,520
people also have studied for a long time

941
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:41,440
already and still nobody had ever U

942
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:43,480
known or hypothesized any role for this

943
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,960
particular Gene cluster and based on the

944
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:47,720
combination of coexpression and

945
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:50,440
co-regulation we could really uh figure

946
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:53,079
out this function so I think this this

947
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:54,960
is a promising strategy to figure out

948
00:39:53,079 --> 00:39:58,400
what these kinds of Gene clusters are

949
00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:00,240
doing I also mentioned like species

950
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,680
correlations and how they can be helpful

951
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:05,000
and and Robert ker in my lab is pursuing

952
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:07,560
that further he has been trying this out

953
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,520
with a number of model uh synthetic

954
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:13,720
microbial communities and one of them is

955
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:16,640
uh a synthetic Community from uh that's

956
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:19,319
a model for a rizosphere microbiome it's

957
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:22,839
composed of these three bacteria zamonas

958
00:40:19,319 --> 00:40:23,920
koranis um Flor bacteria neonia and

959
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:26,920
basilla

960
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:29,800
serus and when you actually look across

961
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:32,359
the whole range of

962
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:35,160
co-cultures like both dual co-cultures

963
00:40:32,359 --> 00:40:37,920
triple co-cultures mutants in different

964
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:40,400
conditions Etc you actually see that

965
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:42,839
there's also specific cross species

966
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:45,119
correlation and anti-correlation in the

967
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:48,480
expression of the metabolic Gene

968
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:51,240
clusters for example this zamonas has a

969
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:54,079
gene cluster for a molecule called cor

970
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:57,040
enin and this is an antibiotic and

971
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:59,599
whenever zamonas makes that antibiotic

972
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:02,880
it's seems that the basilla strain

973
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:05,920
actually responds by turning off all its

974
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:08,160
cider for production but it's also

975
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:10,599
highly positively correlated with these

976
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:13,079
two Gene clusters over here which

977
00:41:10,599 --> 00:41:15,680
actually encode the production of of

978
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:18,880
molecules that are U known to be

979
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:21,760
protective against uh Redux stress uh

980
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:25,040
and also against Redux stress inducing

981
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:28,119
antibiotics called basil so whenever the

982
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:31,560
antibiotic is produced by am Monas

983
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:34,160
billus will start to basically produce

984
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:38,200
these uh protective compounds and at the

985
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:41,160
same time it also um uh increases the

986
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:44,480
expression of efflux pumps and other

987
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:46,920
kind of defense mechanisms and in this

988
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,599
way um yeah we're we're thinking that

989
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:51,720
this can also be a way for example to

990
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:54,240
find antibiotics so whenever uh a

991
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:56,880
certain one bacterium in a microbial

992
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:59,640
Community uh expresses all of these

993
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,880
defens mechanisms uh it's likely that

994
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:04,160
there's another member of the community

995
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:06,000
at the same time that is producing some

996
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:09,040
kind of antibiotic and by looking at the

997
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,440
cross species correlations of expression

998
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:13,000
uh it it should be possible to also in

999
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,440
hopefully that's the next step that

1000
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,119
we're going to do in more complex

1001
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:19,599
communities to unravel these

1002
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:21,240
antagonistic interactions between

1003
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:23,880
microbes and the the genes and Gene

1004
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:28,280
clusters that are mediating

1005
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:31,319
them and finally um one other strategy

1006
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:33,319
that we're uh using uh to to predict

1007
00:42:31,319 --> 00:42:36,680
function for these metabolic Gene

1008
00:42:33,319 --> 00:42:39,520
clusters is basically through prediction

1009
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:42,640
of the structures of course there's many

1010
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:45,200
databases of bacterial metabolites and

1011
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:47,880
their chemical structures uh and often

1012
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:50,680
also associated with functional metadata

1013
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:53,640
like biological activities we know that

1014
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:56,640
for example bcam rings are very often

1015
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:59,599
associated with antibiotics you have

1016
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:01,440
these Keating Moes that are binding

1017
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:03,880
metals that are often associated with

1018
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:08,040
metallophores or specifically sedera

1019
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:10,200
fores Etc uh so we can find Association

1020
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:13,599
of of substructures of molecules with

1021
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:15,599
specific types of uh biological

1022
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:18,000
activities at the same time we can

1023
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:21,319
actually predict also structural

1024
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,559
features from Gene clusters by for

1025
00:43:21,319 --> 00:43:27,800
example Subs specificity predictions of

1026
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:29,880
enzymes or by finding these sub clusters

1027
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:32,400
these groups of co-evolving genes within

1028
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:34,680
Gene clusters that are associated with

1029
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:37,400
the biosynthesis of a specific chemical

1030
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:39,119
myy and thus we can also get predicted

1031
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:41,480
structural features from the gene

1032
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:43,280
clusters and then we can see is there a

1033
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:46,079
match between let's say the predicted

1034
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:48,040
structural features from Gene clusters

1035
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:51,800
and Association of these structural

1036
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:53,240
features with uh certain uh types of

1037
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:56,720
activities of

1038
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:58,880
interest and as an example uh Zach whom

1039
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:01,319
I mentioned earlier actually formalized

1040
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:05,960
this for metallor so these are molecules

1041
00:44:01,319 --> 00:44:09,319
that are metal binding uh by in detail

1042
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:11,599
looking at all of the uh subpathways

1043
00:44:09,319 --> 00:44:13,240
within uh more complex bis sythetic

1044
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:15,720
Pathways that are involved in making

1045
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:18,119
substructures that are metal binding so

1046
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:21,079
these keading groups they are called

1047
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:22,839
here you see uh in this panel B all of

1048
00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:25,160
these keying groups and their B

1049
00:44:22,839 --> 00:44:27,440
synthetic Pathways and for each of these

1050
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:31,640
keying Group B sythetic pathway made

1051
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:35,119
like uh anti- smash rules to detect the

1052
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:37,480
specific combination of enzymes so to

1053
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:40,280
really detect within a complex

1054
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:42,599
biosynthetic Gene clusters are there the

1055
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:45,359
genes are there genes present for making

1056
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:46,200
these specific uh substructures as part

1057
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:50,440
of the

1058
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:53,880
molecules and um yeah so this actually

1059
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:57,079
works pretty well so um get an F1 score

1060
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:59,000
of 86 very high Precision meaning that

1061
00:44:57,079 --> 00:45:01,040
if these path these subpathways are

1062
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,839
present then it's almost always a

1063
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:05,000
metallor sometimes you miss things so

1064
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:07,760
the recall is a bit lower because and I

1065
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,319
think there was a question earlier um

1066
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,920
occasionally these genes are elsewhere

1067
00:45:09,319 --> 00:45:12,440
in the genome so if these genes are

1068
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:16,000
outside the gene cluster elsewhere in

1069
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:18,880
the genome you might kind of miss out on

1070
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:21,800
uh being able to predict this

1071
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:25,280
functionality there was a previous paper

1072
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:27,920
uh also from uh UC Berkeley on using

1073
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:30,119
transporter genes for prediction of of

1074
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:32,119
metallor bioactivity this this works a

1075
00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:34,440
bit less well U but you can actually

1076
00:45:32,119 --> 00:45:36,119
also combine these like looking at the

1077
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,920
enzymes and the Transporters and

1078
00:45:36,119 --> 00:45:41,520
together actually works even a bit

1079
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:44,400
better with an F1 of 0. n um yeah and

1080
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:46,520
this way sa was also able to do like a

1081
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:49,440
to get a global sense of like across

1082
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:51,079
many genomes like how many uh of all

1083
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,800
these te clusters actually have this

1084
00:45:51,079 --> 00:45:55,720
kinds of functionality um and we're able

1085
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:58,240
to actually functionally annotate in

1086
00:45:55,720 --> 00:46:01,000
this way a pretty substantial

1087
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:03,839
fraction of the gene

1088
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:06,720
cluster at the same time to also expand

1089
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:09,520
this to other key types of biological

1090
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:11,960
activities um and ideally you would want

1091
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:14,040
to do this also with uh with for example

1092
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:15,520
machine learning methods where you're

1093
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:17,800
not dependent on these rigid

1094
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:20,319
associations with a specific chemical

1095
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:22,400
substructure and and a specific

1096
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:24,520
biological function of course it would

1097
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:27,359
be really cool to to do this in a more

1098
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:30,319
generalized way um and I do think there

1099
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:33,599
is a lot of potential also for for AI to

1100
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:34,920
to help with this um at the same time

1101
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:38,800
and this was highlighted also in this

1102
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:41,119
piece in nature I think two years ago um

1103
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:44,599
that there is really a lack of large

1104
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:46,920
scale standardized data to do this well

1105
00:46:44,599 --> 00:46:48,920
and this is also U yeah something that

1106
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:51,520
came up in a in a workshop that we

1107
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:55,920
organized in in Leiden uh a couple years

1108
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:57,359
ago on like how we can use AI uh for in

1109
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:59,680
this case drug discover

1110
00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:02,480
from these natural products um that

1111
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:04,559
there's really a need for these high uh

1112
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:07,440
high quality large scale standardized

1113
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:09,440
data sets and um I'm I'm happy to say

1114
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:11,680
that by now there's really initiatives

1115
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:14,359
going on with large scale collaborations

1116
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:17,520
to get this going also for example with

1117
00:47:14,359 --> 00:47:20,200
large libraries of purified molecules

1118
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:23,160
that can be tested across a range of

1119
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:26,480
standardized essays to to really get

1120
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:26,480
better activity

1121
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:35,800
so now that Marx already payed me the

1122
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:38,720
way to talk about uh metabolites and

1123
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:40,640
algorithms I wanted to start by delving

1124
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:43,000
a little bit deeper into the human

1125
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:46,119
microbiome and the metabolites that they

1126
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:49,000
produce most of the bacteria that H

1127
00:47:46,119 --> 00:47:51,119
reside in our gut are anerobic bacteria

1128
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,720
so they are the responsible of producing

1129
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:56,480
this uh wide range of

1130
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:59,480
metabolites um these metabolites are

1131
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:02,040
important for either micro poost

1132
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:03,960
interactions or for micro micro

1133
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:06,640
interactions and depending on the

1134
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:10,200
concentrations they are produced they

1135
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:12,040
can have either beneficial effect for

1136
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:15,480
our health or

1137
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:18,359
detrimental and this for example um as

1138
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:20,040
an example of this is andol for example

1139
00:48:18,359 --> 00:48:23,680
this is a molecule that is produced in

1140
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:26,400
the gut and in low concentrations it it

1141
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:29,160
can have beneficial effects for the

1142
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:31,119
immune system but in high concentrations

1143
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:34,559
this molecule can translocate into the

1144
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:38,319
brain and then it can via the gut brain

1145
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:41,480
barrier and then it it can disrupt the

1146
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:45,000
the motor activity of the host and we

1147
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:49,640
have other examples like p fasol v acids

1148
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:52,280
that can help uh digest lipid um

1149
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:54,000
metabolites and short chain fatty acids

1150
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:57,160
that are well known also for having

1151
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:00,760
beneficial effects for the for the head

1152
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:04,680
for the gut uh by helping tightening the

1153
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:08,920
cell Junctions and promoting the immune

1154
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:12,319
um immune system but there's a still a a

1155
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:14,640
large black box that we don't know like

1156
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:15,960
which kind of molecules these microbes

1157
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:18,839
are

1158
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:20,760
producing and this is actually not only

1159
00:49:18,839 --> 00:49:22,280
the case of the human microbiome but it

1160
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:25,119
also applies to other types of

1161
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:27,160
microbiomes like the oral microbiome the

1162
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:30,319
risos spere as manx was was talking

1163
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:33,240
about so it is very important to know

1164
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:35,520
actually who is doing what in these

1165
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:37,240
communities which are the actual

1166
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:39,000
mechanisms that are triggering the

1167
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:42,400
specific phenotypes that we are

1168
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:44,720
interested on because if we know we can

1169
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:47,000
answer these questions we will be in a

1170
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:48,280
much better position to actually

1171
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,040
understand and manipulate these

1172
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:51,040
communities as

1173
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:55,559
desired

1174
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:58,200
and as Marx was already mentioning

1175
00:49:55,559 --> 00:50:01,599
before one of the peculiarities of these

1176
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:05,920
metabolites that the the gmic bacteria

1177
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:09,319
produce are known to be encoded in

1178
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:11,520
metabolic Gene clusters mgc in shorts

1179
00:50:09,319 --> 00:50:14,040
and these are actually the genes that

1180
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:16,280
are closed together in the genome and

1181
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:18,480
they are responsible responsible for the

1182
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:20,559
regulation the synthesis transportation

1183
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:25,000
of the of the

1184
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:27,599
metabolite and and this is actually very

1185
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:30,799
interesting but since there was no to to

1186
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:34,040
be able to predict such uh metabolic gen

1187
00:50:30,799 --> 00:50:35,839
clusters we decided to tailor the anti

1188
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:38,400
smash break more that was already

1189
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:40,680
working very well for uh biosynthetic

1190
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:44,799
genin clusters for secondary

1191
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:48,760
metabolism um into gut smash uh which

1192
00:50:44,799 --> 00:50:52,040
mik already briefly mentioned before so

1193
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:53,880
we tailored anti smashed into guts smash

1194
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:55,799
to be able to predict specialized

1195
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:57,319
primary metabolic Zin clusters from

1196
00:50:55,799 --> 00:51:02,640
anerobic B

1197
00:50:57,319 --> 00:51:04,400
and all the and and we actually um yeah

1198
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:08,440
modified and generate new

1199
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:10,799
functionalities to be able to um

1200
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:12,640
properly annotate and and identify this

1201
00:51:10,799 --> 00:51:16,079
kind of te

1202
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:18,720
clusters and how gut smash Works uh it

1203
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:21,200
uses logic detection rules these logic

1204
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:25,040
detection rules are Pam combinations

1205
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:27,359
that uh work together in a way that are

1206
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:32,440
uh relevant because they dis they are

1207
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:36,880
the signature of a specific Redux um er

1208
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:39,640
um Redux uh mechanism or or or pathway

1209
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:42,720
so for example in this case here we have

1210
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:46,520
pfl like domain and radical D radical

1211
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:49,000
Sam domain or bfl acetate and radical

1212
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:52,839
Sam domain if we find this combination

1213
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:55,880
of B FS within a within 20 KBS this is

1214
00:51:52,839 --> 00:52:00,480
the signature uh reaction for the pway

1215
00:51:55,880 --> 00:52:04,440
to acetate last for me pathway and then

1216
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:08,319
once we we identify the the the cin we

1217
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:11,200
extend the the the gluster on both of

1218
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:14,160
the flanks to be able to include the the

1219
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:17,400
other cor biosynthetic gen clusters that

1220
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:20,119
might be uh

1221
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:23,520
nearby and we actually have two

1222
00:52:20,119 --> 00:52:25,960
different types of uh of rules one that

1223
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:27,400
are known to be specific to known

1224
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:32,440
pathways

1225
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:35,760
so this would be for example uh yeah um

1226
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:39,599
Pathways that see that have the same uh

1227
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:42,079
core enzyme activity but having like a

1228
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:44,440
little bit of flexibility within this uh

1229
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:46,599
pathway so that we can yeah still

1230
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:48,839
predict from different organisms and

1231
00:52:46,599 --> 00:52:50,960
then we have the general rules that aim

1232
00:52:48,839 --> 00:52:53,599
to Target important Redux enzymes in

1233
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:55,599
certain context that seem to be relevant

1234
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:57,359
and this could be for example a flavor

1235
00:52:55,599 --> 00:53:00,960
enzyme which is

1236
00:52:57,359 --> 00:53:03,079
find together uh with a short chain

1237
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:04,960
dehydrogenase this could be for example

1238
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:07,960
a novel cluster related to lipid

1239
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:11,960
catabolism but of course the the

1240
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:15,280
specific function is is yet

1241
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:17,359
unknown so we started from a collection

1242
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:20,160
of non Pathways that were previously

1243
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:22,760
calized and and and they were published

1244
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:25,000
so we could have access to the to the

1245
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:28,000
catalytic reaction of this pathway we

1246
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:31,520
knew which were the the core en

1247
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:34,599
timeses and and we have a yeah a a

1248
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:37,720
collection of these Pathways that here

1249
00:53:34,599 --> 00:53:40,720
you have a a representation of these T

1250
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:42,280
clusters as you can see they look pretty

1251
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:43,799
different from each other some of them

1252
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:47,040
are very short some of them are very

1253
00:53:43,799 --> 00:53:50,000
long and also in terms of reactions they

1254
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:52,680
are very different and examples of them

1255
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:55,960
are for example the triamine producing

1256
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:58,680
Gene cluster the P forol Gene cluster

1257
00:53:55,960 --> 00:54:02,799
ethanol pathway

1258
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:06,160
Etc and so we had uh 43 different

1259
00:54:02,799 --> 00:54:08,960
Pathways that we uh used to build uh the

1260
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:11,079
known path the the the detection rules

1261
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:14,280
for these known

1262
00:54:11,079 --> 00:54:17,280
Pathways and how did we actually uh

1263
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:19,200
build this uh detection worlds well so

1264
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:24,599
we started with from this collection of

1265
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:28,359
known uh of known um Pathways from there

1266
00:54:24,599 --> 00:54:30,480
we could identify the core genes and

1267
00:54:28,359 --> 00:54:33,599
then discern the core genes from the

1268
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:35,559
auxiliary ones from here we could we

1269
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:38,160
could also see that some of these G je

1270
00:54:35,559 --> 00:54:40,680
were actually repeated between different

1271
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:44,640
Pathways so then in those cases we could

1272
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:47,799
generate the uh pyogenes for these t

1273
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:50,400
protein families and in here we included

1274
00:54:47,799 --> 00:54:53,720
protein sequences from different sources

1275
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:57,680
one was from our collection of uh of uh

1276
00:54:53,720 --> 00:55:00,880
specialized uh primary metab clusters

1277
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:02,920
then we also uh included the the protein

1278
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:06,359
sequences from the experimentally

1279
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:09,440
characterized uh proteins that were uh

1280
00:55:06,359 --> 00:55:13,160
in unipr and then we also included a

1281
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:14,119
representative um protein from from the

1282
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:17,119
Pam

1283
00:55:14,119 --> 00:55:19,640
database and from here we could identify

1284
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:23,160
the the specific clades that we were

1285
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:27,920
interested on and this help us to build

1286
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:31,599
a specific phmm so we customize the phmm

1287
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:34,520
to be able to Target um the the enzymes

1288
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:37,119
that we were interested on and discern

1289
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:40,920
between these ones and for example the

1290
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:44,240
housekeeping uh related sces that could

1291
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:46,960
uh be involved in these protein

1292
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:50,960
families and then from here once we had

1293
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:52,599
the phmm build we had a preliminary set

1294
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:56,400
of detection rules

1295
00:55:52,599 --> 00:56:00,319
created these detection rules were then

1296
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:04,799
tested on a on a collection of uh

1297
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:07,960
taxonomically diverse uh

1298
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:10,960
genomes and then Marx as as was

1299
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:13,480
mentioning before we have this uh with

1300
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:16,839
with this tool in in the group called

1301
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:20,520
Big scape that allow us to group each of

1302
00:56:16,839 --> 00:56:23,559
the predicted gen clusters that were um

1303
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:25,839
predicted by the by the same rule we uh

1304
00:56:23,559 --> 00:56:27,920
classified them and then we run big

1305
00:56:25,839 --> 00:56:31,839
Scape on each of these subgroups and

1306
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:34,119
this help us to um classify the or group

1307
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:37,280
together the gene clusters into Gene

1308
00:56:34,119 --> 00:56:40,760
cluster families and we manually analyze

1309
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:43,640
the the output of of the the big scape

1310
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:45,880
to be able to find uh the taxonomic

1311
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:48,760
diversity of the predicted gen clusters

1312
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:54,359
and also if there was any outlier that

1313
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:57,240
we can uh see uh in the in the from the

1314
00:56:54,359 --> 00:57:00,920
from the output Network for example

1315
00:56:57,240 --> 00:57:02,880
and we also um and and from these

1316
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:05,200
results we were also able to check for

1317
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:08,000
example in niture if we if what we were

1318
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:11,559
predicting was actually known or not

1319
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:15,039
known and from here we did a couple of

1320
00:57:11,559 --> 00:57:18,599
uh well this allowed us to uh actually

1321
00:57:15,039 --> 00:57:21,680
refine the detection rules and we did a

1322
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:24,599
couple of back and forth rounds of

1323
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:27,400
validation and refinement and then we

1324
00:57:24,599 --> 00:57:30,559
had the final version of gats

1325
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:33,760
which included uh different different

1326
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:36,280
types of rules uh such as the specific

1327
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:38,680
to known pathway uh pathway rules and

1328
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:42,799
the general rules

1329
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:45,920
also so the general gut smash workflow

1330
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:49,559
then would be to start from a bacterial

1331
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:52,680
genome then uh we use the bacterial

1332
00:57:49,559 --> 00:57:57,720
genome either in J back format or fasta

1333
00:57:52,680 --> 00:58:00,720
format as input then that smash uh

1334
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:03,920
identifies the Gin cluster by iterating

1335
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:06,200
over the detection rules then this gin

1336
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:10,960
cluster is

1337
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:13,240
um is um um well compared to a database

1338
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:15,760
of other thing clusters that we have and

1339
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:19,520
I will talk a little bit more in detail

1340
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:20,400
later and then we annotate the the the

1341
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:23,640
te

1342
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:26,559
cluster like the genes into different uh

1343
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:29,640
functional Gene categories and finally

1344
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:32,720
we we build the interactive

1345
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:33,760
output that one can see in the in the in

1346
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:36,400
the

1347
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:38,559
results so to be able to do this

1348
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:41,160
comparative genomic analysis we also

1349
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:44,760
constructed to different databases and

1350
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:47,319
these databases uh are known as known

1351
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:50,000
cluster plus which contains

1352
00:58:47,319 --> 00:58:53,200
experimentally characterized set of chin

1353
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:55,240
clusters and in here we have the for

1354
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:58,839
example this is the output of noncluster

1355
00:58:55,240 --> 00:59:01,760
Plus um here is the the quer sequence

1356
00:58:58,839 --> 00:59:05,000
and you can see uh for example in here

1357
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:07,680
um to which Pathways of this database

1358
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:09,960
the the query sequence looks more like

1359
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:12,000
and you can actually see also in

1360
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:15,640
particular which gen are the are the

1361
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:18,400
ones that seem to find more um that seem

1362
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:21,440
to find more similarity or

1363
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:25,079
not and then we also have the cluster

1364
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:27,640
blast uh tool for database that uh

1365
00:59:25,079 --> 00:59:29,720
predicts in cluster that has been it's a

1366
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:31,760
collection of uh gin clusters that have

1367
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:34,680
been predicted from our reference

1368
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:38,240
collection using gut smash so in this

1369
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:41,520
way what we can do is to compare

1370
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:46,039
um compare the query sequence to a lot

1371
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:48,039
larger um database of P clusters and in

1372
00:59:46,039 --> 00:59:49,920
this way we can we are able to see a

1373
00:59:48,039 --> 00:59:52,640
little bit the taxonomic distribution of

1374
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:56,680
this T cluster and see for example if

1375
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:59,599
this uh T cluster is uh preserved or not

1376
00:59:56,680 --> 01:00:01,799
uh in or it's only found in the same

1377
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:04,079
gener for example or it's a little bit

1378
01:00:01,799 --> 01:00:04,079
more

1379
01:00:05,799 --> 01:00:11,240
widespread okay so once we had the tool

1380
01:00:08,599 --> 01:00:12,880
we decided to test it out in a in

1381
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:17,280
a in

1382
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:20,799
a data set that contain uh microbial

1383
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:23,160
genomes from healthy donors and that

1384
01:00:20,799 --> 01:00:25,480
help us to h Profile the metabolic

1385
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:29,599
potential of the human microbiota and

1386
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:33,319
for that used more than 4,000 genomes um

1387
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:37,200
more than 200 uh 300 genomes came from

1388
01:00:33,319 --> 01:00:39,559
the h&p data set then we took also the

1389
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:41,119
CGR collection genomes that were

1390
01:00:39,559 --> 01:00:44,960
isolated from

1391
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:50,680
sto and then we also included an extra

1392
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:54,119
set of CIA genomes to account for their

1393
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:56,200
variability and all of these uh all of

1394
01:00:54,119 --> 01:00:59,520
these genomes composed that

1395
01:00:56,200 --> 01:01:02,079
taxonomically diverse collection of

1396
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:05,920
xomes and these were used as input for G

1397
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:08,680
Smash and from here we could we were

1398
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:12,440
able to pull actually uh the known gen

1399
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:16,119
clusters from the put putative gen

1400
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:18,440
cluster thanks to this uh datab basis of

1401
01:01:16,119 --> 01:01:20,880
uh of noncluster blast and and this

1402
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:25,000
comparative genomic

1403
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:27,160
analysis and here are the results um so

1404
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:30,520
for ex um here in

1405
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:34,200
the sorry I lost my pointer so here are

1406
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:36,200
the different um Pathways that we have

1407
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:39,000
and here are the different bacteria the

1408
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:42,240
main bacteria that we could find in the

1409
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:44,520
in this uh reference collection here is

1410
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:47,480
the total number of Pathways and each of

1411
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:49,400
the do represents the the percentage of

1412
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:53,440
the bacteria that actually encode for

1413
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:57,200
this specific pathway so if we find a

1414
01:01:53,440 --> 01:02:00,279
large um dot it means that more than 50%

1415
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:03,480
of the bacteria from this uh gener

1416
01:02:00,279 --> 01:02:06,599
actually encodes for the pathway and if

1417
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:09,119
the thought is small it means that less

1418
01:02:06,599 --> 01:02:11,920
than 50% of the bacteria and this was

1419
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:14,920
just a simplify and actually and the

1420
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:17,599
colors represent the different types of

1421
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:19,039
Pathways that we have based on the uh

1422
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:22,319
output

1423
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:24,520
metabolite and for example what we can

1424
01:02:22,319 --> 01:02:27,960
see in here is that clust

1425
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:29,920
rium and that

1426
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:34,680
is

1427
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:38,880
here here sorry uh so clust rium is the

1428
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:41,359
genus that actually displays uh a more

1429
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:44,480
metabolically metabolically diverse

1430
01:02:41,359 --> 01:02:46,240
genome hi en codes for 43 different

1431
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:51,720
Pathways

1432
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:54,839
and and then it's followed by uh the

1433
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:59,240
enterobacteria members which include the

1434
01:02:54,839 --> 01:03:02,039
entac and salmonella uh Genesis and

1435
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:04,920
actually it's interesting because um we

1436
01:03:02,039 --> 01:03:09,520
also can see that despite these are the

1437
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:12,799
two geneses that display uh a remarkable

1438
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:15,359
metabolic diversity and there are still

1439
01:03:12,799 --> 01:03:17,880
many of the pathways where they do not

1440
01:03:15,359 --> 01:03:21,960
overlap so that means that they have

1441
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:24,839
actually different strategies also to to

1442
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:26,760
yeah to to cope and to grow in the in

1443
01:03:24,839 --> 01:03:30,240
the in the human

1444
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:32,799
gut and and this is actually important

1445
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:34,799
because depending on the resources that

1446
01:03:32,799 --> 01:03:37,559
they have in the in in the gut they can

1447
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:40,079
actually proliferate more or less and

1448
01:03:37,559 --> 01:03:43,720
this shape the composition and the and

1449
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:47,079
the and yeah of the of the human gut

1450
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:50,160
micro can I ask a question to that um so

1451
01:03:47,079 --> 01:03:51,680
for the metabolomic pathways that you

1452
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:54,160
were learning on right that where your

1453
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:56,720
ground truth from known Pathways or

1454
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:58,920
known databases the have you seen there

1455
01:03:56,720 --> 01:04:01,160
also a taxonomic bias towards some

1456
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:03,400
enterobacter AC that have been better

1457
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:05,240
studied in the lab and which could also

1458
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:07,880
explain why you see a high number of

1459
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:09,960
pathway matches for them or Clum may be

1460
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:11,440
studied well in the lab so that so would

1461
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:13,319
you basically say that for the other

1462
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:15,480
bacteria there are potentially other

1463
01:04:13,319 --> 01:04:17,599
metabolic pathways or they can also have

1464
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:19,559
a high number but we are not covering

1465
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:21,880
them yeah of course that plays a role

1466
01:04:19,559 --> 01:04:24,400
also on the on the identification I

1467
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:26,559
think that the the rules of how they are

1468
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:28,279
being designed they allow some

1469
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:32,520
flexibility but of course if that

1470
01:04:28,279 --> 01:04:34,440
differs a lot from from what we know

1471
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:36,160
then it's not that we are not going to

1472
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:39,440
predict them but probably this is going

1473
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:41,240
to be not classified as known because

1474
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:43,359
based on this comparative genomic

1475
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:46,279
analysis we of course have to set

1476
01:04:43,359 --> 01:04:49,079
thresholds on okay if this is my

1477
01:04:46,279 --> 01:04:52,680
reference genome we want this to look

1478
01:04:49,079 --> 01:04:54,960
more or less similar so yeah definitely

1479
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:57,240
but still like doing in this way we

1480
01:04:54,960 --> 01:05:00,079
could still see that for example some of

1481
01:04:57,240 --> 01:05:02,880
the pathways that were

1482
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:05,720
originally um studied from an organism

1483
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:05,720
could be found in

1484
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:13,000
another and then also here I have a

1485
01:05:09,559 --> 01:05:16,240
similar plot but in here um instead of

1486
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:20,480
um the Genesis I have the specific uh

1487
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:23,160
species and and in here instead of uh

1488
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:26,799
combining the the dots

1489
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:29,799
into more than 50% of the of the

1490
01:05:26,799 --> 01:05:32,640
isolates having the pathway or not these

1491
01:05:29,799 --> 01:05:35,240
are actually row counts and what we can

1492
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:39,520
see in in this plot also is that we

1493
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:43,279
could find strain specific um patterns

1494
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:45,440
of uh of uh of primary metabolism

1495
01:05:43,279 --> 01:05:51,160
meaning that some of the for example in

1496
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:55,039
here that it's in cluster um alanes I

1497
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:58,359
think um for for some of the pathways

1498
01:05:55,039 --> 01:06:00,559
that gets my was uh predicting not all

1499
01:05:58,359 --> 01:06:03,480
the isolates actually encode for this

1500
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:05,920
pathway as you can see in here some of

1501
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:08,200
the dots are very small implying that

1502
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:10,279
not all the isolates were having this

1503
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:14,559
pathway and this is actually very

1504
01:06:10,279 --> 01:06:16,640
interesting as well because then it also

1505
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:19,880
remarks and highlights the the

1506
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:22,880
importance of not just considering

1507
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:27,200
genosis but also like Str specific

1508
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:27,200
traits that that are important

1509
01:06:28,319 --> 01:06:31,319
and

1510
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:39,400
yes so for the for this plot uh uh map

1511
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:41,319
and then the the the previous one uh how

1512
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:44,599
much different would it look if you did

1513
01:06:41,319 --> 01:06:46,760
a instead of the the I guess phenetic

1514
01:06:44,599 --> 01:06:48,400
tree here if you just did like a little

1515
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:51,480
cluster mapping right if you did like a

1516
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:53,039
little hierarchical clustering uhuh um

1517
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:56,920
because I'm wondering like how much of

1518
01:06:53,039 --> 01:07:00,279
this is you know different

1519
01:06:56,920 --> 01:07:03,200
you knowa or

1520
01:07:00,279 --> 01:07:05,400
whatever yeah like are you are do you

1521
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:08,000
have like this specialization occurring

1522
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:11,799
at like you know the level of you know

1523
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:13,319
genetic similarity or is it sort of like

1524
01:07:11,799 --> 01:07:16,039
you know you have different branches and

1525
01:07:13,319 --> 01:07:17,839
then you know further up and then based

1526
01:07:16,039 --> 01:07:20,079
on wherever they happen to end up being

1527
01:07:17,839 --> 01:07:23,720
they specialize into whatever

1528
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:25,319
KN I think that's very I didn't try this

1529
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:26,760
I think that maybe it would look a

1530
01:07:25,319 --> 01:07:28,520
little little bit different but also

1531
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:31,240
based on these analysis we could see

1532
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:32,160
that for example there were some like

1533
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:34,720
that

1534
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:37,359
actually each of the clades or or

1535
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:40,400
Genesis have very specific uh functions

1536
01:07:37,359 --> 01:07:42,640
in the gut so it it's restricted also by

1537
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:45,880
by by Genesis that doesn't imply that

1538
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:48,000
then within cuses or or strains we don't

1539
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:49,680
have differences also but I think that

1540
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:53,240
the major differences are between

1541
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:57,440
taxonomical groups in the higher part of

1542
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:57,440
the phogy so

1543
01:07:57,599 --> 01:08:04,079
yeah okay and then we also decided to

1544
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:07,640
analyze a little bit the the the

1545
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:10,520
predicted um gen clusters that that were

1546
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:13,799
generated with well that were

1547
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:17,839
differentiated from the known Z clusters

1548
01:08:13,799 --> 01:08:22,359
and here um this is a network actually

1549
01:08:17,839 --> 01:08:24,159
that contains um 12 uh th000 different

1550
01:08:22,359 --> 01:08:26,520
putative thing clusters that's because

1551
01:08:24,159 --> 01:08:29,000
we don't know the the

1552
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:31,600
the the function Associated to them they

1553
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:35,560
have been classified according the key

1554
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:37,279
Gene that they encode for and in this

1555
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:40,520
network what we can see is that there

1556
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:43,040
are actually truly novel thing clusters

1557
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:45,560
but there is Al we could also see that

1558
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:48,279
for example there were s clusters that

1559
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:49,719
were not covered by any specific rule

1560
01:08:48,279 --> 01:08:52,520
but the that they have been

1561
01:08:49,719 --> 01:08:56,719
characterized before so it was not in

1562
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:58,880
our initial uh set of uh Pathways so

1563
01:08:56,719 --> 01:09:02,319
then yeah we couldn't we couldn't

1564
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:05,199
predict that as a as a specific pathway

1565
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:08,880
but it's good to see that still with our

1566
01:09:05,199 --> 01:09:12,319
um general rules we are able to um

1567
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:13,880
predict this uh interesting CH clusters

1568
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:18,000
and then of course there there are the

1569
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:21,199
distantes of the nonn nonn Clusters that

1570
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:23,319
this was uh Mar's question that uh yeah

1571
01:09:21,199 --> 01:09:25,480
of course like if if there are some of

1572
01:09:23,319 --> 01:09:28,159
the T clusters that look very different

1573
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:30,880
to our uh reference they were not

1574
01:09:28,159 --> 01:09:34,159
annotated as known but they were

1575
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:34,159
annotated as

1576
01:09:35,199 --> 01:09:41,000
bu and

1577
01:09:37,239 --> 01:09:43,679
then we also did a more specific uh

1578
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:45,880
analyses on some of these uh putative

1579
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:48,960
train clusters and in here I'm

1580
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:52,719
highlighting four uh four of them so in

1581
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:56,040
here on the um right hand side you have

1582
01:09:52,719 --> 01:10:00,280
the network where the pathway has has

1583
01:09:56,040 --> 01:10:02,920
been has been extracted from and H for

1584
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:05,640
example this this specific one in here

1585
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:09,120
that it's from OC cluster citroni this

1586
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:12,360
one encodes for a for a flavor enzyme

1587
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:14,440
and the actual neighborhood where you

1588
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:16,360
can find this flavor enzyme seems to be

1589
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:19,960
very interesting because it's associated

1590
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:22,280
with an binding protein and also and a

1591
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:24,960
silco dehydrase

1592
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:26,960
and yeah we wanted to highlight this

1593
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:29,360
kind of Pathways because we think are

1594
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:32,560
interesting and that uh these are

1595
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:36,280
actually Pathways that might uh be

1596
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:40,080
characterized further and might um help

1597
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:42,760
to uncover novel novel Pathways and yeah

1598
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:46,679
other examples are for example this

1599
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:51,960
Doria one which actually uh which

1600
01:10:46,679 --> 01:10:55,320
actually encodes for a uh uh pH fer

1601
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:59,800
Toxin and it's and it's actually also

1602
01:10:55,320 --> 01:11:01,600
close by um yeah theam par phosphate

1603
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:04,480
enzyme which is also very interesting

1604
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:07,360
for example and but this is just to

1605
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:09,920
point out some of the some of the some

1606
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:13,239
of the pathways that we could find

1607
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:16,640
interesting so in summary from this part

1608
01:11:13,239 --> 01:11:19,440
um I hope that I can I showed you that

1609
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:22,360
the gut smash can help profile you uh

1610
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:24,360
the human microbiome and can help

1611
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:25,760
understand who is doing what in this

1612
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:28,000
environment

1613
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:30,679
um also that the bacteria are very some

1614
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:33,560
of the bacteria are very versatile and

1615
01:11:30,679 --> 01:11:35,239
we can see strainer specific patterns

1616
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:37,280
and also that the general detection

1617
01:11:35,239 --> 01:11:39,880
rules are are very useful to predict

1618
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:43,000
Noel in clusters in bacterial

1619
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:44,639
genomes and can represent interesting

1620
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:47,400
candidates to study

1621
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:50,600
further I also wanted to mention that we

1622
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:53,960
build the B smash web server to be able

1623
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:56,000
to just online analyze your genomes

1624
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:59,600
without the need of having to install

1625
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:03,120
and all the all the dependencies and and

1626
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:05,040
and and the databases and everything and

1627
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:09,320
it's hosted in the gats smash. by

1628
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:13,360
informatic NL um web page and there's

1629
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:15,600
also a bunch of information in in these

1630
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:18,800
tabs in here if you click the well you

1631
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:22,239
will find information how to download

1632
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:22,239
interpret the results and

1633
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:27,800
everything so now that we know who is

1634
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:31,400
doing what in the human microme we were

1635
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:33,679
also interested on who was actually um

1636
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:36,840
contributing to this a specific

1637
01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:39,840
phenotypes so and for that we need to

1638
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:42,280
know how abundant are these Pathways in

1639
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:45,520
the in the communities and if these

1640
01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:48,400
pathways are actually differentially um

1641
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:50,560
abandoned across the across the samples

1642
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:53,560
because as I was mentioning at early at

1643
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:56,199
the beginning also like the metabolites

1644
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:58,440
have a specific concentration to be able

1645
01:12:56,199 --> 01:13:00,560
to trigger this phenotypes so this

1646
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:04,760
information is

1647
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:07,199
important um and yes so if we are able

1648
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:09,040
to know if these te clusters are

1649
01:13:07,199 --> 01:13:13,040
differentially expressed or not we will

1650
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:14,639
be in a better position to actually um

1651
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:17,000
understand the role of these

1652
01:13:14,639 --> 01:13:18,920
metabolites and I want to highlight that

1653
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:22,000
this is actually the tool that I'm about

1654
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:24,040
to explain that is called big map it's

1655
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:27,560
not only used for the cut microbiome but

1656
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:27,560
also for other typ of

1657
01:13:27,719 --> 01:13:33,080
microbiomes so big map is a tool to

1658
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:35,679
assess gen cluster differential

1659
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:39,080
abundance and expression across samples

1660
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:42,639
and we do that by using um the predicted

1661
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:46,440
gen clusters by cutm or any other smash

1662
01:13:42,639 --> 01:13:48,840
um uh tools and we use this in

1663
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:50,360
combination with metag genomic and meta

1664
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:52,280
transcrip toic

1665
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:55,440
data

1666
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:57,880
and this this work by the way was done

1667
01:13:55,440 --> 01:14:01,239
with uh together with Hannah and Kun

1668
01:13:57,880 --> 01:14:03,960
that at the time were Master students

1669
01:14:01,239 --> 01:14:06,239
and big big ma consist of four different

1670
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:09,199
modules the first one is called the

1671
01:14:06,239 --> 01:14:12,080
family module and performs a redundancy

1672
01:14:09,199 --> 01:14:14,520
filtering on a given given set of gin

1673
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:17,560
clusters so we start from a gin cluster

1674
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:20,639
collection and then we run um a

1675
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:23,239
redundancy filtering using mash and then

1676
01:14:20,639 --> 01:14:26,400
we uh we to take a

1677
01:14:23,239 --> 01:14:29,120
representative uh using meal calculation

1678
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:31,400
and then we cluster the metal the

1679
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:34,400
representative thing cluster with big

1680
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:35,440
scape again to be able to get the Gin

1681
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:39,840
cluster

1682
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:42,639
fam also for the in case we are using

1683
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:45,639
metatranscriptomic data we also atmm

1684
01:14:42,639 --> 01:14:47,800
searched the Pam database for five

1685
01:14:45,639 --> 01:14:51,480
different housekeeping scenes to be able

1686
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:53,760
to have a baseline of expression levels

1687
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:56,920
of these uh of the things that we will

1688
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:58,639
later compare to our

1689
01:14:56,920 --> 01:15:02,320
expression

1690
01:14:58,639 --> 01:15:04,600
levels then we have the download module

1691
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:09,440
uh that downloads the fast files

1692
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:11,600
Associated uh to an Sr ID this uh step

1693
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:14,480
is optional of course if the user

1694
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:16,920
already have the meta genomic data or

1695
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:19,840
metat transcriptomic data the that can

1696
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:23,120
be skipped and then we map the reads

1697
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:27,280
onto the representative T cluster using

1698
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:29,320
Bai and yeah basically what we do is to

1699
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:31,440
uh either align the metag the

1700
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:34,320
metagenomic RS or metat transcriptomic

1701
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:37,480
RS into the representative think

1702
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:39,239
clusters to be able to have

1703
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:43,960
um an

1704
01:15:39,239 --> 01:15:47,480
alignment and from here we uh normalize

1705
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:51,199
and further process the the map reads to

1706
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:53,960
be able to visualize the the

1707
01:15:51,199 --> 01:15:56,120
output and this is actually how the how

1708
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:58,639
the output looks like

1709
01:15:56,120 --> 01:16:00,960
um this is for example this is an

1710
01:15:58,639 --> 01:16:04,560
example when taking different

1711
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:07,600
metagenomic um data from a data set that

1712
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:12,199
contain um Chone disease samples and

1713
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:13,920
unhealthy samples in here in the here in

1714
01:16:12,199 --> 01:16:15,679
the in the right you have the

1715
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:18,679
significant genin clusters that were

1716
01:16:15,679 --> 01:16:20,440
found with bigmat in the top bar you

1717
01:16:18,679 --> 01:16:24,159
have the comparing groups so in this

1718
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:28,159
case green is for um Chown disease and

1719
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:32,120
yellow for healthy uh samples and here

1720
01:16:28,159 --> 01:16:35,400
we have a bars just indicating the lock

1721
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:36,960
F chains that uh were found between the

1722
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:39,840
the two comparing

1723
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:42,840
RPS and then here we have the coverage

1724
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:45,840
values of the of the chin cluster so the

1725
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:48,400
higher is the number the better uh

1726
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:52,120
covered the chin cluster is VI

1727
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:54,280
rates and sorry can I ask again um so do

1728
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:56,199
I also get the information by using that

1729
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:58,480
tool for examp which part of the

1730
01:16:56,199 --> 01:17:00,159
biosynthetic gene cluster has which

1731
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:02,520
coverage so for example is the

1732
01:17:00,159 --> 01:17:06,120
transporter up regulated but the

1733
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:08,480
metabolomic metabolic component is not

1734
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:11,760
yes yeah but

1735
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:14,000
so that's not part of the output of of

1736
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:18,360
Big Mac per set but this is something

1737
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:20,400
you can process later with a with a with

1738
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:22,320
intermediate files that we generate and

1739
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:24,679
just visualize it with other tools this

1740
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:27,400
is actually something that I've done for

1741
01:17:24,679 --> 01:17:30,600
the gut smash paper and I think that I

1742
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:32,120
visualized that with the sushi art

1743
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:35,239
package I think it's

1744
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:38,639
called so yeah definitely then you can

1745
01:17:35,239 --> 01:17:40,280
easily see which are the the the parts

1746
01:17:38,639 --> 01:17:42,320
of the Gin cluster that actually have

1747
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:44,080
more Heats yeah and this is something

1748
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:45,440
that you have seen often so that for

1749
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:47,560
example also based on met

1750
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:50,159
transcriptomics data Transporters are

1751
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:52,400
regulated but the rest of the um

1752
01:17:50,159 --> 01:17:55,920
synthetic cluster is not we haven't

1753
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:55,920
looked at that

1754
01:17:56,360 --> 01:18:01,440
so as I was saying in this specific case

1755
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:03,520
we can see here that there are two

1756
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:05,880
specific chain cluster one that is known

1757
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:08,360
and one that is unknown that seem to

1758
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:11,679
have different

1759
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:15,080
um abundancies in terms of um

1760
01:18:11,679 --> 01:18:18,280
metagenomic RS aligning these gen

1761
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:20,840
clusters they are both so in here for

1762
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:23,480
example the more yellow the more

1763
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:25,360
abandoned the the pathway seem to be and

1764
01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:28,400
they seem to be more abandoned in the in

1765
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:32,760
the healthy samples than in the um cron

1766
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:34,920
disease ones and the coverage uh of the

1767
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:37,159
of the Gen cluster also seem to indicate

1768
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:39,400
that they are pretty well covered so

1769
01:18:37,159 --> 01:18:42,320
these are good candidates actually to

1770
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:44,199
maybe study further and I also wanted to

1771
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:47,880
mention that actually this is

1772
01:18:44,199 --> 01:18:50,280
a h this can also help us to prioritize

1773
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:52,320
which are the putative Jin clusters that

1774
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:55,480
we want to study further because we have

1775
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:57,320
here an extra layer of evidence saying

1776
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:59,440
that these Str clusters might be playing

1777
01:18:57,320 --> 01:19:02,159
a role in some of these phenotypes that

1778
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:06,000
we are interested

1779
01:19:02,159 --> 01:19:08,719
on and this is actually the the heat map

1780
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:11,800
that would output big map for metat

1781
01:19:08,719 --> 01:19:15,239
transcriptomic data so here we have used

1782
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:18,159
the same data set uh so in green the

1783
01:19:15,239 --> 01:19:20,760
here in green are the CR dis samples and

1784
01:19:18,159 --> 01:19:22,840
here the the healthy samples the only

1785
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:26,000
difference in here is that we have added

1786
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:29,040
this extra uh column in here which

1787
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:32,199
depicts the expression levels of these

1788
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:35,000
house five housekeeping genes and that

1789
01:19:32,199 --> 01:19:37,760
that is only to be able to compare our

1790
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:42,040
expression levels of our Pathways with

1791
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:45,040
this housekeeping je one for example and

1792
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:47,560
again in here we have a a gen cluster

1793
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:50,600
that is a putative one that seem to be

1794
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:52,800
that is significantly H associated with

1795
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:55,719
cron disease that seems to be more

1796
01:19:52,800 --> 01:20:00,840
abandon in Cron's disease it seems to be

1797
01:19:55,719 --> 01:20:03,040
related to fatty acids uh metabolism and

1798
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:06,480
yeah this is another good example of of

1799
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:10,960
a team cluster that can be H important

1800
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:14,719
for yeah for for this specific

1801
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:17,440
P well now that we know that we have the

1802
01:20:14,719 --> 01:20:20,000
means to to actually know how abundant

1803
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:22,159
are these te clusters we wanted to know

1804
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,920
how that would translate into the human

1805
01:20:22,159 --> 01:20:25,199
gut

1806
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:28,080
microbiome and for that what we did was

1807
01:20:25,199 --> 01:20:31,440
to predict the Gin clusters or use the

1808
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:34,080
predicted gin clusters from the from the

1809
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:36,560
collection of uh these three different

1810
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:40,520
reference collections in combination

1811
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:43,880
with the 100 one uh,

1812
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:46,840
1,100 35 metagenomes from healthy

1813
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:50,920
samples was this is the the data set

1814
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:53,320
from the lifelines deep cohort and this

1815
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:55,360
was actually the input for the big map

1816
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:57,480
um tool

1817
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:59,520
and in this way we could assess the

1818
01:20:57,480 --> 01:21:01,199
abundance and prevalence of the of the

1819
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:05,480
pathways that were predicted by gut

1820
01:21:01,199 --> 01:21:07,440
Smash and we also wanted to see if the T

1821
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:09,239
cluster abundance was able to correlate

1822
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:13,000
with the metabolite abundance so for

1823
01:21:09,239 --> 01:21:16,760
that we also used um big Maps results

1824
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:19,159
with in combination with the MS data of

1825
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:21,400
uh these same

1826
01:21:19,159 --> 01:21:25,360
participants these are the results of

1827
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:29,280
the pathway prevalence and so in here in

1828
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:31,960
the x-axis you have all the all the

1829
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:35,199
pathways and in here in the y axis all

1830
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:37,880
the the prevalence of the pathways again

1831
01:21:35,199 --> 01:21:42,360
classified into the different

1832
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:44,560
uh categories that we that we Define and

1833
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:48,000
in here it was nice to see that we were

1834
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:51,239
able to uh capture most uh most of the

1835
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:53,360
pathways that were known to be found in

1836
01:21:51,239 --> 01:21:55,199
healthy Vol in healthy samples we were

1837
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:58,120
able to see them in

1838
01:21:55,199 --> 01:21:59,920
almost hund in all of the in all of the

1839
01:21:58,120 --> 01:22:03,880
participants that was very interesting

1840
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:08,199
to see for example these are the this

1841
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:12,040
um cin uh fatty acids producing

1842
01:22:08,199 --> 01:22:14,440
Pathways uh all of them seem to be yeah

1843
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:17,120
prevalent in the in all of the in all of

1844
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:18,719
the in all of the samples and then it

1845
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:22,840
was also interesting to see that for

1846
01:22:18,719 --> 01:22:24,639
example the B operon that actually um

1847
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:27,600
transformed the Chic acid into the the

1848
01:22:24,639 --> 01:22:30,880
oxy colic acid it is known to be encoded

1849
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:34,159
in very low abandon bacteria in the gut

1850
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:36,040
that it's Clum syons and it was

1851
01:22:34,159 --> 01:22:38,080
interesting to see that also despite

1852
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:41,400
being very low abundant in the gut we

1853
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:43,880
were able to find it in most of the in

1854
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:47,480
most of the samples

1855
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:49,159
also and then of course it it was also

1856
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:52,040
interesting to see that for example for

1857
01:22:49,159 --> 01:22:55,360
other Pathways that are known to be uh

1858
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:56,719
detrimental for the human H health

1859
01:22:55,360 --> 01:23:00,239
uh such as

1860
01:22:56,719 --> 01:23:03,960
the H propal utilization that for

1861
01:23:00,239 --> 01:23:06,840
example is en goed in salmonella or um

1862
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:12,600
the picol synthesis pathway they were

1863
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:16,800
found in a h in a lot less number of

1864
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:20,120
samples and then when we looked at the

1865
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:22,600
at the abundance of this Pathways uh of

1866
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:24,159
these Pathways across this data set we

1867
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:26,560
could see that some of the pathways very

1868
01:23:24,159 --> 01:23:28,760
con consistently found across all the

1869
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:31,080
samples at high abundance this is

1870
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:35,440
actually the case of p42 this is the

1871
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:37,040
third pathway in here and and also this

1872
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:40,199
is a case of all the pathways that

1873
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:45,560
actually have a a

1874
01:23:40,199 --> 01:23:48,280
very small box uh box plot and with a

1875
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:50,080
very short whiskers also but then we

1876
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:52,920
could also find Pathways that differ a

1877
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:54,800
lot in abundance between individuals and

1878
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:58,679
that's for example the three into

1879
01:23:54,800 --> 01:24:02,880
propionate pathway um and this was

1880
01:23:58,679 --> 01:24:05,400
actually um making us question if the if

1881
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:07,400
the metagenomic abundance actually would

1882
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:09,480
correlate with the metabolite abundance

1883
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:11,360
because if we have such differences

1884
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:15,480
maybe we could see those differences

1885
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:18,360
also in the in the metabolite

1886
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:21,040
concentration and this is actually a

1887
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:26,080
work that was done together with liming

1888
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:29,600
Chen and in here on the on the top part

1889
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:33,480
of the plot you can see the correlations

1890
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:37,480
between metabolite aband abundance and

1891
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:42,119
and the pathway abundance and these

1892
01:24:37,480 --> 01:24:44,400
three lower ones are from FAL content

1893
01:24:42,119 --> 01:24:46,119
and the rest are from plasma content so

1894
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:48,679
we also wanted to see if that was

1895
01:24:46,119 --> 01:24:52,520
actually having an effect on the on the

1896
01:24:48,679 --> 01:24:55,119
correlations that we were doing and yeah

1897
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:57,840
basically we couldn't see

1898
01:24:55,119 --> 01:25:00,320
a correlation between um between the

1899
01:24:57,840 --> 01:25:02,159
metabolite abundance and the pathway

1900
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:05,400
abundance

1901
01:25:02,159 --> 01:25:07,600
and uh not in the plasma neither in the

1902
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:09,639
in the fal content despite in the fal

1903
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:12,639
content I think that if if you compare

1904
01:25:09,639 --> 01:25:15,600
because these are for the same

1905
01:25:12,639 --> 01:25:19,760
pathway it improves a little bit on the

1906
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:21,480
on the when using the fal uh Ms data and

1907
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:23,760
that might be because in there the

1908
01:25:21,480 --> 01:25:25,000
concentration of these metabolites it's

1909
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:27,080
higher

1910
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:29,400
and this lack of correlation might be

1911
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:33,280
due to different reasons and one of them

1912
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:35,920
can be due to dietary differences

1913
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:39,119
transcriptional regulation differences

1914
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:41,360
diffusion dynamics of the metabolites

1915
01:25:39,119 --> 01:25:44,199
secondary fermentors that maybe use some

1916
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:47,239
of the end products of some of the

1917
01:25:44,199 --> 01:25:51,239
pathways and are convered to other ones

1918
01:25:47,239 --> 01:25:53,480
so and from this we could also see that

1919
01:25:51,239 --> 01:25:54,800
uh the importance of using metat

1920
01:25:53,480 --> 01:25:57,880
transcriptomic

1921
01:25:54,800 --> 01:26:00,239
data so that's why we decided to analyze

1922
01:25:57,880 --> 01:26:02,679
another data set I ask a question

1923
01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:05,159
actually yeah um in the previous slide

1924
01:26:02,679 --> 01:26:07,679
is it that there's only one pathway

1925
01:26:05,159 --> 01:26:10,960
that's making the metabolite that you're

1926
01:26:07,679 --> 01:26:13,840
measuring in the plasma or the fecal

1927
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:16,199
sample or could there be multiple

1928
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:18,280
Pathways that make that that metabolite

1929
01:26:16,199 --> 01:26:20,760
and so even when one pathway is not

1930
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:23,719
abundant maybe the other pathway is and

1931
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:25,719
that's why you see the metabolite even

1932
01:26:23,719 --> 01:26:27,360
when the path way is slowly abundant and

1933
01:26:25,719 --> 01:26:29,560
therefore you just will never get a

1934
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:31,639
correlation no we actually did all the

1935
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:33,719
combination so we have indeed different

1936
01:26:31,639 --> 01:26:35,920
Pathways that for for example produce

1937
01:26:33,719 --> 01:26:38,239
acetic acid and we did all the

1938
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:40,880
combinations and we also pulled them all

1939
01:26:38,239 --> 01:26:46,040
together and then correlate the but the

1940
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:50,960
the results were the same still so

1941
01:26:46,040 --> 01:26:54,080
yeah and yeah by analyzing so we have uh

1942
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:58,960
we wanted to analyze and this ihmp data

1943
01:26:54,080 --> 01:27:03,080
set that actually contain uh paired um

1944
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:06,520
data so there was 81 samples that have

1945
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:10,199
uh metagenomic data metabolomic and

1946
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:14,080
metatranscriptomic data then there were

1947
01:27:10,199 --> 01:27:15,920
uh 271 metatranscriptomic data that were

1948
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:19,400
only Associated to

1949
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:23,119
metabolomic data and all of these

1950
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:26,280
samples actually also um come from

1951
01:27:23,119 --> 01:27:28,320
healthy ulcerative colitis and Chron

1952
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:31,000
dise sample so we had different

1953
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:32,639
phenotypes in here uh but the

1954
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:35,320
interesting part is that we were having

1955
01:27:32,639 --> 01:27:37,960
different types of pair data and and

1956
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:41,239
metat transcriptomic data

1957
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:44,440
also and this was the together with the

1958
01:27:41,239 --> 01:27:47,040
predicted gen clusters um uh predicted

1959
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:49,880
by gut smash we used this as input for

1960
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:52,040
big map and then with the PMS data we

1961
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:53,560
could we did the same analysis to be

1962
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:54,679
able to correlate the Gen cluster

1963
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:57,360
abundance

1964
01:27:54,679 --> 01:28:00,080
an expression with the

1965
01:27:57,360 --> 01:28:03,639
metabolite and this is uh these are the

1966
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:06,440
results so in here in this first uh

1967
01:28:03,639 --> 01:28:10,800
plotting here we have an overall

1968
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:15,119
correlation uh plot so here is for the

1969
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:17,560
um 81 um metag genomic samples the green

1970
01:28:15,119 --> 01:28:20,159
one is for the 81 metat transcriptomic

1971
01:28:17,560 --> 01:28:24,679
samples and the the yellow one is the

1972
01:28:20,159 --> 01:28:26,080
271 metat transcrip on examples and you

1973
01:28:24,679 --> 01:28:31,040
can see that

1974
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:34,719
correlations range between minus 0.3 to

1975
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:36,239
almost 0.4 so not very high correlation

1976
01:28:34,719 --> 01:28:39,600
still

1977
01:28:36,239 --> 01:28:41,600
and and we also highlight it in here in

1978
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:43,199
different colors I'm not sure if you're

1979
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:45,360
able to see the different dots in

1980
01:28:43,199 --> 01:28:47,199
different colors and these are actually

1981
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:51,400
the pathways that are represented here

1982
01:28:47,199 --> 01:28:54,080
just to highlight the Feld and and if we

1983
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:56,800
analyze this specific um curent

1984
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:58,840
corations in particular we because these

1985
01:28:56,800 --> 01:29:01,040
are actually one of the highest

1986
01:28:58,840 --> 01:29:04,920
correlations that we get we see that

1987
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:06,760
still um the MTC abundance and the

1988
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:09,800
expression do not correlate well with

1989
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:11,880
metabolite abundance still in general

1990
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:15,280
despite having

1991
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:19,800
maybe higher values for for The Meta

1992
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:21,880
transcrip value uh data sorry but

1993
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:23,600
actually when we splited the data set

1994
01:29:21,880 --> 01:29:25,000
into the three different phenotypes that

1995
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:28,239
we could find

1996
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:31,320
we got better results and actually the

1997
01:29:28,239 --> 01:29:32,880
correlations increased up to almost uh

1998
01:29:31,320 --> 01:29:37,400
0.60

1999
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:40,600
so um yeah it seems that uh the

2000
01:29:37,400 --> 01:29:42,960
phenotypes have actually they role in

2001
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:45,560
correlate on these analysis right so

2002
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:48,480
it's important to actually split uh the

2003
01:29:45,560 --> 01:29:51,000
analysis using these three different uh

2004
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:53,080
phenotypes and also that the expression

2005
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:55,840
of some of these path pathway seems to

2006
01:29:53,080 --> 01:29:58,040
be indeed predictive for some of the

2007
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:59,920
metabolite abundance but not all of them

2008
01:29:58,040 --> 01:30:04,000
since there's still a lot of them that

2009
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:06,560
are close to zero or or very

2010
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:10,400
low so what do we learn from this

2011
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:12,600
analysis um well metabolic inferences

2012
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:15,440
are difficult to make from metomic or

2013
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:17,119
meta transcriptomic data alone and this

2014
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:20,440
is important because there are tools

2015
01:30:17,119 --> 01:30:23,320
actually that make such inferences so we

2016
01:30:20,440 --> 01:30:26,880
all they might be very useful but we

2017
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:30,440
have to be cous also about um how we

2018
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:33,520
interpret these results and then they

2019
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:36,280
need to better understand the the the

2020
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:38,199
influence of diet genin regulation

2021
01:30:36,280 --> 01:30:42,800
secondary fermentors and everything to

2022
01:30:38,199 --> 01:30:45,800
be able to make such predictions more

2023
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:50,280
accurately and then finally uh to wrap

2024
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:52,880
up um I will uh I wanted to highlight a

2025
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:56,440
few take home messages one of them is

2026
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:58,480
that h g smash can get uh deeper

2027
01:30:56,440 --> 01:31:01,320
insights on who can do what and can be

2028
01:30:58,480 --> 01:31:03,320
useful to be to do this uh metabolic

2029
01:31:01,320 --> 01:31:06,080
profiling of the human gut bacteria but

2030
01:31:03,320 --> 01:31:10,920
we have also actually uh applied it to

2031
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:13,960
different um microbiomes such as uh ship

2032
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:17,040
ran for example oral microbiome so it's

2033
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:20,320
not just uh restricted to the cut

2034
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:24,119
microbiome human G microbiome then also

2035
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:27,040
that uh uh using metagenomic data put

2036
01:31:24,119 --> 01:31:31,400
for bigm can be very useful to

2037
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:32,719
understand how AB how pathways are are

2038
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:36,440
which pathways are actually more

2039
01:31:32,719 --> 01:31:39,119
abundant which are not and the role they

2040
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:43,480
play in the in the phenotypes

2041
01:31:39,119 --> 01:31:45,920
um I want uh metabolite outcomes are

2042
01:31:43,480 --> 01:31:49,000
difficult to predict from metagenomic

2043
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:51,159
data or metatranscriptomic data alone

2044
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:53,560
and then that I think that integrative

2045
01:31:51,159 --> 01:31:56,040
fic approaches are the way to get uh to

2046
01:31:53,560 --> 01:32:00,239
go to be able to understand complex

2047
01:31:56,040 --> 01:32:00,239
ecosystems and inir causation
