00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,400
hello computational music theorists our

2
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:19,920
topic for the coming week is going to be

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:24,840
on intervals and equivalents and working

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:29,359
with what equal and the same and so on

5
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:30,679
mean I am very much trying to treat

6
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,000
everybody

7
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:37,079
in this class and everybody I meet as

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,920
equals but that doesn't mean that I

9
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:42,840
think that everybody is the same in fact

10
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,079
that would that would be a very unequal

11
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:51,079
way to treat people so we can have this

12
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:55,120
notion that equality does not mean the

13
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:57,120
same thing and that equal does not mean

14
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,519
identical this is something I hope we

15
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,719
practice in our lives but it's also very

16
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:05,479
important in thinking about how we

17
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,680
compare musical

18
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:10,680
structures I'm asking you over the

19
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,960
weekend to read a very interesting

20
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:18,439
chapter from Dimitri tko's a geometry of

21
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:19,280
Music in which he talks about five kinds

22
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:21,680
of

23
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:26,000
equivalents a few more but mostly about

24
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:28,880
five kinds that he calls optic octave

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,880
permutation transposition inversion and

26
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,880
cardinality

27
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:39,360
these ways of thinking about equality of

28
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,840
notes or melodies or chords or other

29
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,920
musical structures even whole pieces is

30
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:48,479
going to be very important when we want

31
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:51,280
to find particular musical gestures or

32
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,719
we want to identify particular things

33
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,360
using a computer I'm sitting at the

34
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:57,920
piano because I'm going to demonstrate a

35
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,719
few of the things that we might think

36
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:04,039
mean that something is equal or

37
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,240
something is the same but maybe they're

38
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:09,160
not

39
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:11,840
identical but first I want to play

40
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:15,599
something that doesn't work very well on

41
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:20,400
the piano so listen to these two

42
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:25,080
pieces the way you wear your

43
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,080
hat the way you sip your

44
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:35,560
tea the memory of all that

45
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:39,319
no no they can't take that away from me

46
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,319
the way your smile just

47
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,680
be the way you sing off

48
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:57,159
King the way you wear your

49
00:02:52,280 --> 00:03:01,840
hand the way you sip your

50
00:02:57,159 --> 00:03:01,840
tea the memory of all

51
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:11,640
no no they can't take that away from me

52
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:17,120
the way your smile just

53
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:17,120
been the way you sing off

54
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:24,959
King I asked you to listen to two pieces

55
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:28,680
actually I just played excerpts but did

56
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:31,760
I play two pieces or did I play One

57
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,760
Piece twice

58
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:39,760
were those two pieces the same

59
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,760
piece were they the same

60
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:46,239
recording I think will think that well

61
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:49,560
they were

62
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,640
the same piece but different recordings

63
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,280
different performers different styles

64
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,840
different interpretations but there was

65
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,120
something the same about them so we can

66
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:01,560
think of an equivalence class or a kind

67
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:05,840
of equivalence between pieces that

68
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,840
doesn't necessarily mean that they are

69
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,480
identical now let's turn to some musical

70
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,239
structures that we can demonstrate at

71
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,920
the

72
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:18,440
piano so I want to talk concretely about

73
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,400
some ways that we might think about

74
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:22,280
equivalence and what do we mean by

75
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,840
equivalence when we're talking about

76
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:28,440
notes or chords or melodies or pieces

77
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,479
and I want to think about some of the

78
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,199
things that we might be doing

79
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:36,400
so for

80
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:38,639
instance can we think of a context

81
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:42,240
where

82
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:45,520
notes as a group are the

83
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:48,039
same regardless of the order that we

84
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,490
talked about them let's start with just

85
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:51,919
a C major chord c e

86
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:57,800
[Music]

87
00:04:51,919 --> 00:05:00,360
g and if I say C3 E3

88
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:04,720
G3 and that's the chord

89
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:07,960
or if I say that it's G3 E3

90
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:11,960
C3 it's still the same chord or if I

91
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:14,000
said that the chord is E3 C3 G3 it

92
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:16,720
really doesn't matter so this could be

93
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,400
when we're talking about chords a place

94
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:23,000
where there is a

95
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,520
permutation equivalence doesn't matter

96
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,759
what order they're in on the other hand

97
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,880
if we're talking about um a melody or

98
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:32,830
something some sort of piece that has

99
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,639
you know

100
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:39,039
[Music]

101
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:42,039
um then it matters if we

102
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,039
go

103
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:49,759
sorry those don't seem to be equivalent

104
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,039
in some context that we might think of

105
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,560
as

106
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:58,759
equivalents so there could be a context

107
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:01,560
where P permutation equivalence is

108
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:04,319
active and context where it isn't uh we

109
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:06,440
can also think of

110
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:10,240
cardinality especially on the piano it

111
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:16,319
doesn't matter if I play c e

112
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:18,520
g as a chord or if I play c c e

113
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,599
g you can't even tell maybe I can put

114
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:24,680
two fingers on the c or something like

115
00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:27,280
that but on in a cordal context on the

116
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:30,319
piano we would normally say well that

117
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,720
that cardinality doesn't really matter

118
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,919
in terms of the sound um if you're going

119
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:40,440
to be notating it then yeah it

120
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:40,440
matters we also can think of octave

121
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:48,440
equivalence that all those notes are C

122
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:50,919
when we say something like all of these

123
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:53,080
things are we're saying that they're

124
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:55,000
equivalent in some way so we're saying

125
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,919
that in this case when I say all these

126
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,520
notes are C we're talking about an opave

127
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,520
equivalence relationship

128
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,759
but I can't say that all of those notes

129
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,440
are

130
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,080
C3 only that note is

131
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:15,400
C3

132
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:17,240
C2 C4 if you were um you know uh in

133
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:20,360
instrumental teacher and you ask

134
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:22,680
somebody on uh on an instrument like you

135
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:26,599
know flute to the clarinet or the violin

136
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:30,060
to play a scale in three octaves and

137
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:34,039
they just play the same octave

138
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:37,120
[Music]

139
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:39,160
you'd really say no no NE I asked for

140
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,520
three octave so so we can think of a

141
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:43,080
world where there isn't an octave

142
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,140
equivalence and we can put these two

143
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:50,440
things together that we can think

144
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:54,440
[Music]

145
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:57,800
cegc we have a kind of world where we

146
00:07:54,440 --> 00:08:01,280
say well that's the same as c e g in the

147
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,360
sense of play the tonic Triad in C major

148
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,759
it doesn't matter if I

149
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:09,240
[Music]

150
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:11,120
play those all fulfill this particular

151
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,120
equivalence

152
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,120
class

153
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,879
and there are other ones um one of the

154
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:21,440
ones that

155
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:24,520
Tacho sort of assumes throughout is and

156
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:29,120
isn't even a part of his optic

157
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:30,000
Opti world is um spelling so it doesn't

158
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,599
matter

159
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
or C major is a little bit hard but it

160
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:40,000
doesn't matter if

161
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:42,200
I think of a single note play E

162
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,800
flat play D

163
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:48,160
sharp it's the same thing so we can

164
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:50,959
think of a spelling equence um now if

165
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,600
you were to be in theory one class and

166
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:55,240
you're asked to write a C Minor triad

167
00:08:53,600 --> 00:09:00,120
and you write

168
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:03,800
c d Shar G you probably going to get

169
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:07,680
marked wrong because that's a context

170
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:09,880
where there is not spelling

171
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:13,120
equivalence we can also think of a world

172
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:14,510
where there's a transposition equivalent

173
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:19,640
so for

174
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:21,940
[Music]

175
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:25,259
instance

176
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:25,259
[Music]

177
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:33,839
and we can say oh well those are both

178
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:37,680
the same piece those are both Mary had a

179
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:40,360
little l so that there's um a

180
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:43,279
transposition equivalence that makes

181
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:45,920
that piece still Mary had a little

182
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:48,279
L and we definitely use that when we're

183
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:51,839
talking about chord types so we talk

184
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:56,040
about that's a major Triad that's a

185
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:59,440
major Triad that's a major Triad um so

186
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:04,240
that we can have talk about a concept

187
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:07,079
like major Tria that takes into account

188
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:11,240
that there's um a transposition

189
00:10:07,079 --> 00:10:14,399
equivalence probably the one that uh

190
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:17,079
people like the least and and think that

191
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,399
it's not really a context that we want

192
00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:21,959
to be working with is the inversion

193
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:25,680
context and when we play something in a

194
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:29,600
tall context like a C major

195
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:33,440
Triad and then we invert it so let's see

196
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:37,120
from E to G is a minor thir so we'll go

197
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:40,920
from G B flat is a minor third and E to

198
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:46,079
C is a major third so B flat to D is a

199
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:49,200
is a major third so we can

200
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:51,079
say in an inversion and transposition

201
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,760
context that those well I guess those is

202
00:10:51,079 --> 00:10:56,040
not even a transposition context um that

203
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,800
those two are equivalent and not like go

204
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:02,000
whoa whoa you what are we talking about

205
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:04,040
but um there are some places in

206
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,240
post-tonal theory where that's important

207
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:08,440
but we can even think about it even in

208
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:12,160
the tonal or in this case a pre- tonal

209
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:15,120
context here I'm going to play four

210
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,430
pieces one goes well I'll do the one we

211
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,400
just

212
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:20,400
[Music]

213
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:33,600
played here's another piece

214
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:36,360
[Music]

215
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,360
and here's another

216
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:44,519
[Music]

217
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,040
piece play that one one more time so you

218
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:49,800
get in your

219
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:52,399
[Music]

220
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:54,190
ears and then we can have a piece like

221
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:57,869
this

222
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:57,869
[Music]

223
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:06,560
I played in some sense four different

224
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:09,079
melodies or something but maybe I only

225
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:12,120
played three different pieces because we

226
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:15,240
can recognize oh those last two are the

227
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:17,560
same piece but one is upside down from

228
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,839
the other this is actually a a piece

229
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:22,959
that was really famous in the 15th

230
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:25,240
century called lar or the armed man and

231
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:27,519
composers at that time like to play

232
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,760
around with it they transposed it they

233
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:33,600
did diatomic transposition so that you

234
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:36,920
play in um in well you know different

235
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,920
modes so instead

236
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,700
of may you play some maybe you play

237
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:44,320
something

238
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:47,360
[Music]

239
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,600
like and it's a slightly different piece

240
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,120
but still the same piece so you can

241
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,160
think of a dionic transposition

242
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:54,199
equivalence but they also definitely

243
00:12:52,160 --> 00:13:01,120
played with what I was showing the

244
00:12:54,199 --> 00:13:01,120
inversion equivalent context so that uh

245
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:10,279
at are in some ways the beginning of the

246
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,639
same

247
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:15,399
piece we're going to be asking you in

248
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:18,360
the problem set to see if you can come

249
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:20,839
up with other contexts where we talk

250
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:23,720
about well that's the same thing like is

251
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:23,720
this a C major

252
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:28,399
Triad good well this is a fancy piano so

253
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:32,240
I'm going to change the temperament to

254
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,240
mean tone and now we

255
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:40,000
go maybe over Zoom you can't hear the

256
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:43,519
difference as much but we can go to a

257
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,519
you slightly different one

258
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:48,680
even

259
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:54,800
[Music]

260
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:57,000
or and those are all the notes c e g

261
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,519
they're not exactly the same but we

262
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
think of them as the same so we can

263
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:03,759
think of a temperament context or a

264
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,199
tuning context where we allow things to

265
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:08,839
be equivalent so I think this is the

266
00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:12,120
background that you need in order to uh

267
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:14,800
go through uh the reading of Dimitri

268
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:17,279
tachko on Optics and

269
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:20,240
equivalence as usual you're going to be

270
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:22,600
implementing your code in Python using

271
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:26,240
musical objects either that you create

272
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:30,720
or that you have unlocked in music 21

273
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:34,480
and when you're doing this you think

274
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:37,639
about what two objects are what are two

275
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:40,279
notes that python defines as equal or

276
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:43,320
that I have defined in music 21 defines

277
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:46,160
as equal what do we mean by that and

278
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:48,720
you'll see that each object in the

279
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,639
computational language generally has

280
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,880
only one

281
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:57,079
builtin uh sort of equivalence set that

282
00:14:53,880 --> 00:15:00,440
defines what the equal equal operator or

283
00:14:57,079 --> 00:15:03,040
whatever it is um means and well there's

284
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,839
actually a second one that is operator

285
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,959
that defines something else what do we

286
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:10,279
mean by these two

287
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:13,160
objects are the same that they is the

288
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:17,240
same I is what I wanted to say but um

289
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:19,040
and what choice was made and how could

290
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:21,519
we have made a better choice and who's

291
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,240
going to hate me for the choice I made

292
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,560
and who would have hated me if I made

293
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:29,319
another choice on defining equality in a

294
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,519
note or in a chord

295
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:34,079
thanks for listening to this video and

296
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,800
now let's get started with reading what

297
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:38,800
Demitri chatko has to say on this

298
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,800
subject
