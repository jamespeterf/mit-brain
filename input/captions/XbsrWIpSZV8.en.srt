1
00:00:01,209 --> 00:00:02,502
So we're now at...

2
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:04,462
Just over 1,000 RPM

3
00:00:04,462 --> 00:00:06,965
2,400...

4
00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:08,800
...3,000. Yeah.

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,679
Could the amount of cavitation be affected
by our particular blade geometry?

6
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:13,555
Yeah!

7
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:17,017
I remember Zack
organizing this workshop out in California.

8
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:19,644
It was about reusable rocket engines.

9
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:22,689
And there was this huge outcry
from industry 

10
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:26,192
about students not having enough 
hands on experience.

11
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:28,945
Not just hands on, but not knowing 
how to make things.

12
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:30,989
So when they designed, keep that in mind.

13
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:32,157
“The impellers are supposed to go...”

14
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:36,494
Yeah, I think it's making things
but using modern manufacturing tools.

15
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:39,539
So things like 3D printing,
metal, 3D printing, plastic, 3D printing,

16
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:42,667
rapid prototyping for engineered devices.

17
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:44,085
“We can use Bernoulli's principle...”

18
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:48,673
We're spending this semester designing 
and then building this pump system.

19
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,217
The overall idea of turbo pumps

20
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,802
is that they're used a lot of similar machines.

21
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:56,139
So on a bigger scale you could think about
using them in a jet engine or a rocket.

22
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:57,599
It works! 

23
00:00:57,599 --> 00:01:00,602
And if you operate at maximum speed,
it doesn't leak!

24
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,228
It's nice to have a system
that you can take

25
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:05,106
responsibility of the whole thing,
and then figure out

26
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:09,110
all the little details that end up to what
puts, you know, people on the moon.

27
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:10,987
We started off

28
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:13,990
by designing basically some impellers.

29
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,201
Impellers that are 3D printed metal.

30
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,745
It’s starting to get too narrow...

31
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,372
We didn't specify the specific pumpdesigns,

32
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:24,250
the impeller shapes really anything.
We gave them tools.

33
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,462
They developed their own designs
and each team arrived at their own 

34
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:28,963
unique specialized design.

35
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:32,801
And many discovered
interesting design features

36
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:35,720
which are actually used in
real applications. 

37
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,263
The real high performance engines.

38
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:38,765
[LAUGHING]

39
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:39,390
That works?

40
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,100
Yeah! 

41
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,142
And your’re moving stuff! 

42
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:45,396
So far it has gone
remarkably smooth, in large part

43
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:48,399
because we have exceptional students
and then also exceptional TA’s.

44
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,027
Yeah, the TA’s play a huge role. 

45
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:52,153
“That should be dry.”

46
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:54,823
Because it's a new course.
We're running it for the first time.

47
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:57,700
We spent most of the summer
developing the lab activities

48
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,577
and the problem sets
that would go with it,

49
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:03,581
and then most of the fall course correcting
as fast as we could

50
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:05,500
and just reacting
to how the students were learning.

51
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,418
Yeah, we start every module

52
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:10,380
with familiarizing the students 
with the same concepts.

53
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,508
But after that they all branch off 
into their own designs basically.

54
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:17,887
This class is probably the most
multifaceted class I've ever taken.

55
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:23,726
I think it really captures the entire
process of an engineering cycle.

56
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:29,315
Some of the parts that they're using were
farmed out to manufacturing companies.

57
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:32,986
I mean, especially with 3D printing,
like essentially we have like 12 teams.

58
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:35,655
And so if we tried to print 
12 of these would have taken like months.

59
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:38,199
Different teams
use different manufacturing techniques

60
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,493
and different materials, different color,
different surface

61
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:43,496
finish, different mechanical properties
and maybe different performance.

62
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:44,914
And they're going to see.

63
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:50,170
I think initially we chose polycarbonate
because it was the cheapest option, but

64
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:53,381
it would have absorbed a lot of the water
that we were going to be using.

65
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:56,801
So we decided on nylon 12
because it was the second cheapest option.

66
00:02:56,926 --> 00:03:00,388
You know, they're using actually the auto
pricing tools to assess cost curves,

67
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:03,266
and they're actually seeing
how that directly relates

68
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:05,226
to fundamental things
that they learned in lecture and.

69
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:06,311
How to deal with vendors. Right?

70
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,897
If you don't communicate well,
you won't get what you asked for, right?

71
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:09,522
Yes!

72
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,941
Oh, the seal is leaking!

73
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,443
Oh, this is the problem.

74
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,485
No!

75
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:15,778
Drainage system? 

76
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:17,238
You guys have a drainage system?

77
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:20,241
[LAUGHING]

78
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:22,160
It works really well.

79
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:22,702
OK! 

80
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:23,912
All right, all right!

81
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,121
Well, anyway,
we got our data.

82
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:26,873
How much oil was that?

83
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,374
[LAUGHING]

84
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:32,086
Being able to use all of the design
principles and things we've learned

85
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:35,381
for the past four years
to be able to incorporate all of these

86
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:38,593
into one system that's integrated
has been really nice. 

87
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:42,138
When you're doing a problem set,
you're just working through numbers

88
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:44,807
and then you look back
and there's plenty of time to revise it.

89
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:47,727
But once you're doing these more 
hands on and practical applications, 

90
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,562
the decisions carry a lot more weight.

91
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:52,649
And so at some point,
we just had to decide that, you know,

92
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,567
this impeller design is,
what we want to go with.

93
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,277
And we're going to actually 
go get it printed.

94
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:59,113
Same thing for rotordynamics setup
as well as the casing.

95
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:03,660
So I think that process of learning
with your team when to kind of commit

96
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,121
to a decision and what variables you need
to know to feel confident in that.

97
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,457
I think that was pretty unique
from past classes. 

98
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:11,960
You really stepped up becoming engineers.

99
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:14,295
It's also a communications
intensive class.

100
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:18,049
So the main deliverables aren't exams
or anything like that,

101
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:20,510
but it's it's a presentation
and a report.

102
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,471
And so that kind of communication stuff,
we like having input

103
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:24,764
from the communications department.

104
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:28,184
To be able to use that process
of communicating to somebody else

105
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:31,562
to really enrich and deepen
your own understanding.

106
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:34,857
These students, they might develop
more efficient aero engines.

107
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:37,860
They might develop better,
more reliable rocket engines.

108
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,155
They may develop the next consumer
electronic device.

109
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,658
The skills that they're learning here
are transferable

110
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,702
to like any kind of physical system.

111
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,203
“...or the water pressure rise...”

112
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:48,830
These students are now going to go off

113
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,832
and they're going to have huge impact.

114
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,125
And I'm excited to see how they apply

115
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:55,878
what we teach them in the real world,
and what implications

116
00:04:55,878 --> 00:05:00,049
this has for our partners and industry
for the next generation of technologies.

117
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:03,344
These are the future leaders, and
it's our privilege to get to educate them.
