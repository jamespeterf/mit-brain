1
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,720
Okay. So last time we talked about at

2
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,720
towards the end we talked about

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,720
sequences

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,640
and so in particular we talked about

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:30,560
square root of two right. a square root

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,880
of two. We could think about this if we

7
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:37,200
wanted to think about square root two on

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:39,440
the real line. Then we have here one and

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,640
we have two.

10
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:46,559
And we could define a sequence of

11
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:50,559
numbers where the first one is one, the

12
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:55,280
second one is 1.4,

13
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:58,879
the third is 1.4.1 4.1

14
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:03,879
and the next one is then the next digit

15
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:03,879
in square<unk> of two. So 1.4.1.4

16
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:11,200
etc.

17
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:16,479
And so so this is like a sequence of

18
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:18,799
numbers that are increasing uh and it is

19
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:22,080
square root of two where you're taking

20
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:25,520
more and more digits. Right?

21
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:30,439
So square root of two

22
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,439
is in some sense the limit

23
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,479
of this sequence.

24
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,880
And so precisely a sequence uh is so we

25
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,600
talked about that last time but let me

26
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,600
just remind you what that is. So a

27
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,600
sequence

28
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,320
is uh is a function

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,520
from the natural numbers. So f goes from

30
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:12,400
the natural numbers into the real

31
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:14,959
and the value at some natural number n.

32
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:18,480
the value of this function at a natural

33
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:20,879
number and this we denote usually it's a

34
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,520
standard notation then one denote it

35
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:27,319
like this with where the n is a

36
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,319
subscript okay

37
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,599
uh and so let's uh let's take a look at

38
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,920
a couple of different uh sequences. So

39
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:40,560
we told that so this here really is a

40
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:46,640
sequence. Uh another example is

41
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:49,200
um where you have a n = minus1

42
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:52,239
to the power n.

43
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,480
So uh so n again is is this natural

44
00:02:52,239 --> 00:03:00,239
number. So this means that this sequence

45
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:08,280
a1 is equal to minus1 a2 is equal to -1

46
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:08,280
* -1. So that's one. A3 is -1 * -1

47
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:16,800
* -1.

48
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:19,680
So this is min -1 and a4 is -1

49
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:23,200
multiplied itself four times. So that's

50
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:27,080
one. Right? So this sequence here is

51
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,080
it's it's alternating

52
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:37,840
between the values

53
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:40,799
uh minus one and one.

54
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,799
So it's starting off at minus one and

55
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:46,799
then it goes to one and it goes to minus

56
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:51,760
one one minus one etc.

57
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:54,640
Okay. And so this sequence here right it

58
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:57,360
doesn't really right it's not you know

59
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,200
it doesn't really converge it it's not

60
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,120
it doesn't really have a limits right so

61
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,599
this here we'll make this precise in

62
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,920
just a minute so this sequence does not

63
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,920
have a limit

64
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:22,160
uh another an example of a sequence is

65
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:25,440
is a decaying sequence like this. So a n

66
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:30,000
is equal to 1 / n

67
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:34,960
right? So so a1 is equal to 1, a2 is

68
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:38,800
equal to a half, a3 is equal to a3 and

69
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:41,520
then a4 is equal to 1/4. Right? So these

70
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,160
numbers here are all positive. Right?

71
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,880
the the values of a is all all of them

72
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:50,080
are all positive and they become smaller

73
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:52,080
and smaller right

74
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,600
so you could write that sort of

75
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,440
suggestively this here is going down

76
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,800
like that

77
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:04,000
and so right so it seems sort of obvious

78
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,160
that this limit here

79
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,960
uh that this sequence has a limit this

80
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,960
here has a limit

81
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,280
and the limit is zero.

82
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:28,000
Okay. So now let me make the formal

83
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:31,280
definition. So so what does it mean that

84
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,639
a sequence is convergent?

85
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,639
So um a sequence

86
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:42,199
uh a n is convergent

87
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:52,639
to uh to to a. So a is another real

88
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:56,720
number

89
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:59,840
is a sequence a n is converging to a if

90
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:03,639
the following is the case.

91
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,639
If the following hold

92
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,960
uh for all epsilon

93
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:21,720
for all epsilon greater than zero

94
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,720
there exist

95
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,039
there exist an

96
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,199
anal

97
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:34,520
number

98
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,520
such that

99
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:42,720
if little n

100
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:46,800
is bigger than this natural number then

101
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:52,960
the difference between a n and the

102
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:56,400
supposed limit is bounded by epsilon.

103
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:58,960
Okay. So if you think about it, so if

104
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:02,080
you think about it on the here you have

105
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:06,960
on the real line here you have a

106
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:09,280
and so if you give me an epsilon

107
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:12,479
so then I'm looking at a here I'm

108
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:17,360
looking at an interval around a so this

109
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:20,560
is an interval here from a minus epsilon

110
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:23,280
to a plus epsilon

111
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:28,479
and the claim is that the sequence a n

112
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:32,240
is converging to a if there exists some

113
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:35,199
n. So that if n is little n is larger

114
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:39,360
than this capital n then all of these a

115
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:44,400
n lands somewhere here right all of them

116
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:48,720
a n is in this little integer for

117
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:50,800
n uh little n bigger than this capital n

118
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:54,000
right that's what it means to be

119
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:57,120
convergent right but it's like for all

120
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,280
epsilon so you you allowed to you know

121
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,599
someone else else is allowed to pick the

122
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,080
epsilon and then you have to prove that

123
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:08,080
there exist a capital n so that from

124
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:12,080
there on and out all of the a lie in

125
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:14,560
this little interval. Okay.

126
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:18,639
So this is what it means for a sequence

127
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:20,319
to be convergent. So we say that a n is

128
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:24,000
convergent

129
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:26,319
uh to a if this here is the case and in

130
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,800
that case

131
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,800
in that case

132
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:39,200
one also writes that uh that the limit

133
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:42,200
as n goes to infinity of a n is equal to

134
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,200
a

135
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:50,920
a sequence.

136
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,920
So if you have a sequence or a sequence

137
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,680
that is not convergent

138
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,000
uh is said to be divergent.

139
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:16,399
Okay.

140
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:19,200
And so now let me

141
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:23,200
look at an example.

142
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:28,600
Um, so suppose you're looking at

143
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,600
the number 0.9999

144
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:37,360
etc. Right? This number here, this is

145
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:40,640
really this number here, we really think

146
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:44,800
about this number here as one. This is

147
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:47,360
indistinguishable from one, right?

148
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:50,720
And in fact what you really think about

149
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,480
is that you think about that you have a

150
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:57,519
sequence

151
00:09:52,480 --> 00:10:02,600
uh a where a1 is 0.9

152
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:02,600
a2 is 0.999

153
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,320
a3 is 0.999

154
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:14,480
A4 is equal to 0.999

155
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:18,079
9 9

156
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:22,240
etc. Right? So a n

157
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:25,279
is where you have zero point

158
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:28,600
and then nine

159
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,600
n times

160
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:37,120
right? If you're looking at that

161
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:41,120
sequence here, right?

162
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,640
Then you have that this sequence a n is

163
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,839
convergent

164
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:48,800
to one. So a n

165
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:55,320
this one also write that is convergent

166
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:55,320
to one like this. So a n is convergent

167
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,839
to one. Right? So there's various ways

168
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:04,800
of writing that is convergent. You can

169
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:07,680
write it like this. This means that it's

170
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:10,240
convergent and the limit is a. You can

171
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,480
write it like this. This means that the

172
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,800
sequence is convergent and the limit is

173
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,800
one. Right? Or you can write it out in

174
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,800
words.

175
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:25,120
Okay. Um so so this sequence I claim

176
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,519
that this sequence here defined like

177
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,760
this and this is really how you think

178
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,519
about this right when you think about

179
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,959
this number you sort of think about it

180
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:38,160
that's you know this is you know 0 9

181
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:41,440
with more and more uh numbers nines

182
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:44,720
added and the limit which is really what

183
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:47,440
this number here in itself is is one.

184
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:51,200
Okay. Now let me explain why the

185
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:56,600
sequence defined this way why this is

186
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,600
convergent as a limit one. Okay.

187
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:06,160
And so so now

188
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:10,800
so now of course now

189
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:13,680
you give me an epsilon. So given epsilon

190
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:17,440
given epsilon greater than zero

191
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:21,360
then I need to find a capital n so that

192
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:25,880
from there on and out the a is within

193
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,880
epsilon. So we need to find

194
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:33,440
to for this epsilon we need to find

195
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:38,720
capital n so that if little n is bigger

196
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:40,880
than this capital n then a n minus one

197
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:44,160
is less than epsilon right that's what

198
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:49,959
we need to do right

199
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:49,959
but for your epsilon so to do that

200
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:57,519
we need to choose this capital n.

201
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,320
So I'm just choosing

202
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:03,639
uh I just choose capital n. So to do

203
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,639
that choose

204
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,720
capital n such that

205
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:20,480
uh that 1 / n is less than epsilon.

206
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:25,040
Right? We can do this by the archimedian

207
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:28,040
property. Right. So this is uh so we can

208
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,040
find

209
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:35,560
n by the

210
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,560
uh such an n

211
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,680
and capital n by the archimedian

212
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:45,880
property

213
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,880
that we discussed last time.

214
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:57,120
Okay.

215
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:59,519
But now you see if you're looking at

216
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,920
if you take

217
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,920
if you now

218
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:13,279
if you now look at little n that is

219
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:18,000
bigger than capital n then you have that

220
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:21,360
one minus a n. Well, 1 minus a n

221
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,440
actually for all n this here is less

222
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,240
than

223
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:29,760
uh 1 / 10

224
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:34,000
to the power n right because like if n

225
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:38,000
is equal to 1 this is this here this is

226
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:42,079
within one10th of one and likewise this

227
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,240
here is in 100 of one etc. Right? So we

228
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:47,279
have this inequality. It's actually

229
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:50,279
equality in this case. This here is a

230
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,279
equality.

231
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:59,040
Okay. But now you see that this thing

232
00:14:53,279 --> 00:15:02,560
here this is obviously 1 / 10 ^ n. It's

233
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:08,399
lesser equal to it's actually it's less

234
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:11,440
than uh n 1 / n. And so if little n is

235
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:14,320
bigger than capital n, this is therefore

236
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,800
less than 1 / capital n. But this here

237
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:20,000
was less than epsilon. And that's what

238
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:23,440
we needed to prove. Right?

239
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:27,360
So for the given for your given epsilon,

240
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:29,680
I specify a capital n and then we need

241
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,160
to prove that if little n is bigger than

242
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:37,320
that capital n, then we come within

243
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:37,320
epsilon of the limit. Okay.

244
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:45,600
Um

245
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:51,480
okay. Now let me prove a little theorem

246
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:51,480
about uh convergence sequences.

247
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:01,360
Then this is like if you will this

248
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:05,440
little lema

249
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:08,000
is like the first test for whether a

250
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:11,320
sequence is convergent.

251
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,320
So still

252
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:21,959
if

253
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,959
a end is a convergent

254
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,519
sequence

255
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,519
then

256
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:37,920
uh a n

257
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,920
need uh then a n is bounded.

258
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:44,880
Sorry, let me explain what I mean by

259
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:51,720
that. I mean that then the set of a n so

260
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:51,720
just explain that. So then the set

261
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:59,360
um the set a1 a2

262
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:04,360
a3

263
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,360
etc. This set here is bounded

264
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:12,799
Okay,

265
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:15,280
it's not enough to be bounded that to be

266
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:18,280
convergent but it is a necessary

267
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,280
criteria.

268
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:25,280
[Applause]

269
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:27,600
Let me just as a side remark say that

270
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:30,400
that if you're looking at the sequence a

271
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:32,640
n that we looked at just a minute ago

272
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:36,160
this here that is alternating between

273
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:38,000
minus1 and one right this is a bounded

274
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,720
sequence because the value there's only

275
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,840
two values so it's obviously bounded but

276
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:46,960
it's not convergent right so but it is a

277
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:49,760
necessary for a sequence to be

278
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:55,440
convergent is necess necessary that the

279
00:17:49,760 --> 00:18:00,320
sequence of of numbers here uh is uh is

280
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:04,679
bounded for for okay so

281
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,679
so now let's try to prove that

282
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:12,080
so

283
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:15,799
we have so since

284
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,799
a n is convergent

285
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:26,640
Then there is some a so that a end in

286
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:30,320
converts to this a right

287
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:34,440
and so now I can I can just focus on one

288
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:37,609
single epsilon. So in particular

289
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,609
[Applause]

290
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,520
if we choose

291
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:51,320
epsilon to be equal to one then there

292
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,320
exist

293
00:18:53,919 --> 00:19:01,840
then there exist capital n. So that if

294
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:06,799
little n is bigger than this capital n

295
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:10,559
then a little n minus a is less than

296
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:13,120
one. Right? This is this is that is

297
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:16,320
convergence just applied to this single

298
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:20,240
epsilon. Right?

299
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:23,120
Okay. And so now

300
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:26,320
so now so this is the first observation.

301
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:29,600
The second observation is that if we now

302
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:32,880
look at all the a that are not

303
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:36,840
considered here. So if you're looking at

304
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,840
the set the set

305
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:43,280
this is the first

306
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:46,960
capital a

307
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:50,080
capital n minus one a n right those are

308
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:52,960
the ones that doesn't fall in under that

309
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:58,280
this little n is bigger than the capital

310
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:58,280
n so this set here is finite

311
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:07,240
so obviously So for any finite set you

312
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,240
have that. So there exist

313
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,640
Cal

314
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,960
number

315
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,960
such that

316
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:24,480
that A N is less or equal to C for any

317
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:27,360
of these guys. Right?

318
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,690
For any A in this

319
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,600
any A in

320
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:35,799
[Applause]

321
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,799
uh in this finite set.

322
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,799
Right? So this means in other words this

323
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:54,159
means that a n is less or equal to c if

324
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:57,159
n here is between one and n minus one.

325
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,159
Right?

326
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:06,960
So now I look at

327
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:12,880
So now I look at uh now I want to look

328
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:14,880
at the numbers a n and um this number

329
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:18,159
here

330
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:21,280
right and I want to look at so I'm

331
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:25,200
thinking about the set

332
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:29,440
uh a absolute value

333
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:34,320
and where in here is

334
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:37,840
one up to one two etc. Right?

335
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:40,480
Well, I claim that this thing here I can

336
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:43,679
now prove that this set here is bounded

337
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:48,320
and this is just because that the first

338
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:54,039
uh n minus one those are bounded by c.

339
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:54,039
So I claim that this set here so claim

340
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:04,280
is that that uh that uh the soup

341
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,280
of this set

342
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:13,039
where n uh from one

343
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:17,440
over all ends

344
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:19,440
the soup of this set is uh is lesser

345
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,760
equal to

346
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,760
the max

347
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:32,640
of C and A + normal absolute value of A

348
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:35,760
+ one. So I claim that right. Now this

349
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,760
is clearly if you're taking the first n

350
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:40,240
minus one

351
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:44,080
then we already know that they are

352
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:46,720
bounded by c right so you just need to

353
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:52,320
worry about the one starting at capital

354
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:55,600
n right so we only need to worry about

355
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:58,720
when so this is obviously the case for

356
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:04,280
the first capital n minus one so we only

357
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:04,280
need to worry about only need

358
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,000
to show this

359
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:18,000
for little n

360
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,400
larger than capital n larger equal.

361
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,880
Yeah.

362
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,679
>> Um are you explain the max over there

363
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,400
why there's the absolute value of a plus

364
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,480
the plus one?

365
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,320
>> Yeah, I I would explain this and then I

366
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,880
I'll get to this and this is part part

367
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,159
of the proof. Yeah. So it it hopefully

368
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,720
it will be clear in a minute. If it's

369
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:38,080
not, you you should complain.

370
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:41,440
Okay. So I only need to prove that when

371
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:44,640
I'm just looking at the set here and I'm

372
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:47,679
starting at capital N, then the soup is

373
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:54,039
bounded like that.

374
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:54,039
And so then I so I'm looking at a n

375
00:23:54,080 --> 00:24:00,880
but a n I can write as a end I can write

376
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:04,799
sort of in a stupid way I can write a n

377
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:08,720
as a n minus a

378
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:10,720
plus a right so I can write it like that

379
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:14,080
right

380
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:17,200
and then I can just right so I have the

381
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:21,440
sum of two things the absolute value is

382
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:24,240
less than the absolute value the sum of

383
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:27,120
the absolute values.

384
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:30,159
So I have this right.

385
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:33,039
But now you see that since little n is

386
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:35,039
bigger than this capital n this capital

387
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:37,919
n was chosen so that this here was

388
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:40,559
bounded by one. Right? So this thing

389
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:43,760
here is less than one and this here is

390
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:45,600
less than the absolute value of a.

391
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,559
Right?

392
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:51,360
And so we have for the whole tail

393
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:54,559
starting at capital n we have that this

394
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:57,039
thing here is bounded by one plus the

395
00:24:54,559 --> 00:25:00,720
absolute value of a and for the

396
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:06,080
remaining capital n minus one those are

397
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:09,200
bounded by c right and so so together

398
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:12,480
all of this is bounded by the maximum of

399
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,240
these two things.

400
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,000
Okay.

401
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,880
Now the next thing I want to talk about

402
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:22,640
is that there's there's some sort of

403
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:25,600
algebraic property of limits

404
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,200
that is often very useful.

405
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:31,279
Um,

406
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:35,360
and I will prove there's four of these.

407
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:38,080
Um, and I will prove two of them and the

408
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:43,799
other one I will

409
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:43,799
um I will outline the proof of

410
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:51,360
>> Y.

411
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:53,120
>> So in that the soup is Oh, soup is less

412
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,720
than. So we we don't need to find

413
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:58,000
>> Yeah. No, you don't need to actually

414
00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:00,400
find the soup, right? Yeah. And and the

415
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,880
reason I want to write soup and not

416
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:05,760
maximum is that of course if it's

417
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:08,960
infinite numbers, it's not clear that is

418
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:11,279
a maximum, right? So we need to use the

419
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:14,159
the terminology soup.

420
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:16,080
>> So that that max of CN

421
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:18,640
+ one is not a soup.

422
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:21,760
>> No, no, that's right. is is a bound for

423
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,120
the soup but but the soup presumably is

424
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,039
is is less

425
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:27,679
>> and one there really just one

426
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:30,240
>> and the one really to some extent could

427
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:32,960
be almost anything. Yeah, it's a it came

428
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:36,240
from the epsilon, right? But you see if

429
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:39,039
you made that epsilon smaller then then

430
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:41,520
probably the c would jump up, right?

431
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:43,760
Because that is you right because the c

432
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:46,240
was the maximum of the first n minus

433
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,840
one. So if you're further out then there

434
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:53,360
are more numbers that you're taking the

435
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:56,640
maximum over. So anyway yeah.

436
00:26:53,360 --> 00:27:00,360
Okay. So so we want to prove some

437
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,360
algebraic properties

438
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,720
of limits.

439
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:17,840
Okay.

440
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:20,880
So, so the idea is that we take um so we

441
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:23,760
have four of these

442
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,760
and the first one is that you take a

443
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:32,600
sequence. So maybe I would just say

444
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:32,600
throughout a n and bn are sequences.

445
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:43,520
uh and a n is convergent to a

446
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:48,400
and bn

447
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:51,200
is convergent to b. Okay.

448
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:53,279
The first one, the first property is

449
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,360
that if you take a real number, sorry,

450
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:57,520
if you take a real number, C here is a

451
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:00,480
real number

452
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:04,240
and you form a new sequence

453
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:08,480
where CN is just this real number

454
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:10,559
times A N. Right? So each CN is somehow

455
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:14,960
almost like a N except that they're

456
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:18,799
multiplied by this fixed constant C. So

457
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:21,200
this here so the first one is that CN is

458
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:26,399
also convergent

459
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:28,720
uh and the limit is just C * A.

460
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:33,919
Okay.

461
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:38,240
The second one is that um that if you

462
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:39,919
take that a if you define a sequence. So

463
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:43,600
this is a different sequence that this

464
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:49,919
one. But if you define a sequence cn by

465
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:52,480
its a n the nth element is a n + bn

466
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:57,520
then this sequence is also convergent.

467
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:59,750
Cn is convergent and the limit is a + b.

468
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:06,460
So that was the second property.

469
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:06,460
[Applause]

470
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:12,200
The third property.

471
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:18,080
The third property

472
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:21,120
uh is

473
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:24,000
uh right the third property is that if

474
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:29,440
you take a product sorry so if you take

475
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:33,440
a n if you take if you define cn as a n

476
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:35,840
* bn right so this is a new sequence

477
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:41,360
then cn

478
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:44,640
is convergent and the limit is a * b and

479
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:50,720
the Last property is

480
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:52,960
that if um if the a

481
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:57,279
um are

482
00:29:52,960 --> 00:30:01,880
uh all of these are different from zero.

483
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:01,880
So this here is for all n

484
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:09,360
and also you have that the limit here is

485
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:12,320
not equal to zero.

486
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:17,600
uh then

487
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:21,440
if you define a sequence to be 1 / a n

488
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:23,760
then cn here converge and the limit is

489
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,760
one away.

490
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:28,559
Okay.

491
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:31,440
And so I will prove sort of rigorously

492
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:35,120
the first two and I will basically tell

493
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:38,320
you how to prove the other two. But I

494
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:41,679
the first two I will kind of write out

495
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:44,720
um formally as you know as we talked

496
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:48,080
about last time how you write formal

497
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:50,880
approve whereas the what I'm going to

498
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:53,200
discuss for three and four is very very

499
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,880
close to a formal proof but it's more

500
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,440
like what you would have on a piece of

501
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,440
scrap There you go.

502
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:15,159
Okay. So now,

503
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:15,159
so now let's prove the first one.

504
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:19,240
So prove of one

505
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:33,840
So since

506
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:36,720
so given

507
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:39,720
epsilon greater than zero

508
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,720
since

509
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:46,080
so yeah so first of all of course if

510
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:49,440
this capital C

511
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:52,480
if this capital C is zero then

512
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:56,159
everything is zero So it's like trivally

513
00:31:52,480 --> 00:32:01,399
the case. So we may as well assume So

514
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:01,399
may as well assume that's capital C

515
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,960
that capital C is not zero.

516
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:16,080
So now given epsilon greater than zero

517
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:20,080
since this sequence a n is converging to

518
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:23,399
a this means that there exist

519
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,399
there exist

520
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:31,600
n such that and now I'm not going to use

521
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:34,480
that epsilon you gave me that epsilon

522
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:37,360
uh I'm not going to use that epsilon in

523
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:40,159
the definition that a end is converging

524
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:42,000
to a. I'm not going to use that one, but

525
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:44,880
I'm going to use one that is closely

526
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,559
related. I'm going to use epsilon

527
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:51,039
divided by the norm of c. Right? Because

528
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:53,360
that's another positive fine. So you

529
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:57,120
gave me an epsilon.

530
00:32:53,360 --> 00:33:00,159
I'm going to look at this number here.

531
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:03,200
That's a positive number.

532
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:06,960
And I can use that in the definition

533
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:10,000
that a n converts to a. So I'm going to

534
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:13,200
say that because a n converts to a there

535
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:17,600
exist a capital n such that if little n

536
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:20,399
is bigger than this capital n then a n

537
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:26,960
minus a

538
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:32,399
uh is less than epsilon over capital s

539
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:35,760
uh c sorry a norm of capital c right but

540
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:38,760
now I just multiply on both sides So

541
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,760
multiply

542
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:46,960
by

543
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:50,200
by the absolute value of capital C on

544
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,200
both sides.

545
00:33:52,559 --> 00:34:01,600
And so if we do that then this here pops

546
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:04,880
in right it actually go in as c * a n

547
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:09,040
minus c * a

548
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:12,720
is less than epsilon and this is as long

549
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:14,960
as this n little n is bigger than that

550
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:18,560
capital n. This is exactly what we

551
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:23,119
wanted to prove. Right?

552
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:26,119
Okay. Now the second one

553
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:26,119
is

554
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:38,399
right. So the reason why I'm doing the

555
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:40,960
the first two

556
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:42,960
you see you see that those are pretty

557
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,280
straightforward. I mean it's not like

558
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:49,440
that it's it's not like any of these is

559
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:52,800
complicated to prove. Um the next two is

560
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,320
a little bit more uh I mean I wouldn't

561
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,960
say complicated but a little bit more

562
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,880
involved these two and but I want to

563
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:02,560
give you the idea because it's a kind of

564
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:04,560
a very simple but useful idea uh in

565
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:08,560
these two

566
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:14,839
so I I don't want to skip the the proof

567
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:14,839
okay so now uh we uh so we want to prove

568
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,880
the second property

569
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:30,240
Okay.

570
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:33,839
So we have that. So we have that a n is

571
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:37,359
converging to a and bn is converging to

572
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:40,000
b. And so again you give me an epsilon

573
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:42,079
that I have to work with. So given

574
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,320
epsilon

575
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:47,040
given

576
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:50,079
epsilon greater than zero

577
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:52,800
then I'm going to not again use this

578
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:55,200
epsilon in the definition that a n

579
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:57,359
converts to a and I'm not going to use

580
00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:00,480
it in the definition that bn is

581
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:04,240
converging to b but I'm going to use

582
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:06,560
epsilon over two in each of them. So

583
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:12,599
since

584
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:12,599
a n converts to a there exist

585
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,960
there exist

586
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:25,000
a capital n and let me call it capital n

587
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,000
subscript a such that

588
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:35,280
if little n is bigger than this capital

589
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:41,780
n subscript a then a n minus A

590
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:44,909
is less than epsilon / 2, right?

591
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:44,909
[Applause]

592
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,480
And likewise,

593
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,480
likewise,

594
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:13,880
since um since BN converts to B, then

595
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,880
there exist

596
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:22,400
there exist just a capital n but and I

597
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,400
denote it by this this may be different

598
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,240
than the one coming from a the sequence

599
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:29,560
a n

600
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,560
such that

601
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:41,920
if little n is bigger than this capital

602
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:47,359
n subscript b then uh bn minus b is

603
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:50,800
smaller than epsilon / 2. Okay.

604
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:52,880
And so now I have to choose right. So

605
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,960
you gave me the epsilon and I have to

606
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:58,320
choose a capital n. I haven't chosen

607
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:01,280
that yet but I will do that now. So we

608
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:05,359
set so set

609
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:08,920
capital n equal to the maximum of these

610
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:08,920
two ends.

611
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:15,599
So you're setting it equal to the

612
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:18,000
maximum of these two. Now if little n so

613
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:21,760
then for

614
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:24,079
little n bigger than this capital n if

615
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:29,040
you're looking at a so now we want to

616
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:33,200
look at so our sequence cn was the sum

617
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:36,960
of these two right so this here was cn

618
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:40,960
so we want to prove that so we want to

619
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:43,440
look at cn minus a * b and we want to

620
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:45,839
prove that if little n is bigger than

621
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:49,119
this then this here is strictly less

622
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:50,720
than epsilon right but this thing here

623
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:54,720
is

624
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:56,640
cn was by definition a n plus bn

625
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:59,880
sorry and this was not a product it was

626
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,880
a sum

627
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:06,079
um minus

628
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:10,079
a + b

629
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:13,440
so but this thing here you can write as

630
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:19,320
a n minus a

631
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:19,320
plus bn minus b.

632
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:23,200
And now you can just take the absolute

633
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:27,160
value of this. It's bounded by the

634
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:27,160
absolute value of the first.

635
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:37,249
[Applause]

636
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:42,839
So plus the absolute value of the

637
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:42,839
signal,

638
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:51,760
right?

639
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:54,160
And now you see that if um if little a

640
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:59,119
uh if little a

641
00:39:54,160 --> 00:40:02,400
let me keep. So if little a

642
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:06,320
sorry if little n since little n is

643
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:09,680
bigger than capital n which is bigger

644
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:12,320
than capital n of a in particular then

645
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:17,920
this thing here is less than epsilon /

646
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:21,240
two. Right? So you have that CN minus A

647
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,240
+ B

648
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:29,119
is less than epsilon / two that comes

649
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:34,880
from this. But you also have that

650
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:36,720
capital n is bigger equal to n subb. So

651
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:41,040
you also have that this thing here is

652
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:43,680
less than epsilon / two. Right?

653
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:46,079
So, so you have that this thing here

654
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:49,040
when little a is big n is bigger than

655
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:51,680
this capital n this thing here this

656
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:53,680
difference is strictly less than epsilon

657
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:55,680
that's what we needed to prove in order

658
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:58,240
to prove that this sequence that was a

659
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:00,240
sum of the two sequences converging to

660
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:04,079
the sum of the limits yeah

661
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:07,760
>> um we initially defined like

662
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:09,760
a less than epon what was the

663
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:13,599
justification for why we could

664
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:18,079
If we know that convers

665
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:22,720
>> right so that's right so because a n or

666
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:27,599
bn because they converge so like say a n

667
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:30,240
converts to a right then for all epsilon

668
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:33,760
you gave me the epsilon but and I'm

669
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:36,319
using that it's converging not just when

670
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:39,599
for that choice of epsilon but also even

671
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:42,240
for epsilon over two right that epsilon

672
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:44,880
if you right so you gave me the epsilon

673
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:47,119
then I'm using that is converting so I

674
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:49,359
will have to choose probably a n that is

675
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:52,160
much larger if I'm using epsilon over

676
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:54,319
two than if I use directly the epsilon

677
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:56,560
>> so it assumes that n increases like

678
00:41:54,319 --> 00:42:00,079
epsilon gets smaller where

679
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:02,319
>> as epsilon gets smaller presumably you

680
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:04,000
need to choose capital n larger

681
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:05,599
>> okay so you couldn't run into a case

682
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:09,359
where we're assuming like the

683
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:10,480
convergence is like smooth as was like

684
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:14,880
oscillating about

685
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:19,359
>> right right that's right I mean so so

686
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:21,520
um right I'm just I'm using that for I'm

687
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:23,920
basically using that for all epsilon

688
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:27,040
that it wasn't just for a fixed epsilon

689
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:29,119
right and so that's why when you came

690
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:33,960
with this epsilon then I'm actually used

691
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:33,960
it for epsilon over two yeah

692
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:38,480
okay so that was the first two property

693
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:41,599
those are the the it's not like the

694
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:43,599
other one is super difficult. Uh but but

695
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:45,839
that was but those two are the most

696
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:47,520
straightforward. Let's look at the other

697
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:50,240
two.

698
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:53,440
And so right in particular because it's

699
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:57,920
like a like for the next one there's a

700
00:42:53,440 --> 00:43:01,520
little trick that is useful in in

701
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:04,400
various different settings.

702
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:09,839
Um

703
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:14,000
and so so prove but but the next two I

704
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:16,240
will just outline. Okay.

705
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,160
So

706
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:20,400
proof

707
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:23,640
of three.

708
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,640
So outline.

709
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:35,599
So we need to look at a n time bn right

710
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:41,040
that's so cn is is a n * bn and we want

711
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:43,119
to compare cn with a * b

712
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:45,599
right we want to show that this thing

713
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:48,640
here if little n is sufficiently large

714
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:51,200
so given h epsilon if little n is

715
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:54,240
sufficiently large then this difference

716
00:43:51,200 --> 00:44:01,920
is bounded by epsilon

717
00:43:54,240 --> 00:44:03,520
but this thing here is a n bn minus a b.

718
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:06,480
Okay.

719
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:09,119
But and so the little trick is now that

720
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:12,240
in itself it's kind of difficult to

721
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:16,160
compare these two things. But the little

722
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:19,839
trick is that if you're looking at A and

723
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:22,640
B and if you sort of

724
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:25,200
by instead of comparing them directly

725
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:28,800
then comparing this with something that

726
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:32,000
is halfway between this and that then it

727
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:36,480
gets a lot easier. So what you do is

728
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:40,560
you're looking at A and B and and you

729
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:44,040
subtract A and B and then you add it

730
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:44,040
immediately again.

731
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:53,440
So this is certainly the same, right?

732
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:56,400
And now I can write this thing here as a

733
00:44:53,440 --> 00:45:00,160
N. I can just concentrate on these two

734
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:04,280
first and there I can factor out a in.

735
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:04,280
So I can write that as this.

736
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:11,079
And this thing here I can factor out at

737
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:11,079
B,

738
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:19,520
right? So I can write it like that.

739
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:21,599
And now now you see this is like it

740
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:24,160
looks much more promising. This one look

741
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:26,720
like the problematic one. This one looks

742
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:29,680
like no problem at all because this is

743
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:32,000
just some fixed constant times this

744
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:33,599
difference here. This one looks a little

745
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,280
bit more problematic because it's not a

746
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:37,359
fixed constant, right? But we'll deal

747
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:39,440
with this in just a second. But the

748
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:43,400
first thing I can do is I just take the

749
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:43,400
absolute value of this

750
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:51,240
plus the absolute value of that.

751
00:45:53,040 --> 00:46:00,480
And now I just take so so then this here

752
00:45:57,359 --> 00:46:01,760
is actually the same for a product. You

753
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,640
can just take the product of the

754
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:08,040
absolute value.

755
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:08,040
It's the same.

756
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,720
Okay.

757
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:21,839
Now,

758
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:24,240
now

759
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:29,640
the next thing is that we're going to

760
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:29,640
use the theorem that we proved earlier

761
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:36,040
that since

762
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:44,640
since this sequence here

763
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:47,359
since these numbers here all of these

764
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:50,400
numbers for all when you take right when

765
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:55,280
you take the set

766
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:57,920
um when you're looking at this set

767
00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:00,920
this set here since this set here is

768
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,920
bounded

769
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:05,760
and it's bounded because the sequence

770
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:09,359
was converging right and so we already

771
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:12,720
prove that then the the values the set

772
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:16,560
of values is a bounded set right so it's

773
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:18,800
bounded and so we can assume so there

774
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,800
exist

775
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:26,920
See, so that

776
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:37,599
uh A is the absolute value is bounded by

777
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:42,000
the C, right?

778
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:48,560
And so now so now I have and and um

779
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:51,440
Okay. And so now I uh have that uh CN

780
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:54,319
minus A * B.

781
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:56,880
This is what I had up there. And I'm

782
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:58,240
just using that this is now bounded by

783
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:06,960
just because these thing here are

784
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:12,960
bounded by C. I get C B N minus B plus B

785
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:15,119
over A N minus A. Right.

786
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:17,839
And now you see now it's going to follow

787
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:20,400
like so so so this here was just some

788
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:23,440
observations right and now when you come

789
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:26,640
to the proof so to prove

790
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:28,720
to prove

791
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:31,280
uh three

792
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:35,280
then given

793
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:37,599
given epsilon greater than zero.

794
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:41,280
Now we want to make sure that this thing

795
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:43,359
here is less than epsilon / two and that

796
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:47,040
this thing here is less than epsilon /

797
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:50,720
two and so I don't want to get in

798
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:54,720
trouble if this here was zero or if this

799
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:56,880
was zero. So I'm just so given epsilon

800
00:48:54,720 --> 00:49:04,960
since

801
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:06,480
a n converts to a then I can um um find

802
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:10,640
now I'm basically writing out the whole

803
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:13,839
proof but a n I can find capital a n

804
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:17,119
sorry capital n a so that if little n is

805
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:23,440
bigger than capital n a

806
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:26,640
then you have that a n minus A is less

807
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:29,839
than I don't quite use that epsilon and

808
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:33,920
I don't quite use epsilon over two but I

809
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:35,680
take absolute value I multiply it like

810
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:37,200
this

811
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:40,400
okay because I don't want to have

812
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:42,079
something where if b was zero then it

813
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:44,319
really didn't make any sense what I

814
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:46,960
wrote so now there's no problem it

815
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:49,520
definitely makes sense even if b is zero

816
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:52,640
and likewise

817
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:55,640
likewise since

818
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:55,640
uh

819
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,599
so likewise

820
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:13,040
likewise

821
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:17,000
since since BN converts to B

822
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:17,000
then there exist

823
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:26,440
so again you you gave me a uh epsilon.

824
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:26,440
So there exist a np such that

825
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:35,200
if little n is bigger than np

826
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:37,359
then actually you have that bn

827
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:40,319
minus b

828
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:42,480
is less than epsilon again over two and

829
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:44,960
this is not quite what I use because I

830
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:46,960
don't want to be in trouble. That's c is

831
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:49,119
already non- negative because it's

832
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:51,200
bigger than these absolute value. So,

833
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:54,960
but I'm just adding one for the same

834
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:58,839
reason. And so now you see that if

835
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:58,839
little n so therefore

836
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:05,440
if little n is bigger than the maximum

837
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:08,480
of these two then both of these

838
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:11,200
inequality hold

839
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:16,160
right both of them hold and so this

840
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:21,119
means that you now have that cn minus a

841
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:24,720
* b this thing here so we had it here

842
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:28,079
this is less and C.

843
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:32,880
And then this difference here was now

844
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:35,760
assumed to be epsilon over 2

845
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:37,839
1 + c.

846
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:40,000
And likewise

847
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:42,559
this here

848
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:46,559
is bounded by

849
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:50,960
this number here times

850
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:53,200
and then this this thing here.

851
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:58,800
So epsilon

852
00:51:53,200 --> 00:52:00,960
over two uh absolute value of b + one.

853
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:03,280
Okay.

854
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:07,440
And but now you see that this thing here

855
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:10,160
that's c divided by 1 + c that's bounded

856
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:15,319
by one. Right? So this thing here is

857
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:15,319
bounded by epsilon / two.

858
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:19,440
And this thing here same reason is that

859
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:21,760
this thing here is bounded by epsilon

860
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:24,160
/2.

861
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:29,200
And so the whole thing was bounded by

862
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:31,760
epsilon uh when uh when little n was

863
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:33,760
bigger than the maximum of these two. So

864
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:37,280
this in the end I I wrote out the whole

865
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:39,520
proof, right? Um in the I already posted

866
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:41,119
the lecture notes. In the lecture notes,

867
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:43,680
I didn't write out the whole proof, but

868
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:46,640
I gave the idea. So I sort of stopped

869
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:49,599
once we were here and somewhere here

870
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:52,599
after this one somewhere anyway. But you

871
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:52,599
see

872
00:52:54,800 --> 00:53:00,000
okay so the

873
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:04,079
right so the next thing I want to talk

874
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:06,319
about is that if you no no I still need

875
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:08,400
uh property four and that's also useful

876
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:12,720
sorry so let let's go through that and

877
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:12,720
then then we'll come to subsequences

878
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:31,040
So I want to prove that if you take a

879
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:34,480
sequence of real numbers none of them is

880
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:37,440
zero they converge and the limit is not

881
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:41,040
zero then one over the sequence is

882
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:41,040
another convergence sequence.

883
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:44,119
Okay.

884
00:53:54,319 --> 00:54:01,440
But but again just the main takeaway the

885
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:05,119
main takeaway I think from property this

886
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:07,359
third property was that this little idea

887
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:09,200
about inserting something that was

888
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:10,960
halfway between the two things you were

889
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:13,359
comparing because they weren't very easy

890
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:15,359
to compare directly and that's like a

891
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:18,319
little trick that is useful in various

892
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:20,960
places it comes up almost the same thing

893
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:22,800
one place it comes up is what's called

894
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:25,280
lightness rule that if you take two

895
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:28,319
functions and you take the product of

896
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:30,480
these two functions and you try to prove

897
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:33,200
that what is the derivative of the

898
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:35,440
product. It's exactly the same trick and

899
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:38,559
it comes up various other you know more

900
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:41,280
fancy ways.

901
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:42,880
Okay. So now let's look at let's prove

902
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:45,280
property

903
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:52,680
four.

904
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:52,680
So property form group of property form.

905
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:05,280
So we have this. So CN is 1 / a n and we

906
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:07,119
know that a n are not equal to zero and

907
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:10,559
we know that a is not equal to zero.

908
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:13,040
This here makes sense and and also 1 / a

909
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:17,559
makes sense. So we want to compare this

910
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:17,559
here with one away.

911
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:26,119
And so this thing here is 1 / a n minus

912
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:26,119
1.

913
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:36,079
And now I can put it on a common

914
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:38,720
denominator. So this is a - a n / a n *

915
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:40,800
a.

916
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:43,200
So like that

917
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:45,119
can write it like this. Right? Now

918
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:47,119
already the denominator looks very

919
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:50,400
promising because we know that this goes

920
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:53,680
to zero. Right?

921
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:56,640
And and now

922
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:58,400
but now I need to bound says so need to

923
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:01,119
bound

924
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:02,720
uh right. So need to bound we need to

925
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:06,000
bound.

926
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:08,319
So we we want to bound this here right

927
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,839
by epsilon when little n is sufficiently

928
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:13,200
large

929
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:15,359
the top the nominator here looks great

930
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:17,839
the denominator

931
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:20,160
maybe we're a little bit worried about

932
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:23,160
but the thing is that so we need to

933
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:23,160
bound

934
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:33,599
a n times a this here from

935
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:36,000
from below

936
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:38,000
Well, we want to bound it from below

937
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,400
because then when you're looking at one

938
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,240
over it, then that's an upper bound,

939
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:44,880
right?

940
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:48,799
And really because a here is just a

941
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:50,960
fixed number that is not zero, then it's

942
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:56,359
equivalent to proving. So it's this is

943
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:56,359
this this is equivalent

944
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:01,400
to bound

945
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:07,640
the norm of a n from below.

946
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:14,559
Remember we we don't need to bound it

947
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:17,760
from below for all a n but we need to

948
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:20,799
bound it from below for a for n

949
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:24,319
sufficiently large right

950
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:28,799
and so now you you make the trivial

951
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:35,359
observation so that a n you can write a

952
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:38,640
n as a n minus a plus a right

953
00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:43,839
and so therefore uh therefore the norm

954
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:49,400
of a n is bounded by the norm of a n

955
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:49,400
minus a plus the norm of a.

956
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:57,359
Sorry, this was not the this was not

957
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:59,280
this was uh this was not how I want to

958
00:57:57,359 --> 00:58:01,119
write it. I'm going to write it slightly

959
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:04,000
differently.

960
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:05,599
I'm going to write a

961
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,079
I'm going to do the symmetric syn thing

962
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:13,680
but I'm I'm doing it so I'm writing a n

963
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:18,119
as a min so I'm writing a as a minus a n

964
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:18,119
plus a n right

965
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:25,200
and then then if I do that then I can

966
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:27,359
just take the absolute value of a is

967
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:31,760
bounded by the absolute value of this

968
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:34,160
difference plus the absolute value of a

969
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:37,040
in right

970
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:41,200
and now I can move this here over on the

971
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:44,559
other side. So this here implies

972
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:49,040
that norm of a

973
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:52,000
minus the norm of a minus a n

974
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:56,359
is lesser equal

975
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:56,359
to this here. Right?

976
00:58:56,559 --> 00:59:04,319
And now you see that this thing here is

977
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:07,440
so so now we're going to use that uh

978
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:10,720
this here was not equal to zero. So this

979
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:13,359
here is bounded away from zero.

980
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:17,599
And so now we can

981
00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:22,079
we can take say a here

982
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:25,920
uh over two. So we can use this here. We

983
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:29,040
can use a norm of a over two. This is a

984
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:31,920
positive number because a was not zero.

985
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:38,680
And we can use this in the definition of

986
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:38,680
that a n. So use this. So, so use this

987
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:43,559
in the definition

988
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:51,520
of that

989
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:53,680
a converts to a right. So this means

990
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:56,680
that if you are this means that there

991
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:56,680
exist

992
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:05,520
a capital n let's call a capital n1.

993
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:08,640
It's not the final n that we want to use

994
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:12,240
but there exist a capital n1. So that if

995
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:16,799
little n is bigger than this capital n1

996
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:19,839
then actually we have that a n

997
01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:22,240
a minus a n

998
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:25,720
is less than

999
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:25,720
this thing here.

1000
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:32,400
Right?

1001
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:34,240
But now you see that this means that

1002
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:37,599
when you're looking at when you go up

1003
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:40,400
here and you're looking at when you go

1004
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:44,200
up to that line be before. So this is

1005
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:44,200
the line from before.

1006
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:50,720
Sorry this here minus this here. This

1007
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:53,440
and this.

1008
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:56,480
When you're looking at this line here,

1009
01:00:53,440 --> 01:01:01,359
well, this thing here, this here is at

1010
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:04,880
most half of this. So, this thing here

1011
01:01:01,359 --> 01:01:09,040
is bigger than

1012
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:11,200
this thing here over two, right?

1013
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:14,960
And so, now you see that we have bounded

1014
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:18,480
these guys from below, right?

1015
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:22,079
And so now we go back up to So now we go

1016
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:25,200
back up to we're looking at C minus

1017
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:28,640
sorry we're looking at CN

1018
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:32,079
- 1 / A.

1019
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:35,680
This is this is this

1020
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:38,960
up here. I'm just I'm just uh I'm just

1021
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:40,880
transferring that equation down to this

1022
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:44,720
board here.

1023
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:47,040
So this here is a n a minus

1024
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:49,119
a n

1025
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:50,960
divided by and I can just take the

1026
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:55,359
absolute value separately of the

1027
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:58,599
denominator and the denominator a n

1028
01:01:55,359 --> 01:01:58,599
* a.

1029
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:08,240
Okay. So, so now you see that this thing

1030
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:12,799
here as long as so when

1031
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:15,440
n here little n is bigger than n1

1032
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:19,599
but then we have that this thing here is

1033
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:23,119
at the very least the absolute value of

1034
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:25,440
uh a over two. So this means that this

1035
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:27,200
thing here we can now bound from from

1036
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:29,920
above

1037
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:34,079
like this. This is as long as you have

1038
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:38,000
this inequality here and this thing this

1039
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:41,839
is just a norm of a this give another

1040
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:45,960
norm of a over two so the two jumps up

1041
01:02:41,839 --> 01:02:45,960
so it's like this thing here

1042
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,000
right

1043
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:56,160
and now you see that

1044
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:59,599
now you see that this egg is just like a

1045
01:02:56,160 --> 01:03:02,720
constant Right? So this means that I may

1046
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:05,040
have to go even further out than N1. But

1047
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:07,520
if I go even further out, then I can

1048
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:09,200
make this in here smaller than the given

1049
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:12,200
epsilon.

1050
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:12,200
Okay.

1051
01:03:13,359 --> 01:03:16,720
All right. So this was like the outline

1052
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:18,799
if you will, but that's not at this

1053
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:21,200
point there's not very much to fill in.

1054
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:24,240
Right.

1055
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:27,240
Okay. So now I want to talk about uh

1056
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:27,240
subsequences.

1057
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:46,520
And then I want to then I want to prove

1058
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:46,520
a little theorem about subsequence.

1059
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:55,480
So,

1060
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:08,520
so I have a sequence

1061
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:08,520
and uh and so I have a sequence

1062
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:13,599
and then a subsequence. So I'll give you

1063
01:04:11,359 --> 01:04:16,480
first some examples and then I will

1064
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:20,480
explain uh then I will give you the

1065
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:25,039
proper definition of what a uh what a

1066
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:26,640
subsequence is. So I start with

1067
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:29,680
uh

1068
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:33,839
this sequence from before. So this was a

1069
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:36,799
sequence where a1 was minus1 a2 was one

1070
01:04:33,839 --> 01:04:40,839
a3 was minus1. it was alternating

1071
01:04:36,799 --> 01:04:40,839
between minus one and one.

1072
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:46,680
And so in this case here, in this case

1073
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:48,160
here, if you take

1074
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:52,000
[Music]

1075
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:54,319
uh this sequence, let's call it

1076
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:57,039
uh

1077
01:04:54,319 --> 01:04:59,359
let's call it B

1078
01:04:57,039 --> 01:05:03,680
uh let's call it um let's use a

1079
01:04:59,359 --> 01:05:05,839
different index. Let's call it B K.

1080
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:08,000
This is right. So k here play the same

1081
01:05:05,839 --> 01:05:10,400
role as n before but I want to use a

1082
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:13,359
different symbol to not somehow confuse

1083
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:17,200
with the n over here.

1084
01:05:13,359 --> 01:05:19,839
So if I take so I could take a sequence

1085
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:23,640
that was like one all the time. This

1086
01:05:19,839 --> 01:05:23,640
here for all K.

1087
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:29,359
This here would be a subsequence. This

1088
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:32,720
would correspond to that you took all

1089
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:35,200
the the even ones, right? That you you

1090
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:38,000
just take all the even ones, right? So

1091
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:40,640
this is like a sub.

1092
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:44,640
You could also have another example. So

1093
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:50,119
this is example one. See another example

1094
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:50,119
is where you took all the odd ones.

1095
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:57,119
So this here is is also a subsequence

1096
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:58,640
and you could do something more

1097
01:05:57,119 --> 01:06:02,960
elaborate

1098
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:07,839
where you take say first you take the

1099
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:10,960
first two odd and then you take the next

1100
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:15,280
two even. So you could have a sequence

1101
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:17,520
that was like B1 is equal to minus1

1102
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:22,319
B2

1103
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:26,480
is equal to minus1 B3. Now it becomes

1104
01:06:22,319 --> 01:06:29,680
the next two even ones and then you go

1105
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:35,000
back to the next two odd ones etc. Okay,

1106
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:35,000
that would be another u subsequence.

1107
01:06:35,839 --> 01:06:41,480
Um, let me look at a few more examples.

1108
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:56,000
So for instance, if

1109
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:59,200
your sequence, your original sequence,

1110
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:02,000
so here's another example.

1111
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:07,760
If your original sequence

1112
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:11,520
was just that a n was equal to n, right?

1113
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:13,520
Then you could take a sequence. So then

1114
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:16,520
the sequence where you just take the odd

1115
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:16,520
numbers.

1116
01:07:17,359 --> 01:07:21,160
This here is a subsequence.

1117
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:29,119
And likewise if you take all the just

1118
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:34,480
the even numbers

1119
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:37,480
this is also a a sequence a subsequence.

1120
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:37,480
Okay.

1121
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:44,880
Um but if you're looking at if you look

1122
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:48,480
at say something like this where you're

1123
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:50,880
taking so if you define a sequence where

1124
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:53,039
it was one

1125
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:59,400
one

1126
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:59,400
uh one one two even like this.

1127
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:07,000
This here is not a subsequence. This is

1128
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:07,000
not a subsequence.

1129
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:16,239
Because you have what you have done here

1130
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:18,080
is that you have taken the same number

1131
01:08:16,239 --> 01:08:19,759
several times and it doesn't appear

1132
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:22,319
several times. The value doesn't appear

1133
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:24,640
several times in the original one. So

1134
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:28,159
that's not allowed.

1135
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:31,199
It's also not allowed to do something

1136
01:08:28,159 --> 01:08:33,199
like this. This here is also not a so

1137
01:08:31,199 --> 01:08:35,679
not a subsequence. Another thing that's

1138
01:08:33,199 --> 01:08:38,480
not a subsequent

1139
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:41,759
when you take things out of order. So if

1140
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:45,199
you do if this here was the original

1141
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:49,279
sequence, if you're now looking at a

1142
01:08:45,199 --> 01:08:53,679
sequence that was three, two, and then

1143
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:56,000
four, five. This here is etc. This here

1144
01:08:53,679 --> 01:09:00,080
is not a a subsequence either because

1145
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:02,319
things are taken out of order. Okay.

1146
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:05,560
So now what is the formal definition of

1147
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:05,560
a subsequence?

1148
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:10,199
So here's the formal definition.

1149
01:09:14,970 --> 01:09:17,979
[Music]

1150
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:36,920
That's so if so you have a sequence a n

1151
01:09:33,679 --> 01:09:36,920
a subsequence

1152
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:47,759
of a n

1153
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:53,839
is where you have a map uh g

1154
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:57,560
from n into n. This is a increasing map.

1155
01:09:53,839 --> 01:09:57,560
This is strictly increasing.

1156
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:07,600
And then if you're thinking about this

1157
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:11,199
thing here, right? You think about this

1158
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:13,920
as a function f,

1159
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:18,000
then you now could think about the

1160
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:20,640
composition of these two functions.

1161
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:24,000
So this thing here and maybe I would use

1162
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:27,840
a different notation like this a

1163
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:30,840
different uh index like this. This thing

1164
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:30,840
here

1165
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:37,600
BK this here is a subsequence right. So

1166
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:42,159
you see that this here right when you

1167
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:45,199
pick if you have a sequence like this

1168
01:10:42,159 --> 01:10:47,520
you know the first one could be anything

1169
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:50,400
in the original one but once you have

1170
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:53,280
fixed the first one you can't look back

1171
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:55,760
or you can't go to this you have to the

1172
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:58,560
next element have to be somewhat further

1173
01:10:55,760 --> 01:11:01,760
out in the sequence okay and and and

1174
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:05,040
that sort of continue right

1175
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:07,360
and this here is often just to indicate

1176
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:11,120
that it's a subsequence of this

1177
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:15,199
sequence. Then the standard notation is

1178
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:17,920
a n and then another subscript.

1179
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:20,000
Okay. So anyway, so of course hopefully

1180
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:21,840
there's not too many subsequences of

1181
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:25,040
sequences because each time it's

1182
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:27,679
supposed to be another subscript.

1183
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:30,800
Okay. Now there's a little theorem that

1184
01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:34,800
we can just prove here at the end and

1185
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:38,400
that is that if you and and it's yeah

1186
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:43,520
it's sometimes it's a it's a very simple

1187
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:48,400
fact but it is sometimes a useful fact

1188
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:51,960
and that is that if you take a sequence

1189
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:51,960
so a sequence

1190
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:55,600
it's a theorem

1191
01:11:56,080 --> 01:12:06,199
Um that's so so uh a sequence a n is

1192
01:12:03,199 --> 01:12:06,199
convergent

1193
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:14,280
to a

1194
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:14,280
if and only if

1195
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:20,760
all subsequences

1196
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:30,920
of a n

1197
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:30,920
uh converge

1198
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:37,640
to to a.

1199
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:44,239
Okay. Now to prove this there's two

1200
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:46,880
two things we need to prove right

1201
01:12:44,239 --> 01:12:49,199
because it's a if and only if statement.

1202
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:51,920
So we need to prove that if it is

1203
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:54,239
convergent then all subsequence are also

1204
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:56,719
convergent and then we need to prove

1205
01:12:54,239 --> 01:12:59,199
that if all subsequence are convergent

1206
01:12:56,719 --> 01:13:01,280
then the original sequence is convergent

1207
01:12:59,199 --> 01:13:06,600
but one of the two implication is

1208
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:06,600
trivial. So one of the two

1209
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:11,800
implications

1210
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:16,520
is trivial

1211
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:21,800
and that is that namely

1212
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:27,920
uh since

1213
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:31,600
right so the the the map remember that

1214
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:34,560
the map to define a subsequence has to

1215
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:38,960
be strictly increasing, right? So that

1216
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:42,719
so remember that a sequence was

1217
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:44,960
a function like this.

1218
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:47,760
That was a sequence, right? And a

1219
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:50,800
subsequence there you have another map

1220
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:52,080
that is strictly increasing

1221
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:54,719
and then you're looking at the

1222
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:58,480
composition. But if you take this other

1223
01:13:54,719 --> 01:14:01,760
map to be the identity, right? that that

1224
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:03,840
the other map is like g of k is equal to

1225
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:06,880
k of of course this is strictly

1226
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:09,760
increasing right and if you did if you

1227
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:11,840
if this hair map was the identity then

1228
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:15,840
the subsequence would just be the

1229
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:19,520
original sequence right so so one of the

1230
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:23,239
two implication here is trivial since

1231
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:23,239
a n itself

1232
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:28,080
is

1233
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:31,080
admittedly trivial still but it is a

1234
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:31,080
subsequence.

1235
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:42,400
So, so if all subsequences

1236
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:45,679
converge to a well then the original

1237
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:47,520
sequence since it is a subsequence

1238
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:50,159
suddenly will converge right? So that

1239
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:53,840
was trivial. Okay. Okay, so we not just

1240
01:14:50,159 --> 01:14:57,440
need to prove that if a end converts to

1241
01:14:53,840 --> 01:15:00,719
a then any subsequence

1242
01:14:57,440 --> 01:15:03,120
but this is not much more difficult

1243
01:15:00,719 --> 01:15:07,560
uh because you see

1244
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:07,560
if you so given an epsilon

1245
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:14,800
so now given epsilon

1246
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:17,800
given so now so now we have so we we now

1247
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:17,800
have

1248
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:25,600
that a n converts to a and we're looking

1249
01:15:22,159 --> 01:15:28,840
at a subsequence a n and k and we want

1250
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:28,840
to show

1251
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:38,800
that a and k also converts to a right so

1252
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:41,679
given epsilon

1253
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:44,159
given epsilon greater than zero

1254
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:44,159
there exist

1255
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:51,840
um capital n

1256
01:15:50,159 --> 01:15:56,080
so that if little n is bigger than

1257
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:58,239
capital n then a n minus a is less than

1258
01:15:56,080 --> 01:16:04,000
epsilon.

1259
01:15:58,239 --> 01:16:06,320
But now you see that if k is bigger than

1260
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:11,679
capital n

1261
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:15,280
then then what correspond to this here

1262
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:18,320
is the right this is this here how to

1263
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:20,719
think about it this here n k you should

1264
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:23,199
really think about that this thing here

1265
01:16:20,719 --> 01:16:26,719
is the value of this strictly increasing

1266
01:16:23,199 --> 01:16:28,400
function right but this thing here is

1267
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:31,520
because it's really increasing

1268
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:35,120
is bigger than K. Right? So you see that

1269
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:37,679
if this thing here is bigger than this,

1270
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:39,840
then means that this index here is

1271
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:43,199
further out than in particular the the

1272
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:45,440
the capital N.

1273
01:16:43,199 --> 01:16:50,239
And so this means that if you have this

1274
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:53,440
here, then a N k this is some

1275
01:16:50,239 --> 01:16:56,560
element like this but it's further out

1276
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:58,960
than capital N. So this thing here

1277
01:16:56,560 --> 01:17:02,239
surely will also be less than epsilon

1278
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:06,840
because it's fall in under here.

1279
01:17:02,239 --> 01:17:06,840
Okay. So that that that that

1280
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:12,239
uh implication wasn't too much harder.

1281
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:15,520
And that's sometimes useful

1282
01:17:12,239 --> 01:17:18,719
that so so like if

1283
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:21,520
um yeah it's sometimes useful that

1284
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:25,840
you're looking at a sequence

1285
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:28,320
and um and you see that if it is

1286
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:29,920
convergent that you you're looking at

1287
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:32,000
you're looking at a sequence and you see

1288
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:35,120
that there's a subsequence that is not

1289
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:36,880
convergent or you have that there's two

1290
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:38,800
different subsequence of a given

1291
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:41,199
sequence that converts to different

1292
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:43,679
limits. then then the original sequence

1293
01:17:41,199 --> 01:17:45,199
wasn't convergent either. Yeah.

1294
01:17:43,679 --> 01:17:48,800
>> Can you not have like a finite

1295
01:17:45,199 --> 01:17:51,280
subsequence of subsequence that like

1296
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:53,440
doesn't get to end so hasn't arrived at

1297
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:56,480
the point of convergence?

1298
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:59,920
Um I mean so convergence is always

1299
01:17:56,480 --> 01:18:03,120
something about the tail about the end

1300
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:05,920
right it's it it never care about what

1301
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:09,520
happened in the beginning right so there

1302
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:12,480
might be finally many ends initially

1303
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:14,880
where you know things are crazy but then

1304
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:16,640
from there on out

1305
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:18,960
>> subsequences that we care about in this

1306
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:21,199
case are those subsequences that also

1307
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:24,719
>> yeah yeah so all sequences including

1308
01:18:21,199 --> 01:18:27,920
subsequences are infinite things, right?

1309
01:18:24,719 --> 01:18:30,480
Yeah. So like that's right. So because

1310
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:32,400
the thing is that that you had to have

1311
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:35,920
this map

1312
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:39,440
uh maybe I erased it but G here has to

1313
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:42,080
be a map from all the natural numbers

1314
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:45,040
into N. So it means that for each

1315
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:47,040
element here you get something right. So

1316
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:50,040
there's really infinitely many of them.

1317
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:50,040
Yeah.
