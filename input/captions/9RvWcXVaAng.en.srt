1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,800
but now I'm very pleased to introduce Dr

2
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:12,000
George Westerman principal research

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:15,440
scientist at the MIT SLO School of

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,480
Management Dr Westerman is a world

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,439
recognized thought leader in leading

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:22,560
transformation and competitive advantage

7
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:24,439
through technological innovation he

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,160
works at the really exciting

9
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:29,400
intersection of executive leadership and

10
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,759
digital Innovation to provide continuous

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,920
valuable sites to leaders in all

12
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:34,920
Industries George

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,879
welcome thanks

14
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:43,879
Todd it's really great to be here and um

15
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:47,199
I'm it's especially great because at

16
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:48,920
home we got 5 Ines of snow yesterday and

17
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:51,960
there was no snow on the ground here so

18
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:54,520
that's a good thing so um yeah I teach

19
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,280
in the management school and so what I

20
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,640
focused on he said Technology Innovation

21
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,239
leadership I Tred to take Technologies

22
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,199
and make them to Dem mystify them to

23
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:05,119
help leaders understand what's happening

24
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,920
there and really think about how do you

25
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,159
design your organization and how do you

26
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,759
lead transformation so I did some of the

27
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:13,400
earliest research on digital

28
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:15,960
transformation 15 years ago to tell you

29
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:18,240
how long ago that was nobody used the

30
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,200
word digital transformation back then

31
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,280
right and so wrote some book on that I

32
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:25,200
I'd done work with it organizations

33
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:28,680
before that I've done work in skills and

34
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,920
careers and now of course AI all of

35
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,560
those things come together AI is

36
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,119
affecting all of that and so uh what I

37
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,240
want to do today is talk to you a little

38
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,560
bit about how do you think about

39
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:43,920
generative Ai and how do you work that

40
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:46,719
in your strategy now Eric has been doing

41
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,640
AI for almost as long as I've been alive

42
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:51,320
right and

43
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,520
um I want to try to tell you about AI

44
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,040
from a management standpoint and that

45
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,159
means it will I will try to make it

46
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,520
crystal clear for you in trying to make

47
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:03,000
decisions in your organization but it's

48
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:06,039
also means that if Eric and I disagree

49
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,399
he's correct okay so that's where we

50
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:10,560
want to go my job is to be as as clear

51
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,760
as possible help you figure out the

52
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,680
questions you can ask the instincts to

53
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,440
develop as you are making decisions

54
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,920
because all of you probably are having

55
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,879
to make decisions with AI how can I help

56
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:24,200
you understand that a little bit better

57
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,879
or if I could say it a different way um

58
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,480
how can it make a little bit less scary

59
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:29,319
and make you feel more competent in

60
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,160
dealing with this stuff so you ready to

61
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:33,400
go

62
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:36,000
um three pieces here number one is what

63
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,319
is AI uh now Eric already talked about

64
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,840
what is AI I'm going to give you my

65
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:41,800
version of it okay and think about these

66
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,760
these elements of the different kinds of

67
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,879
AI and how to think about it number two

68
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,239
is Gen AI because that's really where

69
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:50,280
we're spending a lot of time now a lot

70
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:51,959
of attention on chat GPT and Gemini and

71
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,879
mid journey and all these Sora and all

72
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:55,519
these others how do you think about

73
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:58,400
making that work in your organization

74
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,360
because it's tremendously powerful but

75
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,200
also very risky and how do you think

76
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,440
about that uh and then the last is what

77
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,159
what does that mean how are companies

78
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:09,040
innovating with this right now so uh

79
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:11,200
first what is AI and like I said it's a

80
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,720
little bit scary after having followed a

81
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,799
a AI Professor but like I said it's

82
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,400
mostly correct and hopefully very clear

83
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:20,080
when we talk about it uh what is AI well

84
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,319
the thing about what is AI is it's

85
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,120
really hard right the definitions Eric

86
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,879
gave were from

87
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:30,080
2003 now Google does not track Google

88
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:31,879
Trends back in 2003 they start in 2004

89
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,120
and look what generative

90
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:36,920
AI nobody was talking about it because

91
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:39,400
it didn't exist back then right uh but

92
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,159
then deep learning he talked about that

93
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,360
and you could see how that came on 10

94
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:45,480
years ago or something like that that

95
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,519
was really cool we had a thing called

96
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,519
the work of the future initiative and

97
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:53,400
the question there was with deep

98
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:56,120
learning doing what it is doing what

99
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,680
jobs will be left after the robots eat

100
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:00,360
the jobs okay and we found out actually

101
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,720
they don't eat the jobs they eat pieces

102
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,560
of the jobs right and also there's a lot

103
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,840
of extra effort that goes in it's not

104
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,200
just the technology but that was the

105
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,560
scariest most interesting Ai and now

106
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,879
what do we call that we call that

107
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,560
traditional AI right that's how fast

108
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:19,280
these things move go back a little bit

109
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:21,239
farther this is uh machine learning uh

110
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,560
and you can see you know it it why is

111
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:25,040
why is it bigger well it's a it's

112
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,960
actually a super set of these other two

113
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,800
and then artificial intelligence and the

114
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,639
interesting thing about this you see

115
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,520
artificial intelligence was more common

116
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:35,440
and now it's less common because

117
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,080
artificial intelligence back then was a

118
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,280
different kind of thing than it is now

119
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:41,039
just like Eric was talking about right

120
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,560
so with these with these elements how do

121
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:47,000
you make sense out of this mess when it

122
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,960
keeps moving so quickly I'm going to uh

123
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,800
really first give you my important law

124
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,720
that if you remember nothing else

125
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:57,320
remember this you know Moore's Law right

126
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,080
you know Mo's law and the exponential

127
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:02,360
right these things keep growing at an

128
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,560
exponential rate okay um this is

129
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,560
westerman's

130
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,520
law westerman's law is different

131
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,520
technology changes quickly organizations

132
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,720
change much more

133
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,479
slowly this is I know this to be true I

134
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,080
should not have to say this is true but

135
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,800
I know it to be true and you know it to

136
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:22,039
be true but our technology people often

137
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:25,440
forget this and your technology vendors

138
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:27,919
often forget this the hard part is not

139
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,520
adopting the technology it's changing

140
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:32,919
the way you do business it's not the

141
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,759
digital it's the transformation is the

142
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:35,680
hard

143
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,759
part and so what does that mean

144
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,319
technology is not the problem

145
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:41,639
transformation is so it's not really a

146
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:43,280
technical problem it's also very much a

147
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:45,479
leadership

148
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,880
problem we need to get both of those

149
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:49,680
things in there right and so you know

150
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,240
for example in talking about AI we've

151
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,840
talked to two we'll talked to a lot of

152
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,400
Executives but here's two that we can

153
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:57,360
quote right uh Matthew Evans who who

154
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:00,520
worked on AI for the manufacturing

155
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,800
process at Airbus he says says strictly

156
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:05,080
speaking we don't invest in AI or

157
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,840
natural language processing or image we

158
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:10,440
are always investing in a business

159
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,880
problem or if we go on to the Home Depot

160
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:16,479
fim squ uh another thing I do is I run

161
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:19,039
the MIT Sloan CIO leadership award every

162
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:22,120
year and fim was uh one of our finalists

163
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:25,360
last year and Home Depot is a HomeGoods

164
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:27,960
store right if you need Hardware or saws

165
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,599
or wood or anything you go to Home Depot

166
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,840
I am renovating a house right now so I

167
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:33,919
spent a lot of time in Home Depot and

168
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,759
fim and his team have created a really

169
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:38,120
good experience for a really really

170
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,120
complicated store he says we should

171
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,280
always be looking for Extraordinary

172
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:45,800
experiences we want to bring joy to the

173
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:48,240
user we want to Delight the technology

174
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,880
that's secondary and once again we

175
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,400
forget that all the time but we can't

176
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,800
forget that because technology provides

177
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:58,440
zero value to your

178
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,960
company what you do with the technology

179
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,280
is what creates that value you okay how

180
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,160
you change your business or your

181
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:07,440
products to make it work

182
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,919
better so what's the first thing from a

183
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,440
management side what's the first thing

184
00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:15,280
you need to know about

185
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:19,319
AI artificial intelligence is not

186
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:22,000
intelligent okay and Eric mentioned this

187
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:24,360
and we should continue that right it is

188
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,639
a basically it's it's a program that

189
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:29,639
executes but it doesn't have that

190
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:31,160
context knowledge right um and we have

191
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:33,120
to remember that it's basically

192
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,680
executing a formula and that formula is

193
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,440
what you've programmed it to do what

194
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:40,479
what it's learned how to do but it may

195
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:43,360
not be the right thing uh a Oliva a

196
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:45,960
Oliva who uh has created AI that can

197
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,680
actually read what you are thinking

198
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,520
right with brain scans one of the

199
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,960
smartest people I know she says

200
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,000
artificial intelligence should be

201
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:56,039
artificial

202
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,520
idiots that's one way to think about

203
00:07:56,039 --> 00:08:00,199
this okay it's not intelligent but the

204
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:03,080
thing is it can act very

205
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:05,759
intelligently and that's very useful as

206
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:09,919
long as we are careful as long as we do

207
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:11,440
it in the right way okay so the digital

208
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,440
transformation research this is an

209
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,240
update we started this in 2010 this is

210
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,360
an update from 2021 where can you look

211
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,080
for opportunities not from AI not just

212
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,039
from AI but from mobile and from

213
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,120
internet of things and from other

214
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,599
Technologies you're facing four good

215
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:31,000
areas you can look one is creating an

216
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:34,560
engaging emotionally emotionally

217
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
engaging targeted personalized customer

218
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:40,200
experience number one right number two

219
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:44,279
is operations not just automation but

220
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:47,160
the ability to adapt and adjust as

221
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:49,720
things go on right that's industry 4.0

222
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:51,560
the uh business models not just being

223
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,880
the Alibaba or the Amazon of your

224
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,920
industry but what can you do with

225
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,920
information to make more lwh hanging

226
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,880
fruit turning your products into

227
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,959
Services these kinds of things and what

228
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:04,760
we rediscovered we should have noted

229
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:07,120
before employee experience employee

230
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:09,600
experience is a critical part we know

231
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,079
that good satisfied employees lead to

232
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:15,120
satisfied customers we also know that if

233
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:17,839
you have a bad employee experience it's

234
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,440
a very good indication that your systems

235
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,880
and your processes are not running the

236
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,120
way they should or your incentives right

237
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,000
so when you're looking for what to do

238
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,640
with AI it's the same way we think about

239
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,320
any the other digital transformation

240
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,959
work you can look in these areas and not

241
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,160
only in these areas but the opportunity

242
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:37,600
to go across Like Home Depot has done

243
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,839
like Airbus has done okay um you'll see

244
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,560
also that this rides on top of your

245
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:45,079
systems your data your systems and if

246
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,440
that's a mess it's hard to do this AI

247
00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:49,240
actually helps a little bit with that

248
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,200
messy data but the better your data is

249
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:54,519
the cleaner your processes are the

250
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:57,920
better you will be okay so uh I really

251
00:09:54,519 --> 00:10:00,959
think of AI as the next stage of digital

252
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,880
transformation the same principles apply

253
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,480
but there's more that you can do and

254
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,240
there are more powerful

255
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,600
opportunities and so we still need to

256
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,600
lead this but we need to think more and

257
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,120
more about what we can do okay so here's

258
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:16,000
some things we could do with generative

259
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:17,800
AI um I I have designed courses over

260
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,440
time we're doing one in the Philippines

261
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:22,120
right now instead of courses and instead

262
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,519
of me standing up and stand putting a

263
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:26,440
suit on and going in front of a camera

264
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:28,600
now we just type words in and she will

265
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,399
say it instead and if you don't like how

266
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,800
she looks somebody else that looks

267
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,800
different will do it and they can do it

268
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:36,279
in a different language and frankly I

269
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:38,240
can do it with a deep fake very easily

270
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:41,959
right I don't need to go to a studio

271
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:44,480
anymore right uh also any any corporate

272
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:46,920
literature you have can be in any

273
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:50,160
language you want instantly with a push

274
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:52,240
of a button right uh over here certainly

275
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,079
coding many people are doing coding

276
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,240
right now how many of you are your your

277
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:58,839
programmers are they using co-pilots and

278
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,800
things like that well if they are not

279
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:03,279
it's time to start this really does help

280
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,000
now there are questions about whether

281
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,160
it's better for the senior people or the

282
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,600
junior people but there's a learning

283
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:11,760
process and it is better it's not only

284
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,440
better for coding but also enforcing

285
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,720
standards and making documentation

286
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,600
people hate doing that the computer can

287
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,680
help them okay what else is there well

288
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,839
Cresta Cresta is uh is a call center

289
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,079
tool especially for sales and you heard

290
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:30,160
some really good startups um this in a

291
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:32,519
randomized trial at MIT they found that

292
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:37,959
everybody using this tool got

293
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:40,680
better uh the most senior people got 14%

294
00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:42,600
better the most Junior people got 34%

295
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:44,639
better if you have the senior and the

296
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,639
junior people they raise the bar for

297
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:49,200
everybody and it moves up what does it

298
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:52,399
do it listens to you talk and it gives

299
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:55,200
you hints while you are talking that

300
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:58,720
person is getting confused explain the

301
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:01,200
product better okay uh that person's

302
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,720
getting angry try this to calm them down

303
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,240
okay and then at the end it comes back

304
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,880
and says looking across what you've been

305
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,360
doing you don't close fast enough try to

306
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:12,320
get to the sale Fester these kinds of

307
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,240
things it becomes what a good supervisor

308
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,560
would be but it's with you all the time

309
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,199
and I'm working on a project right now

310
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:19,519
with the media lab where we are creating

311
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:22,639
a personalized tutor for the programming

312
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:25,399
class the first python class

313
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:28,160
for

314
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:30,920
um small uh sorry

315
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:33,120
minority institutions minority learning

316
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:35,519
institutions the idea is if we can get

317
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,560
people through that first class with an

318
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,959
individualized tutor they're on a set

319
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,920
for a career that they never would have

320
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,160
had possible but people drop out of that

321
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,440
first class because they do not have a

322
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,000
tutor so we're developing that right now

323
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,800
okay and then last but not least those

324
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,320
of you using any products whether it's

325
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:52,760
sap or workday or adobe this is being

326
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,399
integrated into all of your products

327
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,519
right so this is happening all over the

328
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,240
place but once again it's not the

329
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:00,360
technology it's what do you do with the

330
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,360
technology that makes better the other

331
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:05,079
thing that's really important here is we

332
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,720
talk about generative AI

333
00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:08,959
Solutions but most of the best Solutions

334
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:13,600
are a

335
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:16,320
combination generative AI traditional AI

336
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,839
boring old it and also people and

337
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,560
process in there so lemonade uh they

338
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:24,199
have a very the very specific niche in

339
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:26,440
the insurance Market they write 98% of

340
00:13:24,199 --> 00:13:28,920
their policies 98% of first claim

341
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,639
notices and they handle 50% of claims

342
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:33,360
off automatically through this

343
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:36,519
combination of different AIS and also

344
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:39,000
traditional systems what about that 50%

345
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:40,600
well the easy stuff the computer does it

346
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,079
and the hard stuff they give it to a

347
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:47,839
person to figure out what to do that's

348
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:50,959
how their model works okay um

349
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:52,800
and this is Cisco this is not the the

350
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:55,279
technology company Cisco this is Cisco

351
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,440
the Food Service delivery they have I

352
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:59,639
one of the largest truck fleets in the

353
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,360
world restaurants are around the world

354
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:04,160
gets supplied by these and here are all

355
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,680
the different ways that Cisco is

356
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,759
applying AI in what they do now this is

357
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:11,519
not a high-tech company they deliver

358
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:12,800
cans of stuff to restaurants but you

359
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,120
could see all the different things they

360
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:18,079
have on the customer experience side

361
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,800
over there and also on the back office

362
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:23,240
and uh when um Tom peek when I was

363
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,560
talking with him about what he does uh

364
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:28,040
all those little brains those are

365
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:30,079
opportunities where generative AI can

366
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,320
help you know we think about generative

367
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:34,440
AI in helping to figure helping a

368
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,720
salesperson figure out their call

369
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:39,519
planning but how about generative AI in

370
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:43,399
helping you route things around a

371
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:44,800
warehouse or uh how you know we we don't

372
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:46,399
have this thing that want we don't have

373
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,240
this kind of mushroom but this kind of

374
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:53,519
mushroom will work right so all kinds of

375
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:57,360
opportunities there so um if you

376
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:59,320
ask three AI experts what are the

377
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,120
categories of AI you will get five five

378
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,199
different

379
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:05,320
answers nobody can really agree so I'm

380
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:07,440
going to give you my four

381
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:09,560
categories and I'm not going to tell you

382
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:13,279
this is right I'm going to tell you it's

383
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:14,759
mine okay if that helps so um four

384
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,279
categories and this should look familiar

385
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:17,959
because Eric talked about a lot of this

386
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:19,160
right and what I want to do is walk you

387
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:20,920
through these just to give you a little

388
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,399
bit more Instinct on what to do about

389
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,639
these things okay so number one

390
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:27,399
rule-based systems Eric called it expert

391
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:29,880
systems put a lot of if then statements

392
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:32,120
together 1984 when I first started

393
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:34,079
programming my one of my first jobs was

394
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,399
to create an engine for a rule-based

395
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:38,560
system and like Eric said these things

396
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,480
don't work right beyond the simplest

397
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,480
problems but now rules engines are

398
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,720
better and if you use them in the right

399
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,040
environments

400
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,120
prescriptions loan making these kinds of

401
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,920
things within the limits in which they

402
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:55,519
are good they are useful but don't try

403
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:57,839
to get outside that context okay um then

404
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:00,040
there's a conom metrics which is

405
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,639
statistics most of us learned in school

406
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,920
deep learning generative AI let's walk

407
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:06,240
through these things okay so expert

408
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:09,199
systems we talked about this how do you

409
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,079
program them you talk to an expert and

410
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:13,279
the expert tries to figure it out but

411
00:16:11,079 --> 00:16:16,199
there's a nice Paradox which is that we

412
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:18,160
know more than we can tell or as Eric

413
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:20,319
said your two-year-old understands

414
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,759
physics but couldn't tell you how that

415
00:16:20,319 --> 00:16:25,319
works okay and we have that problem all

416
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:27,199
the time but you have to talk to an

417
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:29,639
expert you don't need any data the

418
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:31,800
expert the good thing is these are they

419
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:33,720
will give you a PR precise answer and

420
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:36,720
they will give you the same answer every

421
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:39,279
time but they do not

422
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,880
adapt right you add a rule things get a

423
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:43,600
little tricky so that's one thing

424
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,839
econometrics that's the next thing right

425
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,120
that's statistics we many of you

426
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,959
probably learned statistics you've

427
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,560
probably forgotten much of it but we

428
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:53,600
still use this all the time right if you

429
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:56,040
have structured data meaning data that

430
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,360
you can put into a spreadsheet usually

431
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:00,880
numeric data these things work and they

432
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:04,120
work really really well okay they're

433
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:06,400
pretty pretty cheap to uh to program and

434
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:09,160
especially the two things right how do

435
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,959
we create a formula for those two

436
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:13,280
Dimensions that will help us to figure

437
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:15,640
out is it a blue thing or a green thing

438
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,439
okay and they tend to be they are false

439
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,520
positives there are false negatives but

440
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,000
they tend to be pretty good okay the

441
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,039
other is looking at the trend line

442
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,679
looking at the regression okay these

443
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:28,000
things actually work remarkably well

444
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,600
with numeric data and also things you

445
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,280
can turn into numic data like is he

446
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:35,200
going to buy my product based on what I

447
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:37,760
do to him okay um you can also do

448
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,280
multiple Dimensions finding that trend

449
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,320
line with two Dimensions easy try it

450
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,880
with 100

451
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:47,880
Dimensions we U I have a team right now

452
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:50,720
currently looking at 100 million CVS

453
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:52,760
resumés and tracking people's careers

454
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,400
through that 100 million rums to try to

455
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:57,400
figure out what is a more or less

456
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,200
productive path you're not going to do

457
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:01,679
that by just looking at two dimensions

458
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,520
right um and then of course you don't

459
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,880
have to just look at lines but you do

460
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,480
have to have an idea of what the

461
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,720
functional form is that you're looking

462
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,280
at so it's awful numeric there's some

463
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,080
things but you can do this it's

464
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:14,240
relatively cheap it works really well

465
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,880
you get precise answers you get the same

466
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,240
answer every time but it has to be

467
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:20,120
numeric

468
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:21,600
data then you have deep learning and

469
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,440
Eric talked a lot about deep learning

470
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,919
this was the coolest thing ever 15 years

471
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,400
ago and it's still pretty darn cool okay

472
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:30,679
now the thing is Eric also showed you

473
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,720
there like 50 different versions of this

474
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:34,919
right so I'm just going to give you one

475
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,360
archetype this picture do you know what

476
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:38,600
that picture

477
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:40,799
is it's a neural net but you know what

478
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:44,000
this picture mostly is it's a thing that

479
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:46,080
people use to scare you right it's a

480
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,480
complicated looking thing and it looks

481
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,919
there's a little bit of magic involved

482
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,880
in there so Eric explained this but let

483
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:52,880
me explain it also a little bit more

484
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,360
you're taking inputs you're running them

485
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,320
through a set of weighted averages and

486
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,600
coming out with a prediction of multiple

487
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:03,000
different states at the end

488
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:06,200
okay and it sounds very

489
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,559
easy but it gets Beyond human capability

490
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:11,679
really fast okay you you train it with

491
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:13,159
labeled data you need to know the truth

492
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,600
that's why every time you log in and it

493
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:17,799
says prove you are

494
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:19,200
human tell us where there is a car tell

495
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:21,320
us where there's a bicycle you are

496
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,880
labeling data to train these things

497
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,960
every time you get on social media and

498
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,280
they do the the Aging challenge show us

499
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:30,039
you and show us you 20 years ago you're

500
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:33,200
creating labeled data of old and young

501
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:34,679
people right you need that data um and

502
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,799
then you do the the outputs are

503
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:38,760
repeatable but they are in no way

504
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,240
explainable our smartest people are just

505
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,840
starting to figure out how to make this

506
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,919
explainable and it's going to be a

507
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:47,039
little while okay but I'm going to give

508
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:48,720
you an example now an

509
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,799
MIT I'm going to get a little

510
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,159
complicated on you but I promise not too

511
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,640
complicated the good thing is I'm going

512
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:55,640
to try to take this scary picture and

513
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:58,159
make it a little bit more real Eric

514
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:01,960
started I'll try it and after the two of

515
00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:04,159
us hope it will make sense okay what are

516
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:06,799
those

517
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:10,640
anybody they're

518
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:14,320
numbers now try to tell me if we were to

519
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,480
say features right loops and lines and

520
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,600
these kinds of

521
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:21,039
things tell me the formula the set of to

522
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:24,840
look at the number two how would you

523
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:26,480
create the rules to decide what is a

524
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:28,880
number

525
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,440
two well it has a little loop at the the

526
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,280
top it has a loop down here and then the

527
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:39,120
number goes down right that's how a two

528
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:41,159
looks except that uh no Loop there right

529
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,120
and there the line is going across

530
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:45,360
instead of going down right if you were

531
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,520
to try to program this with a bunch of

532
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:50,919
features you would probably not get very

533
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:54,120
far but 35 lines of code 25 to 35 lines

534
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:55,919
of code can do this no problem at all by

535
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:58,280
by doing this kind of thing what do you

536
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:00,679
do well first of all you take these two

537
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:03,960
dimension objects and you turn them into

538
00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:08,320
a one-dimensional set of numbers okay so

539
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:09,720
28 by 28 image becomes 784 pixels now

540
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,360
what you have just done is you've thrown

541
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,640
away all the relationships between what

542
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:17,039
is on top of each other you've thrown it

543
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:18,559
away and the algorithm doesn't care and

544
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,760
then you put the numbers in the left

545
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:24,840
hand side and you have random numbers

546
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:27,360
here and it spits out 10 estimates 0

547
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:30,080
through n How likely is it that that is

548
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,159
the number okay and so you come through

549
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:37,679
and you get this well maybe we think

550
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:39,880
maybe it's a two a one we think

551
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:43,520
maybe it's

552
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:45,840
a two maybe it's a seven okay and some

553
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,679
stronger or less strong estimates and

554
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:51,000
then you go back and say hey it's really

555
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:54,080
a nine and you go back the other way and

556
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,120
you turn all the knobs to make it a

557
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:59,159
little bit better

558
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:02,039
okay now if that bothers you

559
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:03,760
how much do you turn each knob it should

560
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:06,080
bother

561
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,720
you because nobody knows how much you

562
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,960
turn each knob but we do know if you do

563
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,440
this 10,000 times the knobs end up in

564
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,000
the right

565
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:16,760
place so if it sounds like magic to you

566
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,720
it is Magic it's the magic of large

567
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:21,520
numbers and good algorithms okay and so

568
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:23,000
if you're wildly uncomfortable then you

569
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,640
are like the rest of us we are all

570
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,799
wildly uncomfortable with this but it

571
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,360
does

572
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:31,159
work so you do that 10,000 times and it

573
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:32,480
get gets there now what does that mean

574
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:34,159
well that means you got to have labeled

575
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,000
data you need to know what that number

576
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:38,679
really is you need to do the

577
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,559
reinforcement over and over again and

578
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:43,760
you need to back chain to to adjust

579
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:46,279
those numbers okay if your data is

580
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:49,000
biased let's say we have only data on

581
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:51,720
men but not women well then what happens

582
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,320
when a woman comes in this Amazon found

583
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:56,400
this out they were reviewing resumés to

584
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:59,400
try to figure out what resumés look like

585
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:02,440
their best to engineers

586
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:05,120
and they were routinely rejecting

587
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:08,039
women why was that none of their

588
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:10,400
Engineers were women and women talk

589
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:12,279
differently right uh by the way if you

590
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:15,200
were the captain of the women's swimming

591
00:23:12,279 --> 00:23:16,679
team you would never get a job none of

592
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,200
the men that they trained it on were

593
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:21,000
ever captain of the women's swimming

594
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,919
team right and also different use so

595
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,880
they had to go five and fix that bias

596
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:27,279
same thing if you train on men versus

597
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,799
women children versus adults different

598
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:31,159
parts of the world okay so you got to

599
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:32,880
get rid of that you got to test that

600
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:34,400
bias you also need to make sure you

601
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,559
actually have some kind of accuracy in

602
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:39,880
your data so that's it no more on the

603
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:42,240
neural Nets do you understand that

604
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:45,440
picture I could test you and you would

605
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:48,159
know how to say that now okay well at

606
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:50,520
least nobody can scare you anymore all

607
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:52,600
right so then G continues and as Eric

608
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,919
said you know what they do now not only

609
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:56,480
they're using a lot of these similar

610
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:58,640
algorithms but they're also inventing

611
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:01,000
and they're saying okay given what you

612
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:04,240
told me and everything I know what's the

613
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,440
next best word or pair of words to say

614
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,159
and then it says okay once I have that

615
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:10,039
given everything you told me and

616
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,279
everything I know plus everything I just

617
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:14,760
invented what's the next best word

618
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:16,880
what's the next best word and it can get

619
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:18,520
things very right as you've seen you can

620
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:22,600
also get them very

621
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:24,720
wrong I first did my bio with cat GPT

622
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:26,559
and it the bio was really good expert on

623
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,120
digital transformation and Innovation

624
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:32,000
strategy author of four award-winning

625
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,559
books blah blah blah I loved it right

626
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,840
I've only written three

627
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:39,880
books I don't know what that fourth book

628
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:41,039
is but it and it wouldn't tell me right

629
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,799
so you want to be careful but the

630
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,640
interesting thing about that is well

631
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:46,559
I'll come back to that in a minute it

632
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,080
randomly generates the next so why do

633
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:49,840
you get a different answer every time

634
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:54,240
because it is random it's meant to be

635
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:55,760
that way okay and you can use that um it

636
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,640
creates new things it doesn't just

637
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:01,480
classify it creates new right it can be

638
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,960
used for good as bad you can get some

639
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:05,080
boring stuff you can also get creative

640
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,360
stuff but you also get this the

641
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:09,399
hallucinations right uh my favorite is

642
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,880
this this lawyer prepared all of his

643
00:25:09,399 --> 00:25:15,080
court documents using chat

644
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:17,559
GPT and unfortunately some of the cases

645
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:20,080
that he cited as precedent for what he's

646
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:24,000
doing were not

647
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:25,360
real that made the judge very angry okay

648
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,679
so not only did he get in trouble with

649
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,360
the judge but he ended up in all the

650
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:30,880
business press as being the laughing

651
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:34,679
stock don't do that right but here's the

652
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:37,360
thing we are so worried about these

653
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:39,480
hallucinations but how many of us know a

654
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:42,520
perfect

655
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:44,120
employee people make mistakes too right

656
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:46,159
and so the idea is not to expect a

657
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:50,320
perfect answer maybe except if your car

658
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:51,919
is driving right um but the answer is to

659
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,000
get these things to work well and put

660
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:56,760
the right controls in in case they are

661
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,440
wrong the same thing we do with people

662
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:00,320
so why do we expect the computers to be

663
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,039
better than people in every Cas is why

664
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,960
don't we just put the right processes in

665
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:06,000
place to account for the fact that these

666
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:10,120
are sometimes not

667
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:13,080
right um the other thing of course huge

668
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:16,000
training data this thing needs and huge

669
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:17,679
amounts of energy and so um these are

670
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,840
other other topics we can talk about

671
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:23,200
over time so what the problem is you got

672
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,440
to use the you got to start with the

673
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,240
problem and figure out the right

674
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:28,520
technique so one way to think about it

675
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,600
is there are questions you can ask how

676
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:33,039
accurate do I have to be and how what's

677
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:35,120
the cost of being wrong getting in a

678
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:37,720
traffic accident or making a wrong

679
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,360
medical decision there's a big cost

680
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:43,679
sending the wrong marketing message to

681
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:46,039
somebody no cost at all right do you

682
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:48,159
need the answer to be explainable

683
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:50,480
because if it does then those first two

684
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,399
are probably useful those NE those last

685
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:55,120
two they're not

686
00:26:52,399 --> 00:26:56,440
explainable how do you do that right do

687
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,279
you need the answers to be the same

688
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:00,080
every time you're not going to get that

689
00:26:58,279 --> 00:27:02,159
that with generative AI right and

690
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:04,120
confidentiality and confidentiality is

691
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,440
less of a problem right now you can get

692
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:07,679
these generative things that are going

693
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,679
to keep you or at least the vendors

694
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:11,120
promise they will keep you safe right

695
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,360
but these are things to think about

696
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:16,320
right then on the other side is the

697
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:20,480
data do you have a source of truth and

698
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:22,640
how true is that data and number two is

699
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:25,080
it generalizable or are you going to

700
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:27,760
reject all women that apply for your

701
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:29,760
company okay so as you're thinking about

702
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,600
how to do it these are questions you can

703
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,039
ask about this problem I'm trying to

704
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:36,320
solve right

705
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:37,960
now and the the questions either you can

706
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,000
make the decision or you can ask these

707
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:41,279
questions of your technical people and

708
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,679
first of all they will now be a little

709
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:45,640
bit afraid of you right but second of

710
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:48,519
all you will have a better conversation

711
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:52,760
because you are asking these

712
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:55,080
questions so first bit what is AI four

713
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:56,799
things here's how to think about them

714
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,559
here if he likes traffic lights here's a

715
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:01,000
nice little chart you can use right to

716
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:05,760
think about these things where are they

717
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:08,360
good and bad but that's only part of the

718
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:10,200
problem that's the part saying okay I

719
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,960
have a specific problem I want to solve

720
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,399
how do I I think about what the right

721
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,399
technique

722
00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:19,080
is the real problem is how do I make

723
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:21,039
this work in my

724
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:24,159
organization so I have more questions

725
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:27,120
for you maybe some more answers you

726
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:30,000
ready

727
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:32,480
okay how do I make it work to the new

728
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,880
organization Remember come back to this

729
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,360
technology is not the problem

730
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:40,559
transformation is what is how do we put

731
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:42,600
the processes the the policies and the

732
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:45,799
capabilities in place to do this the

733
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:47,559
right way because doing it once is hard

734
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:49,360
but you need to do it over and over and

735
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:52,279
you need to make it mix in with the rest

736
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,279
of the stuff that you

737
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:56,320
do here are three challenges to think

738
00:28:54,919 --> 00:28:58,720
about when you try to make this stuff

739
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,960
work in your organization and I'd like

740
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,080
to say this is only geni but this is

741
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,880
basically anything how do we work this

742
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:08,840
in right but with generative a how do we

743
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:11,240
prioritize what to do and what not to do

744
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:12,720
what do we do first what do we do second

745
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:16,200
and what do we never

746
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:18,960
do number two risk management you know

747
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:21,240
what if we are wrong what if we have a

748
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,880
privacy problem these kinds of things

749
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:25,200
and last is the capabilities so four

750
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,760
sets of questions you can ask for that

751
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,240
and then after this I'll I'll have one

752
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:31,919
more little section for you

753
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:34,760
okay how do you ensure the safety and

754
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:36,919
the value of what you're doing and one

755
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:39,080
of the big and the other ones is

756
00:29:36,919 --> 00:29:40,519
learning how do you not only learn about

757
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:43,440
this Innovation but how do you learn

758
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:45,360
across Innovations so you can choose the

759
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,399
best way to do things and you don't end

760
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:51,919
up doing the same thing 10 times

761
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:56,000
okay um one of the big questions to

762
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:58,799
think about here is what how does

763
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,480
your governance process look

764
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:03,600
and what we've seen in generative AI is

765
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:06,919
multiple approaches but they tend to

766
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:09,320
fall into top down this is a very risky

767
00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:11,600
very expensive thing let's control

768
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:14,080
everything okay and the good thing about

769
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,799
that is we're not going to make mistakes

770
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,120
we're not going to throw money away

771
00:30:15,799 --> 00:30:18,360
we're probably not going to kill a lot

772
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,279
of

773
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:23,120
people but we're also not going to

774
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:25,000
innovate very well because the central

775
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:28,120
part of large organizations it doesn't

776
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,399
always know the best opportunities okay

777
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:31,559
the other side is the is the

778
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:34,440
decentralized way hey go out and

779
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:36,679
innovate do whatever you want okay now

780
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:39,559
here are some rules you know don't don't

781
00:30:36,679 --> 00:30:41,360
steal money don't do be bad to people

782
00:30:39,559 --> 00:30:43,559
right but here are some rules innovate

783
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,519
within these rules and tell us about

784
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:47,039
what you're

785
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:48,919
doing it's a tremendously good way to

786
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:51,039
discover really interesting ideas at the

787
00:30:48,919 --> 00:30:53,840
edges but it's a great way to waste

788
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:56,080
money also okay and also depending on

789
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:58,440
how careful are being you can also break

790
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,480
some laws when you do that because where

791
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:03,200
the central might try to be very careful

792
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:06,120
the edges might not and so what what we

793
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,559
saw in gender of AI is the very top down

794
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:11,000
safe but

795
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:13,760
slow or the very decentralized very fast

796
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,639
but more risky and more costly we saw

797
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:18,760
both of those coming out so at Society

798
00:31:16,639 --> 00:31:21,960
Jal one of the big French

799
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:24,240
banks they had a they did it in a very

800
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:26,639
centralized way but they asked everybody

801
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:30,200
to say if you did if you want to do this

802
00:31:26,639 --> 00:31:32,320
what would you do and they got 700 use

803
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:34,720
cases and what they decided is they did

804
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:38,279
a few of those right away but the rest

805
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:40,600
they said wait because all these cases

806
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:42,960
an intelligent agent is important a

807
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:44,720
chatbot to talk to people is important

808
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,679
programming is important let's do this

809
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,159
the right way and we will build

810
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:51,559
everything on top okay so they did a few

811
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:53,399
things fast they did they told other

812
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:55,840
things to wait until they had these

813
00:31:53,399 --> 00:31:58,639
other capabilities set up they tried to

814
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:00,880
bridge the centralized and decentralized

815
00:31:58,639 --> 00:32:03,399
Cisco that I told you about they did a

816
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:05,679
different way they said you know what

817
00:32:03,399 --> 00:32:08,880
this is just another

818
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:11,080
technology we have a way we think about

819
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:13,679
this and the first thing we think about

820
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:16,120
is can we buy this instead of building

821
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:18,279
it and if we can we will do that the

822
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:20,600
second thing they say is if we think it

823
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:22,840
needs to be programmed can we do it

824
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:25,720
cheaper and easier with expert systems

825
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:28,240
and statistics or do we do the fancy

826
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:29,880
complicated stuff and only when it

827
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,919
answers all those questions do they do

828
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:34,559
the Leading Edge the generative AI so

829
00:32:32,919 --> 00:32:36,080
you see these these governance rules

830
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:38,360
they fit in there right you got to

831
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:40,720
figure out what works with your company

832
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:42,600
and how does it fit the risk profile

833
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,919
that you're thinking

834
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:48,279
about some other questions you want to

835
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:50,519
ask though are also just as important is

836
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:53,679
our culture ready for

837
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:56,440
this what happens when the computer is

838
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:59,000
just as smart as our expert

839
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:01,120
person 15 years ago this started

840
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,720
happening in Banks where the computers

841
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:07,519
were as good at judging a high quality

842
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:09,360
or a lowquality loan than people were or

843
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:11,799
Insurance the computers were just as

844
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:14,360
good at underwriting some things as

845
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:17,480
people the people felt very threatened

846
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:20,000
by that and it was a whole process it's

847
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:21,279
happening in all kinds of jobs now if

848
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,080
you've seen the movie

849
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:24,919
Moneyball have you seen I don't know

850
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:27,080
whether America you know baseball's a

851
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:28,559
big deal I don't know if it is here but

852
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:31,519
you know there's big question right how

853
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:33,240
do I tell who is a good potentially new

854
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:35,639
employee for this

855
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:38,159
company maybe the computer is better and

856
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:40,760
people don't like that okay so do we

857
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:42,880
have the humility to work with these or

858
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:45,799
do we fight against

859
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:49,399
them do we have ethics to do the right

860
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:51,840
thing and not the wrong thing right and

861
00:33:49,399 --> 00:33:53,960
also in the culture how good are we at

862
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:56,799
experimenting and trying things and

863
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:58,880
failing fast rather than trying to have

864
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:01,039
the first answer the right answer before

865
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:03,519
we start

866
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:05,200
okay the culture's got to be ready for

867
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:06,919
these things and the way you do that you

868
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,599
have to drive that you don't just say

869
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:10,879
plug in the model you got to help people

870
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:13,159
get comfortable right with Innovation

871
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:14,720
units other things and another one also

872
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:17,399
with people being

873
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:20,560
comfortable do we have the skills but

874
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:20,560
what does this mean for

875
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:26,240
careers a friend of mine uh Daniel Rock

876
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:30,639
looked at gpts and he has calculated

877
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:34,079
through a very rigorous process that 46%

878
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:38,119
of all jobs are likely to have 50% of

879
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:40,879
their tasks replaced by AI over

880
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:44,839
time now some jobs it'll be

881
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:47,679
100% these are just 46% percent of jobs

882
00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:50,000
will have half of their tasks go what if

883
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:52,839
you do that job how do you feel about

884
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,599
that and am I going to am I going to go

885
00:34:52,839 --> 00:34:55,919
along with this or am I going to reject

886
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:58,720
this because I think it's going to hurt

887
00:34:55,919 --> 00:35:00,560
my job so what do you what do you do

888
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,880
about this certainly we've done I've

889
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:04,000
done some some writing on this and

890
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,400
certainly after lunch you're going to

891
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,079
see some really interesting stuff on

892
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:11,040
that but AI doesn't have to replace you

893
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:13,240
how can it make your job easier reduce

894
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:15,160
your cognitive load how can it do one of

895
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:17,040
the things I do it for all the time I'm

896
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:20,160
a pretty good writer but I'm not I don't

897
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:22,839
do those sexy creative titles so I let

898
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:26,160
AI do it now give me five potential

899
00:35:22,839 --> 00:35:27,400
titles for this right uh or I can give

900
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,599
it my text and say make this more

901
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:31,400
exciting

902
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:35,119
right um and the other thing we did not

903
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:37,440
expect is the ability to learn with ai

904
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:39,040
ai is a tremendous teaching tool and I'm

905
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,760
finding I'm learning all the time just

906
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:44,520
by having it help me think having it

907
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:46,119
asked questions about what I'm doing or

908
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:47,960
uh and certainly I talked about this

909
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:49,839
tutor we are doing and and many places

910
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:51,440
are doing these tutors including at

911
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:54,319
Cresta and at one of the startups we

912
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:56,520
talked about right so it does not have

913
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:58,760
to replace us are you having that

914
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:00,319
conversation with your people

915
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,560
about how this you're not just saying

916
00:36:00,319 --> 00:36:04,319
we're not going to hurt you because

917
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:06,240
nobody believes that right but can you

918
00:36:04,319 --> 00:36:09,160
have the conversation about how we can

919
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:11,200
help you introduce this uh so for

920
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:13,160
example denu creative an advertising

921
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:15,119
firm that is a firm that you might think

922
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:17,280
should be a little bit nervous about

923
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:21,200
these

924
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:24,119
things and um what they're finding is

925
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:25,640
that these creative people love this but

926
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:27,599
they're being very systematic in the

927
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,760
company about how they introduce this

928
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:31,480
first of all they are saying all the

929
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:34,200
boring stuff your planning your

930
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:36,640
proposals those kinds of things it will

931
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:39,000
do that for you take a few words and

932
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,440
turn it into a proposal that's great

933
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,720
what they didn't expect and that they

934
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:46,200
love now is let's draw a picture and

935
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:48,640
instead of saying Go away and in a week

936
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:50,520
we will have a design for you now they

937
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:53,160
say go get a cup of coffee and in five

938
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:54,640
minutes we'll have a design for you and

939
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:56,000
now we can iterate that and iterate it

940
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:58,359
you can do it with the client it's

941
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,720
better for both they didn't expect that

942
00:36:58,359 --> 00:37:02,040
right the other thing they're doing

943
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:03,440
though is they're not saying you use it

944
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:05,599
you use it what they're saying is

945
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:08,079
everybody use it we will help you and

946
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:09,400
let's get together and share your ideas

947
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:11,400
what is working for you what's not

948
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:13,280
working for you these office hours where

949
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:15,640
people share their tricks so people are

950
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:18,040
investing as a group in getting better

951
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:21,960
and you see what happens it frees up the

952
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:24,040
T the time that creatives need to be

953
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:26,440
creative all the stuff they hate they

954
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:29,119
don't have to do they can't see

955
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:30,720
themselves going back to the old way so

956
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:32,440
what they did they were very careful

957
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,200
about helping people understand how this

958
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:37,119
can be good for them not just bad for

959
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:38,760
them they involved them in that process

960
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:40,359
and that's how they they they avoided

961
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:44,079
the rejection and they get better with

962
00:37:40,359 --> 00:37:46,480
this in coding in your marketing people

963
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:48,960
in many places you will customer service

964
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:51,160
you will have this thing going on a lot

965
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,160
of

966
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:55,119
fear we've done a thing called the

967
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:56,960
global opportunity Forum where we are

968
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:58,000
getting companies talking to companies

969
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,319
about career

970
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,920
questions how are you developing your

971
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:04,599
people what are skills that you need

972
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:06,680
what's the best way that you can do to

973
00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:08,880
help your people grow with you instead

974
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:10,520
of being afraid as you grow and so if

975
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,160
you're interested contact me about how

976
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:15,359
to how how we are getting companies

977
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:17,560
together to think through this

978
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:19,760
challenge so that's that you ready for

979
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:22,200
the last part of this

980
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:25,599
talk we talked first of all about types

981
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:27,280
of AI four types and if you have a

982
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:29,720
particular problem how do you decide on

983
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:32,160
the right type and I gave you questions

984
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:35,319
you can ask then we talked about having

985
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:38,079
your company be have the capability to

986
00:38:35,319 --> 00:38:39,960
use this well to transform in a better

987
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:42,119
way and questions you can ask there

988
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:44,720
about culture and helping your people be

989
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:45,480
ready so we just completed a study it's

990
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:49,280
coming

991
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:50,839
out tomorrow in Sloan management review

992
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,720
about how are company's looking at

993
00:38:50,839 --> 00:38:55,359
transformation with generative Ai and we

994
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:57,560
were looking for these giant

995
00:38:55,359 --> 00:39:00,560
Transformations let's change the entire

996
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:02,599
underwriting process in a firm or let's

997
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:05,680
turn over all of our

998
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:09,400
sales and customer service to a

999
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:12,680
computer we didn't find those but we did

1000
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:14,520
find a lot of smaller Transformations

1001
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:17,480
happening that people are starting to

1002
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:18,640
get a lot of value from this and setting

1003
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:21,520
themselves up for the bigger

1004
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:22,560
transformation over time so what we do

1005
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,880
is if you think about the big

1006
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:27,920
Transformations as being transformation

1007
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:29,280
with a big capital t

1008
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,000
what we found is that companies doing

1009
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,839
are doing a lot of transformation with a

1010
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,680
litty smaller Transformations but

1011
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:39,000
they're doing it in a systematic way

1012
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:40,760
that is helping them get ready okay and

1013
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:45,240
it looks like

1014
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:47,160
this level one is most companies already

1015
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:50,640
are thinking about individual

1016
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:54,119
productivity here is a version of the

1017
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:56,880
llm that is safe to use or here's our

1018
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:59,160
own private version right McKenzie for

1019
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,800
example has an llm that looks across all

1020
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:03,520
of their slide

1021
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:05,800
decks and it's not perfect but if you

1022
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:08,319
need to know about energy generation in

1023
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:10,480
Southeast Asia McKenzie probably did

1024
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:13,359
this once before and it can help to

1025
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:14,760
answer some questions for you okay so

1026
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:15,880
not only the public things but the

1027
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,400
private things they're starting to do

1028
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:20,359
from the individual productivity

1029
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:23,079
standpoint very low risk they're just

1030
00:40:20,359 --> 00:40:25,720
informing people it's a good way to get

1031
00:40:23,079 --> 00:40:27,319
started okay number two is to specialize

1032
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,680
roles and tasks let's start to transform

1033
00:40:27,319 --> 00:40:31,880
form that so we're seeing it in call

1034
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:33,599
centers a lot we're seeing it in coding

1035
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:35,720
we're seeing it in some other things

1036
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:38,240
typically a human still stays in the

1037
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:40,319
loop but sometimes for low-risk

1038
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:42,880
things they're letting the computer take

1039
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:45,640
over okay like at lemonade right

1040
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:48,119
lemonade is 50% of things get processed

1041
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:50,240
automatically 50% they the the more

1042
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:52,319
risky things they take up and so that's

1043
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:54,280
starting to happen and then then what

1044
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:56,520
we're we're not seeing as much of except

1045
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:59,599
in technology companies is actually

1046
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:01,240
doing the Direct Customer impact okay so

1047
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:04,280
how do we think about this in the first

1048
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:06,760
level individual productivity summarize

1049
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:09,160
these documents uh many many banks I

1050
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:10,680
know that the minute a company releases

1051
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:13,040
its

1052
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:15,800
financials a minute later five minutes

1053
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:17,800
later all the spreadsheets are

1054
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:19,560
updated you you had to have a lot of

1055
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,800
interns that did that before now it just

1056
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:23,359
happens right these kinds of things

1057
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,079
could happen sum well sorry that that's

1058
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:26,280
the next piece but summarizing documents

1059
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:28,240
hey what what just happened at my

1060
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:30,680
meeting right and in the company

1061
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:33,319
specific llms the opportunities in the

1062
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:35,319
tasks are like that one can we make

1063
00:41:33,319 --> 00:41:37,599
sense of the the latest quarterly report

1064
00:41:35,319 --> 00:41:39,359
for financials um can we think about

1065
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:42,760
customer support that's human in the

1066
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:44,319
loop right they tend to be lower risk

1067
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:46,960
and you keep the human in the loop to

1068
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:49,400
help mediate that risk even

1069
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:51,599
more and last but not least we're seeing

1070
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:53,520
this farther thing the direct engagement

1071
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:56,560
and we're seeing this in online right

1072
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:58,000
now uh the people that make coach and

1073
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:00,319
Kate Spade

1074
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,160
things things that only this big but

1075
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:04,839
they cost a lot of money right um

1076
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:06,960
they're personalizing a very

1077
00:42:04,839 --> 00:42:08,200
conversational approach to help you just

1078
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,760
as if you went in the store and that

1079
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:11,680
person would make you buy that handbag

1080
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:14,280
that pays that you charge too much money

1081
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:17,520
for now online they can start to do the

1082
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:19,839
same thing relatively low risk those

1083
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:22,280
kinds of things are starting to happen

1084
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:24,359
um and also the idea of doing the first

1085
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:26,680
or second tier of customer service and

1086
00:42:24,359 --> 00:42:28,720
then these are happening right the

1087
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:30,800
product companies are already doing it

1088
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:32,640
because they have to right what we're

1089
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,160
seeing less of is this bottom thing

1090
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:37,480
transformation of

1091
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:39,079
large processes what will happen from

1092
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:41,520
what we're hearing is that you're not

1093
00:42:39,079 --> 00:42:42,319
going to get geni replaced in the hole

1094
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,960
but

1095
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:47,359
combinations will do it gen will have a

1096
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:49,800
part so many companies we already have

1097
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:53,040
them the forms that you give generative

1098
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:55,920
AI will translate that into into Data

1099
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:57,960
that the rest of the processes can use

1100
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:59,920
and then it will translate it back into

1101
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:02,520
conversational later you'll see these

1102
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:04,000
combinations happening more and more

1103
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:05,599
okay so you want to think about the

1104
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,880
risks and the capabilities What's

1105
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:11,800
Happening Here we call this the risk

1106
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:13,680
slope how as you grow you grow your risk

1107
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:16,319
management capability but you all also

1108
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:20,319
grow your capability to do more and more

1109
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:22,760
bigger things over time okay here's the

1110
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:24,920
reason why this is so

1111
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:26,839
important the proofs of concept it's

1112
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:29,000
easy to do them but making it work at a

1113
00:43:26,839 --> 00:43:31,079
large group of users or

1114
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,440
customers getting from the lab to

1115
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:35,559
reality is really hard and in fact in a

1116
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:38,000
large bank she said The more stuff you

1117
00:43:35,559 --> 00:43:39,960
do the more stuff you find to do she did

1118
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,359
not mean more features we can build she

1119
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:43,359
meant more errors we have to

1120
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:48,800
solve and what one way to think about it

1121
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:50,599
is H&M the fashion company it's almost

1122
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:53,079
like putting a tire on a car how many of

1123
00:43:50,599 --> 00:43:56,040
you have changed the tire on your

1124
00:43:53,079 --> 00:43:57,559
car not many people well if you've ever

1125
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:59,760
changed the tire you know that you do

1126
00:43:57,559 --> 00:44:01,319
not put all put a bolt on really hard

1127
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,400
and another one because you will bend

1128
00:44:01,319 --> 00:44:04,680
the tire you'll bend the rim put a

1129
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:06,599
little bit a little bit a little bit a

1130
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:08,359
little bit okay that's how you want to

1131
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:10,920
think about your AI capability in your

1132
00:44:08,359 --> 00:44:13,920
companies do it here learn from there

1133
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:16,680
for the next thing the next thing okay

1134
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:18,559
so what's the conclusion I just gave you

1135
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:22,480
a lot of

1136
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:24,359
stuff but that's okay this is MIT right

1137
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:28,400
you're smart

1138
00:44:24,359 --> 00:44:30,839
people um AI can seem to be intelligent

1139
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:33,760
but be intelligent in how you use it but

1140
00:44:30,839 --> 00:44:35,480
remember just because it's not perfect

1141
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:38,240
that doesn't mean it's

1142
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:40,559
bad your people also make

1143
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:42,240
errors put the right processes right

1144
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:44,520
controls to deal with the fact that

1145
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:46,440
people are sometimes wrong okay number

1146
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:48,200
two start with the problem not the

1147
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:50,680
technology and many times the answer

1148
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:52,280
will be combinations not just one of

1149
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:56,760
these you look at the task that needs to

1150
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:57,760
be done number three get started now

1151
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:59,920
because because if you're going to put

1152
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:03,040
that tire on your car little bits you

1153
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:04,280
work up the growth slope the risk slope

1154
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:07,319
and every time you do something you

1155
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:10,440
learn more to be better at

1156
00:45:07,319 --> 00:45:13,160
it you got to help your people be

1157
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:14,760
ready because if they're not ready they

1158
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:17,040
will fight you and they will fight you

1159
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:18,839
either very actively or more likely

1160
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:21,880
they'll just say oh that's hard I don't

1161
00:45:18,839 --> 00:45:24,079
know what to do right those of you who

1162
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:26,400
have te teenagers you know they do both

1163
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:28,599
right so um and last but not least

1164
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:30,920
continuous improveed what can you do

1165
00:45:28,599 --> 00:45:33,119
with small T Transformations that will

1166
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:37,280
help the large te Transformations later

1167
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:39,720
on okay so I have exactly 10 seconds

1168
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:41,440
left so I'm going to ask for questions

1169
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:43,079
even though I'm not allowed to so let's

1170
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:45,319
take a few questions but I won't go too

1171
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:47,280
far over okay can we do some

1172
00:45:45,319 --> 00:45:48,680
questions so by the way lots of good

1173
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:51,880
reading if you want it including the new

1174
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:51,880
article so thank you very

1175
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:57,040
much what should we do with questions

1176
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,800
ah they're up

1177
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:05,160
here I don't get to choose the question

1178
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:06,720
this is scary um or just pushing

1179
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:08,440
everyone to use AI even the blueco

1180
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:10,240
collar workers is this the right move is

1181
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:11,599
it necessary for everybody the

1182
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:14,559
interesting question thing that you said

1183
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:17,760
in there is they're pushing

1184
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:18,960
everyone how can you encourage everyone

1185
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:22,280
you see the

1186
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:23,599
difference if I say you have to do this

1187
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,960
half the people are going to say you

1188
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:27,440
can't tell me what to

1189
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:28,720
do if you say hey this is a fun set of

1190
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:30,480
tools that's try to help you think

1191
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:32,760
through it they might be a little bit

1192
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:35,359
more interested so what I suggest is

1193
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:37,200
have encourage everybody to do it and

1194
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:38,920
you might learn something and if you

1195
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:40,520
encourage everybody to do it they might

1196
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:43,839
actually suggest some Innovations and

1197
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:46,079
fight this a little bit more okay what's

1198
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:48,200
another question there we go um many of

1199
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:51,640
our works revolve around achieving

1200
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:54,800
efficiency and optimization when AI

1201
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:56,559
can when AI can do that better what

1202
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,599
would be the F focus of humans work so

1203
00:46:56,559 --> 00:47:00,559
certain we had the the work of the

1204
00:46:58,599 --> 00:47:02,480
future initiative Ben's going to talk

1205
00:47:00,559 --> 00:47:05,319
about this more also after lunch some

1206
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:07,359
really fascinating things but there I'm

1207
00:47:05,319 --> 00:47:10,599
convinced there will be plenty for

1208
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:11,920
people to do and in an Ideal World you

1209
00:47:10,599 --> 00:47:14,720
take all the boring

1210
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:17,599
stuff let the computers do that and you

1211
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:19,720
let the people do more interesting stuff

1212
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:21,480
now that's an ideal world but can we get

1213
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:24,359
closer if you think way automation has

1214
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:27,119
worked all over time it has always taken

1215
00:47:24,359 --> 00:47:29,119
the routine work but there's still been

1216
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:30,880
a role for humans and when you look at

1217
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:33,040
the way Advanced manufacturing works you

1218
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,400
still have people in there they're just

1219
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,920
not doing the really boring stuff

1220
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:39,079
anymore right so I think there will be a

1221
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:41,160
role for humans and the tricky part is

1222
00:47:39,079 --> 00:47:43,319
trying to figure out how to introduce

1223
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:46,800
the right things in the right way and to

1224
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:49,720
engage your people in the

1225
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,920
process um the global opportunity Forum

1226
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:54,280
we're talking about is another

1227
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:56,960
opportunity there next up how do you

1228
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:59,800
balance creativity with and without AI

1229
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:02,760
what are the advantages

1230
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:04,960
disadvantages of flexing ideas I don't

1231
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:08,040
see any disadvantage actually I do see a

1232
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:09,280
disadvantage I do it all the time what

1233
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:11,520
are some creative ways to think about

1234
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:13,319
this you can always ignore it but what

1235
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:15,640
would I do without the computer I would

1236
00:48:13,319 --> 00:48:18,480
go to a couple friends what's a creative

1237
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:21,040
way to think about this okay so I don't

1238
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:25,000
see a problem with helping the computer

1239
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:27,400
be more helping the only challenge is

1240
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:30,240
sometimes you start down a route and you

1241
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:32,040
get stuck in that route so just as if

1242
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,640
you're talking to people when you're

1243
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:35,040
talking with the computer be ready to

1244
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:37,839
back out of that route and try a

1245
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:39,319
different thing you know you can get

1246
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:43,119
uncreative because you get stuck in a

1247
00:48:39,319 --> 00:48:44,880
certain path okay um but absolutely Flex

1248
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:48,040
the ideas all you can you don't have to

1249
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:49,839
accept those ideas uh how can we prepare

1250
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:52,720
young people for a job 15 years from now

1251
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:54,280
that might not exist due to AI anymore

1252
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:56,400
hopefully if you are training sorry let

1253
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:58,920
me say that differently certain people

1254
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:01,160
you train to do a job right we have

1255
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:03,359
vocational training all over the place

1256
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:05,319
you train them for that job because they

1257
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:07,280
nobody should expect that you start a

1258
00:49:05,319 --> 00:49:08,160
job now and it will be the same job in

1259
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:11,160
15

1260
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:14,079
years now there are some you know my my

1261
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:15,359
mom was a school teacher 15 years later

1262
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:17,839
she was still a school teacher but she

1263
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:18,760
was teaching differently uh my uncle was

1264
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:21,400
a

1265
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:22,880
fireman 15 years later he was still a

1266
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:26,280
fireman but there were new tools he had

1267
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:27,480
to learn to use okay you should so you

1268
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:28,880
train people people for the job if

1269
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:31,559
you're training them for a job but they

1270
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:33,280
should also get the ability to learn

1271
00:49:31,559 --> 00:49:34,559
they should gain the Comfort the growth

1272
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:37,480
mindset to get things and you should

1273
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:39,440
always train that okay as far as

1274
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:43,920
training people for what will the good

1275
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:47,119
things be um creativity working with

1276
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:49,200
people critical

1277
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:51,200
thinking these don't seem to be going

1278
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,319
out of style this this generative AI

1279
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:54,200
stuff those don't seem to be going out

1280
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:56,799
of style for a while right actually

1281
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:58,599
writing those emails maybe but knowing

1282
00:49:56,799 --> 00:50:00,839
how to tune those emails to be the right

1283
00:49:58,599 --> 00:50:02,280
kind of interaction with people AI will

1284
00:50:00,839 --> 00:50:03,960
help but those things will happen so

1285
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:06,000
what I I call these human skills and we

1286
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:08,040
have a framework we call the MIT human

1287
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,079
the the in in when I was in open

1288
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:12,240
learning the human skills framework

1289
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:13,000
right and that framework we think about

1290
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:16,400
how

1291
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:19,680
I think how I work with others how I

1292
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:21,319
manage myself how I lead others those

1293
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:23,760
skills are probably not going to go away

1294
00:50:21,319 --> 00:50:25,720
and so how can you get those in college

1295
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:27,359
how can you get those in high school

1296
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:30,240
teamwork

1297
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:33,160
writing and communicating leading things

1298
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:34,839
even when you're 12 years old okay okay

1299
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:36,359
I think that's the end of my time so I

1300
00:50:34,839 --> 00:50:40,880
want to thank you and I'll be bring

1301
00:50:36,359 --> 00:50:40,880
around at lunch if you want to talk bye
