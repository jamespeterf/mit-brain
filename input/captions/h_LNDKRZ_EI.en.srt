1
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,000
Next we have uh someone very famous. I'm

2
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,359
going to talk him up. He's my former

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,240
boss egg and he's going to present on

4
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,960
Penn South.

5
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,359
>> Thank you. I've got a lapel also. Thank

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,559
you, Nick. And as a matter of fact, Nick

7
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,399
will probably uh recognize some of the

8
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:37,920
beginning of my presentation here

9
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:41,680
because he was involved in one of the

10
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,440
first presentations we did on the Penn

11
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,440
South community. As a matter of fact,

12
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:49,440
was involved in the design and did some

13
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:52,399
of this 3D modeling. And uh I got to

14
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,600
drop back just a little bit. Um both

15
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:59,600
Carrie who was on remotely

16
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:02,399
uh Carrie first of all sits on the IATMO

17
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,040
uniform mechanical code technical

18
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:09,439
committee. In other words, we write

19
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:13,920
approve and submit the final codes and

20
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:17,119
there is a a geothermal code as of 2024

21
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,240
and as of 2027 there will be a thermal

22
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:24,799
energy network code. Interestingly

23
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:27,040
enough, Mark Mezner C448 is a basis that

24
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:30,000
we use for a design. So, a lot of that

25
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:33,360
is being adopted perhaps uh completely.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,560
So, we have so many players in here and

27
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,640
I can honestly say everybody in here has

28
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,600
had a great deal to do with what we're

29
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:46,159
going to talk about now. Uh now, first

30
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:47,920
of all, this is part of uh pawn

31
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,920
4614

32
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,920
NAERTA. That's a public opportunity

33
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,079
notice. Now, what they do is they put

34
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,280
out put these things out and they say,

35
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:59,840
"We got a problem. Can you come up with

36
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,399
a solution?" And if we come up with a

37
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,399
good solution or a problem to fit a

38
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,880
solution and this was for thermal energy

39
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:11,120
networks, they award us funding for

40
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:14,400
this. So, uh, this one started in 2021.

41
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,239
Actually, Penn South hired Egg Geo

42
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:21,120
before that because they wanted to

43
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:24,480
convert their campus to um geothermal.

44
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,480
And the reason why is because they had,

45
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,720
let me jump back and make sure I didn't

46
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:32,080
Yeah, it'll cover it in a minute. They

47
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,360
had this 5 megawatt boiler and in

48
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:38,080
addition to that, they generate their

49
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:40,000
own electricity. And so local law uh 91

50
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:44,000
told them if they didn't fix their

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,680
carbon emissions by xy year, which keeps

52
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,160
getting extended, they would get fined

53
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,040
millions of dollars a year. So New York

54
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,680
City is one of those cities that you you

55
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:56,000
hear about the carrot, you know, the way

56
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,560
to get people to do things. They've got

57
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,640
the stick. If you have too many carbon

58
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,800
emissions, you will get fined millions

59
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,360
of dollars a year. So they hired us.

60
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,800
They're pretty affluent. uh community,

61
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:12,080
152tory buildings covering five blocks

62
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:15,280
in downtown Manhattan, home to 2500

63
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,360
families. And they have an 18,800 ton

64
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,080
central chiller plant. You can see the

65
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:23,200
cooling tower there and a 5 megawatt

66
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,360
central boiler. And sorry about the

67
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,239
overlap here that happens sometimes in

68
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:31,120
these, so just look through it. Um,

69
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:33,519
local law 38, local law 97. I won't go

70
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,760
into the details of it, but they needed

71
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,640
to get compliant on these. So, they

72
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,560
hired us and then Nick, when Nick was

73
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,560
working with us, we put in an

74
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,879
application for this pond and we were

75
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:50,879
awarded this pawn. So, we began to study

76
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:53,840
how we could take this community off of

77
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:56,560
these boilers and stop the emissions.

78
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,239
There is a New York City tool and I keep

79
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,720
hearing about this with regard to bore

80
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:04,000
holes and Brock, you probably know this.

81
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,239
You can go on to a tool online and if

82
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
you were to look at the details on these

83
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,239
graphs on the right, it shows you how

84
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,480
many bore holes you need to drill, what

85
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,640
the thermal capacity is under the

86
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,799
footprint of that to do a closed loop

87
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:20,799
system. So, the first thing we did is

88
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:23,440
studied that and we got the entire uh

89
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:25,520
community involved with that. But then

90
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,199
we really started looking at this and

91
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:32,000
this was not easy. This alone took Nick,

92
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,960
our operations manager, Justin, uh

93
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,960
myself, my wife used to work with us as

94
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:41,280
our marketing director, and it we put on

95
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,280
our combat boots and we went out and we

96
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,240
beat on doors because we wanted to find

97
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:50,160
out where to get the energy to do that 5

98
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:52,800
megawatt load. Well, as it turns out,

99
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:56,400
this is the US Postal Service across the

100
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,880
street and we worked with uh couple of

101
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,960
the um well with first we tried to get

102
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,120
with the federal government and then we

103
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,440
found out we could use a local property

104
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,280
management company but we got the data

105
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,960
on it and they have about 8 megawatts of

106
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,840
thermal rejection through their cooling

107
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,280
towers. So we said, "Aha, there may and

108
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,880
it's they have data centers and

109
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,919
equipment. So they may have it all year

110
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:21,600
round." And this particular center uses

111
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:24,160
this orange building. This is the um

112
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,000
this is the physical plant, the chiller

113
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,479
plant and heating where it provides all

114
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,479
the heating for all these buildings. And

115
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:34,800
we said, well, if we could get this

116
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:36,479
energy over here, we could maybe even do

117
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,199
the whole thing without a single bore

118
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,960
hole. And kind of like what Carrie said

119
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,199
earlier, you know, that's the whole

120
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,800
point of this. So, we said, "Yeah, let's

121
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,800
go ahead and look at that." And we went

122
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,120
forward with that. And then we start put

123
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,520
on our combat boots and we went out and

124
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,360
we talked to the State University of New

125
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,000
York. We talked to the public school

126
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,720
over here. We've even got Penn Station

127
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
involved now. We're almost all the way

128
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:04,160
to uh to the to the Hudson River at this

129
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,080
point. We may even be able to tap into

130
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:10,000
that by the time we're done. At any

131
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,840
rate, we went to work on this and uh one

132
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,440
of the things you'll you'll know and

133
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,800
this is the biggest concern we always

134
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:19,680
hear about to go underneath the streets

135
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:23,280
of New York is a freaking nightmare.

136
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:25,759
This this when when Nick was there when

137
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,000
we presented to KED because KED did a

138
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:32,000
lot like Eversource did here. They were

139
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,240
directed by the PSC to do these thermal

140
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
energy networks. Well, you want to take

141
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:40,800
any kind of a guess how much this is

142
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,319
going to cost? Try almost a quarter

143
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,240
billion dollars. Okay. So, we went to

144
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,720
Coned and they said if you can get it

145
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,800
down to 90 million, you can have it. We

146
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,319
walked because we weren't going to go

147
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,039
cheap and we weren't done with our

148
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,280
study. We just said no. And Penn South

149
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:59,360
said we'll do whatever you want to. So,

150
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,560
we walked and we're finding ways to

151
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:05,199
reduce that cost now. Meanwhile, Coned's

152
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,960
doing great work. I mean, Greg Mullis

153
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,400
and the whole team over there. But we

154
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,919
wanted to do this. And part of what a

155
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:14,479
nice study does is this. This is very

156
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:16,240
important. Nothing moves fast with

157
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,319
government. You've heard that except I

158
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,800
got to take it back with Eversource and

159
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,400
heat. It just boom. Before I even knew

160
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,240
what happened, it was done over here in

161
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,800
Frammingham. I can't wait to see that a

162
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:30,560
week from Saturday after the GR

163
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:33,199
conference. But for us, we were just

164
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,199
like, "No, we want to get through this."

165
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,759
Plus, Sue Doherty over at Nightert is

166
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:40,560
our project manager. And for every

167
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,919
problem, they ask a hundred questions.

168
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,840
They said, "Well, how are you going to

169
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,000
deal with that? How?" Because they don't

170
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,360
fund this so that somebody can get

171
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,240
something for free. Why do you think

172
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,560
they fund it? So we can clear a path for

173
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,199
others to do it. And that's exactly what

174
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:58,240
we're doing. So the amount of paperwork

175
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:02,080
we do to tread the way for others to

176
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:04,720
follow is monstrous. Our uh our hat hats

177
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,400
off to our engineers and so forth. So we

178
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,160
move forward. They did this is a

179
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:12,000
actually from earlier this month. They

180
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:14,400
turned in task five. We had to model it

181
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,560
without

182
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,400
the post office because what if the post

183
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,280
office decides to move? they're just

184
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,199
renting the building after all from and

185
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,720
what if we don't have that 8 megawatt.

186
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,360
So we really had to look at it's kind of

187
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,280
like the backup boiler scenario. So our

188
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,520
guys really started looking at it and

189
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,719
they said, "Okay, here's where we can

190
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:38,000
put the closed loop, but we'd have to do

191
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:40,880
the advanced boring solution like they

192
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,399
did in Frammingham." And so that's

193
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:47,279
expensive. But we have other

194
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:50,160
technologies and that involves aquafer

195
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:53,920
coupled. And by the way, this particular

196
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:58,000
part of Manhattan has a very robust

197
00:08:53,920 --> 00:09:00,480
glacial till aquifer. So we we checked

198
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,720
that. We got involved with it. We looked

199
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,800
at what's called invective flow. If

200
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,320
you've listened to a lot of what we're

201
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:11,040
talking about doing these flow studies

202
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,279
shows how fast when we're extracting

203
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,720
heat or rejecting heat, it can be

204
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:18,880
restored. Plus, we have to show thermal

205
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,320
influence to the neighboring properties

206
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,920
because in New York, they want to know

207
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,800
what you're doing to everybody's

208
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,800
property. So each of these models as

209
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:30,160
Nick will tell you or any scientist can

210
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:32,320
take eight to 16 even 40 hours. But we

211
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,000
get through this and we look at the

212
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:38,080
bottom line is we get a thermal

213
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,600
influence over 25 years. And I think

214
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,680
that's the way we're going to go. We're

215
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,959
going to go with uh four doulets and

216
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,800
we're going to be able to handle the

217
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:48,000
peak. We're still going to need some

218
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:50,720
boilers and so forth, but this is um the

219
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,920
Penn South Underground utilities. This

220
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:56,000
is how it's going to be piped. Uh, and

221
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:59,760
this is what it looks like. That you've

222
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,959
heard a lot about from Carrie about um

223
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,959
single. These are the singular loops and

224
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,640
then there's a transportation loop where

225
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,480
they can all as a matter of fact right

226
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,040
here in Frammingham they have those two

227
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,440
loops. They'll be able to shed or add

228
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:16,079
load one to another. All of these

229
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,000
individual loops here will be able to

230
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,839
share energy with one another. And this

231
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,399
is just a picture of the big what we

232
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,560
call the transportation loop. What is it

233
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,800
transporting? It's transporting energy.

234
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,920
It's like

235
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:33,360
it's like the grid when you take a big

236
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:36,959
load from maybe in Texas they need extra

237
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:39,040
electricity and you can get it from

238
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,640
maybe Arizona or something like that in

239
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,440
a much smaller way. That's the way it

240
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:46,680
works. And that is my presentation.

241
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,680
Thank you everybody.
