00:00:00,062 --> 00:00:01,056
Hello

2
00:00:01,187 --> 00:00:02,682
my name is Maria Valeria

3
00:00:02,916 --> 00:00:05,421
and I am honored to
share my journey with you

4
00:00:06,218 --> 00:00:08,281
I was born and
raised in Venezuela

5
00:00:08,437 --> 00:00:10,515
a country rich in resources

6
00:00:10,562 --> 00:00:11,750
and resilient people

7
00:00:12,234 --> 00:00:14,625
However, the past 24 years

8
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:18,578
have brought deep political,
economic, and social challenges

9
00:00:19,216 --> 00:00:21,216
Leading to my forced migration

10
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,937
and leaving behind my family

11
00:00:22,962 --> 00:00:25,264
and career as an agricultural engineer

12
00:00:26,468 --> 00:00:28,037
In 2018

13
00:00:28,062 --> 00:00:29,312
I moved to Uruguay

14
00:00:29,336 --> 00:00:30,562
But first

15
00:00:30,587 --> 00:00:32,375
I spent six months in Colombia

16
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,468
working informal jobs to save money

17
00:00:35,218 --> 00:00:37,125
Upon arriving in Uruguay

18
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:39,646
I had to start over, with manual jobs

19
00:00:39,671 --> 00:00:42,484
despite quickly obtaining legal status

20
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:45,437
Determined to rebuild my career

21
00:00:45,703 --> 00:00:47,578
and be able to help my family

22
00:00:47,828 --> 00:00:50,187
I enrolled in the MIT ReACT program

23
00:00:50,983 --> 00:00:52,937
which transformed my life completely

24
00:00:54,062 --> 00:00:55,906
With basic English skills

25
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:57,593
but strong determination

26
00:00:57,618 --> 00:01:01,443
I earned a certificate in Data
Science and Computing from MIT

27
00:01:01,983 --> 00:01:05,375
And I improved my English
through

28
00:01:06,126 --> 00:01:08,932
After a year of persistent applications

29
00:01:09,218 --> 00:01:13,932
I secured a position as an analyst
in a major software company

30
00:01:14,811 --> 00:01:15,781
So I did it

31
00:01:15,806 --> 00:01:17,109
I started my new path

32
00:01:18,151 --> 00:01:19,973
What motivates me at work

33
00:01:19,998 --> 00:01:22,578
is the opportunity to
learn and grow continually

34
00:01:23,229 --> 00:01:26,484
I value a supportive
and inclusive environment

35
00:01:26,509 --> 00:01:30,338
where teamwork and personal
development are encouraged

36
00:01:31,108 --> 00:01:35,182
Working online with international
organizations can be challenging

37
00:01:35,207 --> 00:01:37,318
due to the difference in regulations

38
00:01:37,343 --> 00:01:38,098
time zones

39
00:01:38,123 --> 00:01:39,843
and communication styles

40
00:01:40,286 --> 00:01:41,197
My advice?

41
00:01:41,222 --> 00:01:42,937
Is to stay organized

42
00:01:42,962 --> 00:01:43,890
be proactive

43
00:01:43,915 --> 00:01:45,718
and seek support networks

44
00:01:46,381 --> 00:01:51,437
To shift mindsets about the positions
displaced individuals should occupy

45
00:01:51,828 --> 00:01:56,437
it's crucial to recognize and promote
our diverse skills and perspectives

46
00:01:57,055 --> 00:02:00,375
Companies need to see
us as a valuable asset

47
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,468
This includes adopting
inclusive hiring practices

48
00:02:04,493 --> 00:02:07,046
and providing opportunities
for career growth

49
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,468
So thank you for listening to my story

50
00:02:10,744 --> 00:02:13,093
and for being part of this
important conversation

51
00:02:13,118 --> 00:02:15,671
at the Migration Summit 2024
