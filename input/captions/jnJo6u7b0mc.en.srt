1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,600
yes so we are delineate uh we are

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,240
transforming information overload into

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:11,400
insights for

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:14,920
biofarma um and uh I am the co-founder

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,640
and CEO and I was also an MIT PhD

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:20,760
candidate in biological

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:24,640
engineering oh my slides are

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:26,439
stuck okay there we go um so I also have

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,439
about 7even years experience Building

10
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:30,759
Systems pharmacology models uh for

11
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:33,120
companies like fiser and AST zica so

12
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:35,840
help them design their clinical trials

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,200
um optimize doses things like that I'm

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,000
joined in this endeavor with my

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,640
co-founder Jo ibal who is an expert in

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,200
digital transformation software

17
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,039
Solutions primarily in the Aerospace

18
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:49,440
industry um and delinia is a growing

19
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,239
team of about 20 engineers and

20
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,600
researchers focused on applying AI to

21
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:57,199
accelerate analysis workflows uh

22
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,960
primarily in biopharma and currently

23
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:02,039
we're going through the Y combinator uh

24
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,600
ACC program we're coming up to the end

25
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,080
of the batch so we're in San Francisco

26
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,799
right

27
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,799
now so you know the computational

28
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:14,280
analysis workflow is still really

29
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:17,280
scattered um depending on the industry

30
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:20,280
it can require a lot of manual effort to

31
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,360
digitize and structure information into

32
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:26,600
data sets that align with internal

33
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,640
processes specialty software or

34
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,600
guarantee the kind of high accuracy you

35
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,759
need in a domain like bio PHA so even

36
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,200
with large language models things like

37
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:40,560
deep research still PhD scientists are

38
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,119
doing this type of work manually um so

39
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,200
for example uh some of the customers we

40
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:48,159
work with in large Pharma they have

41
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:51,040
teams of scientists um spending months

42
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,520
to create a single data set um so we

43
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,039
want to accelerate that take away that

44
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,240
manual effort so they can focus on the

45
00:01:56,039 --> 00:02:02,520
science so our platform processes really

46
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:05,280
any source and structures it to create

47
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:08,399
quality controlled data sets um as well

48
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:11,599
as performing some an automated analysis

49
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:14,239
on top of that data um so we can process

50
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,440
things like research papers we also

51
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:19,519
pretty uniquely get out the numerical

52
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,640
data from plots and graphs so a lot of

53
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:24,640
the scientific information that exists

54
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:26,239
out in the world is kind of Trapped

55
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,160
Behind These plots and graphs and we

56
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:32,400
have a custom model to get that data out

57
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:34,319
um so we use custom computer vision but

58
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,879
also all the state-of-the-art large

59
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:41,280
language models to extract this data we

60
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:44,400
also have a human QC team they're all

61
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,680
trained um in the biof fora domain to

62
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,640
ensure that everything is 100% accurate

63
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,120
um and then we have some co-pilot

64
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:54,720
assisted analysis um to help the

65
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,760
scientists in getting that data in the

66
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,800
right format or making a decision using

67
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,080
that

68
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:03,799
data um as a case study we helped a top

69
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,920
Pharma company create a small molecules

70
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:09,480
database this database was used to train

71
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:11,720
an AI model that ultimately helped them

72
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,680
reduce animal testing pretty

73
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:16,200
significantly um so we helped them

74
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,799
extract data from about 900 research

75
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,720
papers um we used our computer vision

76
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:23,480
methods to get out that precise

77
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,760
numerical data from graphs like this um

78
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:28,400
some of them were even more confusing to

79
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,280
look at because they were from papers

80
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,120
from even the' 70s and stuff when they

81
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,040
were just

82
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,720
scans um but then we combin that with a

83
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,480
contextual understanding of really how

84
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:41,120
that data was collected so what was the

85
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:44,000
experiment done um what was the compound

86
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:47,640
that was used um a lot of detail and

87
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,480
constructed a 23,000 data point data set

88
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:51,680
for them to um Plug and Play into their

89
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,959
AI

90
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,280
model and so there's a couple of things

91
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:58,720
that make us really unique um one is

92
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:02,239
that were fit for purpose so just from a

93
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:05,840
semantic description of your goal um you

94
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:08,640
can find the papers that um align with

95
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,959
that and then extract that very specific

96
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:14,239
numerical information out um so plots

97
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:17,120
and figures is another one of our unique

98
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:19,440
uh advantages and then we structure the

99
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,079
data and clean it across all of these

100
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,040
different sources so that it meets um

101
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,160
certain requirements and then the

102
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,880
structuring is aligned with internal

103
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:33,759
processes or specialty software um so

104
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:36,320
it's really um you know easy for them to

105
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,080
continue their workflow and they don't

106
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,000
have to change the software that they

107
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:44,600
use to do the analysis they don't have

108
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,600
to change um their processes it's all

109
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,560
aligned um so we've made a lot of

110
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:51,919
progress uh up to this point so we have

111
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,240
data service contracts with uh two large

112
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,400
Pharma companies um we're going to be

113
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,840
acknowledging some of their Publications

114
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,720
um we are a preferred vendor of data

115
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:04,280
sets for one top Fara company um and as

116
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,800
I mentioned we uh were lucky to receive

117
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:09,880
the early acceptance to y combinators

118
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,400
winter 2025 batch um which we're uh

119
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:14,560
finishing up right now and we're really

120
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,880
looking to partner with biofarma

121
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,160
companies especially those that have

122
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,560
needs related to Data Mining and

123
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,479
structuring of complex information

124
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:25,440
especially when the workflow around it

125
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:28,039
and the software is also uh kind of

126
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:31,520
complicated so please reach out

127
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:33,840
thanks Emily great thank you so much um

128
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,360
so you're obviously first focused on

129
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,039
biofarma but um can you tell us if this

130
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:42,240
can be applied also to maybe a few other

131
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:44,800
areas yes absolutely um we definitely

132
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,080
believe it's flexible um we are also

133
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,400
working with people in the process

134
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:52,520
engineering space um they have similar

135
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:57,120
problems um and uh yeah definitely this

136
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:58,360
is flexible to this great and also um

137
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,960
for companies that have developed

138
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:03,639
internal large Lang language models

139
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:07,080
Solutions um is there flexibility to

140
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:09,000
integrate um this as well yeah that's a

141
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:11,880
that's a great question so definitely

142
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,960
especially the module that gets out the

143
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:18,120
numerical data from plots and graphs um

144
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:21,560
I suspect that is a problem that other

145
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:24,039
um Industries face but currently there's

146
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:27,160
no AI solution to do that and that could

147
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:29,919
be a standalone module so um definitely

148
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:33,199
uh we could explore that than thank you

149
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,199
so much emilys
