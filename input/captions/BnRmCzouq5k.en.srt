1
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:08,320
All right, I think we are ready for this

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,960
first session. My name is Dontis. I'm

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:16,080
from Mos University and I'm also a part

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:17,840
of the NF NF um center and uh I'm

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,880
chairing this session and I have been

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:24,000
really looking forward to uh to hearing

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:27,680
uh these three speakers and the session

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,000
is on scaling variant interpretation and

9
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:34,480
the first speaker is Ruth Lo and Ruth is

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,239
um professor at the Novonics Foundation

11
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,960
Center for Metabolic uh re research at

12
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,800
the University of Copenhagen and the No

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,280
Foundation Center for Genomic Mechanisms

14
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,760
of Disease at Broad Institute. So,

15
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,520
welcome Ruth.

16
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,640
>> Uh good morning. Thank you so much for

17
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,199
having me and thank you for the

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,960
introduction Dita. My talk is on the

19
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,480
genetics of obesity and more

20
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,199
specifically and how we actually

21
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,760
shouldn't curate uh our phenotype in

22
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:05,280
this case obesity to to get to the next

23
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:07,680
level of uh of uh variant to function

24
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,159
translation.

25
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,760
So very briefly, my disclosures have no

26
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:16,320
effect on anything I tell you. So no no

27
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,240
secrets here. Obesity is a traditional

28
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,080
common disease just like type 2

29
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,560
diabetes, cardiovascular disease. The

30
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,439
environment has an important impact over

31
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,320
the past 30 40 years. Uh the prevalence

32
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,560
of obesity has doubled, tripled. Uh and

33
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,520
that's definitely driven by a changing

34
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,840
environment. We eat more, we move less.

35
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,000
Um but it's in particular people who are

36
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,000
genetically susceptible who will respond

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,479
to this environment and who will gain me

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,960
more more than people who are not so

39
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,439
much uh uh uh susceptible. So the

40
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,640
heritability has been estimated to be 40

41
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:53,280
to 70%. Which is considered and again

42
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,799
very similar to other complex diseases.

43
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,520
Maybe different from other complex

44
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,360
diseases is that obesity is a very

45
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,280
visible public disease but I'm not going

46
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,320
to talk about that today. But it's also

47
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,479
a very early onset disease unlike type

48
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,560
two diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

49
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,000
So that's when we think about um

50
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,080
prevention. That's something we need to

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,400
take into account. Furthermore, it's

52
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,920
also a disease that involves a lot of

53
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,920
organs uh or tissues, not just the

54
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,160
brain, not just the fat cell, but when

55
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,000
it comes to like connecting obesity with

56
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,080
coorbidities, many other tissues and

57
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,080
organs are involved.

58
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:32,480
Um when it comes to gene discovery, it's

59
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:34,160
been actually um a very successful um uh

60
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,560
pathway. I would say is that we started

61
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,360
in 2007 with the discovery of FTO with

62
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,560
only a sample size of 5,000 individuals

63
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,879
and then over time we've identified more

64
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,040
and more variance mostly because we

65
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,920
increased the sample size more and more

66
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,560
and many of these efforts have been uh

67
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,519
like uh driven by the giant consortium

68
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,720
like headed by Joel Joel Hershorn

69
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,800
and uh by now we have more than 1,700

70
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,959
variants that have been identified

71
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,440
mostly associated with body mass index

72
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,319
or first identified for body mass index.

73
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,959
A few have been identified for other

74
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,720
adepositi related phenotypes.

75
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:16,159
And what we've learned in the context of

76
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:18,239
the biology is that uh the brain is a

77
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:22,400
central is a central organ probably

78
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:25,040
affecting um uh like our um hunger,

79
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,519
satiety, reward systems uh in the brain.

80
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,040
The hypocampus lyic systems like are are

81
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:33,040
driving this whole process. You see

82
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:35,840
here, this is a a nice figure from from

83
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:39,599
2015, but it is still the case. Not much

84
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:41,920
has changed uh since then. Um but the

85
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:44,159
variant to function translation has been

86
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,560
very slow.

87
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:49,440
FDO was the first discovered uh

88
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,080
phenotype almost 20 years or 18 years

89
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,680
now. You see very nice signal. This is

90
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,000
again from an older paper where the p

91
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,879
value is 10 theus 60. Now we're at like

92
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,120
10 to the minus 200 and initially we

93
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:03,920
thought that FDO was the causal gene and

94
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,159
there was quite a few papers in cell in

95
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,560
nature nature genetics that showed very

96
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:11,200
credible results for FDO as a causal

97
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,879
gene within uh within the context of

98
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:17,120
obesity but soon after uh the discovery

99
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,280
others researchers started to venture

100
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,680
out like some thought it was RPG group

101
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,400
1L uh that was the causal gene because

102
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,080
it's in quotes the the basil body of the

103
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,240
primary Celia which we know from the

104
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,800
Barney Beetle syndrome may be cause of

105
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,280
obesity but like others including

106
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,440
Molina's team thought it was more IRX3

107
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,880
or even further down IRX 5 that was the

108
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,080
causal gene. So there was a little bit

109
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:43,280
of um discussion in the field but then

110
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,520
over time things got clearer and maybe

111
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:49,759
uh this story got concluded with the

112
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:52,160
paper in science by uh uh the Marcela

113
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,160
nogo and Molina's team where they in

114
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,960
indeed concluded that the signal here in

115
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:00,560
FDO within neurons and preadiposites

116
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:02,479
seem to reach to IRX3 and IRX5 and that

117
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,120
may be sort of the causal genes within

118
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:07,039
this locus and this is just an example

119
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,120
to tell is like it took them quite a

120
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,520
few. It's like took them about 14 years

121
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,000
to come to that conclusion and

122
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,600
there's,700 variants actually that are

123
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,680
waiting to be translated. Maybe there's

124
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,360
like a dozen of variants that have been

125
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,120
translated from variant to function

126
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,639
within the context of obesity but that's

127
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:27,120
about it. Within my team, we've tried to

128
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,840
approach the variant to function in a

129
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,840
more uh like bionirmatic ways like a

130
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:37,039
statistical way because I don't do

131
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:39,199
actually lab work. Uh so Diane um used I

132
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,880
think about eight approaches that were

133
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,600
were at the time that she was doing

134
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:46,800
these analyses to to do the gene

135
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:49,120
prioritization and then uh she counted

136
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,720
how much the same gene was prioritized

137
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:55,039
by the by the different approaches. Uh

138
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,360
so here summarized in this upset plot

139
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,759
for example here you see that here are

140
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,919
the different approaches that she

141
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:05,280
considered for the gene prioritization

142
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:07,919
and you see that uh 86 genes were were

143
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:12,560
prioritized by four approaches and could

144
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:16,080
be any combination um 34 genes by five

145
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:19,280
and uh six gene by uh six. So that's not

146
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,280
all approaches but uh these are these

147
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,440
six genes and I won't go into the detail

148
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,520
but some of them are indeed like

149
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,759
confirmed uh or not necessarily

150
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,479
confirmed but also supported by animal

151
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:33,199
studies that they may play a role in in

152
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:35,280
obesity context and not always uh they

153
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:39,840
do not always point to the brain but

154
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:41,680
often also like a deep side biology and

155
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,000
then another project that is in process

156
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,080
and this also is like a collaboration

157
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,720
with Molina's team like is Virginia.

158
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:52,639
She's doing using a more multi-omics

159
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:54,880
approach where we go from snip to BMI uh

160
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,840
through uh maybe gene expression and

161
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:00,800
proteomics data. So what she did is she

162
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:04,639
combined uh all the uh publicly

163
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:06,479
available EQL data uh across multiple

164
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,479
tissues. Sometimes she did a meta meta

165
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,800
analysis. She did the same for the

166
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:14,800
proteomics data and used that in her

167
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,479
analysis to um basically uh align all

168
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,800
the variants that we have and I should

169
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,400
have emphasized these are the the 500

170
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,639
variants that have been reported in the

171
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:26,160
Yangoidal paper which is the latest

172
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:29,599
giant paper. uh she prioritized 413

173
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:32,000
genes in 189 lowi. Again an upset plot

174
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:35,039
but the main message here is that again

175
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,800
the brain remains the most uh the tissue

176
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,039
in which the most genes are being

177
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,919
prioritized or seem to be playing a role

178
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:43,680
but other tissues are now also popping

179
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,160
up.

180
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,840
She then overlated so here are her

181
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,560
results uh based on the

182
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,160
collocicalization with EQL and PQL QTL

183
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,039
data. She overlaid that with the data

184
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:57,039
from from Diane right here and then

185
00:07:55,039 --> 00:08:00,319
overlay that also with the results from

186
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:02,639
CS2G and you see there's 37 genes that

187
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:05,599
are prioritized by all three methods and

188
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:08,479
now she focuses on these 37 uh here are

189
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:10,319
some of them to to really summarize the

190
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,000
data in a paper that will be coming out

191
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,080
soon. So this is a plot that we use

192
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,160
where we have a variant the genes that

193
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,720
are prioritized in which tissue. So it's

194
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:22,960
just a lot of data to really summarize

195
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:25,120
into uh one uh nice uh story but that's

196
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,879
coming up because what's next is

197
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,720
actually is like the giant consortium

198
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,440
has been working so I haven't updated

199
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,360
this plot uh since 2021 and that's not

200
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,760
because I've been lazy but it's mostly

201
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,760
because there haven't been that many new

202
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,760
discovery uh studies. The giant

203
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,959
consortium has been working on a meta

204
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:45,680
analysis. uh giant itself combined the

205
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:48,240
data of 2.1 million individuals and then

206
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:51,040
collaborate with 23 y. So now we have a

207
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:55,360
meta analysis 5.6 million people and

208
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:57,360
this is um so now we have uh really

209
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,600
9,000 LOSA actually that we have

210
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,160
identified and the Manhattan plot looks

211
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,959
like this.

212
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,440
It's funny. Um

213
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:11,120
so the the the the significance

214
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:14,240
threshold is right here and you ask like

215
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:17,120
uh sometimes this it's like uh too much

216
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,360
data not not necessarily helpful. So

217
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,519
what can we do with this kind of data?

218
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,200
We we thought like let's start with the

219
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,440
easy things instead of varant to

220
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,760
function let's just do make a new

221
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,519
genetic score and we published that like

222
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,519
uh in the in the summer it's a rule of

223
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:35,440
let this effort. So now we made a

224
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:37,519
polygenic score um uh that that works

225
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,760
actually really well like better than

226
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,760
than the previously reported genetic

227
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,839
scores. You see here the results in the

228
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,519
European ancestry like let's focus on

229
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,000
the blue dot here like the explained

230
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,920
variance is now 17.5%

231
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,120
and we see actually it does pretty well

232
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:55,680
in other um ancestries

233
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,640
in central south Asian east Asian middle

234
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:01,120
eastern at mixed American but not still

235
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,360
not uh in in populations of African

236
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,760
ancestry. So that's definitely needs

237
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,839
more work and maybe starting point of of

238
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,399
predominantly European data is is not

239
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,480
the way to go. uh the prediction of

240
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:15,680
obesity has gotten better. So here are

241
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:18,959
the results in biomeds bio bank million

242
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:21,120
veterans program UK bio bank for obesity

243
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:24,880
class one which is BMI over 30 then

244
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:29,120
class 2 over 35 and class 3 is over 40

245
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:30,959
and um focus on these results here then

246
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,320
you see that the the area under the

247
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:37,120
receiver operating curve is is getting

248
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,120
pretty good so it's like 7 for just your

249
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,920
regular obesity and you have to keep in

250
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:45,440
mind like that obesity is still 50% %

251
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:47,360
heritable, 50% or 50% genetic, 50%

252
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,519
environment. So we'll we'll never be

253
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,560
perfect in predicting uh regular or

254
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:54,959
common obesity. So 72 is is pretty good.

255
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,560
And as we go to more extreme obesity, we

256
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,959
get better. And maybe that is because

257
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,959
more extreme obesity is maybe even more

258
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:03,680
genetic than just your common forms of

259
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:05,519
obesity. And we see this already at a

260
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,279
very young age. You see, it's like from

261
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:10,959
this is data from the Alps study from

262
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:13,200
zero to 25 years. And we have three

263
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:16,399
curves with the the people who are in

264
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:19,200
the lower desile of the uh the polygenic

265
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:22,000
score in red, the people in the top

266
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,880
desile in blue and then the average in

267
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,880
yellow. And you see already at age five

268
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,120
that genetic predisposition is coming

269
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,440
through. Um and it puts you on the track

270
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,760
throughout life uh to be heavier or

271
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,880
leaner than than the average depending

272
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:39,200
on where you are. Another thing we're

273
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:43,200
doing right now is is led by Victor

274
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:46,480
who's also here um is just building on

275
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:49,279
on the uh the the idea that genetics can

276
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:52,399
support uh drug development. We using

277
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:54,720
the giant data to to look in how how

278
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:58,079
many of the lossi indeed provide support

279
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:00,320
for uh gene uh for drug discovery. So

280
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:04,240
this is very preliminary preliminary

281
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:08,639
data. Um so out of the 9,000 LOSI we

282
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:11,600
prioritize 7,000 genes and 700 of these

283
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:14,240
genes actually are already the target of

284
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,639
either approved drugs or drugs that are

285
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,279
close to get on to the market but not

286
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:21,760
for weight loss. Um so the question is

287
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:24,079
here that how many of these drugs that

288
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:27,519
are approved or in in in the in the

289
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:30,240
process of of approval could be used to

290
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:34,240
for repurposing in the context of uh

291
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:37,519
weight loss. And then among the uh new

292
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,279
targets that are not currently um or

293
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,320
among the the new genes that are

294
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:45,680
currently not target for uh uh current

295
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,600
drugs, how many could be new targets?

296
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,519
And there we use the data from the uh

297
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,760
illuminating drugable genome initiative.

298
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,800
And here we see that again about 800

299
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:57,120
genes are predicted to be druggable with

300
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:00,000
high confidence. So maybe among those

301
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,639
there's maybe new anti-obesity targets.

302
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,079
Uh of those 700 so most of them are

303
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:09,279
anti- antibbody druggable and 100 of

304
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:12,079
those are small molecule drugable. Again

305
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:14,160
very preliminary data. uh but this these

306
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:16,240
are projects basically to avoid the real

307
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,040
task which is the variant to function

308
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,959
right so because uh remember I told this

309
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,399
maybe a dozen of variants associated

310
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,959
with body mass index that have been

311
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,680
translated into function but now we have

312
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:29,519
9,000 uh it's a little overwhelming it's

313
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,320
been taken a long time for us to really

314
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:34,560
write up the story into a a concise and

315
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,880
meaningful paper

316
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,480
um and maybe the real problem is is is

317
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,200
is

318
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,440
not just um the amount of data but is

319
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:47,120
also the phenotype. Some people have

320
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:49,519
tried to um shortcut the the variant to

321
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,839
function by uh focusing on rare

322
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,839
variants. Uh here you see a few

323
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,079
initiatives. Uh the giant consortium

324
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,680
here used the exone chip quite a while

325
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,360
ago. It was a cheap way to get to the

326
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,160
rare variants. We had 700,000

327
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,959
individuals find actually three variants

328
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,959
that are truly rare uh below the 1%

329
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:09,680
level including the two variants in the

330
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:12,160
JIP receptor. These are coding variants.

331
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:15,360
um a paper by Regeneron that combined

332
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:17,519
data of 600,000 people identified 16

333
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,519
genes mostly focusing their paper on

334
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,120
GPR75.

335
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,560
We don't know yet whether that's a real

336
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,720
drug target but they are definitely

337
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,120
working on that and then there's a

338
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,279
recent paper by the Cambridge group

339
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,839
combining data of 400,000 individuals

340
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:34,480
and their paper mostly focused on

341
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:38,240
bassoon. This is just to say that this

342
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:40,000
seems an an efficient way to to go from

343
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:43,360
varant to function within the obesity

344
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:47,760
field. Um but you still need a lot of

345
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:50,720
data uh for a few targets. Um so maybe

346
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,480
the problem is not so much uh with with

347
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,880
the amount of data. It seems that we

348
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,720
have a lot of data but maybe it's the

349
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,199
problem is really with the phenotype

350
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,360
body mass index. Everyone agrees that

351
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:03,199
it's actually not a very good uh

352
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,959
phenotype.

353
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:07,120
um because it's pretty crude and it's

354
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:09,600
far from the real biology. So in my

355
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:12,320
group we've really been focusing on

356
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:15,920
curating the phenotypes uh focusing on

357
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:19,360
more refined adiposity traits. Um, one

358
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:21,440
study is is focused on um, body

359
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,800
composition really and and tomorrow

360
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,480
Victor will uh, talk about this this I

361
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,480
think it's like an exciting study where

362
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,800
we look at variance associated with

363
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,399
muscle mass and fat mass in the same

364
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,240
direction or in the opposite direction.

365
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,000
He'll tell you more about that. I'll

366
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,240
tell you a little more about the

367
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
uncoupling of obesity from its

368
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,399
coorbidities and that that's coming

369
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,360
next. But we're also focusing on using

370
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:49,600
PETCT scan data from medical records of

371
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:51,600
Copenhagen Hospital um to to quantify

372
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,720
brown adapost tissue activity but also

373
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,959
other uh other depositive phenotypes and

374
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,639
that's uh very much in in development as

375
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,320
well. So we use AI to do the

376
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,519
quantification

377
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:06,639
and um we also focusing on fat

378
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:09,680
distribution. So obesity is is it's not

379
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:12,959
only about too much um adiposity but

380
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:15,279
also where exactly you will store it and

381
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:17,279
uh we also increasingly focusing on

382
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:19,360
biomarkers particularly with the

383
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:21,199
proteomics uh becoming increasingly

384
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,759
available. This this promises to be an

385
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:26,000
exciting field as well. So today I want

386
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,759
to focus on on this story and actually

387
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,399
just got published last week in nature

388
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:33,199
medicine and is led by Natalie Shami

389
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:36,399
who's here as well today and uh by JJ

390
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:38,399
Wang. So what we did is we did not do a

391
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,160
case control analysis of healthy obese

392
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,360
individuals versus unhealthy obese

393
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,600
individuals because there's a lot of

394
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:46,320
discussion about that but we we looked

395
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,079
at uh these phenotypes body mass index

396
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,680
body fat percentage and waist hip ratio

397
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:54,000
on one hand and uh these cardabolic risk

398
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,800
factors on the other hand. So lipids

399
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,519
blood pressure and glucose and insulin

400
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,279
and what we did is uh so this story

401
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,279
actually builds on a previous story

402
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:05,679
where where we use summary statistics.

403
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:08,079
So here we use individual level data of

404
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,839
mostly of the UK bio bank. So what we

405
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:13,439
did is we take a distribution of body

406
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:16,640
mass indexes. It's it's right skewed but

407
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:18,240
we made a standard normal a normal dist

408
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,799
a normal distribution with a mean of

409
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:24,079
zero standard deviation of one. And we

410
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:25,919
did the same for all the traits um and

411
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:28,240
also for the card metabolic trait. So

412
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:32,240
each phenotype is now on the same

413
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:34,480
distribution and um we made a new

414
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,520
phenotype by subtracting one from the

415
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:40,559
other. Say my body mass index is plus

416
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,799
three on the BMI side but minus3 on the

417
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,320
LDL side. So the if you subtract one

418
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:46,000
from the other depending on which one

419
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,799
you extract. Now I'm all of a sudden

420
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,360
plus six. So that becomes a whole new

421
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:53,760
distribution and now we did the G was on

422
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:56,480
that new distribution. So if I'm plus

423
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,000
six, it means that I'm a healthy obese.

424
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,600
I'm a person with healthy obesity

425
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,280
because I have a high BMI and low LDL.

426
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,440
If you're minus 6, you're the opposite.

427
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,000
You have may have a low poly index, but

428
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,160
you have a high LDL. And we did that for

429
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,559
BMI and LDL, but we did that for all

430
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:15,440
these possible combinations. So we did

431
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:19,120
uh created 24 new phenotypes. We did a G

432
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,640
G was across these 24 um new phenotypes.

433
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,200
We made sure that the signals we

434
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:27,919
observed are collocicalized and we ended

435
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:31,520
up with 205 new lossi in 206 with 206

436
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:35,200
independent association signals.

437
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:40,880
So just to confirm uh we then made uh a

438
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:43,360
score of these 206 uh lossi or 266 loi.

439
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,840
So we have the uncoupling score because

440
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:48,160
we really look at how adiposity is

441
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,400
uncoupled from these cardabolic risk

442
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:53,840
factors and we compare it with your

443
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:56,880
typical um unhealthy obesity score you

444
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:59,280
could say it. So red is is the healthy

445
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,360
score. Uh blue is the unhealthy score.

446
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,200
And you indeed see like if you do the

447
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,120
association within the UK bio bank

448
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,799
there's no effect on height but you

449
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:11,120
quickly see that um the um the

450
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:13,760
difference is particularly visible in

451
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:16,240
the VAT SAT ratio where if you have an

452
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,080
unhealthy score there's not so much an

453
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,919
effect and I should here's the null line

454
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,520
but if you have a healthy score you

455
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:25,200
actually have a favorable fat

456
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:27,840
distribution and you see the same for um

457
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,440
waist to hip ratio uh where the

458
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,120
unhealthy score is a source with a

459
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,960
higher waist ratio where the healthy

460
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:36,160
score does not have too much an effect

461
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:38,480
on fat distribution. Um it's more

462
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,960
visible if you look at the uh risk

463
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,799
factors where here is the null line and

464
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,679
you see that the healthy score lies

465
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:48,160
mostly on the inside uh on the negative

466
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:50,400
side. So the protective side of this uh

467
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,480
radar plot meaning weaning is associated

468
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,600
with lower blood pressure, lower glucose

469
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:58,080
levels um lower HBO and C triglycerate

470
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:00,559
and of course higher HCL as expected

471
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:03,760
whereas the unhealthy score is also as

472
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:05,840
expected uh lies on the the outside. So

473
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,880
this is just for confirming that what we

474
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:11,039
find is indeed healthy obesity versus

475
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,280
unhealthy obesity.

476
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:15,520
uh we do a FI was we did a FI was within

477
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:18,240
UK bio bank and indeed we see like a

478
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:21,120
nice confirmation that both scores are

479
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,440
associated with increased obesity but

480
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:26,960
the unhealthy score is indeed associated

481
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:30,080
with higher risk of um type 2 diabetes

482
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:32,480
hypertension and the uh healthy score is

483
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:35,200
has a protective effect of interest is

484
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:38,960
of course that the or the association

485
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,720
with other diseases um not the non-card

486
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:44,320
metabolic diseases that seem to be

487
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:47,760
associated with um weightbearing

488
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:50,799
diseases such as cellulitis um uh

489
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:52,400
varicose veins and so much. So it's of

490
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:54,559
course a bit tricky to call it healthy

491
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:57,039
and unhealthy because in the end uh the

492
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:59,039
risks of the people with a high healthy

493
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:01,120
obesity score uh they're still

494
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:05,120
associated with these these diseases in

495
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:07,520
the same way as unhealthy score. uh we

496
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:10,240
also confirm these results in uh

497
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:12,400
children uh focus on the cardioidabolic

498
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,000
risk factors. If children with a healthy

499
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,799
score and they're at around the age of

500
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,679
11 and 12, they already at that age you

501
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:21,760
see that they have a protective profile

502
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:25,120
compared to children with a high score

503
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:27,200
on the unhealthy score. If you look at

504
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,280
the card metabolic uh of if you look at

505
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,159
tissue enrichment analyses with the

506
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:34,400
healthy uh variance the it's

507
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,640
particularly the peripheral tissues that

508
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:39,840
show up adipos tissue abdominal fat and

509
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:43,120
so on but also cartilage adrenal stomach

510
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:45,440
uh whereas the unhealthy score uh in in

511
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:48,720
similar to the BMI score is associated

512
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,240
with um uh the central nervous systems

513
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,320
because of clearly different biology

514
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,480
that is being observed. We also look at

515
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,880
the proteins. We know from the UK bio

516
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,640
bank data that high body mass index is

517
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,559
associated with high protein levels

518
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,000
probably because this the bigger you are

519
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:04,159
the higher the levels. That makes sense.

520
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,440
And that's shown in this data from from

521
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:10,240
Sunidal. So when we looked at at the

522
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:13,600
scores and their association with um the

523
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:15,440
the the UK bio bank proteins um the

524
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,120
unhealthy score which has some more

525
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,960
power is associated with more proteins.

526
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:23,200
The unhealthy score is also associated

527
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:26,000
with 337 proteins. 28 are associated in

528
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:30,559
in uh are overlapping.

529
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:32,240
Um of the overlapping proteins 85% are

530
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:34,480
in the same direction. And this is what

531
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,559
you see here. This is somewhat like

532
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:39,039
there's three dimensions to this plot.

533
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:41,200
Um on the right hand side means higher

534
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:43,600
adiposity, higher cardabolic disease.

535
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,600
for the red dots. Uh but for the yellow

536
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,919
dots, it means like a higher adiposity,

537
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:50,400
lower cardium metabolic risk. And on the

538
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:52,400
left hand side, lower adiposity, lower

539
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,960
cardium metabolic risk. For the for the

540
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,360
red dots again and for uh the yellow

541
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:02,720
dots, lower adiposity, higher cardio

542
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:04,960
metabolic risk. Um so these 176 proteins

543
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,679
are they're actually consistent your the

544
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:10,159
traditional adiposity proteins, leptin,

545
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:13,120
fatty acid binding proteins. uh you see

546
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:14,960
them pop up uh in both uh at both plots

547
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,520
on the same time and the same like with

548
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,039
with some others on on this side. So

549
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,240
these recall these proteins are

550
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:25,360
adipositely driven. What about the 15%

551
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,799
others? There's about 32 proteins that

552
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,200
are actually going in the opposite

553
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:32,000
direction. So they will show up here in

554
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:34,480
the red dots but here on the on the

555
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,440
yellow dots and on this side on the red

556
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:41,039
dots and here on the yellow dots. So for

557
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:46,400
example um growth hormone receptor LDL

558
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:48,720
receptor APO um F uh FGF-21

559
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:52,080
um like too much data to really go into

560
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:54,000
the detail right now. Um but for us it

561
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,240
it suggests that they're they're not

562
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
driven by adiposity as such because then

563
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,760
they would lie on the same side but now

564
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,200
they lie on the other side and what

565
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,600
could explain here is that they're

566
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,520
driven by uh the health status the card

567
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,159
metabolic health status and then there's

568
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:11,360
another and then go a little faster.

569
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:13,120
There's 129 proteins that only show up

570
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,520
for the uncoupling even though this

571
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:19,039
uncoupling score has less power than the

572
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:21,440
uh unhealthy score. uh we see adipoq as

573
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:24,640
expected to show up uh lipoprotein

574
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,480
lipase myostatin so there's a lot of

575
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:29,279
interesting proteins that are showing up

576
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:32,159
to be associated with uh either score

577
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:35,840
telling us more about the biology

578
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:39,600
going a little faster um I showed you

579
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:42,159
like that we have one uh set of 206 uh

580
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,240
prote um genes that are associated or

581
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,559
variants that are associated with this

582
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:50,080
unh this healthy profile but actually

583
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:52,799
they also cluster within uh multiple um

584
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:55,840
subclusters. For example, here these are

585
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:57,679
the it's a heat plot. These are the 266

586
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,559
variants associate body fat percentage

587
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:02,080
and body mass index and by definition

588
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:04,400
because that's how we discovered them

589
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:06,320
with a protective profile with any of

590
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,640
these cardabolic risk factors. But you

591
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:11,120
see they clusters this cluster three is

592
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:14,080
a source with lower body fat uh lower

593
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:17,919
blood pressure. Cluster five with lower

594
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:20,240
glycemic traits. Cluster six uh with a

595
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:22,000
healthier lipid profile. Cluster one is

596
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,480
pretty complicated because it has a

597
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,799
healthy profile for triglycerides but

598
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,559
unhealthy for glycemic traits. And then

599
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:30,240
four, seven, and eight, they're actually

600
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:33,360
more globally associated with a

601
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,640
healthier profile. So combining u oh

602
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,039
yeah and then we did a variant to

603
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:39,120
function prioritization binatically

604
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:41,120
overlay with GTEx data and then in

605
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,720
collaboration with Molina also using

606
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,200
CS2G

607
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,679
and uh combining all that data and

608
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,919
knowing the the clusters in which these

609
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:52,559
variants fall and sort of having that

610
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:55,039
more refined phenotype for each of these

611
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:57,840
variants we were able to prioritize some

612
00:25:55,039 --> 00:26:00,240
of these genes um better than we we

613
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:02,320
could without that information. So here

614
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,919
I'm just going through it highlighting

615
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,760
some of these genes. If any of these

616
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:08,080
genes are familiar like please let me

617
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:10,400
know because we're now working on like

618
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:12,320
the v the real variant of function. So

619
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,320
even though this study was published the

620
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:17,039
study is not complete and we're working

621
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:22,000
with Molina's team uh and one posted in

622
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:25,120
my group Molina um um uh uh Elonor

623
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,279
Manita is is here uh doing this real

624
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,600
variant of function in the lab with with

625
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:32,159
Molina's team.

626
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:35,279
Um this is just to say and maybe to

627
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:37,120
conclude that it's like uh gene

628
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:39,120
discovery is maybe complete but we

629
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:41,360
really need to work more on curating the

630
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:43,840
phenotype to get the phenotypes closer

631
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,600
to the biology to to facilitate and make

632
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,200
it make it much easier to do the variant

633
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,360
to function translation. So it's

634
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,200
important to just not forget about the

635
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:54,559
phenotype.

636
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:58,400
So uh just to point out that the biology

637
00:26:54,559 --> 00:27:00,000
that we implicated with uh the the the

638
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,400
genes that we have identified are the

639
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,480
ones that we've identified before. Uh

640
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,320
but actually now with the with the more

641
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,640
data we we've we strengthened these

642
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,640
observations and we actually identified

643
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,880
a few new pathways that seem important

644
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:16,720
in the variant to function translation.

645
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:19,120
Just to say like identifying uh variance

646
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:22,159
is not hard but genetics may help

647
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:25,679
elucidate the the heterogeneity within

648
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:28,159
obesity or any complex trait. Uh we see

649
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:30,799
multiple loi that couple uncouple

650
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:32,320
adiposity from its coorbidities. uh

651
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:35,840
multiple mechanisms seem to be

652
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:38,320
underlying and by combining this like

653
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,640
better description of the phenotype with

654
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:43,679
uh the the variant to function

655
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:47,039
translation I think we may like expedite

656
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:48,640
uh the actual uh variant to biology uh

657
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:51,679
observations

658
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:54,080
very grateful to my team at CBMR at the

659
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:56,480
icon institute as well uh working with

660
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,559
Molina has been a a blessing like really

661
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,080
has pushed me to the next level of the

662
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:02,320
variant to function translation and

663
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,080
going beyond the bionformmatics uh and

664
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:06,080
of course also the oops the giant

665
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:09,840
consortium

666
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:12,880
um with Joel uh Herson leading it and of

667
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:16,760
course uh the funding for this work.

668
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,760
I'll finish here.

669
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,919
Thank you Ruth for a very very

670
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:30,279
interesting presentation. So are there

671
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:30,279
any questions from the audience?

672
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:37,440
So, so a couple questions R. So, one, if

673
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:39,360
if you were to filter genes um by just

674
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,080
the number of genes that definitively

675
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:44,880
have multiple variants uh that can can

676
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:47,760
be linked to um the phenotypes of

677
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,360
interest. Does that help um narrow the

678
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,640
list? So, I'll ask three quick

679
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,600
questions. That that's question number

680
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,399
one.

681
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:57,200
>> Question number two is I never saw GLP1

682
00:28:54,399 --> 00:29:00,159
come up on any of your gene lists. So if

683
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,760
you were to do a retrospective on GLP1,

684
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:04,320
where would it have fallen out kind of

685
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:07,279
in in this list? And then the the final

686
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:09,279
question is on on FGF-21,

687
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,799
it looks like it goes in one direction

688
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:12,960
and then the other direction. So

689
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:15,840
increases risk of atyposity and and then

690
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,360
decreases risk of cardioabolic disease

691
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,520
or or cardiovascular disease. So if you

692
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:22,880
were to you perturb that, would you

693
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:26,640
expect uh differential effects across

694
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:28,799
those two phenotypes? Right. Actually, I

695
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,799
did uh the first question about

696
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:32,080
filtering genes. What was exactly what

697
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:35,600
you mean?

698
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:37,200
>> Multiple alals at a locus to help

699
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,559
whittle those down for

700
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,200
>> That's a good question. Actually, we

701
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:42,799
haven't looked into that. Um but indeed,

702
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,279
we are working on the variant of

703
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:46,880
function in the lab with Molina. Um

704
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:49,650
don't know what the process the stage is

705
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,679
at the moment but uh

706
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:54,399
[Laughter]

707
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:58,080
>> uh yeah.

708
00:29:54,399 --> 00:30:01,360
Yeah, waiting for the data. Um, for

709
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:03,919
GLP-1 receptor varants, um, it's very

710
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:06,880
interesting with the 9 million uh, with

711
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:09,360
the 5 million meta analysis. It's it's

712
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:12,399
it's starting to show up. It's a very

713
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:14,480
nice peak on GLP-1 receptors. uh but

714
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:17,360
this is the first time we see it uh in a

715
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:20,320
meta analysis show up in adults is very

716
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:23,919
intriguing but uh a small well small

717
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:27,440
28,000 um individuals meta analyses in

718
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:30,000
children but but um in children before

719
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,919
the age of three GLP-1 receptor variants

720
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,640
are showing up there and that's actually

721
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:36,880
a phenotype BMI before the age of three

722
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:39,360
is not correlated with your adult

723
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,799
phenotype so it's very intriguing we

724
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,559
don't quite know what's happening so but

725
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:45,360
then we need 5 million people to find it

726
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:48,080
in adults. Um, and then your third

727
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:50,000
question I already forgot.

728
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,760
>> Yeah, it's true. It's like, and I didn't

729
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,279
mention it here, but these are plasma

730
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:57,360
proteins and um, these are still very

731
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:58,960
correlated phenotypes or correlated

732
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:02,880
observations. We haven't looked really

733
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:05,520
at the causality. Is FGF-21 up uh, as a

734
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,120
causal uh, or as a consequence or as a

735
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:10,399
compensatory? like there's a few other

736
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:12,000
of these proteins like LPL um and

737
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:13,760
myostatin that are in the direction that

738
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,360
we didn't really hypothesize would be

739
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:19,320
but that maybe have to do with with the

740
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:19,320
fact that it's plasma proteins.

741
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:37,120
So our next speaker will be Jason

742
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:40,080
Flanick. He's assistant professor at

743
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:42,399
pediatric ped pediatrics at Howard

744
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:44,640
Medical School and the division of

745
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:47,440
genetics and genomics at Boston

746
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:50,000
Children's Hospital and associate member

747
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:53,000
of the broad institute at mid and

748
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Harvard.

749
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:59,440
>> All right. Um thank you um for the

750
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:02,399
invitation to speak here today and um

751
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:04,320
thank you all for um listening to me. Um

752
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:07,840
I'm going to talk today about a method

753
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:10,799
and resource um for trying to understand

754
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:13,039
mechanisms underlying um G-W was results

755
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:14,799
and also we'll see rare diseases too.

756
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:16,720
Um, and I've called this a gene to

757
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:18,640
variant approach. Um, because it comes

758
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:21,200
at the V2F problem from a little bit of

759
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:23,919
a different perspective. And that

760
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:26,000
perspective comes from our group's work

761
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:27,679
on genetics knowledge portals. If you

762
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,840
have not um, if you're not familiar with

763
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:31,120
our group, we build a lot of um, you

764
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,880
know, we work with a lot of communities

765
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:35,039
to make their G-W was data and

766
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,480
downstream work available um, through

767
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:38,080
public knowledge portals. If you haven't

768
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,080
checked out the association to function

769
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:42,240
knowledge portal, um, I'd encourage you

770
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,840
to do so. has a lot of interesting

771
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,080
results I think that's relevant to a lot

772
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:48,240
of the things we'll talk about today. Um

773
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:50,240
and this was a direct actual consequence

774
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,760
of one of the earliest um V2F

775
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,960
initiatives here at the Broad. It was

776
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,200
initially called the variant to function

777
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,720
portal and now it's funded by NHGRI to

778
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,960
be the association to function knowledge

779
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,640
portal. Um but our work in this area

780
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,799
kind of goes back even further to the

781
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,880
accelerating medicines partnership for

782
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:07,760
um initially type two diabetes and

783
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:10,000
subsequently common metabolic diseases.

784
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:11,840
Um and this was a consortium about I

785
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,399
think maybe seven or eight pharma

786
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:16,960
partners now over its course uh with a

787
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:19,200
bunch of academics and industry um and

788
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:21,200
nonprofits as well. And the goal was to

789
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,360
make human genetic data more broadly

790
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,519
accessible to catalyze drug discovery

791
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:27,840
primarily through um prioritizing

792
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:30,080
targets that had genetic support. And

793
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:33,200
one of the first projects that we did

794
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:36,640
actually as part of um AMT2D was kind of

795
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:39,200
a mini manual ad hoc V2F. This is way

796
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:41,360
before it was called V2F, but we took

797
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,279
all the type 2 diabetes genetics data

798
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,039
that existed at the time. We kind of

799
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:46,799
cross- referenced it with all these

800
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:49,039
other experimental data. It was very

801
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:51,440
kind of messy, but you know, after about

802
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:53,760
six or seven months, we produced this

803
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,519
report um with a list of potential

804
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:58,159
targets that we thought were, you know,

805
00:33:55,519 --> 00:34:00,159
had very strong genetic support from the

806
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:02,640
genetic data as well as auxiliary

807
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:04,880
genomic data for type two diabetes. And

808
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:07,120
what I think was notable to me about

809
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,720
this activity was not that literally

810
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,560
every single one of these genes was

811
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,480
completely rejected by every pharma

812
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,159
partner that we worked with, but that

813
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,839
the reasons that they rejected them was

814
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:18,320
not because the genetics data wasn't

815
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:20,720
strong or they didn't believe that these

816
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:23,119
had genetic support, but that there were

817
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:25,599
a bunch of reasons that, you know, were

818
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:28,159
specific to each partner that just ruled

819
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:30,079
them out for like, you know, maybe it

820
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:31,839
wasn't competitive in the market, maybe

821
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:33,440
they didn't have an assay, it wasn't

822
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:35,200
area of interest. So there were all

823
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,679
these like very specific considerations

824
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:39,200
that each partner had that kind of they

825
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,720
could have told me in advance like we're

826
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:43,359
not going to be interested in that gene

827
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:45,119
if you prioritize that. So what that's

828
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:46,720
kind of how I thought about this over

829
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:48,159
the years is that we typically think of

830
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,599
the variant to function approach. I

831
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:52,720
think Ruth just illustrated this. We

832
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:55,839
have like 7,000 um LOSI. How do we come

833
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:57,359
up with technologies to map each one to

834
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:59,680
you know what it's implicating

835
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:03,040
functionally? um that's very difficult

836
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:04,400
to do and also a lot of these um LOSI

837
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,320
are not going to be of interest to a

838
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:09,040
vast majority of people who are going to

839
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,800
use them downstream and instead I think

840
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,760
of the problem more on the lines of can

841
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:15,599
we answer the question that if a user or

842
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,359
somebody you know not just pharma

843
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:19,680
partners but somebody who would be an

844
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:21,599
experimental biologist has a question

845
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,000
about the potential role of a mechanism

846
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:25,839
or gene in disease what can we tell them

847
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,760
about what human genetics says about it

848
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:29,119
and if you think about this is this is

849
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,240
you know while it's flipping the

850
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:32,640
question on its head, it's still using

851
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:34,800
the same data. But you can imagine many

852
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:37,200
cases where even if you don't haven't

853
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:39,440
definitively mapped every single variant

854
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:41,200
that informs on the function and you

855
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,520
maybe even there isn't a genomide

856
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,839
significant hit for a gene involved in

857
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:47,119
this mechanism, you might still have

858
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:49,599
information and you might have already

859
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:51,440
even solved the problem. So kind of what

860
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:53,119
I'm going to talk about today is how to

861
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,960
answer a question like this because I

862
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:57,119
think a mechanism we probably all mean

863
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,359
different things when we describe a

864
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:01,119
mechanism. Um but you know in my

865
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:03,040
experience most people have like a very

866
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:04,640
narrow range of interests. You know they

867
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,400
have like an assay that they work in.

868
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,800
They have investments that they've

869
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,880
already done. They want like novelty but

870
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,480
not too much novelty. So a very

871
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,640
complicated question like this. The

872
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:17,359
question is can we provide a resource

873
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:19,200
that enables people to kind of um you

874
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:21,680
know address this. So I'm going to walk

875
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,599
through a couple steps of how we do this

876
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:25,920
um and argue that I think with large

877
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:27,440
language models and really the amount of

878
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,119
G-W was data that we have across

879
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:31,359
thousands of traits now it's actually

880
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:34,160
becoming possible to provide useful

881
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:37,440
answers to this sort of question. All

882
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:39,760
right. So starting from the ground up um

883
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,200
I'm going to model a mechanism. Right.

884
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,280
So this is I'm not I'm going to be

885
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,720
intentionally very abstract and fuzzy.

886
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,200
So I'm going to define a mechanism just

887
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:49,200
to be a fuzzy set of genes. So I'm

888
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:51,359
ignoring anything involving like pathway

889
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:53,200
information, regulatory relationships.

890
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:55,920
It's just here's a bag of genes with

891
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:57,599
some weights. So all the context for

892
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,640
that mechanism, you know, like let's say

893
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:02,720
insulin signaling is the mechanism. You

894
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:04,800
might say the specific genes involved

895
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,880
might vary by tissue, it might vary by

896
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,800
context, disease state. those are going

897
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,960
to be encoded by completely different

898
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,800
gene sets. So what this means is we

899
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,400
might have like potentially an infinite

900
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,640
number of mechanisms that are actually

901
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,880
existing in the human body, right? And

902
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,480
moreover, we don't observe any of these,

903
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,160
right? We don't know actually this

904
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,920
precise genes that are involved in any

905
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:26,240
process that's really happening in the

906
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:28,560
human body. What we do have are a bunch

907
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:30,240
of experiments that we can do which will

908
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,760
produce a readout of genes and that

909
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,520
readout's going to be influenced by

910
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,119
whatever mechanisms that experiment is

911
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,119
targeting. So imagine you have like a

912
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:38,800
differential expression experiment in

913
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:41,119
the pancreas. People with type 1

914
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:43,200
diabetes versus healthy controls. You

915
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:45,119
might hypothesize that genes involved in

916
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,040
autoimmunity or insulin secretion or

917
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,720
beta cell growth might somehow

918
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,079
contribute to the readout of genes you

919
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,240
get from that differential expression

920
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:54,960
experiment. Okay? And while we can

921
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:58,079
observe like the true mechanisms, it's

922
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,839
trivial, not trivial, but extremely easy

923
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:01,280
to generate tons and tons and tons and

924
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:03,200
tons of these readouts, right? In fact,

925
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:05,359
there's like millions of them scattered

926
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:07,359
across all these different um bio

927
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:10,079
repositories. I work with a colleague

928
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:12,480
Avi Mayion um actually at Mount Si with

929
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:14,480
Ruth um who has built a ton of resources

930
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,960
for doing this. And while these are

931
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,960
biased and noisy and incomplete, you

932
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:21,119
would assume that like the label of a

933
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,800
gene set, you know, hopefully has

934
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:25,119
something to do with the mechanism it's

935
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:27,119
interrogating, right? So this um the

936
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:29,520
genes involved in you know annotated as

937
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:31,200
having abnormal gliposy glucose uptake

938
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:33,359
when you delete them in mice hopefully

939
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,680
inform on some mechanism that's relevant

940
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:38,400
to that. So you can think of this giant

941
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:40,400
matrix of like every gene by like every

942
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,079
readout you have. Everything's noisy.

943
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,359
It's incomplete. It's biased. It's

944
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:45,520
almost kind of like if you think about

945
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:47,119
it like a G-W was tag snip, right? So

946
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,680
like the tag snip is often not the

947
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:51,920
actual causal snip. Here you might tag a

948
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:53,839
mechanism with the gene set, but may not

949
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:56,720
necessarily be the causal one, but this

950
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:58,079
is still our input um information. So

951
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:01,119
what we're trying to do in the context

952
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:04,079
of V2F is when G-W was the readout. So

953
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:05,680
GB was going to um read out like you

954
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:07,680
know between cases and controls however

955
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:10,560
you define them a set of variants that

956
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:12,640
implicitly observe a readout of genes.

957
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:15,200
Okay. And we're trying to unpack which

958
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:17,599
mechanisms are kind of contributing to

959
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,440
that readout. Okay. Um and our goal is

960
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:21,599
to kind of go back from the G-W was

961
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:24,079
results to infer the underlying

962
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:26,480
mechanisms. So here's a statistical

963
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:28,240
model as to how you could model this. So

964
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:30,480
I'm going to I'll build this up from the

965
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:32,240
ground up going forward. So on the

966
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,160
bottom level we have a variable for

967
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,839
every gene set in that library. So it

968
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:38,079
could be a million of these. Okay. And

969
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:39,520
they have latent weights, the degree to

970
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:42,400
which they contribute to the trait. So

971
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,920
there's one model per trait. Okay? So we

972
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,359
don't know what these weights are. We do

973
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,920
know the gene sets and we know which

974
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:50,480
genes are in them. And so we have those

975
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:53,200
feed forward and they add on the log

976
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:55,359
odds scale to produce a probability of

977
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:57,280
disease relevance for every gene. So we

978
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:59,680
have 20,000 additional variables for

979
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:02,800
genes. And those probabilities are also

980
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:04,880
latent. We don't observe them. Okay. Um

981
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,160
we can put like and I'm kind of glossing

982
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,320
over the details, but you put

983
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:10,160
regularizing priors to make to kind of

984
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:12,320
handle like the super large scale of

985
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:14,000
like these number of gene sets. So what

986
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:16,640
you do observe are the variant

987
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,320
associations nearby each gene. Okay. And

988
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:21,040
so you need basically this is the key,

989
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:22,640
right? You need a model of how the genes

990
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,400
whether or not they're disease relevant

991
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:26,800
influence the associations you observe

992
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,640
nearby. Okay. So obviously this is a

993
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,160
very hard problem to some extent variant

994
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,760
to gene is like the whole thing we're

995
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:34,400
trying to do here. But I would argue

996
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:36,640
that while going from a specific variant

997
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:39,920
to confidently implicating a gene is

998
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:42,160
very hard it's comparatively easier to

999
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:44,079
given knowledge of a gene being disease

1000
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:46,720
relevant to look at all the variants

1001
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:48,640
nearby and model how their associations

1002
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,960
change. And so we have a postoc in the

1003
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,560
lab Alex Yamos who's working on this.

1004
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,560
Actually a lot of the work that's been

1005
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:56,720
done by people here at the broad AI

1006
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:58,560
Price Ben Neil in particular over the

1007
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:01,200
last decade have really worked out how

1008
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:03,359
variant effects change in response to

1009
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:05,200
like annotations that you know are

1010
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:07,359
relevant to disease and you can kind of

1011
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,800
incorporate genes into this model and

1012
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:10,800
like again you know lay out equations

1013
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,079
that are really just directly informed

1014
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,079
by the work that a lot of people here

1015
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:15,920
have done. Um I could spend like a whole

1016
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:17,280
talk on this. I'm not um going to do

1017
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:20,000
that today because I want to more focus

1018
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:21,680
on kind of the mechanism inference here

1019
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,240
and also this method is still a little

1020
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:25,839
slow to you know use as part of what I'm

1021
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:27,359
talking about here. So all the results

1022
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:29,760
I'm going to show today instead are a

1023
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:31,839
much simpler model of how variance um

1024
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,000
effects change as a result of being near

1025
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:36,880
a disease relevant gene. Um this is like

1026
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,880
a very very simple is a variant nearby

1027
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:41,440
the gene how far is it? It's called

1028
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:43,119
human genetic evidence scores um that we

1029
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,720
have a perspective on a couple years

1030
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:46,560
ago. Uh again, I'm not going to go into

1031
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,760
the details of this. Um I'm instead

1032
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,839
going to go into like kind of how you

1033
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:51,599
infer and what you get when you try to

1034
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:54,160
back down and calculate the genes and

1035
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:56,560
the mechanisms that underly um a G-W

1036
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:59,280
was. So again, not going through the

1037
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:01,440
details, you observe the G-W was variant

1038
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:04,880
associations. You can then you want to

1039
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:06,400
infer the latent gene probabilities and

1040
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,560
mechanism/get

1041
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,160
weights. Okay, you do that via technique

1042
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,920
called Gibb sampling. I'm not going to

1043
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:14,960
show the equations for that. and you

1044
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:17,359
output a completely joint posterior

1045
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:19,599
distribution over all 20,000 genes in

1046
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:21,119
every gene setting and by nature of the

1047
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:22,720
and again these priors you put on the

1048
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:24,560
gene sets it's actually a very sparse

1049
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,000
you kind of select out specific gene

1050
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,680
sets in a way that's much more

1051
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,040
interpretable so what that looks like

1052
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:31,200
I'm showing results for like a heart

1053
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:33,599
failure G-W was um you basically drop in

1054
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:37,280
the G-W was it runs in about 20 minutes

1055
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:39,280
um and um you get out on the the left

1056
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,200
table is showing kind of those gene

1057
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:43,200
level variables so that leftmost column

1058
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:45,280
column is those probabilities of disease

1059
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:48,000
relevance and those are actually broken

1060
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:50,960
down on the log odds scale into effects

1061
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,720
coming down from the um from the

1062
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,160
variance. Okay, so that's what's called

1063
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,680
G-W was log odds. That's how much

1064
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,920
evidence there is from the G-W was for

1065
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:00,240
that gene and then bottom up how much

1066
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:01,440
are coming from the gene sets as part of

1067
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,800
the model. Right? Everything's being

1068
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:05,200
learned from the G-W was though. There's

1069
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:07,440
no like you know like prespecification

1070
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,960
of the gene sets. on the right is it's

1071
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,280
showing the top gene sets that are

1072
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:14,000
selected and these are remember they're

1073
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:15,440
jointly fit. Okay, so they're all like

1074
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,480
jointly modeled as to how they

1075
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:20,079
contribute to gene probabilities which

1076
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,760
is a distinct thing from fitting them

1077
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:23,599
one by one which is done in most

1078
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,359
traditional enrichment analyses and I'll

1079
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:26,560
I'll return to that in a second. You can

1080
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:27,440
kind of see like you know I don't know

1081
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,960
how many of you know about heart

1082
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,319
failure. I don't know much about it but

1083
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:32,000
you know at least the gene sets and the

1084
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:34,800
genes a priori if you look these up they

1085
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,640
all they all kind of make sense. Um, now

1086
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,240
one thing I also want to note is that I

1087
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:40,160
kind of couched this in the language of

1088
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:42,480
inferring mechanisms from a G-W was

1089
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:44,640
where you have the snip data but if you

1090
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:47,040
have direct estimates of gene

1091
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:49,359
probabilities which you often get for a

1092
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,880
rare disease for example you can run the

1093
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:53,040
exact same model it's just here that

1094
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,720
rather than you directly encoding the

1095
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:58,000
gene probabilities you can get that from

1096
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:59,760
like ofet or the genC and then you can

1097
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,359
run the exact same model in any rare

1098
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,960
disease right so this is like you know

1099
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:06,240
kind of a rare form of you know heart

1100
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,599
failure um you know cardiammyopathy and

1101
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,200
you know obviously you can see from that

1102
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:11,200
known log odds that's what we're hard

1103
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:13,280
coding these genes to have a 95%

1104
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:15,680
probability from the data but you still

1105
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:17,119
infer the underlying gene sets and

1106
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:19,280
allows you actually and I'm not going to

1107
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:21,280
touch on this but kind of embed these

1108
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:23,200
rare and common traits in this like kind

1109
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:25,920
of gene set space which has a lot of

1110
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:28,240
interesting implications so the method

1111
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,920
for doing this is called pigeon um and

1112
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,440
the name for this is prior is inferred

1113
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,920
from gene annotations and that's because

1114
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:36,319
the way um we usually I usually talk

1115
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:38,640
about this in its initial motivation was

1116
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:42,319
not to infer mechanisms but to just

1117
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:44,240
infer um gene probabilities and you can

1118
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:45,680
actually show that if you typically

1119
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,760
think of genetic support as the

1120
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:50,720
probability of genes involved in disease

1121
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:52,480
given its associations nearby. If you

1122
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:54,000
augment that to also consider its

1123
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:56,319
annotations and then you fit that

1124
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,720
jointly, you can kind of decompose like

1125
00:44:56,319 --> 00:45:00,400
the estimate into a prior that comes

1126
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:03,520
from the annotations that you learn from

1127
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:05,040
the data and then direct evidence

1128
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,960
typically a base factor for those who

1129
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:08,800
know basian statistics coming from the

1130
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,079
direct data.

1131
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,240
There's another interpretation if you're

1132
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:14,640
familiar with the pops method. um you

1133
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:16,640
can actually show that if you kind of um

1134
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:19,440
do a couple of modifications to kind of

1135
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:21,680
approximate or use shuristics to um kind

1136
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:23,839
of truncate this model you can show that

1137
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:26,240
you get the pops method. So this is kind

1138
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:28,800
of a just a generalization of pops to be

1139
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:31,599
probabilistic and directly fold in you

1140
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:34,079
know both direct evidence and also uh

1141
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:35,760
associations alongside the annotations

1142
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:37,359
um which allows you to kind of you know

1143
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,119
have a justification of what POPS is

1144
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:41,200
doing when it's prioritizing genes at a

1145
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:42,880
locust. But the interpretation I like

1146
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,640
the most actually is thinking about a

1147
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:46,800
new concept of genetic support which I

1148
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,880
call indirect genetic support. So we

1149
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,640
typically think of support for a gene

1150
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:52,880
coming on the left just from the

1151
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:54,640
variance nearby the gene. But on the

1152
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,720
right you can kind of see that support

1153
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:59,760
also comes from mechanisms that the gene

1154
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:01,440
is involved in that you infer are

1155
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:03,440
relevant to the trait and that's from

1156
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:05,520
other genes across the genome that kind

1157
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,880
of implicate the mechanism. So your

1158
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,560
support for a gene actually comes from

1159
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,400
the associations for every gene in the

1160
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:12,400
genome with like the mechanisms that

1161
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:15,359
they share kind of providing that link

1162
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,640
as to how that information flows. So the

1163
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:18,319
way I you know I think you can think

1164
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:20,160
about genes that are relevant to a trait

1165
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:22,319
is actually on an axis of you know two

1166
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:25,200
dimensions right. So on the y- axis is

1167
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:27,760
how much G-W was association

1168
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:30,160
evidence there is for a tra gene and on

1169
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:33,119
the right the x- axis is kind of how

1170
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:34,960
much information there is from um the

1171
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:36,800
you know just from the annotations. I'll

1172
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:38,160
have more to say about this momentarily.

1173
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,599
Um I'm not going to go through too much

1174
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,440
of validation for this. We've done some

1175
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:43,359
extensive validation. I'm just going to

1176
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:46,240
um reference one which is this concept

1177
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:48,319
of relative success. Um Eric Minnlel and

1178
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:49,920
others um here at the Broad wrote this

1179
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:51,760
paper a year ago and the headline

1180
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,440
finding was basically if you have a gene

1181
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:55,920
and it's near a published G-W was

1182
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:58,240
association or a published rare disease

1183
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:00,960
gene it's like 2.6 times more likely to

1184
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:02,480
succeed as a drug target. Um and if you

1185
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:04,800
kind of do we we worked with Eric to do

1186
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:06,880
the exact same calculations and what you

1187
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:09,200
see is for both direct and indirect

1188
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:10,720
support as it increases this on

1189
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,560
continuous scale you have it for every

1190
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:14,400
gene in the genome as you go from no

1191
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:16,400
support up to a very large number you

1192
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:19,119
get a significant increase in relative

1193
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:21,760
success. Um these appear additive so for

1194
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:24,240
whatever threshold you have for direct

1195
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:26,560
support adding indirect increases it

1196
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:28,160
vice versa. Um, this is shown from just

1197
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:29,839
like all of the annotations, but we've

1198
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:31,680
also done this with like a time limited

1199
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:33,359
where you only look at approval after

1200
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:35,040
the date of which the annotations were

1201
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:37,280
developed. Um, and putting it all

1202
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:38,800
together, you have an uptick that you

1203
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:40,880
know relative to like the 2.6fold

1204
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:43,119
six-fold increase from like is it nearby

1205
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:44,960
a published GW was hit. You get a shift

1206
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:47,119
up when you look at like the comparable

1207
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,800
like full probabilities and also of

1208
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:50,560
course a much larger number of targets

1209
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,920
that have support because you know you

1210
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:53,599
have a lot of targets that aren't near

1211
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:56,000
G-W was hits but have suggestive hits

1212
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:57,599
and also all annotations that we're

1213
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,200
inferring.

1214
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:01,119
So we're still working on publishing

1215
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,800
this method but we've applied it to

1216
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:04,560
7,000 traits. You don't actually even

1217
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,240
need full summary statistics to apply

1218
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:08,560
this. You can run it just on a list of

1219
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:11,119
known curated snips from the G-W was

1220
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:13,839
catalog. Um you are welcome to browse

1221
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:15,280
this um at um it's not publicly linked

1222
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:17,839
from any of our portals, but if you just

1223
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:20,560
put slash pigeon at the end of it, you

1224
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:22,240
can type in any phenotype or gene um and

1225
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:24,079
get a sense for how it's working. And if

1226
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:25,599
you have any thoughts of this, please

1227
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:27,440
I'd love to hear from you as we're kind

1228
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:30,160
of working through how it might be of

1229
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:31,359
interest. Um just to kind of walk you

1230
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:33,440
through like some of the basic things

1231
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:35,200
you can do. You can type in any trait.

1232
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:37,200
you get this plot I was showing I think

1233
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:39,839
I switched to coronary artery disease

1234
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:41,359
rather than heart failure but you know

1235
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:43,119
there's a lot of information in these

1236
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:46,000
relationships right so if you expand any

1237
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:47,760
dot on the plot you you can see like you

1238
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,520
know the locus zoom plot that's in this

1239
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:52,160
case contributing to this direct support

1240
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:54,640
log odds of 4.26 26 which is like an 80%

1241
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:56,880
probability and also all the gene sets

1242
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:58,640
that learned that were learned from the

1243
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:00,640
G-W was to actually support this right

1244
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:02,000
so this is like a gene scarb one that's

1245
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,440
kind of like in the upper right hand

1246
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,200
corner of this plot so these are like

1247
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:07,359
very these are all going to be your

1248
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:09,119
completely well-known genes but you can

1249
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:10,800
you know depending on where you go in

1250
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:13,520
this plot depending on your interest of

1251
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:14,800
novelty versus like associations you

1252
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:16,559
know like things in this middle are

1253
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:19,599
slightly more novel like just picking

1254
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:21,760
out one like an example tspo you'll see

1255
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:23,440
kind of where there's not a genomicide

1256
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,720
significant variant nearby it. There's

1257
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:26,559
one that's like near genomide

1258
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:28,000
significant, but when you combine it

1259
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:29,839
with all these annotations for

1260
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,760
cholesterol metabolism, it bumps it up

1261
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:33,440
to have like a probability that might be

1262
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:36,000
higher than a gene that might be an

1263
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:38,240
aector, you know, or you know, that gene

1264
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:41,520
that's not clearly an aector in like a

1265
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:42,960
known locus. Um, one thing I I can't

1266
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,319
talk about, but I think interesting

1267
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,839
perspective is that if you flip this

1268
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:48,319
around and look at genes, you actually

1269
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:50,319
get these incredibly dense fingerprints,

1270
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:52,079
right? So you can almost just trivially

1271
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:53,520
tell from you know across all these

1272
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:56,800
traits for this gene that it's involved

1273
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:58,160
in like heart um muscle function. So it,

1274
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:00,160
you know, caused you to think about is

1275
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:02,640
the real thing I take a G-W was and

1276
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:04,400
define the phenotype and then I get the

1277
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,839
function of the gene or do I just like

1278
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,599
take the gene and look across every

1279
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:09,280
trait and infer the function and like

1280
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:11,119
actually an LMM is really good at

1281
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:12,880
guessing just based on the phenotypes

1282
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:14,240
what the function of the gene is and

1283
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:16,400
that's before even getting that you have

1284
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:17,839
these two axes right so like the traits

1285
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,839
that have both direct and indirect

1286
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:22,160
support or where you have a very clear

1287
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:24,319
coherent biology but you know there are

1288
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:26,800
genes that like you know I saw this on

1289
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:28,400
George's slide where there's like super

1290
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:30,800
well-known annotations but no

1291
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:32,559
associations and kind of the inverse. So

1292
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:34,000
you have these complicated patterns of

1293
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:36,000
almost like these embeddings of these

1294
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:39,200
genes I think tell you a lot about

1295
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:41,599
function. Um but I want to return kind

1296
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:43,920
of the remaining five minutes on back to

1297
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:46,640
this question of mechanisms for for a

1298
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:49,280
gloss. So if you kind of look at the

1299
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:51,599
gene sets that are at the top of the

1300
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:53,680
model, this is for again coronary artery

1301
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:55,280
disease. You can kind of tell by their

1302
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:57,200
labels that they're picking out

1303
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:59,920
different mechanisms, right? So like the

1304
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:01,200
cholesterol metabolism gene set looks

1305
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:03,040
like it's probably a different thing

1306
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:04,319
than the disorganized mioardium. So that

1307
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,839
that one's a wiki pathway for

1308
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:08,319
cholesterol metabolism. The second is a

1309
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:09,680
mouse phenotype. Um this is very

1310
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:10,640
different from traditional enrichment,

1311
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:12,960
right? Because remember we're fitting

1312
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:14,480
this jointly. So if you just sort by the

1313
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:15,920
marginal effects, you get like nothing

1314
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,200
but lipid traits, which is why, you

1315
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:19,280
know, it's kind of similar to BMI where

1316
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,559
we just see all the the brain stuff at

1317
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,800
the top. That's because those are

1318
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:24,480
marginal enrichments in a lot of cases.

1319
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,640
Um, and when you fit it jointly, you

1320
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:28,960
start to decompose into these orthogonal

1321
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:30,400
different mechanisms. Um, and like you

1322
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:32,079
know, if you expand these and see the

1323
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:33,359
genes like you, you know, they are

1324
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:34,960
completely different genes. So, you're

1325
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:38,079
kind of segmenting these genes for the

1326
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:39,520
for the G-W was. But the issue is that

1327
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:42,000
gene sets as I mentioned are not

1328
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:44,800
mechanisms, right? They're tags. You can

1329
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,960
think of noisy incomplete bias tags for

1330
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:48,559
true mechanisms. And so, here's where

1331
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:50,319
though if you model it like this, right?

1332
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:52,000
So imagine you have a matrix this I'm

1333
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:54,640
calling the gene matrix that's the true

1334
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,480
mechanism matrix as I defined it those

1335
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:58,400
are latent you don't observe them and

1336
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:00,960
then you model the gene set matrix as

1337
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:03,119
readouts of those latent mechanisms okay

1338
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:05,760
so we don't observe those but we observe

1339
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:07,119
this gene bygene set matrix and if you

1340
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:09,119
model this that you can show if like

1341
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:10,880
these are plusone like distributions for

1342
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:12,480
the entries a little messy there's

1343
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:14,480
probably a better way to do it you can

1344
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:17,040
use non- negative matrix factorization

1345
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:19,200
to decompose the gene by gene set matrix

1346
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:21,040
and get the underlying latent

1347
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:23,119
inferences. Okay. And it's it's easier

1348
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:26,240
to understand when you see the data. So

1349
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:28,880
for example, um you run the heart

1350
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:31,440
failure um results and you get like a

1351
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:34,240
factor like this that loads on these

1352
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:36,240
different gene sets. Now with an LMM

1353
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:38,079
just based on the gene set labels, you

1354
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:40,079
ask it what do you think this is doing

1355
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:41,920
and can give you a little piffy thing.

1356
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:44,000
Okay. So again, you're kind of

1357
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:46,319
condensing, you know, all of these tag

1358
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:49,760
gene sets on the right for going back to

1359
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:52,079
heart failure into higher order

1360
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:53,040
mechanisms. Okay? And you can tell by

1361
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:54,960
kind of like the heart failure

1362
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:56,400
hypertrophy is probably picking up a

1363
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:59,440
different mechanism than liver lipid

1364
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:01,280
abnormalities and etc. um to give you an

1365
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:03,119
example of what they look like for each

1366
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:05,760
latent mechanism. You have the list of

1367
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:07,680
genes and those have loadings and then

1368
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:09,680
you have you know so this is kind of

1369
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:12,160
that original definition of a mechanism

1370
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:13,839
I define and then you have the loadings

1371
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:15,440
across all the gene sets. So those are

1372
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:17,119
your annotations. It's what allows you

1373
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:20,079
to interpret what the mechanism is

1374
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:22,079
doing. Um that's for heart failure

1375
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:23,520
hypertrophy. This is for liver lipid.

1376
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:26,000
You can tell obviously you know very

1377
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:27,680
different gene sets and different genes.

1378
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,760
Again, they're all labeled just based on

1379
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:31,359
the gene sets, but if you take the genes

1380
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:35,040
in them and then you cross reference

1381
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:36,880
them with like their fwases, you get

1382
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:39,359
what you would expect in most cases. So

1383
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:41,359
on the top, all those genes independent

1384
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:43,920
data, right? Like in associate with a

1385
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:45,599
bunch of lipid traits um from other G-W

1386
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:47,440
was and on the bottom the heart

1387
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:49,760
development abnormality genes associate

1388
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:51,440
more with heart structure traits, right?

1389
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,880
So ideally you'd probably build a joint

1390
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:55,440
model that incorporates these patterns

1391
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:56,720
of traits like Ruth was showing. Um, but

1392
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,800
like you know, this is kind of

1393
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:00,480
illustrating that the even with the bias

1394
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:02,160
and the noisiness of annotations,

1395
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:03,920
they're able to pick out stuff that you

1396
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:07,280
can expect to see from the trade

1397
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:08,960
patterns. Um, it's I really like

1398
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:10,000
browsing these. I encourage you to type

1399
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:11,520
in your favorite trait. There's some

1400
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,839
really intuitive examples like you know

1401
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:15,920
for waist tip ratio. It's a common

1402
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:18,400
marker of um, you know, body fat

1403
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:19,920
distribution. um you get mechanisms for

1404
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:21,839
like the metabolic syndrome which

1405
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:24,800
actually separates for like insulin um

1406
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:26,319
hypoglycemia versus um dysipidemia but

1407
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:28,720
also mechanisms like skeletal

1408
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:31,760
development which of course would also

1409
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:33,920
be relevant to waste ratio.

1410
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:35,680
All right. So, in the final two minutes,

1411
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:37,760
I want to return to this question.

1412
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:39,680
Right? So, this is a really complicated

1413
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:41,680
question that is not directly obvious

1414
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:45,680
how you can just map it to what I just

1415
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:47,200
showed you. But, LMMs are capable of

1416
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:48,960
parsing this and actually doing a very

1417
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,400
good job of inferring what the user

1418
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:53,200
wants with whatever they want to type

1419
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:54,720
in. But, I'm sure most of us are

1420
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:56,319
actually using LMSM for this purpose,

1421
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:58,000
but we're all aware they're only

1422
00:54:56,319 --> 00:54:59,839
searching public data sets. They're

1423
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,160
searching, you know, text, qualitative

1424
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:04,319
assertions. um maybe even not even

1425
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:06,960
searching stuff and kind of informing um

1426
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:08,800
using its only its training to answer.

1427
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:10,160
The way you typically get around that is

1428
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:13,119
through a process called retrieve

1429
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:15,839
augmented generation where the LMM will

1430
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:17,760
like be will fetch data from like a

1431
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:19,440
vector database or a knowledge graph and

1432
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:21,599
you encode your data in that and then

1433
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:23,760
you pass that into the prompt and then

1434
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:25,920
it can kind of like add additional data

1435
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:28,880
to its prompt. But this is like a very

1436
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:30,640
difficult like thing to scale. um you

1437
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:32,000
need to kind of like manually take a G-W

1438
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:34,319
was and like extract all these

1439
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,079
assertions. So here now though you can

1440
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:38,319
think of this as like what I just showed

1441
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:41,520
you is this very highdimensional tensor

1442
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:43,839
right where you have like phenotypes by

1443
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:45,359
genes by mechanisms and there's like a

1444
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:47,839
number for every single entry in the

1445
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:50,240
matrix that's all completely uniformly

1446
00:55:47,839 --> 00:55:52,720
inferred right using human genetics to

1447
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:54,480
calibrate everything ultimately and it's

1448
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:56,000
it's still very complex. So like this is

1449
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:57,760
just like a segment of that like you

1450
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,160
know here the squares are like the

1451
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:02,400
mechanisms and like the diamonds are are

1452
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:04,720
like traits and the circles are genes.

1453
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:06,960
So it's really hard for us to interpret.

1454
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:08,960
But for an AI agent where you make this

1455
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:11,680
available now the successor to rag is

1456
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:13,119
called MCP um and you give it access to

1457
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:15,200
other tools like internet search as well

1458
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:17,440
as its own training. It's actually able

1459
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:19,839
to parse these queries and actually

1460
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:22,720
retrieve the information we've kind of

1461
00:56:19,839 --> 00:56:24,319
embedded and extracted from GWAS. And I

1462
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:26,240
have to stop here and not really give

1463
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:28,000
more details on like kind of the next

1464
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:29,760
step for this but just kind of conclude

1465
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,920
with an illustration that if you don't

1466
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:34,960
even build a real agent but you just

1467
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:36,400
give it a custom GPT on chat GPT you can

1468
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:38,400
see at the top I just pasted in that

1469
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:40,799
query and you can see it kind of like um

1470
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:42,960
infers what you want and knows what

1471
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:44,559
filters to apply to like these combined

1472
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:46,319
indirect and indirect support based on

1473
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:48,240
prompt engineering. it can then

1474
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:50,160
contextualize that with like novelty,

1475
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:52,160
drugability, the competitive landscape,

1476
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:54,000
all of those things it knows pretty well

1477
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:55,839
and actually arrive at like, you know, a

1478
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,920
nice filter like helping you navigate

1479
00:56:55,839 --> 00:56:59,599
this data, you know, and again, it's

1480
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:01,359
because, you know, maybe can't search

1481
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:03,839
G-W was snips directly, but it can

1482
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:06,160
search these higher order relationships.

1483
00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:07,599
So I guess um no I don't know if Molina

1484
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:10,720
you're going to ask me but if a sentence

1485
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:13,839
I would say um to summarize for V2F is

1486
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:16,079
that well I think the problem of like

1487
00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:19,839
every single association can we map at

1488
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:22,000
the function is hard I think the problem

1489
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:23,920
of for a given function do I have

1490
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,240
insights from G-W was that help me make

1491
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:27,839
better decisions in the real world I

1492
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:29,680
think there's an enormous amount of

1493
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:31,359
structure already there and I'm actually

1494
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:33,839
continuously amazed every time I run

1495
00:57:31,359 --> 00:57:36,079
these methods how much G-W was detects

1496
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:37,280
at that statistical level. Um, if you're

1497
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:38,960
interested in learning more, please

1498
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:40,720
contact me. We're working on these

1499
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:43,280
agents and hopefully on our knowledge

1500
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:46,160
portals. You'll see them soon. Um, and

1501
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:47,760
you can also contact me um our lab web

1502
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:49,680
page or also our broader knowledge

1503
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:52,680
portal team. And thank you. I'll take

1504
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:52,680
questions.

1505
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:00,960
Thank you very much for an interesting

1506
00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:02,720
talk and I would definitely personally

1507
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:06,160
be very interested in looking into your

1508
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:08,559
portal. So um any questions from the

1509
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:11,839
audience?

1510
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:13,760
>> Hi Jason. Uh I was curious uh the

1511
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:16,799
linkages which are in linkage dis

1512
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:19,920
equilibria when you put your indirect

1513
00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:22,000
support if a linkage is acting in one

1514
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:24,559
direction in one case and in another

1515
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:28,000
direction in another case how does that

1516
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:30,160
show up on your gene scores?

1517
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,520
>> Are you talking about snip linkages or

1518
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:33,040
you talking about like the

1519
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:34,720
>> snip linkages? So that would all be

1520
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:36,400
encoded in that you know I kind of

1521
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:38,319
glossed over it but that mapping of

1522
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:40,799
given a gene knowledge of whether it's

1523
00:58:38,319 --> 00:58:43,599
disease relevant what snips are

1524
00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:45,520
regulating that gene and you would do

1525
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:47,680
that disease by disease and like you

1526
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:49,040
would use like the snip to gene act all

1527
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:50,720
the work that everyone's being done here

1528
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:52,240
all that has to be encoded in that model

1529
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:53,440
and that can get quite sophisticated

1530
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:55,119
which is why I didn't talk about it

1531
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:58,000
today but the answer is you'd fit that

1532
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:59,520
separately right now for each trait but

1533
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,119
ultimately you would want to fit a joint

1534
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:02,960
model of like every disease at the same

1535
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:05,359
time whereas like knowledge of a causal

1536
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:08,160
variant for one gene would inform that

1537
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:10,720
it's causal for another related disease,

1538
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:12,240
but that's computationally intensive.

1539
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:15,480
So, we're kind of doing that post talk

1540
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:15,480
right now.

1541
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:19,480
>> Questions?

1542
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,000
>> Yeah,

1543
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:36,000
>> we discuss a lot. So if there's anyone

1544
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:38,880
else anyone else can go um great work I

1545
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:41,760
love it Jason as you know um I wonder

1546
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:44,240
about the definition and validation of

1547
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:47,040
mechanism itself which as you say and

1548
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:48,960
acknowledge is massively noisy

1549
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:53,839
particularly when you draw from gene

1550
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:55,440
sets as a prior or proxy for mechanisms

1551
00:59:53,839 --> 00:59:57,440
itself and particularly when we're

1552
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,240
talking about complex diseases

1553
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:01,440
>> right

1554
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:03,520
>> um so What are you thinking about the

1555
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:06,880
next steps of improving the definition

1556
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:10,480
of mechanism itself? And related to this

1557
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:12,480
maybe a separate second question is the

1558
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:14,400
looking at feas jointly modeling

1559
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:17,599
phenomide association studies for a

1560
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:20,240
particular target and drawing conclusion

1561
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:22,000
from that is postulated across the

1562
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:25,839
community currently and I think it's

1563
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:30,079
very helpful to come to prioritization

1564
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:32,480
of cell types tissues maybe cell states

1565
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:34,880
>> I would argue though that the space of

1566
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:36,880
physiological traits cataloged in bio

1567
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:39,440
banks is limited to go down to cellular

1568
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:43,200
mechanisms that are disease driving.

1569
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:46,400
>> Right. So, okay. Um

1570
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:48,880
I think you're correct that. So,

1571
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:51,599
I define an experimental readout of a

1572
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:53,520
mechanism and then I use the current

1573
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:54,960
gene sets as like kind of the state of

1574
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:56,880
what we are. But there's no reason like

1575
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:58,960
your readout has to be a biased curated

1576
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:01,839
thing, right? Your crisper screens and

1577
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:03,359
li all those are actual features. So, I

1578
01:01:01,839 --> 01:01:05,520
think you could envision this almost as

1579
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:07,599
like a fine mapping. Again this analogy

1580
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:09,520
of like the current mechanisms are

1581
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:12,240
tagged snips right the initial hatmap 2

1582
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:14,079
was very biased so now can you like fill

1583
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:18,079
that out with like more fine mapping of

1584
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:20,720
those mechanisms for example um I think

1585
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:22,480
second like yes I I right now we are not

1586
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:25,200
really thinking it right now about how

1587
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:26,880
to model more details of what's going on

1588
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:28,480
within a mechanism beyond the group of

1589
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:31,520
genes the hope here would be that this

1590
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:33,280
would kind of get you at just the area

1591
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:34,799
like a set of genes and then that would

1592
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:36,000
narrow your search space and you're

1593
01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:38,160
ultimately going to have to do more

1594
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,200
experiments. The feed loss approach the

1595
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:40,640
third thing what I find really

1596
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:43,440
fascinating is you can take like a

1597
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:46,720
mandelian disease gene just run it based

1598
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:49,200
on the genomwide association studies map

1599
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:51,119
through this method give an LMM like the

1600
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:53,680
just the pattern of associations and it

1601
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:55,680
can guess the mandelian disease like

1602
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:57,040
much more significantly above chance. So

1603
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:58,559
what it tells me is that when you look

1604
01:01:57,040 --> 01:02:01,359
across enough traits, you can get at

1605
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:02,799
like very very very specific phenotypes

1606
01:02:01,359 --> 01:02:05,119
and you

1607
01:02:02,799 --> 01:02:07,920
>> and you may not need to necessarily like

1608
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:09,680
be as worried about a finding people

1609
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:10,319
with that phenotype in a bio bank if

1610
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:11,599
that makes sense.

1611
01:02:10,319 --> 01:02:13,760
>> It it makes complete sense and I

1612
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:16,799
completely believe that it's um powerful

1613
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:18,960
to predict the phenotype. What I wonder

1614
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:21,200
about is the mechanism the mechanism

1615
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:23,040
driven by you know at the cellular level

1616
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:24,720
is this you know

1617
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:26,480
>> so I can Yeah. Yeah. So like I just ran

1618
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:27,920
a quick test yesterday like for plin one

1619
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:29,839
right which is this rare disease gene.

1620
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:31,680
It's involved in atapost expan right so

1621
01:02:29,839 --> 01:02:33,599
you give it just the feas plot you say

1622
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:35,520
lmm what function do you think this is

1623
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:38,000
and it guesses atapost expansion even

1624
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:40,559
though there's no g-wets for it. So the

1625
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,160
so the question is like is that a useful

1626
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:44,079
definition of mechanism? I don't know

1627
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:46,640
there's a there's a resolution at which

1628
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:48,160
you're going to run out but I think the

1629
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:49,920
answer is can you at least narrow it

1630
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:51,839
enough and then like find math quote

1631
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:53,359
unquote within that space to fill it out

1632
01:02:51,839 --> 01:02:54,400
more. It's kind of how I'm thinking

1633
01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:56,079
about it. But yeah, there's no

1634
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:58,880
substitute for doing experiments,

1635
01:02:56,079 --> 01:03:01,880
obviously. Yeah. All right.

1636
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:01,880
>> Yeah.
