00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:08,720
Our rounding out our presentations today

2
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:10,559
is nine diagnostics with AI powered

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,880
nanoensor technology for precision

4
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,360
medicine and monitoring. Welcoming CEO

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,960
and co-founder Freddy Wyn. I just want

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,800
to thank the ILP and the startup

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,560
exchange for having us today. So my name

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,640
is Freddy Wyn. I'm a physician scientist

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,080
engineer by training but I'm the CEO

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,039
co-founder of Nang Diagnostics where

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,640
we're really trying to work on

12
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,960
determining treatment effectiveness

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,559
discovering new biology using our AI

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,399
enabled nano nanoensor technology cancer

15
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:35,840
diagnostics and biotools are evolving

16
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,440
towards really more comprehensive

17
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,040
profiling across the R&D and

18
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,040
manufacturing pipeline as you've heard

19
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,239
throughout all the talks today but some

20
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,160
of the challenges are there's still

21
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,160
limited biomarker insights which really

22
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,399
slows that real-time feedback that we

23
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,920
can use there's been poor stratification

24
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,000
has been driving the drug development

25
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,920
failures and there's fragmented data

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,320
that really undermines the promise of

27
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,840
precision medicine and current

28
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,800
diagnostics and tools that are being

29
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,800
used are slow, expensive and hard to

30
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,879
scale. And so up until now we've largely

31
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,040
been limited to validate biomarkers. But

32
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,960
at nine diagnostics now we can unlock

33
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,520
insights from unknown biomarkers and

34
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,600
contextual clinical patient data. And we

35
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,360
combine all of that together to create a

36
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,240
new signature fingerprint using the

37
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,159
technology at N Diagnostics.

38
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,840
How does our technology work? It's based

39
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,600
on sigma on carbon nanot tubes which you

40
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,840
heard about earlier from Angela

41
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,439
Belchure. Um but what we now can do to

42
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,720
it is surface chemistry that allows us

43
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,400
to introduce quantum well defects to

44
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,200
those carbon tubes and really get a

45
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,280
variety of types of carbon tubes. And

46
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,560
then we wrap DNA sequences around it to

47
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,759
provide that binding sensitivity and

48
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,759
specificity around of the of the sensor.

49
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,759
And we can detect everything from large

50
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,759
proteins down to small molecules. But

51
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,960
now you can see with all these or all

52
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:51,200
these um excuse me access of variables

53
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,759
uh we can have an unlimited uh s library

54
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,079
of nano sensors and then we mix our

55
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,320
sensors with uh a patient sample right

56
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,759
now we use plasma uh proteins is what

57
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,920
we're looking at. So looking at the

58
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,320
plasma layer uh we don't need any extra

59
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,000
sample prep and then we uh look at it

60
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,959
through a high throughput near infrared

61
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,319
fluoresence uh

62
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:12,400
system and once we look at that

63
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,640
interaction we really can create these

64
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,560
signature fingerprints and then we start

65
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,920
incorporating the clinical data from the

66
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,599
patient including their medication

67
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,520
history their coexisting diseases their

68
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,520
migraphics information social

69
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,400
environmental factors and then really

70
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,319
develop that AIM ML model and disease

71
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,680
state

72
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:31,360
classification some of Our earlier data

73
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,680
has been on developing screening

74
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,920
diagnostics. One has been for high-grade

75
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,720
serious ovarian carcinoma. The second

76
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:41,040
has been in differentiation in the brain

77
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,160
cancer space. And you can see even with

78
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,319
these two early validation studies, uh

79
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,040
we've been able to develop assays with

80
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:52,200
sensitivities in the 80 mid 80 to upper

81
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:55,920
80% as well as specificities in that 95

82
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:58,319
98%. And all only needing about 200 in

83
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,519
the first one 269 samples. The second

84
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:03,200
one only 690 samples of to use and

85
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,800
really a relatively short development

86
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,080
timeline in terms of only 3 to six

87
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,680
months. And so some of the more

88
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,440
interesting and newest data that we have

89
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,280
is that we've been trying to figure out

90
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,519
well we can detect known biomarkers but

91
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,040
also unknown ones. So how do we

92
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,040
determine what those unknown ones? So

93
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,560
we've been developing the pipeline for

94
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,800
determining what those proteins are. So

95
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,800
from our most recent early brain cancer

96
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,800
work right now we've been able to

97
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,200
identify 37 proteins that our sensors

98
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,319
responded to. And these are known to be

99
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,239
associated with the tumor cells

100
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,680
themselves the tumor micro environment

101
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,920
as well as the systemic immune

102
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,159
inflammatory response. So that really

103
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,680
allows us to do simultaneous detection

104
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,599
identification of relevant unique

105
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,480
biomarkers without knowing what those

106
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:46,159
proteins are ahead of time. And so

107
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,920
that's really going to allow us to lead

108
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,760
to new discovery and new biological

109
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,280
insights and better understanding of

110
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,640
what treatment response

111
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,319
works. In terms of our technology, we

112
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,799
use small volume samples. Right now, we

113
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,480
can use just 300 microL of the plasma

114
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,480
layer. Um, but we're working on trying

115
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,959
to get that smaller. We can create these

116
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,640
unique signature fingerprint profiles.

117
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,519
We have a rapid assay development time

118
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:12,159
of only three to six months. And it's a

119
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,480
very cost-effective and rapid testing

120
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:16,400
technology. currently less than $5 per

121
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,199
sample in a research environment, less

122
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,919
than five minutes to run per sample and

123
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:24,639
can continue to uh develop reliably high

124
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:26,560
sensor performance. And so the way that

125
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,639
we work with our partners is through a

126
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,320
code discovery process to build

127
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,160
processing local technologies or invitro

128
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,320
diagnostic tools uh where we bring the

129
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,680
AI enabled nanosensor technology. Our

130
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,000
partners bring the bio samples, the

131
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,759
contextual data together we build these

132
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,360
high performing assets that can provide

133
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,080
that actual insights that you're looking

134
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,840
for. Here's an example of how we've been

135
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,680
working with one of our other academic

136
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,520
partner at UCSF in terms of trying to

137
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,520
think about endotyping to treat. So now

138
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,120
really moving the paradigm towards how

139
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,800
do we classify patients based on what

140
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,320
they're most likely to respond to as

141
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,040
opposed to purely on the screening

142
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,040
diagnostic side. And nine diagnostic

143
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,040
aims to transform the R&D value chain to

144
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,120
achieve that acceleration process reduce

145
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,120
risk and proves the sex risk. Right now

146
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,440
we're focusing on the discovery, the

147
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,160
translational science and the biom biio

148
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,919
manufacturing part of the pipeline.

149
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,280
So at 99 we're trying to make smarter

150
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,240
decisions across the R&D and

151
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,320
manufacturing pipeline

152
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,840
uh and through by developing a high

153
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,840
throughput proteomics and metabolics

154
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,800
platform technology really for rapid

155
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,160
biomarker discovery and response

156
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,240
readouts. Our team has had 20 years of

157
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,360
experience in this space over 20 plus

158
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,840
patents have been filed in the nanom

159
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,520
materials nano technologies place and uh

160
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,840
this is now the fourth startup that's

161
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,560
spun out of my co-founder Dan Hiller uh

162
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:44,440
who is also an alum for MIT as well. So,

163
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,440
thank you so much for your time.
