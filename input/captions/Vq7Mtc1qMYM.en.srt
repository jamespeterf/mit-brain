00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,799
Hi everyone, welcome back to the

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:08,000
introductory uh series for the obesity

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:10,639
machine learning competition. Uh today

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,759
uh we'll be talking about uh the data.

5
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:16,160
This is the third uh and final lecture.

6
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,880
Uh and specifically uh we'll be talking

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,560
about uh the experiment uh harnessing

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,279
the technologies that we spoke about in

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:26,400
the second lecture um was performed to

10
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:28,720
generate the data. uh and then we'll uh

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,519
discuss how the data actually looks like

12
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,280
the the data object that you'll be um

13
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,840
working with

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,600
and finally we'll talk about the three

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,600
uh crunches the task that you'll be

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,600
performing

17
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,160
uh and so uh as I mentioned we'll break

18
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,440
this up into three part going over first

19
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,920
of all uh the perturbse experiment uh on

20
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,920
adiposite cells to generate the data

21
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,239
then uh the data objects that you'll be

22
00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:01,000
working with and finally uh the three

23
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:01,000
crunches uh or the three challenges.

24
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:08,159
Okay, so just a quick recap. Hopefully

25
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,799
by now uh you're familiar with uh this

26
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,600
scheme and the different uh adiposite uh

27
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,880
cells that we see uh in adapost tissue.

28
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,200
Some that are associated with

29
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,640
differentiation uh and others that are

30
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:23,040
associated with um specific flavors of

31
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,759
metabolic activity.

32
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,400
We also discussed um how these are

33
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:31,119
therapeutically uh relevant because uh

34
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,520
we know that different proportions um

35
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,520
that deviate from uh the normal of these

36
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:39,840
different cell populations uh are

37
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,680
actually linked to uh obesity.

38
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,799
And finally we spoke about the gene

39
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:47,439
expression programs which uh govern each

40
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,360
of these different cell populations. Um

41
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,680
and we also spoke about the specific

42
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,759
functions that individual uh genes

43
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,200
within these gene expression programs

44
00:01:53,759 --> 00:02:00,240
have. So for example we spoke about um

45
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,560
the capacity of the padiposytes to

46
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:06,719
proliferate in the presence uh or when

47
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,560
PDGFRA is active and also uh the ability

48
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:13,120
of the adiposytes to signal to other

49
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:16,080
tissues uh when adipoq is active.

50
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,760
The issue, however, was that uh while we

51
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,599
know information for some of these genes

52
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,680
in the gene expression programs and some

53
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:24,400
of their functions, we'd like a more

54
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,200
systematic uh whole transcriptto view of

55
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,040
what's going on. Um and so on the

56
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,599
experimental side, we learn about this

57
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,920
technology called perturbse um which

58
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:36,400
allows us to both delete individual

59
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,599
genes in the cells and then measure the

60
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:43,200
gene expression profiles um in those

61
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:45,440
same cells. And so uh one aspect of this

62
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,319
is this gene editing technology called

63
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,959
crisper cast 9. Uh the the cast 9

64
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:53,360
nucleas which is directed to individual

65
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:56,319
genes in individual cells and inserts

66
00:02:53,360 --> 00:03:00,400
these uh doublestranded DNA breaks uh

67
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:02,480
breaking the function of the gene.

68
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,599
And the second component is combining

69
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,920
this pertubation with uh single cell RNA

70
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:10,560
sequencing. So this is the schematic of

71
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,920
individual uh cells being isolated in

72
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,560
these droplets uh barcoded um for then

73
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,440
downstream uh uh counting of the

74
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,519
individual RNA molecules uh i.e. the

75
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,760
expression levels of every gene. And so,

76
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,319
BetabSeek is really the combination uh

77
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,720
of these two technologies allowing us to

78
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:31,440
get the uh transcripttos with the

79
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,560
individual RNA molecules uh in the

80
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,640
different cells as well as the identity

81
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,599
uh of the gene that was knocked out in

82
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,840
that cell in this case denoted by A or

83
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,920
B.

84
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,840
And so, combining this, combining the

85
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,440
biology and the technology, what's the

86
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,440
experiment that was actually uh

87
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:53,760
performed? Uh so first of all this was

88
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:56,080
performed um by three expert scientists

89
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,640
uh at the Broad Institute uh experts on

90
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:03,920
adiposite biology

91
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:07,519
and um what the team did was uh to take

92
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:09,840
preadiposytes and differentiate them in

93
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,680
uh the lab in a dish. So this is very

94
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,319
exciting already because it means that

95
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,920
the kinds of gene expression programs uh

96
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:19,600
that we've been talking about that we

97
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:21,680
know exist in uh tissue in people uh

98
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,880
like the differentiation programs and

99
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,639
the metabolic programs. Um this means

100
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:31,360
that we can actually study that now in

101
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:33,919
the lab uh in a dish. And so um this

102
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,479
differentiation protocol lasts 14 days.

103
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,400
And so you can imagine uh that roughly

104
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:41,759
speaking uh initially we have a

105
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:44,160
population of just priiposites and after

106
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,800
these 14 days we may still have some

107
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,759
priiposites shown here in blue uh but

108
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,080
we'll also have uh generated this more

109
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:55,440
differentiated population of adiposytes

110
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:58,560
shown in uh pink or red. And so this is

111
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:01,520
step one uh and what uh Thiago and the

112
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:05,199
team did was to combine this with uh

113
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:07,039
pertubations. So um knocking out as

114
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:11,199
we've spoken about individual genes in

115
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:12,720
these cells um at day zero and then

116
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:16,160
proceeding with the differentiation

117
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,880
protocol and then finally at day 14

118
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,880
performing uh the perturbse experiment

119
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,840
uh to both get the transcripttos of the

120
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:27,039
resulting cells at this day 14 but also

121
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,120
know whether um whether a partic which

122
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,800
gene uh was knocked out in each of these

123
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,639
cells.

124
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,120
So shown here is just an example with

125
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:38,800
one gene, let's say the red gene. Uh but

126
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,960
in reality uh they tried many different

127
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,199
um pertubations in a pulled format and

128
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,759
so every cell would receive uh a

129
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:48,080
different gene.

130
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,479
The second experiment um which is the

131
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,160
data set for uh crunch 2, the first

132
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,560
experiment was the data set for crunch

133
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,199
one. Um and so in this second experiment

134
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,720
the setup is very very similar. The only

135
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,360
difference is that now rather than

136
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,280
single gene knockouts um what the team

137
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,400
did was actually knock out two different

138
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,639
genes uh in every cell.

139
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,039
And so again this is reflecting the

140
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,000
pertubation um the actual uh

141
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:16,639
doublestranded uh break that happens in

142
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,280
the cells. um and then subsequently

143
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,840
again um the cells were profiled by

144
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:24,240
perturbse and those um double

145
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,800
perturbation identities those double

146
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,800
gene uh knockout identities uh

147
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,800
retrieved.

148
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:35,039
So um just to comment on uh the double

149
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,120
gene uh pertubation screen something

150
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:40,960
that is worth considering uh when you

151
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:43,919
build your models um here is a scheme of

152
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:46,160
a the hypothetical pertubation effect of

153
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,880
knocking out gene one. So let's say it

154
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,039
has a perturbation effect of one um and

155
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,039
then the pertubation effect uh on the

156
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,960
cell of knocking out gene two which

157
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:58,800
we'll say also has a perturbation effect

158
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:01,759
of one. Now uh one kind of naive model

159
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,720
might expect that uh the combination of

160
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:07,759
these two knockouts so knocking out both

161
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,160
gene one and gene two in the same cell

162
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,160
uh would lead you to pertubation effect

163
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,880
uh of two. This is what I call the

164
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,960
additive expectation. But in reality we

165
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,440
see um all sorts of interactions between

166
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,080
genes um that deviate from this

167
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,639
expectation. So uh here are two extreme

168
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,880
examples that I'm showing. one of what

169
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,880
we call a synergistic relationship

170
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,639
between gene one and gene two where

171
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,440
actually the combined effect of knocking

172
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:36,160
both of these genes out is far greater

173
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,479
uh than the um expectation based on just

174
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,479
summing their individual perturbation

175
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,639
effects.

176
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:45,039
And conversely, you can also have

177
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:48,639
antagonistic relationships where the

178
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:51,280
combined effect uh is less than uh you

179
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:55,960
would expect based on uh the sum of gene

180
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,960
one and gene 2 effects alone.

181
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,440
Okay. And so uh the outputs uh of both

182
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,759
of these data sets in the single gene

183
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,759
knockout and in the double gene knockout

184
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,319
um perturbosite

185
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:11,440
cells uh this is the output that you'll

186
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:15,120
get. Uh so on the left here we have the

187
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:17,759
single cell RNA um expression matrix

188
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,560
with every row corresponding to a

189
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,960
different gene in the genome um and

190
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,199
every column corresponding to a

191
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,759
different uh adiposite cell that was

192
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,160
profiled um at day 14 after the

193
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:33,360
differentiation treatment.

194
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:36,240
And every value inside um the matrix

195
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:39,120
corresponds to uh the RNA counts for

196
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,440
that gene in that cell or the um as we

197
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,159
refer to it more generally generally uh

198
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,839
the gene expression level.

199
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,959
So that's one part and then the second

200
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:52,000
part is this pertubation identity matrix

201
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:53,839
where we'll be able to say for a given

202
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,399
uh gene expression profile in a given

203
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:58,720
cell whether that same cell received a

204
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,959
pertubation or not and if it did what

205
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,959
pertubation it received i.e. what gene

206
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,880
was knocked out or perhaps for cell

207
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,880
three, what pair of genes was knocked

208
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,880
out.

209
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,800
And then finally, it's important to note

210
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,600
that there are also in the data set uh

211
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,200
some cells which won't have had any gene

212
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,680
knocked out. We call these the

213
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,320
non-targeting controls. Uh in the data

214
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:26,880
set, they're they're referred to as NC.

215
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:29,120
Um and uh these are a important uh and

216
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,959
uh revealing population because we can

217
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,279
compare the effects of the pertubations

218
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:37,040
from uh for example in cell one the

219
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:38,959
effect of MLX IPL to this uh wild type

220
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,360
population that didn't have any gene

221
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:43,519
knocked out at all.

222
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,160
Okay. So just to review on the uh

223
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:49,200
experiments um that on the data sets

224
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,120
generated by these experiments.

225
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,760
So first of all uh in terms of the

226
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,600
number of genes knocked out uh in the

227
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,440
first data set the data set for crunch

228
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:02,399
one there are 166 single gene knockouts

229
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:05,760
uh and we'll hold out 10 to 15% of these

230
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,519
uh for evaluation

231
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:12,160
and then in the second data set there

232
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:15,120
are 105 uh combinations of uh knockouts.

233
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:18,560
So 105 uh double pertubations and again

234
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:21,560
we'll hold out 10 to 15 uh% of this for

235
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,560
evaluation.

236
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,399
And so how were those genes selected? Um

237
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:31,360
for this we consulted experts uh in the

238
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:33,760
field uh adiposite experts uh and they

239
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,480
chose uh genes that they believe uh

240
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,880
could be relevant to uh obesity. And so

241
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:42,279
this is the uh set of genes that we

242
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,279
focused on.

243
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:48,800
And finally, as I mentioned, yes, there

244
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:50,959
are negative controls. Um, these are

245
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,440
cells that uh did not receive any

246
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:55,600
genetic pertubation. Uh, and we call

247
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,440
these the non-targeting controls and

248
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,360
you'll be able to identify them in the

249
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,160
data sets that you receive uh because

250
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,240
they'll have this NC um annotation

251
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:07,880
rather than the name of a gene under the

252
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,880
pertubation column.
