00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:06,240
Hello everyone listening and watching.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:09,040
Uh welcome to this short video where I'm

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,599
going to give you a demo of how to use

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,599
the interactive mapping module of the

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:16,480
protein institute genomics to proteins

6
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,640
portal a discovery platform to link

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:22,000
genetics training outputs to protein

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:25,359
sequence and structure. Um so as we

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,920
access this uh module it is going to ask

10
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:32,320
um you to sign in using your Gmail

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:34,800
address. So let's do that and after

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,040
continuing we will land up in this

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,320
homepage for interactive ma mapping

14
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:42,800
module with two different subm modules.

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,360
You can start with a human gene protein

16
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,480
identifier or you can also just uh start

17
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,559
with um a protein structure. So in this

18
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,879
particular tutorial I'm going to give

19
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,600
you a demo of the workflow starting with

20
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:58,640
own protein structure and the previous

21
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:01,760
tutorial that is published has the demo

22
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:04,559
for um starting with the gene protein

23
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:07,119
identifier. So let's begin the workflow.

24
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,360
Um here the first step is uploading a

25
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,840
structure which you can either predict

26
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:15,439
from alphafold or you can download from

27
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:18,000
protein datab bank. So I'm going to use

28
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,799
um a structure that I have downloaded

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,080
here 605i

30
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:27,600
uh mmcif file and there are one chains

31
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:31,280
available here chain A. I will uh select

32
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,920
that chain and hit load with that. Now

33
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:37,200
you have a sequence viewer where the

34
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:40,320
sequence um um that is parsed from the

35
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,159
structure is mapped and also you can see

36
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,799
the structure

37
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:47,759
uh and then you also now can upload uh

38
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:51,200
annotations. The allowable formats for

39
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:54,079
annotations for mutations score and

40
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,399
features are shown here. So we'll close

41
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,920
it and we'll load the sample

42
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,320
annotations.

43
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,719
Uh important to note that you can either

44
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,680
paste your annotation in this comma or

45
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:08,720
tab separated format or you can also

46
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,440
upload your data as CSV or Excel file

47
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:15,680
and you can in fact continue without um

48
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:18,720
any annotations at all. So we'll start

49
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,840
we will um go with these mutations and

50
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:25,920
uh submit the annotations

51
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:29,440
um and this um cells will be editable as

52
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:33,040
I have demonstrated um in the previous

53
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:36,560
video uh of for demo with starting with

54
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:40,319
protein with a gene protein identifier.

55
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:45,360
So we'll submit these annotations

56
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:49,200
and now um these mutations are mapped

57
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:51,760
onto the structure. Um so I demonstrated

58
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,519
it previously but we can change the

59
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,360
colors of these annotations. For

60
00:02:53,519 --> 00:03:01,760
example, um if I want to show the benign

61
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:06,400
mutations in blue, um and then denovo

62
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:10,959
mutations in orange.

63
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:13,680
Now we have the benigns mapped as

64
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:17,040
the desired color and then pathogenic

65
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,440
and then the denovo mutations. Now after

66
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,159
executing this workflow, you can share

67
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:25,200
this uh workflow with u um

68
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:28,959
collaborator's email address. So I'm

69
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:31,920
going to just um type in

70
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,680
sample email address here. And now I'm

71
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,519
creating a link. You can also add

72
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,440
another email address. So you can share

73
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,560
with multiple collaborators at the same

74
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:43,280
time. Then it takes uh you to create

75
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:47,599
link. Now after you have created the

76
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:52,720
link we can copy it and try to paste it

77
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:55,360
um in the browser now um it will ask the

78
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,920
your collaborator to log in using that

79
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:01,519
authorized email address

80
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:05,120
um which I'm doing here and after that

81
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:08,640
uh the uh collaborator need to uh needs

82
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,640
to paste this link one more time to load

83
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,360
this entire session that you have

84
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:16,639
created. it um and then the

85
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,400
collaborators can see um the output of

86
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,840
the session.

87
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:24,479
Um so hope this is helpful uh to use and

88
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:27,120
execute workflows uh using the broad

89
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,360
institute genomics to proteins portal

90
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,080
interactive mapping module to analyze

91
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,080
your own data.
