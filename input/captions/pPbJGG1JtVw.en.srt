1
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,760
Um I'm very interested to know uh your

2
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,520
experiences from last class. Um what

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,800
your thoughts were on the NETP

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,960
discussion and the small groupoup

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,320
conversations that you have. Did anybody

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,199
did anybody find themselves in

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,199
conversations that were of interest?

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:37,520
I think my group like it was a lot of

9
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,160
discussion on how like they themselves

10
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,200
are like trying to bring about these new

11
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:45,280
innovations. Um but a lot of this like

12
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,360
teacher lashback and like some people

13
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,360
are having a really hard time like

14
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,800
moving forwards and then like some

15
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,039
people are doing a good job because it's

16
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,879
all them agreeing that like they need to

17
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,280
get those who are proactive about it

18
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,039
like all together. Um, I also thought it

19
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,160
was interesting like I kind of proposed

20
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,879
a question to the group about like how

21
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,360
they see like all of these ideologies

22
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,520
like playing a part um in higher

23
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,119
education. Um, a lot of the times like

24
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,520
specifically the research that you guys

25
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,360
do is kind of focus on K through 12.

26
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,360
Yeah. But like how can this really be

27
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,840
implemented in colleges and especially

28
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,240
like at a university like MIT where you

29
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,600
have professors being hired not because

30
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,000
they're good teachers but because

31
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,280
they're experts in the field. Um, and I

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,720
think that it just kind of like prompted

33
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,439
an interesting discussion about um, like

34
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,680
where schools need to prioritize like

35
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:39,079
whether they're research institutions or

36
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,600
like educational facilities.

37
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:45,119
Cool. Other folks, what else did you end

38
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:47,040
up talking about um, with your ed new

39
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,799
education school colleagues or what else

40
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,399
was interesting to you about the

41
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,880
national education tech plan discussion

42
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,880
or anything else?

43
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,640
Ty and then Omar. Yeah, it was

44
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,240
interesting. Omar and I were in the same

45
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,280
group.

46
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,800
So, let's see if this overlaps, but

47
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:11,520
uh there wasn't a ton of conversation in

48
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,800
our group, but they did they did ask me

49
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,800
about my time as like a software

50
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,640
engineer and how we thought about like

51
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,160
iteration and in the software

52
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,760
development space and how then they

53
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,080
tried to start making parallels to how

54
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,360
they try to implement it in their own

55
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,720
schools. and we talked a little bit

56
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,720
about some of the differences and where

57
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,239
things might be more complex or harder.

58
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,280
Um, so that was like an interesting

59
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,200
conversation to try to take my

60
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,360
experience and reapply it. That's cool.

61
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,239
That's great.

62
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,599
Yeah. So again, there wasn't that much

63
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:38,640
discussion. You kind of went over what I

64
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,040
was going to say. So I guess I'll touch

65
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,440
on I'll touch on the the first part of

66
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,280
the session like the big uh

67
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,640
conversation. I was reading the chat and

68
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,640
it was pretty cool to see like everybody

69
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,160
like commenting on everything and and

70
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,080
seeing like a bunch of examples and

71
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,400
seeing either frustrations or

72
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:58,640
revelations that they never realized.

73
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:01,599
Mhm. About like you know the message of

74
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:05,760
focusing on not the technology itself

75
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:07,360
but like what what we can do and then

76
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,200
how technology can help and what we're

77
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,200
trying to do first. Um and that

78
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,120
revelation for a lot of um these

79
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,040
professionals is pretty cool to see like

80
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,560
develop in the chat. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah.

81
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,640
You get to you get to watch human

82
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,120
development in real time people

83
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,959
encounter whether with I I didn't follow

84
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,159
it that closely because I was talking.

85
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,519
Um did uh were there frustrations that

86
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,080
any anything on the frustration side

87
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,760
that sort of stuck out to you or seemed

88
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,680
memorable? Not necessarily frustration,

89
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:38,319
but sort of like, oh, that's why like

90
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,680
this is happening or like why. Okay, now

91
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,760
this is starting to make sense. So, it's

92
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:45,720
sort of like where frustrations were

93
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:48,480
like cleared up, so to say. Great.

94
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,000
Good. Hi, Armon. You got to come up here

95
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,599
and hang out with me. That's what

96
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,200
happens when you get towards the end.

97
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,840
Yeah. Also, Also and I were in the same

98
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,680
group. We had a spicy one.

99
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,360
Yeah. So like a lot of the discussion

100
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:04,560
was about um like a lot of the people in

101
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,400
our group or like the people like

102
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,319
designing the structures that they were

103
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,640
trying to implement and something that

104
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,959
was interesting was this like repeated

105
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,400
like oh like we designed something we

106
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,239
send it to like the administration

107
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,840
they're like no that's not exactly what

108
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,160
we're looking for trying it and it's

109
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,079
just kind of like constantly trying to

110
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,600
get something that they're like okay

111
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,240
like I like this as opposed to

112
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:30,720
like them being able to

113
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:34,160
like effectively communicate the points

114
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,840
that they want included. This was very

115
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,280
interesting. Or part part of the way I

116
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,680
read our group is that we had some

117
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:43,360
people who were kind of middle level

118
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,360
leaders um and they were trying to

119
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,520
convince more senior leaders to make

120
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,120
change and the senior leaders were much

121
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,360
slower and less interesting in that

122
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,520
which happens in basically every kind of

123
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,040
institution. like when you go and visit

124
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,639
an institution, one way to think about

125
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:01,360
it is it is designed exactly to do what

126
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,960
it's doing right now. Um that like the

127
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,040
like it functions the way it functions

128
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,120
because there's some set of actors who

129
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,320
want it to function that way. Um often

130
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,919
those folks are sort of people with

131
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,360
power and control and you know it exists

132
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,960
the way it does because that's what they

133
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,639
want. And then new people come along,

134
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,160
new people live in that environment and

135
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,199
they're like, well, this could be better

136
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,479
and this could be better and this could

137
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,240
be better and this could be better. And

138
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,520
then more senior folks are like, ah, but

139
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,880
we like the way we've done it all the

140
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,160
time. And so it's not uncommon for

141
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,320
people coming out. You know, I think

142
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,080
really healthy organizations sort of

143
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,520
recognize like, oh, we need to be

144
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,919
constantly improving. And constantly

145
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,840
improving means like throwing away and

146
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,039
destroying things that I have built over

147
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,000
my career because that's the only way

148
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,440
you sort of get better. Um, but pretty

149
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,360
understandable that people wouldn't feel

150
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,560
that way. like I've spent my career

151
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,720
building this thing. Why don't we just

152
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,960
keep doing this thing? Um and so they

153
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,960
were sort of struggling with uh you know

154
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,320
and in an interesting place where lots

155
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,240
of people in lots of organizations find

156
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,680
themselves is like okay we need to do

157
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,240
something different but the people in

158
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,400
charge aren't really supportive like how

159
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,560
do we kind of do it anyway like how do

160
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,560
you know like where change comes from I

161
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,400
don't know maybe I mentioned this I I

162
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,680
can't remember I can't remember if I

163
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,199
mentioned this particular story but one

164
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,720
of the people that I worked with on some

165
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,240
of the content that's in Iterate is this

166
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,759
guy Peter Sen who's at the management

167
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,960
school at uh Sloan um And a neat thing

168
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,560
about working with him is he's done a

169
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,840
ton of stuff in education but lots of

170
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,280
stuff in many other sectors. Um and it

171
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,960
you know it comes up periodically like

172
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,240
man you know teachers like lots of

173
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,080
people in education just don't feel

174
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,759
empowered to make change. Um they feel

175
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,680
like look I got hired in this particular

176
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,880
role like I'm a I'm a math teacher. I'm

177
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,560
a history teacher. I'm a chemistry

178
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,800
professor. Like it's not my job to fix

179
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,160
the university. Um and Peter once said

180
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,400
something to me along the lines of

181
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,639
everyone in every industry feels that

182
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,000
way. Like they're like CEOs don't feel

183
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,280
like they're empowered to make change in

184
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,240
the institute. Nobody feels like they're

185
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,520
empowered to make change in

186
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,800
institutions, but change still happens

187
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,800
all the time because people who don't

188
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,800
necessarily feel empowered still take it

189
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:54,000
upon themselves to try new things, put

190
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,680
new things in the world. Um, and uh um I

191
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,280
don't know, it's it's it's a story I

192
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,800
really like to retell educators because

193
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,160
it's like this is not an education

194
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,319
specific problem. This is like a human

195
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,000
problem. Yeah. Um I thought what Lou

196
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,360
said from the University of Kentucky was

197
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,520
really fascinating because I'm actually

198
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,680
from Kentucky um and I worked at an

199
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,360
organiz organization with her before

200
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,039
called the Kentucky Student Voice team.

201
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,560
All right, cool. And the way that they

202
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,880
like impact change is by putting

203
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,720
students in like stakeholder positions.

204
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,560
So, um instead of like influencing

205
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,080
change through like ineffective ways

206
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,319
like administration, they put students

207
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,319
like at the forefront. So, she's like a

208
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,440
really big leader in like driving I

209
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,800
guess like educational change in

210
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,080
Kentucky. So, I thought it was cool.

211
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,840
That's great. Oh, I'm glad you had that

212
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,240
connection. That's fun. How did you how

213
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,919
you had So, she at the university ran

214
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,280
the sort of student voice thing that

215
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,800
like high school students across

216
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,479
Kentucky could participate in and stuff

217
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,360
or Yeah. So, it was born out of

218
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,319
something called the Pritchard

219
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,199
Committee, but now it's like an

220
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:47,680
independent organization. And the I

221
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,639
guess organization has like adults and

222
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,240
younger students as like co- peers. Like

223
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,479
they put them on like the same level,

224
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,080
the hierarchy to like work together to

225
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,919
um I guess craft a bunch of initiatives

226
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,319
to improve Kentucky schools. Yeah. Yeah.

227
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:01,840
I there's there all kinds of education

228
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,800
technology has tons of cool stuff like

229
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,879
that. um in part because lots of young

230
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,560
people can get interested and excited by

231
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,319
technology and so bringing them in into

232
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,000
leadership role, partnership roles. Um

233
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,520
cities had that too. Uh there's a group

234
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,759
in Boston called the high square task

235
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,479
force um which does all kinds of they

236
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,759
usually do more sort of like you know I

237
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,240
don't know community organizing kind of

238
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,680
like adversarial like why are you doing

239
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,039
this to us? Why are you doing this way?

240
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,479
They have a they have a whole campaign

241
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,160
they're doing right now against either

242
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,919
Shaws or Stop and Shop which is separate

243
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,599
from their education work. Um but

244
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,599
they've gone to a bunch of grocery

245
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,760
stores in neighborhoods around Boston

246
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,640
and bought the same thing in each store.

247
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,000
Um and basically found that in some you

248
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,599
know sort of minoritized poverty

249
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,959
impacted neighborhoods the grocery the

250
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,480
groceries are more expensive than they

251
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:46,399
are in Newton and Welsley or stuff like

252
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,720
that and they're sort of holding uh Stop

253
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,560
and Shop is not happy with these kids

254
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,040
being a thorn in their side. It's great.

255
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,240
Um yeah yeah yeah. They're they're

256
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,080
pretty good at like getting pressed for

257
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,760
what they do and things like that. Um

258
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,959
they'll probably have to respond at some

259
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:03,120
point. Um, good. Um, well that's I I

260
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,040
enjoyed um letting you all connect with

261
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,399
them. It sounds like the meeting, you

262
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,600
know, every time you go into breakout

263
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,440
rooms, it's sort of uneven, but

264
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,800
hopefully it's a good sense for you to

265
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,800
meet some of the people who are in

266
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,240
higher education who are trying to make

267
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,760
the changes that we're going to talk

268
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,600
about, you know, in the past few weeks

269
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,440
and for the the rest of the semester. So

270
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,920
hopefully that was a neat opportunity.

271
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,080
Um, why don't you take a couple minutes

272
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,360
um before I launch into things just to

273
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,519
chat with each other and then we can

274
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,360
surface some of these ideas. Um but the

275
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,600
the learning journal prompt that I had

276
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:35,360
for you was to talk about like what role

277
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:39,040
does technology play um in your MIT

278
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,160
education thus far. Um and uh so talk to

279
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,600
the person next to you. Some of you

280
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,800
might not be from MIT or some of you

281
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,320
might be in graduate school and so you

282
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,920
have some undergraduate connections to

283
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,360
this as well. Those things are all fine.

284
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:51,120
Sort of technology and higher education.

285
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:54,399
Um, typically the the the things that

286
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:57,120
are most useful to talk about are um

287
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,399
either either systems or tools or things

288
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,800
that you think are like particularly

289
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:03,120
helpful or useful. Um, systems or tools

290
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,880
or things that are particularly damaging

291
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:08,000
or harmful or pointless or a waste of

292
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:11,040
your time. Um, and then also anything

293
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,959
that like has has started to seem really

294
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,480
familiar to you, but actually you think

295
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,240
has like interesting unfamiliar

296
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,640
qualities or or thing things that sort

297
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,079
of like feel standard and boring, but

298
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,200
actually they're important maybe in ways

299
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,720
that we don't want to think about. So,

300
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,160
so turn to the two or three people next

301
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,440
to you. Talk for a few minutes about

302
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,920
like if you were to explain to someone

303
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,360
not from your undergraduate institution

304
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,399
like the role that technology plays

305
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:35,720
there, what would be the couple of

306
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:35,720
stories that you would tell? Ready? Go.

307
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,680
Okay, come on back.

308
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,200
Be great to keep trying to hear from

309
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,399
everybody. So, would love to some folks

310
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,560
who haven't shared yet would love to

311
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,640
hear what are what are some uh what are

312
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:53,600
some MIT highlights or low lightss or

313
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,279
sort of distinctive parts of uh or or in

314
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,839
your undergraduate program distinctive

315
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:59,920
parts of technologies.

316
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,880
What do you got Jiren? Uh my group was

317
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:07,120
my group was discussing like MIT's use

318
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:09,440
of canvas and like precoid MIT had this

319
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,279
weird sort of proprietary thing where

320
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,040
they had their own what was that called?

321
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:15,920
Stellar. Stellar. Yeah. Yeah. So they

322
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,760
had like each each class had their own

323
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,000
different stellar website and it wasn't

324
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,600
standardized at all and it was it was

325
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,320
kind of a mess. It like had this weird

326
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,880
outdated sort of 1990s internet era

327
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,399
aesthetic to it. It was pretty horrible.

328
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,040
And then they had this sort of

329
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:33,440
proprietary thing called the learning

330
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:35,839
module which was basically Canvas like

331
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,600
MIT was just trying to make Canvas but

332
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,959
then during the pandemic they I guess

333
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,880
you know they decided to make canvas a

334
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:43,360
much more standardized thing. And so I

335
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,120
found that to be very helpful for

336
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,720
keeping everything organized and having

337
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,720
assignments you know done through Canvas

338
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,880
as opposed to being like oh crap what's

339
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,399
that website I have to go to search up

340
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:56,880
stellar MIT. It was weird. Um, but I

341
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:59,120
feel like because of that, a lot of

342
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,480
professors don't fully utilize all the

343
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,160
different things that Canvas has to

344
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,399
offer, especially when it comes to like

345
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:08,800
grades and inputting grades. Like

346
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:10,399
professors and TAs don't care about like

347
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,560
inputting grades and like a lot of

348
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,959
students would I I feel would really

349
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,560
like to see real-time feedback like on

350
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,800
their grades and how that actively

351
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,760
affects their final grade in the class,

352
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,519
but that just isn't uh that just isn't

353
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,440
professors don't do that. Yeah. Yeah.

354
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,959
Um, and then I mean another thing that's

355
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,639
sort of unusual, we'll talk about this

356
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,920
more as the semester goes on, but it

357
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,320
does seem a little weird that you would

358
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,639
have the exact same Canvas template for

359
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,880
a graduate seminar on chemistry

360
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:40,560
synthesis and an undergraduate seminar

361
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:42,000
on Renaissance poetry and uh like if you

362
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,519
know if if you're studying really

363
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,959
different kinds of things, does it

364
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,399
really make sense to have the same

365
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,519
structure for all of those different

366
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,560
kinds of things? Like it seems like

367
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,320
there should be some differences there.

368
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,440
What were you gonna say, Emily? Um, we

369
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:55,200
talked about MITx, which is you like

370
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,399
physics use it and then a lot of math

371
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,560
classes use it. And I like how it's like

372
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,560
even like it's sometimes like recordings

373
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,920
of like a concept introducing you to a

374
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,519
concept or it could be in writing, but

375
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,560
it's not as like dense as a textbook

376
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,240
where you're kind of like, oh, I don't

377
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,160
want to start reading this. And then

378
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,000
it's like right after when they

379
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,680
introduce it, you have like kind of

380
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,959
check questions where it's kind of like

381
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,320
checking for your understanding and it

382
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,839
immediately tells you if you're right or

383
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,240
wrong, which is really nice because like

384
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,079
for math, I feel like some like when

385
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,200
you're told like, oh, this is the right

386
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,880
answer. You're more focused on the

387
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,720
process of getting to it rather than the

388
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,160
answer itself, which is a lot more

389
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,600
beneficial when you're doing math. Like

390
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,440
you care about the process of how to get

391
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,519
to that answer, not the answer itself.

392
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,279
So I think it's really like really nice

393
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,920
to have that platform for especially

394
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:39,360
math classes. Um and you you know you

395
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,760
could imagine for all for all of those

396
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,079
autograded problems you've ever done you

397
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,639
know five years ago you very likely

398
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:48,079
would have done those pet sets on paper

399
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,000
you would have turned the pet sets into

400
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,920
a TA a TA you know TA would have gotten

401
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,240
hundreds of them um it would have taken

402
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,360
them a week 10 days two weeks to turn

403
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,959
around or something like that and so

404
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,000
that by by the time it gets handed back

405
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:01,839
to you might get the answer key sooner

406
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,920
um but the time you get that like it can

407
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,040
be days or weeks after doing a problem

408
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,320
that you figure out whether you got it

409
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,360
right or not and you just forgot how you

410
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,800
did it or like what you were thinking

411
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,240
about at the time. So there you could

412
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,160
definitely imagine some real advantages

413
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,920
to that kind of instant like you know it

414
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,399
can change the way study groups operate

415
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,760
too both for good and bad. Um but you

416
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,920
could imagine that like study groups

417
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,519
previously would have been like okay

418
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,120
let's all like write this pet set they

419
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,199
all write the pet turn it in you're like

420
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,279
hope that worked. Um, but when you have

421
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,959
the kind of autograding, you you know,

422
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,480
you can be like, "Wait, half of us did

423
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,160
not get this right." Like, "Why didn't

424
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,440
we? Who did, you know, what can we learn

425
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,760
from each other?" You know, there's all

426
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,000
kinds of ways that that instant feedback

427
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,800
can change the the relationships that

428
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,880
you have with with that learning. Good.

429
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,880
Other thoughts? Yeah. Okay. Um, I was

430
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:48,079
going to say something like Notability

431
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:50,000
has really transformed the way I um, for

432
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,760
example, organize all of my classwork

433
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,399
and the fact that everyone uses their

434
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:57,199
iPads now instead of going to paper and

435
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,720
pencil. Um, I think

436
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,160
um, yeah, just the fact that we can have

437
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,920
all of our lecture notes and then upload

438
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,680
it to Notability. We can annotate it and

439
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,920
then do all of our homework on here too

440
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,040
and be able to like compare screens and

441
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,360
things like that. And I think that's

442
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,120
really like before I only ever really

443
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,279
used paper and pencil and then switching

444
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,240
the fact that MIT gave out iPads to

445
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:18,160
everyone. And then um because we have uh

446
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:21,519
the resources to have Notability for

447
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:23,680
free or um and the fact that we like

448
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,279
submit everything electronically now has

449
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,440
kind of been a little bit of a game

450
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:29,440
changer. Does Notability have any social

451
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,920
features? Like do you just have your own

452
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,399
Notability or are there ways? Okay. They

453
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:39,760
recently added some like share your

454
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:41,760
notes kind of gallery search thing.

455
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:44,720
There's also the good old screenshot the

456
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:47,040
iPads if you want iCloud. You can just

457
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,040
text it to the to Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

458
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,120
Yeah. Good. Good. Share like you can

459
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,199
dual screen on the iPad which isn't

460
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,040
necessarily an aspect. Well, not build

461
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:57,519
you can also dual screen so you pull up

462
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,360
someone else's work.

463
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:02,079
There there's some like very specific

464
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,880
applications for some of those kinds of

465
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:07,440
things. Good. Other thoughts if you have

466
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:10,079
one more? We had like the same thought

467
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:13,120
of um cats has been kind of

468
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:14,320
revolutionary in that like I guess in a

469
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,320
way that's I've I've heard of this but

470
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:20,000
you got to tell us what it is again. It

471
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:22,320
is Catsup is an automatic tutor for 601

472
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,600
problems.

473
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,120
It it used to be like an old

474
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,199
introductory computer science course

475
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,880
that was required for most or six

476
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:32,240
majors, but they phased that out like

477
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,839
three years ago. Um I don't remember

478
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,680
what 601 specifically was, but that's

479
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:39,839
what capsu stands for. It's like a

480
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:41,680
recursive um acronym, but like I I guess

481
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,000
in a way like I've never I never got to

482
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,920
use Stellar, but in a way that sort of

483
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,279
has become the the new Stellar in in the

484
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,120
sense that like each class has their own

485
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:51,199
different website and you just like

486
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,399
upload problems on there. And I have

487
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,759
found it to be kind of nice because it

488
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:58,160
also has like a topic grader.

489
00:16:54,759 --> 00:17:00,079
um it lets you like submit um stuff for

490
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,440
recitation like in class and I found

491
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,920
like it's pretty great. I like the

492
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,199
interface um but I I just hate the fact

493
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,720
that I have to like bookmark every

494
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,280
single different website or else I

495
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,039
forget them. So good. So logistical

496
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,959
things. I mean to add to that like

497
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:15,120
different course I mean I've seen it

498
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:18,400
most of it in core six yeah like

499
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:21,600
different core six um classes use it to

500
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:24,079
different degrees and diverse situ there

501
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,839
there is a little fault for it there um

502
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:29,280
there are some classes where the entire

503
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:31,600
class is on there and then you go to

504
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,360
your class in the basement with 40

505
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,440
people and they're all trying to log in

506
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,960
at the same time so that they're marked

507
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,760
as present and they're starting their

508
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,799
lab and everything just crashed. That is

509
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,480
that's that is so comforting to me

510
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:46,559
because I run this system called teacher

511
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,799
moments and we have similar problems but

512
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:51,200
like I'm not an MIT computer science

513
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:53,240
professor and the fact like and the fact

514
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:57,440
that their doesn't work either is

515
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:59,120
very like it's very comforting to me I

516
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,200
think that there's one thing that like

517
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,919
we kind of discussed um which is like an

518
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,320
application of the MITx um is like

519
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:09,120
typically most freshmen at MIT take like

520
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:11,120
the 801 802 teal

521
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,120
Um, and I feel like that gives like this

522
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,200
false advertisement of how education

523
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,640
technology is used here at MIT where

524
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,200
they like give you this like flipped

525
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,520
classroom idea. Um, and like some kids

526
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,640
like love it and then you switch into

527
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:26,480
another class and you never see that

528
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,520
type of learning again. And you're like,

529
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:32,000
well, I liked that, so where is it? Um,

530
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,440
and like for me who like struggled

531
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,240
through it because I was like a student

532
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,960
that was kind of behind going in. um

533
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,120
like then I switched to like my core 16

534
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,480
classes where it's like a professor

535
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,000
lecturing in front of you and all of a

536
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,000
sudden I now understand the concept.

537
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,520
It's like why did I lose a whole year?

538
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,200
Um so it's like kind of like that back

539
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:52,720
and forth between like like are you

540
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,320
going to continue to implement this in

541
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,360
other ways or is it just are we just

542
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:59,200
stagnant in this one idea behind it?

543
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,559
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's that's really I

544
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,679
mean teal is an experience that a lot of

545
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,760
you have had if you if you're not

546
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:06,080
familiar. teal is a way that they do

547
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,799
introductory physics teaching. Um it

548
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,720
came about um because of high failure

549
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,840
rates particularly from people who you

550
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,160
know came from backgrounds where they

551
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,799
were less well prepared in physics. Um

552
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,240
and uh so you know 801 802 these

553
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,840
introductory physics classes would be

554
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,520
taught as lectures with problem sets and

555
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,760
things like that. Um it also actually

556
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,120
there's a long um a really we won't get

557
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,400
into a really interesting tradition of

558
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,840
research in physics education um which I

559
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,480
don't know three or three decades ago

560
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,640
maybe discovered um that when students

561
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,960
even at really good universities take

562
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,799
introductory physics historically they

563
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,480
were actually less Newtonian in their

564
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:42,160
thinking at the end of the class than at

565
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,480
the beginning. um like they were like

566
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,559
they got good grades. Um they could

567
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,240
solve all the kinds of physics problems,

568
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,840
but then they gave them this uh this

569
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,520
test, this sort of assessment called the

570
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,039
force concept inventory, which was a

571
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,720
bunch of conceptual questions about how

572
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,320
force works. And students would actually

573
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,400
do worse at the end of the class that

574
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,320
they would do at the beginning. Um so

575
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,760
there was this sense that like you could

576
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,200
spend a whole bunch of time teaching

577
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,039
people the procedures of physics and

578
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,360
they would actually come to like

579
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:10,400
slightly more misunderstand the concepts

580
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:14,480
as a result of that. Um which is bad. Um

581
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:15,600
and uh um so uh active learning learn

582
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,120
you know learning environments where

583
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,480
students are asked to not just listen

584
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,320
and take notes and then do problem sets

585
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,679
but to like engage during the

586
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,600
conversations about the material were

587
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,280
shown to improve that and then teal

588
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,280
stuck around because while people have

589
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,840
individual experiences with it um there

590
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:32,159
are fewer students who failed um 801 and

591
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,760
802 after teal was implemented and given

592
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,200
a few years to like ramp up and work

593
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:40,080
right than there were beforehand. Um

594
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:42,480
however just because on average teal the

595
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,640
teal system is more likely to have more

596
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,960
students persist doesn't mean that for

597
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,880
any individual student like individual

598
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,400
students can still not like it. Um and

599
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,919
it can sort of not serve them well and

600
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,600
it can not serve them well because of

601
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,960
their background preparation or because

602
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,559
they you know I mean lots of people who

603
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,919
come to MIT end up here because they're

604
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:00,640
pretty good at teaching themselves stuff

605
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:02,559
through lectures. Um, and so you know,

606
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,840
alternate methods, you know, when when

607
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,960
the physics department is trying to

608
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,080
think about what to do with that, these

609
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,440
are all the kinds of trade-offs that

610
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,720
they're considering. What were you going

611
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,559
to say, Har? Uh, slides, especially when

612
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,600
you're taking classes that are like core

613
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:17,280
six or math. When professors use slides,

614
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:21,039
I feel like it affects my learning

615
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:22,640
because I like when when they use chalk

616
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,320
in the board, they just like walking

617
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,520
through it because one, it slows them

618
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,200
down.

619
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:30,080
you also kind of catch up with them. But

620
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,240
they usually apply they go very fast and

621
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,080
second you just have to I don't know it

622
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,080
makes the learning process a different

623
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,200
things. Yeah. Yeah. No, I think I think

624
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,640
I think it's really interesting. You

625
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,400
know they're they're probably like

626
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,679
they're less likely to have errors on

627
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,440
the slides than they are when they're

628
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,880
working things out by hand. It's not

629
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,960
however it's not totally clear whether

630
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,320
or not errors are a bad thing in that

631
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,679
like sometimes people note the errors in

632
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,880
real time or they note them in real time

633
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:53,200
and they fix them and they discuss them.

634
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,039
Definitely like if you can only sort of

635
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,840
talk and move at the pace at which

636
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:59,200
someone can write um that's uh that can

637
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,480
have different kind of advantages. I

638
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,240
mean the slides are kind of cool in that

639
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,520
they get sort of like automatically sent

640
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,120
to you. They can be sent to you in

641
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,880
advance. You can take notes directly on

642
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,559
them. Is taking notes directly on them

643
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,480
actually better or is it better to have

644
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:12,799
to hand copy sort of pay attention

645
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,679
what's going on there? Um these are all

646
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,880
great questions and they're all

647
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,400
questions that actually have research

648
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,919
behind them. There are folks who you

649
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,360
know come up with experiments where they

650
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,880
test all of these different conditions.

651
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,240
What do we do when we tell students to

652
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,520
try to copy everything down? What do we

653
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,720
do when we tell students to summarize?

654
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,000
What if we give them stuff in advance?

655
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,919
What if we let them have computers? What

656
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,120
if we take away their computers? Um,

657
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,760
actually, you know, some of the best

658
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,679
places to do this research end up being

659
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,520
uh military schools um like the like

660
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,960
West Point and the Naval Academy and

661
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,799
stuff like that. Um because they have a

662
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,919
lot of required classes and because you

663
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,679
can be pretty sure that the students

664
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:43,280
will do what you tell them to do. Um

665
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,880
like you like you assign them to either

666
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,919
condition and they kind of like you know

667
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:50,240
they they do what they want to. Um good.

668
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:52,400
Maybe one. So an interesting thing about

669
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,919
our own experiences is that our own

670
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,919
experiences are really important sources

671
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,679
of data for understanding education

672
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,480
technology like like it's important for

673
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:02,480
us to look through the lens of our own

674
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,159
learning experiences and and they can be

675
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,600
very informative. Um the other thing to

676
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,080
remember is that if you're studying at

677
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,440
MIT you're probably weird. Um there

678
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,280
there are probably characteristics of

679
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,520
you which are not typical. Like if you

680
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:16,640
like if you generally find classroom

681
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:19,200
learning pleasant um you are unusual.

682
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,720
Um, if you think to yourself, man, I

683
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,720
really like just kind of like learning

684
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,200
stuff and figuring out on my own in

685
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,799
academic material, that is unusual. Um,

686
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,640
most people are not good at those things

687
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,000
and don't find them enjoyable. So, so

688
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,280
it's it could be helpful to bring your

689
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,280
own experience, but it's also important

690
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,880
to recognize the way like, you know, and

691
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,400
I I went to private schools my whole

692
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,880
life. I've had an extraordinarily

693
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,960
privileged educational upbringing. if it

694
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,960
doesn't in lots of ways I have to

695
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,640
recognize how that upbringing does not

696
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,080
prepare me well to understand the

697
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,760
learning experiences of most students

698
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,720
who go to K12 schools and public schools

699
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,480
in the United States and things like

700
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,679
that. So be conscientious of that as we

701
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,640
do some thinking. But this stuff is

702
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,159
good. All the things you're talking

703
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:58,679
about are are things we'll keep trying

704
00:23:54,159 --> 00:24:01,440
to make sense of. Failure to disrupt.

705
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:02,799
Um this is a book about large-scale

706
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,280
learning um learning environments with

707
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:09,360
many many learners and few experts to

708
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:12,799
guide them. Um, and I would say the

709
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:17,520
heart of what I'm trying to do in this

710
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:21,120
book is to is to demystify education

711
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:22,720
technology for people and to and to say,

712
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,400
you know, with every generation of new

713
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,480
technologies, there will be folks who

714
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,559
come along that try to go to schools and

715
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,279
say, "This thing is totally brand new.

716
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:33,200
This is this is disruptive. Um, this is

717
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,960
innovative. This is going to this is a

718
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,840
gamecher. this is going to transform

719
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:40,159
education. Um, and my job is to be like,

720
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,080
eh, probably not. Um, it might be

721
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,679
helpful, but it's very very unlikely

722
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:47,159
that it will be any of those kinds of

723
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:49,840
things. Um, a one of the ways to

724
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:52,080
demystify technologies is to show where

725
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:54,200
they come from. Um, is to say these

726
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:56,640
things have patterns. The patterns are

727
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:58,480
recognizable. Um, they are patterns not

728
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,320
just in how these things are designed,

729
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,159
but how they get implemented and what

730
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,320
kind of effects they have. When new

731
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:06,000
technologies come along, we don't have

732
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,320
to we don't have to guess out of the

733
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,400
blue how well they might work. We know

734
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,919
roughly how well education technology

735
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,440
works in different kinds of circum. Now

736
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,720
new things there there will be new

737
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,799
things that are invented that are in

738
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,960
fact different but but most new things

739
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:21,360
are just a little bit new. They make

740
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:24,120
just small modifications, small advances

741
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:27,039
off off of past things.

742
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:29,360
Um and then the second half of the book

743
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:32,080
uh says sort of confronts the challenge

744
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,919
like why is it so hard to make progress

745
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,760
with education technology? Why are why

746
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,360
are things not disruptive? Why are they

747
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:40,080
not transformative? Why are they not

748
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:41,279
game changers? Um and I think there are

749
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,880
answers to those questions. I think

750
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:45,039
there are there are challenges that we

751
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,200
have as a field yet to figure out how to

752
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:48,799
tackle. Um and if we study those

753
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,480
challenges and make sense of them, then

754
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:52,480
we could probably do a better job um

755
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:55,039
moving past them. So the first half of

756
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,960
the book looks at these three genres of

757
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,880
learning at scale. It says that most

758
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,480
education technologies, especially the

759
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,799
ones where you try to teach a lot of

760
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,880
people with very few experts, fall into

761
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:06,720
one of three buckets. And you can figure

762
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,880
out what bucket each thing is in by

763
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,039
asking the question who guides the

764
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,880
sequence of learning activities. Um when

765
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,240
learners do stuff, they happen in an

766
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,320
order one after the other after the

767
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,000
other. Um and there are really kind of

768
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,559
three sorts of ways that those orders

769
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,240
unfold. Um the first is instructor-g

770
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:24,159
guided learning at scale. So there can

771
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,000
be some expert or team of experts who

772
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:28,159
says you should learn things in this

773
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
order. Here's part one, part two, part

774
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,600
three, part four, part five. And maybe

775
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,520
learners don't go in that order, but

776
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,960
overwhelmingly they will. Um and there's

777
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,039
sort of some logical sequence to that.

778
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,120
So I call those things instructorguided

779
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,880
learning at scale. Um a bunch of what

780
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,559
you read about for today, massive open

781
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,480
online courses. Um any kind of

782
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:47,360
self-paced online learning sort of falls

783
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:49,520
in that bucket. Um the second big genre

784
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:52,559
is algorithm guided learning at scale.

785
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:54,880
Uh so that's when you um a computer

786
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:56,799
poses you a problem, you answer that

787
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,960
problem and the computer evaluates your

788
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:01,440
performance and then based on that

789
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,520
performance it gives you either more

790
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,520
difficult problems or simpler problems

791
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,360
or the same kind of problem or shunts

792
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,360
you in some kind of different direction.

793
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,600
But basically the computer evaluates

794
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,279
your performance, decides on the basis

795
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,880
of that performance what the next uh

796
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:18,400
item in a sequence of activities should

797
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:22,000
be and then you go do that forever. um

798
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:24,240
lots of you are probably I I don't know

799
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,760
when I taught this 10 years ago maybe

800
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,000
students would have dabbled with these

801
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:31,480
things but it's far far more common now

802
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:35,200
like if you in school ever used Dreambox

803
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:37,600
or Khan Academy um almost all of those

804
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,440
things are some version of uh algorithm

805
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,799
guided learning at scale all all a bunch

806
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,559
of the testing that you've done if

807
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,919
you've taken the computer-based GRE

808
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:46,640
other things like that they use similar

809
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:48,640
technologies um the third bucket of

810
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,400
things we call peerguided learning at

811
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,760
scale. Um, so if any of you have ever

812
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,279
played around with the Scratch

813
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,039
programming community, there's no

814
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:56,880
instruction in Scratch. There's no

815
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:58,480
there's no like Scratch University or

816
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,440
like Scratch lesson one, lesson two,

817
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,760
lesson three, and that's very

818
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:04,000
intentional and by design. Instead,

819
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,840
you're immersed in this community of

820
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,919
peers. Um, and if you go to the homepage

821
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,919
of the Scratch website, there are

822
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,200
featured tutorials and featured projects

823
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:12,799
and things like that. And the way you

824
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,840
figure out Scratch is that you think

825
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,039
about some things that you want to do

826
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,320
and then you find some other people who

827
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:18,240
have done that kind of thing and you

828
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,840
copy them, you converse with them, you

829
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,600
take their project and you modify it.

830
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,240
Um, but you basically sort of design

831
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:26,640
your own pathway. Um, there are lots of

832
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,279
other learning environments, uh, Stack

833
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,039
Overflow, other kinds of communities of

834
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:32,559
practice. The the one that I talk about

835
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:34,320
at the beginning of the book is Rainbow

836
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:36,000
Loom. Um, any of you ever played with

837
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,840
Rainbow Loom when you were kids? Yeah.

838
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,720
Um, so you know when you bought a Did I

839
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,320
tell you the story yet? When you bought

840
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,840
a Rainbow Loom, there are like 10 cards

841
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,799
in the packet. So, you pull open the

842
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,960
packet, there's a bunch of these little

843
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:47,200
rubber bands, little like uh uh what do

844
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,960
they call that thing? Frame to stitch

845
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,679
the rubber bands on. And then there are

846
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,360
10 cards that show 10 different kinds of

847
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:55,760
bracelets that you can make. If you get

848
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:57,200
really into Rainbow Loom, 10 different

849
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,399
kinds of bracelets is not enough kinds

850
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,880
of bracelets. Like, you have to learn

851
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:02,399
more different ways of doing it. Um and

852
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,480
the main way you'll learn that is

853
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:05,600
through YouTube. Um you'll go to this I

854
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,120
mean, and here's the thing that sort of

855
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,799
boggled my mind about Rainbow Loom. So,

856
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,559
there's some dude who is in Michigan.

857
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:11,760
Um, he was like an automotive engineer

858
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:13,039
or something like that who was like, "In

859
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,880
my country, this is the way we make

860
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:16,480
bracelets." Um, and he's like, and he,

861
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,320
you know, he like comes up with some CAD

862
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,320
designs and he sends them to China and

863
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,840
China manufactures of these things and

864
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,919
they put them on shipping containers and

865
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,520
they send them to his distribution

866
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:27,279
center and eventually these packet, you

867
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,799
know, these these little like boxes of

868
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,159
Rainbow things get sent all over the

869
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:32,320
world. It's a total supply chain

870
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:34,159
miracle. Um the fact that you know some

871
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,600
dude in Michigan just has an idea and is

872
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:37,039
like let's have people all over the

873
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,600
world buy these things and they do is

874
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:40,960
amazing. But

875
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:44,480
simultaneously to that physical supply

876
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:46,720
chain infrastructure this giant global

877
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,279
community of Rainbow Loom learners

878
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:52,559
emerges um where there are people who

879
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:54,480
are running little classes at uh um art

880
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:55,919
shops and they're posting videos online

881
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,880
and they're sharing ideas with each

882
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,440
other and they're creating little

883
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,919
Facebook marketplaces. Um and the only

884
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:04,799
way Rainbow Loan could grow is if that

885
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:07,039
learning network grows alongside it. You

886
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:09,600
know that is miraculous. Um that is like

887
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:11,520
an amazing feature of online learning

888
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,960
that uh that you know people could

889
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:16,000
invent a tool to do this kind of

890
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,279
practice um and and a community could

891
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,520
develop to teach each other and

892
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:21,039
themselves this practice. Um, I think

893
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,240
there were uh Oh, the other thing I

894
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,720
really liked about that which I think I

895
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,000
mentioned is that um I don't there were

896
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,840
these two girls. I think their names

897
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,720
were Ashley and Steph um who made

898
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:32,960
Rainbow Loom YouTube videos and they got

899
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:35,600
millions of views and you could compare

900
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,600
their videos to like the actual Rainbow

901
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,039
Loom manufacturer videos and these girls

902
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,360
were getting like 10x the number of

903
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:43,600
views that the actual Rainbow like like

904
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:45,039
basically kids would rather learn um

905
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,320
from these kind of two random girls.

906
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:47,440
They ended up being Philadelphia.

907
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,880
They're very good at protecting their

908
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,080
anonymity, at least for a while. One of

909
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,000
them eventually became a makeup

910
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:55,679
influencer. Um, and and then they

911
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,279
revealed herself. But uh um but I find

912
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,200
these global networks incredibly

913
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:00,799
fascinating. Um and very very difficult

914
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:04,080
to integrate in schools for reasons that

915
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:06,080
we'll explore as we go along. Um so if

916
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,159
you buy that there are these three big

917
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:10,559
categories. Um a thing that we'll do

918
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:13,200
over the next um few weeks is we'll look

919
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:16,240
at how there are similarities within

920
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:18,240
these categories. Um so for instance in

921
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,520
instructorg guided learning at scale

922
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,480
there typically are sort of two key

923
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:24,000
technologies. There are two technologies

924
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,000
that show up over and over and over

925
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,840
again. Um one is a learning management

926
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,360
system. So a learning management system

927
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:32,799
canvas blackboard edex mood stellar a

928
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,960
zillion other things. They're sort of

929
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:38,399
platforms that organize learning

930
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:40,240
materials. Um a an unusual feature of

931
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:43,279
learning management systems is that they

932
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,559
have a feature that like product people

933
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:46,799
who study products called feature

934
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:49,600
convergence. Essentially it's very

935
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:51,279
difficult to like patent um or or have

936
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,640
intellectual property around like

937
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:54,159
components of a learning management

938
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,760
system. So anytime anyone invents

939
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:58,080
something good, everybody else copies

940
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:00,159
it. Um so they're all basically the

941
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,679
exact same system. Um like you buy them

942
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:03,120
from different vendors, but they're

943
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:06,000
basically one learning management

944
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:08,080
system. Um and then the second kind of

945
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,159
crucial feature of online learning

946
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:12,240
management of of MO or instructor guided

947
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:13,919
learning at scale are autograders. Um so

948
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,600
you have to be able to give if you have

949
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:16,880
lots and lots of learners if you want to

950
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,080
be able to give them feedback if you

951
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,159
want to be able to certify their

952
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,679
learning in any way. Um you either have

953
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:24,159
to spend zillions of dollars hiring

954
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:25,600
people to grade their work um or you

955
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:27,440
find ways of having computers grade

956
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,559
their work. Now computers can grade as

957
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,240
we'll talk about this at length

958
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:32,640
computers can grade some things but not

959
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,720
others. Um computers are really good at

960
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:37,519
answer at at evaluating questions where

961
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:39,760
the answer is is well known and certain.

962
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:41,760
Um they are much less good at evaluating

963
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:44,480
anything which has a kind of subjective

964
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:46,880
component to it. Um uh one way to think

965
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:49,200
about this is autograders are great in

966
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:51,360
early language acquisition and very

967
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,559
rapidly become useless in later language

968
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:56,880
acquisition. Um so they can tell whether

969
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:58,159
you've spelled ola correctly. We even

970
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,840
have some pretty cool ones that can tell

971
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:01,360
whether if you've pronounced Ola

972
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,799
correctly. Um, we can give you a

973
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,799
multiple choice question to see if you

974
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:07,279
can recognize the audio recording of

975
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:08,880
Ola. Um, eventually, however, what we

976
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:11,519
want to know are like what are the key

977
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:13,039
themes in Don Kiote? Um, and that we

978
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:16,559
don't have very good autograders to be

979
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:17,840
able to evaluate and and so forth. Um I

980
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,840
would say in addition to this sort of

981
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,760
technological infrastructure, these

982
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:25,440
genres of learning at scale, they tend

983
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:27,679
to align more closely either with direct

984
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:30,080
instruction kind of folks or sort of

985
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:31,519
apprenticeship uh uh constructivism

986
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,880
kinds of folks. The the instructor

987
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:35,919
guided learning at scale people, they

988
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:37,760
tend to be thornyike direct instruction

989
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,840
cognitive load theory kind of people.

990
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:42,000
They tend to be pale filling kinds of

991
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:44,399
folks. Um

992
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,519
uh algorithm guide to learning at scale.

993
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:50,559
um has similarities but differences. Um

994
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:52,399
so the the sort of crucial technology

995
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:54,480
behind algorithm guided learning at

996
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:56,480
scale is a set of algorithms called item

997
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:59,120
response theory. Um this was developed

998
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,720
in the 1980s by educational testing

999
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:03,519
services. The people who make what do

1000
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:05,440
they do the SAT or the GRE? What is it?

1001
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:09,800
What is what test does ETSs make? I

1002
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:13,679
don't know. They make tests. Um and uh

1003
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:16,560
um the like the basic toolkit of item

1004
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:19,119
response theory has proven really quite

1005
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:21,359
robust. Um all item response theory does

1006
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:22,960
basically is it lets you figure out how

1007
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,560
difficult an item is. It's a way of

1008
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,919
quantifying how difficult an item is. If

1009
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,280
you can quantify how difficult an item

1010
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:28,639
is, if someone gets the item right, you

1011
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,839
can give them a more difficult item or

1012
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:32,000
less difficult item. It was actually

1013
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:33,919
originally developed so that you could

1014
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,839
give people tests of equivalent

1015
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:38,159
difficulty without giving them the same

1016
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:40,159
test. Um this proved important like when

1017
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:42,159
we had national testing and we built

1018
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:44,159
communication networks um because in

1019
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:46,399
theory somebody could take a you know a

1020
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:47,839
test in Portland, Maine um and later

1021
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:49,839
that same day someone would take it in

1022
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:51,359
Honolulu, Hawaii um and there's like

1023
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:52,960
just enough time in there for someone to

1024
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:54,560
call and you know and send all the

1025
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:57,359
questions and answers and and things

1026
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:59,520
like that. Um, and so it was it was a it

1027
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:00,720
was part came about from sort of test

1028
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,200
security. You want to make you want to

1029
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:05,200
be able to make claims about about

1030
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,800
people's ability. Um, and one way to do

1031
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,079
that is to give everyone the same test.

1032
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,680
Another way to do that is to give

1033
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,920
everyone tests with different items but

1034
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,119
of the same difficulty. Um, and so we

1035
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,079
had to come up with some statistical

1036
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:17,839
toolkit for doing that.

1037
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:20,480
Um, what we came up with in the 1980s

1038
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:22,880
and 1990s, we like we've modified it a

1039
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:25,040
bit, but we still pretty much use today.

1040
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,320
um we sort of know a bunch about its

1041
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,640
strengths and weaknesses and how it

1042
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,240
works. Um most of our autograders have

1043
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,280
like just now maybe they're starting to

1044
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,720
improve a little bit. Most of them

1045
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,599
haven't improved that much in the last

1046
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:37,119
two or three decades. Um I in some

1047
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:38,400
specific areas, some parts of language

1048
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:39,839
acquisition, some parts of computer

1049
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,839
science, maybe they've improved better.

1050
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:44,240
Um but these technologies for the most

1051
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:46,400
part are pretty stable. um when someone

1052
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:48,079
has a new entrant I I mean I'll you'll

1053
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,400
read more of this story in chapter two

1054
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:52,400
but there was a company called Newton um

1055
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,079
which said that they could take uh they

1056
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,480
could take any body of educational

1057
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:58,320
content and turn it into an intelligent

1058
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,240
tutor um and they thought that their

1059
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:02,560
tutor was absolutely amazing that the

1060
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:04,480
founder described it as a uh something

1061
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,680
like a magical robot tutor in the sky

1062
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,359
sort of knew exactly what you were

1063
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,040
thinking and so forth. Um so he was

1064
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:12,160
making all these like totally outlandish

1065
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:13,680
claims and then his engineers um were

1066
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,040
like had a blog about what they were

1067
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,720
building and they one of their blog

1068
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,320
posts was something like using two

1069
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,160
parameter item response theory to

1070
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,599
evaluate items. They're basically like

1071
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,040
this you know so the leader is out there

1072
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:25,280
being like these things is totally

1073
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,560
amazing and the engineers are like like

1074
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,000
here's the very wellestablished

1075
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,599
technology that we're using to do the

1076
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,680
thing that we like are selling you to

1077
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:33,920
do.

1078
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:35,599
Um the peer-guided learning at scale

1079
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,040
looks pretty different from the other

1080
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:38,240
two. Um, peer-guided learning

1081
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,920
environments tend to be more

1082
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,920
apprenticeship oriented. They tend to be

1083
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:43,760
more wrapped into situated learning

1084
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:46,240
things like that. Um, they tend to have

1085
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:48,320
a different um, uh, technical

1086
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:50,240
infrastructure. Um, instead of being

1087
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,680
based in some kind of content holding

1088
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,760
thing like a learning management system,

1089
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:55,359
they usually exist on the web. Um, and

1090
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,960
usually their killer app is not an

1091
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:58,720
autograder, but a thing that pulls

1092
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,560
content together. Like how do you figure

1093
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,960
out what the right sequence of Rainbow

1094
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:04,720
Loom um, learning materials is to look

1095
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:07,680
at? And things like hashtags are really

1096
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:09,359
important for that. Um uh how do you in

1097
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,960
Scratch like how do you pull together

1098
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:12,640
and come up with a set of featured

1099
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,920
projects or a way of tagging projects so

1100
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:16,160
that people can find their way through

1101
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:19,520
them. Um so these are sort of the three

1102
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:21,760
big buckets um that will explore um one

1103
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:23,079
bucket each over the over the next bunch

1104
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:26,079
of weeks.

1105
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:28,079
Um, the second half of the book, which

1106
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:29,680
pro I guess if this if that if that if

1107
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,200
this project takes us a good chunk of

1108
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,599
March, this project will take us a good

1109
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:35,359
chunk of April, are four problems that

1110
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:37,280
educators and education technology

1111
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:39,280
designers run into over and over again.

1112
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,720
Um, which I'll enumerate quickly just to

1113
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:44,400
orient you.

1114
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:46,640
Um, one's missing. Anyway, the first one

1115
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,240
is the curse of the familiar. Um, the

1116
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,160
idea of the curse of the familiar is

1117
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,760
that it's pretty easy to make

1118
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,680
technologies that do things that

1119
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,520
educators already are doing and get them

1120
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,599
adopted. Um, how many of you have ever

1121
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:59,839
used

1122
00:37:56,599 --> 00:38:01,200
Quizlet? Okay, that that's about as

1123
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:03,200
universal a group. Uh, Quizlet was

1124
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,839
founded by MIT dropout um Andy

1125
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:09,359
Sutherland who took a bunch of uh um

1126
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:11,200
education classes with us and uh um he

1127
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:14,800
built it to I think study French for

1128
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:16,960
himself. Um uh a Quizlet is flashcards.

1129
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,880
Um, if you went and you gathered a bunch

1130
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:21,119
of educational experts around the world

1131
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,720
and said like what like what or you know

1132
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:24,320
what what is our what do our kids really

1133
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,520
need to advance their learning? There

1134
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,720
was there is no one who would raise

1135
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,720
their hands and be like there's a huge

1136
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:30,240
der of flash cards. Like we just don't

1137
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,440
have enough flash cards at school. We've

1138
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:35,280
run out of index cards. Something like

1139
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:36,880
that. Um uh and yet um here's this

1140
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,480
something you know maybe I mean they say

1141
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,880
things like half of all high schoolers

1142
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,720
every month use Quizlet. Um how much

1143
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,960
does Quizlet improve teaching and

1144
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,800
learning? Well, if you're replacing

1145
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,880
regular flash cards with digital flash

1146
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,560
cards, like how much would you expect

1147
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,000
that to improve learning? Like maybe

1148
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,440
some maybe there's a little efficiency

1149
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,040
there. Something like that. You also

1150
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,520
might say something like actually one of

1151
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,960
the best things about flashcards is the

1152
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,160
creation of the flash cards. Like

1153
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,839
there's actually something important of

1154
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,280
learning about like writing down the

1155
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,800
prompts on one ends, the answers on the

1156
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,880
other end. So maybe the paper ones are

1157
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,240
actually better um than the Quizlet ones

1158
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,320
in different kinds of ways. But the

1159
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:12,240
point is um there's probably no one who

1160
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,079
would make a bet that you know human

1161
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:16,400
development would be profoundly

1162
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:18,160
transformed by digitizing flashcards.

1163
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,520
But if you look across many of the most

1164
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,640
successful education technology

1165
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,320
companies, they do something like

1166
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,079
Quizlet. They take a thing which is

1167
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,599
already happening in schools and they

1168
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:27,680
digitize it, maybe make it a little bit

1169
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:28,880
more efficient. There are handful of

1170
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,880
projects that try to do something

1171
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:33,440
totally different. Um and many of them

1172
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:35,359
fail. And the reason why they fail is

1173
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,760
it's really hard to convince people in

1174
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:39,040
schools to adopt totally new routines.

1175
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,160
So there are all kinds of ed, you know,

1176
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,520
there are all kinds of like visionary

1177
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,880
educators out there who think of like,

1178
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,160
man, wouldn't it be cool if we could

1179
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,680
teach math in this really different kind

1180
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,280
of way? If we can teach computer science

1181
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,800
in this really different kind of way.

1182
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,880
Um, and then they build things that do

1183
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,000
that and people go, that's weird. Um, I

1184
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,680
don't understand this really new

1185
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,359
different kind of way. So a bunch of the

1186
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:57,280
things which might potentially lead us

1187
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:58,480
to the biggest gains or changes in our

1188
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,920
teaching and learning are really hard to

1189
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,720
get people to adopt. That's the curse of

1190
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:04,880
the familiar. Um the edtech Matthew

1191
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,640
effect is that we very often hope that

1192
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,560
new technologies especially free

1193
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:11,280
technologies will be the term people

1194
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:12,960
often use is democratizing. Um that they

1195
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,320
will they will essentially what'll

1196
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,000
happen is like every you know people

1197
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:17,680
generally speaking agreed that folks who

1198
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,200
have more resources have had more

1199
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:21,119
learning experiences and therefore have

1200
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,800
learned more than people with less

1201
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,320
experience. Um but we hope that there

1202
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:27,040
are technologies that will like

1203
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:28,800
disproportionately benefit um the the

1204
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,079
less affluent that they will help poor

1205
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,680
folks sort of catch up to other people.

1206
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:33,040
they'll create new kinds of on-ramps.

1207
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,800
You know, maybe they help everybody, but

1208
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:36,800
they particularly help this group. What

1209
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,079
we almost always find is the figure on

1210
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,599
the right, which is that new

1211
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:41,920
technologies disproportionately benefit

1212
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:43,760
the affin um is that they're very likely

1213
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:46,240
to accelerate the learning of people who

1214
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:48,240
are already advantaged. Um if many

1215
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:50,480
people go into education because they're

1216
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:52,240
trying to build a more equitable, just

1217
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:54,400
society, um and it can be quite

1218
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:56,079
frustrating if you keep building stuff

1219
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,400
and it keeps helping the most affluent

1220
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:01,920
people in society secure their position

1221
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:04,079
um better. um we can document this

1222
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,520
really well. It's actually in in a lot

1223
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:07,040
of cases hard to understand why it's

1224
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,640
happening and and we have very little

1225
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:11,119
science or research that helps us

1226
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:12,400
explain what alternatives would be. Um

1227
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:14,000
we know you know we'll give you some

1228
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,119
examples of some technologies that I

1229
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,040
think don't do that that I think do

1230
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:18,560
disproportionately um benefit people

1231
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,760
from further further from opportunity

1232
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,400
but it's really hard to figure out why

1233
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:24,560
they work.

1234
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:26,240
Um, a third challenge that education

1235
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:28,319
technology folks come across all the

1236
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:30,319
time, um, is that computers are good at

1237
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:31,440
evaluating certain kinds of things. The

1238
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:33,359
kinds of things that they're really good

1239
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,760
at evaluating are those that are

1240
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:38,800
routine, uh, that have common features

1241
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:40,319
to them, that are highly structured. Um,

1242
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,880
uh, computers are much less good at

1243
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:44,319
evaluating, um, illststructured kinds of

1244
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:46,079
things, things where, you know, that

1245
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:48,000
that don't have much form to them or we

1246
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:49,359
don't know what inputs need to go in

1247
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,520
them or what the final output should

1248
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:53,119
look like. Um, for instance, one of the

1249
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:55,359
things that that we don't have good

1250
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:57,520
autograders for is people's ability to

1251
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:59,359
reason from evidence in natural

1252
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:01,520
language, you know, either written or

1253
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:03,680
auditory. The main thing that we teach

1254
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:05,520
you for 16 or 20 years in the education

1255
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:07,200
system is how to reason from evidence.

1256
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,560
Like the most important things we're

1257
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:11,200
teaching you how to do, we don't have

1258
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:13,280
good autograders for. Moreover, the

1259
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:15,359
kinds of things that computers can grade

1260
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,359
tend to overlap pretty closely with the

1261
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:19,440
kinds of things computers are good at.

1262
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:20,880
Um, if computers are good at things,

1263
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,960
it's going to be very difficult to make

1264
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:25,200
a living doing those things. So, we have

1265
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:27,200
like really good tests for the kinds of

1266
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,200
things that are probably not so

1267
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,960
important to teach people. Um, and we

1268
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,160
have not very good tests on the kinds of

1269
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,560
things that are really important to

1270
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:36,720
teach people. That is like a bad feature

1271
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:39,119
for educational system. Um, because

1272
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:41,119
autograding of all kinds is way cheaper

1273
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:42,800
than human grading. Um, so we

1274
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:45,520
essentially build all of these systems

1275
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:48,079
where conceivably we're like spending

1276
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:49,599
money to cheaply evaluate the least

1277
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:51,280
important parts of the system and we're

1278
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:52,720
not evaluating the most important parts

1279
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,560
that thing people ought to be developing

1280
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:57,760
in those systems. Um, so that is the

1281
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:59,760
trap of routine assessment. Um, a really

1282
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,359
cool thing about computers is that they

1283
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,599
can collect enormous amounts of data

1284
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:05,760
about what folks do and that we can run

1285
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:07,440
experiments on people um, and improve

1286
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,960
those systems. So every time, not every

1287
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,880
time, but you know, 1% of the time you

1288
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,160
go to Google or Amazon or Facebook or

1289
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,920
whatever that like they're doing some

1290
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,280
little randomized control trial on you.

1291
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,040
You know, the buy button is green

1292
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,640
instead of red and we figure out whether

1293
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:20,640
you buy more from green buttons and red

1294
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:22,800
buttons. Um, and eventually, you know,

1295
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:24,480
Amazon, Facebook, they do millions, I

1296
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,079
don't know, they do many, many of those

1297
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:28,720
experiments every year and their system

1298
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:30,079
continuously gets better. Um, there are

1299
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:31,839
a couple of problems with doing that in

1300
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:33,280
education. Um the first problem is if

1301
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:34,720
you go to folks and you say that what

1302
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,319
you want to do is experiment with their

1303
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,839
children as we've joked before like

1304
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:41,040
people are not that enthusiastic about

1305
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:44,240
that as an idea. Um it's also not clear

1306
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:46,560
that um like surveilling people

1307
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:49,359
constantly in public schools is a good

1308
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:51,040
idea for civil society. Um an exercise

1309
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:52,960
maybe we'll do later on is start

1310
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:55,119
thinking about all of the data that MIT

1311
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:57,119
has about you. Um and we might start

1312
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:58,880
thinking like is it a good idea that MIT

1313
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:00,640
has all of this data about people? is a

1314
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:02,640
good idea for an elementary school to

1315
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:04,079
have all of this data um about where

1316
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,440
people are moving, where they're logging

1317
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:06,800
in, how they're learning, their

1318
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,119
healthcare, all these other kinds of

1319
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,720
things. Um so it could it could be that

1320
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:12,480
collecting huge amounts of data lets us

1321
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:14,400
build really cool edtech products. It

1322
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:16,319
also could be that it sort of in inducts

1323
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,839
people into a surveillance society which

1324
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:19,880
ultimately is not good for democracies

1325
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:22,160
or civil society.

1326
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:23,440
Um so in the second half of the class,

1327
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,200
those are the or the second half of our

1328
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,520
reading of this book. Um those are the

1329
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:30,079
four dilemmas um that we'll spend some

1330
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:33,119
time messing around with and exploring.

1331
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:35,839
Um that is an overview of the task of

1332
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:38,160
the reading together. Um and then what

1333
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:40,800
we'll do for the last 20 minutes of

1334
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:43,119
class um is to talk about massive open

1335
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:45,599
online courses in particular. But maybe

1336
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:47,599
I'll pause um back here you know

1337
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:49,319
essentially on these these kind of two

1338
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:52,400
slides

1339
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:53,520
um and see if uh people have any

1340
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:57,000
questions or things they want to

1341
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:57,000
interject here

1342
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:04,079
for the next slide when you mention like

1343
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:06,280
the four as yet intractable dilemmas

1344
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:09,920
when you are studying technology

1345
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:11,760
education have you found issues that

1346
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:14,560
used to be dilemmas and that at some

1347
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:17,520
point we were actually able to solve and

1348
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:19,200
these are the four that are like left.

1349
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:21,520
Yeah. So, so I think so I think there

1350
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:24,480
there would be some there would be like

1351
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:26,000
um access and distribution problems that

1352
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:28,319
you might have thought about as being

1353
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,079
like really central to lots of different

1354
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:31,359
places 20 years ago that would be that

1355
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:32,960
would still you know if we're talking

1356
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:34,400
about subsaharan Africa or other kinds

1357
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,640
of places in the world are still serious

1358
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,240
but you

1359
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:39,520
know refugee camps places of protracted

1360
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:41,520
conflicts lots of you know lots of

1361
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:43,359
places where access isn't hard um but

1362
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,480
there's also lots of places be like you

1363
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:46,160
know in the United States like pretty

1364
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:48,800
much every school has highspeed internet

1365
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:50,000
now um and So whereas and we still have

1366
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,680
to think about how we do that and how we

1367
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:55,119
upgrade it and things like that but but

1368
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:56,800
but that is a dilemma which has you know

1369
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:58,480
diminished quite a bit over time and

1370
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:01,040
some of you know for sure some of these

1371
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:02,720
dilemmas we've made progress on I mean I

1372
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:05,280
would particularly say the trap of

1373
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:07,200
routine assessment is one where um you

1374
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:09,359
know in the last 10 or 15 years there

1375
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:11,839
are definitely there are definitely

1376
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:14,000
places where you could say hey um we're

1377
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:15,599
doing better automated assessment now

1378
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,599
than we were before at different levels.

1379
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:19,280
So um I mean computer science is

1380
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:21,920
probably the place where we have the

1381
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:24,000
most robust suite of autograding tools.

1382
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:25,760
Um it doesn't cover everything that's

1383
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,440
important in computer science but boy

1384
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:29,119
like you can automatically evaluate

1385
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:31,440
people on a lot of stuff that matters.

1386
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:35,760
Um uh yeah I mean there's an example in

1387
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:38,000
the book of uh of autograding spoken

1388
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:39,359
language um for language learners. You

1389
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,880
know that you can talk out loud and

1390
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:42,240
Dualingo can tell whether or not you've

1391
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:45,760
pronounced something correctly. That's

1392
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:48,000
pretty rad. Um uh and then I think there

1393
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,760
you know it it pro it'll be interesting

1394
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,599
to see in the next few years but I'm my

1395
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,680
hunch is large language models will play

1396
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:55,520
an increasingly large role in at least

1397
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:57,599
giving people meaningful feedback on

1398
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:59,599
their written products. Um whether or

1399
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:02,040
not we actually grade with them like

1400
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:04,079
that may be sort of a bridge too far.

1401
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:05,359
Um, I'm sure we'll use it in some

1402
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:07,440
circumstances, but I bet there'll be

1403
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:09,520
many, many circumstances. You know, if

1404
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:11,760
if you told me 10 years from now, every

1405
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:13,280
time a student turned in a paper, they

1406
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,880
ran it through like an advanced version

1407
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,160
of something like Grammarly, which gave

1408
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,440
them not only feedback about their

1409
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,480
syntax, but was like, "Hey, I don't

1410
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,680
think you have any evidence in this

1411
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,720
paragraph. You might want to go back and

1412
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,560
look at that." Like, that wouldn't

1413
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:24,079
surprise me at all. Um, and that could

1414
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:25,599
help students a lot. you know, if

1415
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:27,200
there's if there's someone who who can,

1416
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:28,800
you know, if there's an automated bot

1417
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,480
that can like, you know, give you

1418
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,920
reasonable feedback generically about

1419
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,680
your writing, that would be cool. You

1420
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:35,440
know, that I'd ra I'd rather focus on

1421
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,880
other things than giving you feedback.

1422
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,880
So, I remember you mentioning in one of

1423
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:40,720
the slides that computers right now are

1424
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,560
like not very good at things that don't

1425
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:46,240
have as much structure, but with things

1426
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:50,319
like LLM, um, do you think that that's

1427
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:54,560
going to change? Like I they will get

1428
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:56,800
better. Um I I think there is still I

1429
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:58,960
think even some of our earliest evidence

1430
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:02,000
suggests that these are really thorny

1431
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:03,920
problems. Um so like I feel like we're

1432
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,880
starting to get some feedback about for

1433
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:09,440
instance people using LLMs to help them

1434
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:13,200
in coding. Um and there's a joke which

1435
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:15,680
is something like um you know um using

1436
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:18,240
co-pilots in coding will reduce your

1437
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:20,800
initial coding time in half and then it

1438
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:23,440
will double your quality assurance time.

1439
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:25,200
um that you know basically because like

1440
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:26,800
not only will it maybe introduce errors

1441
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:28,480
but also the people engineering things

1442
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:31,200
just won't understand what the bot is

1443
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:33,119
doing and the bot is much better at like

1444
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:35,200
very specific parts of building code

1445
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:36,880
than it is in engineering a whole system

1446
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,240
and so like it makes a bunch of

1447
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,440
decisions that make sense for a

1448
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,559
particular thing but don't make sense

1449
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,319
for building a whole system and then

1450
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:45,680
somebody has to go back and repair those

1451
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:48,720
kinds of things. um are you know so are

1452
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:49,839
so in terms of like um I don't I'll get

1453
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,760
we'll get into this more when we talk

1454
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:53,520
about autograders later but um Hal Abson

1455
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:55,040
who's been on the CS faculty forever has

1456
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:57,040
this wonderful quotation in one of his

1457
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:59,480
earliest books on uh computer science

1458
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:03,280
which says something like

1459
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:05,359
um computer programming is a language

1460
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,960
for computer for communicating between

1461
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:08,480
two people about methods that's only

1462
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:11,119
incidentally meant to be run by a

1463
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:13,280
machine. Um and the idea is that really

1464
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:15,359
good code is actually talking amongst

1465
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:18,000
people um and not talking to the

1466
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:20,880
machine. Um our autograders are really

1467
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,160
good at figuring out whether or not code

1468
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,680
like does things that machines

1469
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:25,440
understand and our autograders for

1470
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:27,520
computer science are not very good at

1471
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:29,920
evaluating things like how well is this

1472
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:31,920
code designed for collaboration amongst

1473
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:33,440
people? How you know how sensibly are

1474
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,119
the functions named and other kinds of

1475
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:37,359
things like that. I I my hunch is we'll

1476
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:39,280
make progress on it. Um my other hunch

1477
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:42,400
is that it will remain like a pretty

1478
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:43,920
hard problem for a pretty long time. Um

1479
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,720
and also it's a problem we'll solve in

1480
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:48,319
degrees like will we will we give better

1481
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:50,640
automatic like five years from now will

1482
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:52,480
we give better automatic feedback to the

1483
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:54,319
typical middle school essay written in

1484
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:56,240
almost any topic and will some of that

1485
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:58,480
feedback actually be useful? Seems

1486
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:00,559
almost certain to me. Um will we be able

1487
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:02,960
to actually grade? we will actually say

1488
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:04,800
something like like this p like this

1489
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:06,160
paper is better than this other paper

1490
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,960
with all the consequences that are

1491
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:10,640
attendant to that. Um we already do that

1492
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:12,079
to some extent in the education system

1493
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:13,680
but I think we're still going to find

1494
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:15,760
that we're not confident in the

1495
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:17,200
assessment that these machines make. Um

1496
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:19,520
but fortunately like these are all

1497
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:20,960
testable hypotheses. So you know your if

1498
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:23,440
your predictions were more optimistic

1499
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:26,079
than mine you could very well be right.

1500
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:29,559
Um let's talk about massive open online

1501
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:32,520
courses for a bit.

1502
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:35,839
Um, MOOs burst on the scene in

1503
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:37,839
particular 2011 2012. So almost 15 years

1504
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:39,280
ago now. How many of you have taken a

1505
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:40,800
massive open online course? How many of

1506
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,240
you have signed up for a class? How many

1507
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,720
how many of you how many of you signed

1508
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:46,000
up for one and finished it all the way

1509
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:48,160
through? Okay. So people laugh because

1510
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,440
that is a much smaller number of folks.

1511
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:52,000
Um, this is one of the sort of

1512
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:53,680
distinctive features of online learning.

1513
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,760
Um,

1514
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:59,359
uh, is that online learning is really

1515
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:00,880
hard. Um it is if you were not alive or

1516
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:03,960
sort of paying attention to education in

1517
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:07,280
2011, 2012, 2013, it is hard to

1518
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:09,280
understand h like how much people

1519
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:12,240
assumed that these tools would

1520
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:14,319
completely change higher education like

1521
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:16,960
not be like a little bit useful maybe,

1522
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:18,480
but like utterly rearrange educational

1523
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:20,240
systems. Like people thought they were

1524
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:22,160
going to be before MOOs and after mukes.

1525
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:24,319
part of the hype of this the first sort

1526
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:26,319
of really large scale class like this um

1527
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:27,760
Sebastian Thrun and Peter Norvig um who

1528
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:29,280
are computer science Sebastian Thrun

1529
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,960
works on self-driving cars he founded a

1530
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:32,079
company called Udacity Peter Norvig

1531
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:34,079
worked at Google forever they were both

1532
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:36,079
professors at Stanford um they created a

1533
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:38,240
class called intro to AI um and they

1534
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:40,400
sent an email around to the E mailing

1535
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:42,160
list um saying anybody want to take this

1536
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:44,480
intro to AI class um they were

1537
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:46,559
particularly inspired by Salcon um I

1538
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:48,800
think it was who was talking about the

1539
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:50,960
like the the the MITx practice sets that

1540
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:52,800
you were going through um they were very

1541
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:54,319
taken by that model. You watch a little

1542
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,440
bit of a video, you solve a couple

1543
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:57,040
problems. You watch a little bit more

1544
00:51:55,440 --> 00:52:00,160
video, you solve a couple problems. Sort

1545
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:01,520
of interle them along. Um they send this

1546
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,800
email around, they're thinking, you

1547
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:04,480
know, maybe a few hundred, maybe a few

1548
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,960
thousand people show up. 100,000 people

1549
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:09,680
sign up for this course. 100,000 people,

1550
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:11,359
you know, multiples more than Peter and

1551
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:13,119
Sebastian combined would have ever

1552
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:16,319
taught on Stanford campus in their

1553
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:18,720
entire career there. Um and and there

1554
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:21,040
was a vision like wow this could happen

1555
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:23,599
for everything everywhere. This could be

1556
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:26,960
all of higher education in the future.

1557
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:28,480
Um the amount of resources that

1558
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:30,240
ultimately people like Peter and

1559
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:32,319
Sebastian could put behind a course for

1560
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:34,160
100,000 people like you could easily

1561
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:36,000
spend hundred thousand dollars of build

1562
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:38,000
building that course material and then

1563
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,760
the cost of every marginal student every

1564
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,880
additional student would be quite low

1565
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:42,079
you know. So most people who are

1566
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:43,520
teaching a class, you just like, you

1567
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:45,200
know, you hire someone, you pay them

1568
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:46,640
$60,000 a year in a community college,

1569
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,839
maybe less, you pay them $100,000 a

1570
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:49,680
year, leave college, maybe a little

1571
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:51,440
more. Um, and they spend some of that

1572
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:53,359
money making a course and 20 people take

1573
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:55,040
it and that's that. Um, but imagine if

1574
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:57,040
you could concentrate resources to make

1575
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:59,599
like the best possible instructional

1576
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:01,119
sequence, the best course ever. Um, I

1577
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:02,559
was I did my undergraduate at the

1578
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:04,000
University of Virginia. Um, and the

1579
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:06,480
University of Virginia very briefly

1580
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,480
fired their president um, in I think

1581
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,400
2013 because she was not sort of

1582
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:14,319
transitioning fast enough to this new

1583
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:16,160
online world. Um, and and then um, uh,

1584
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:18,079
the the board of governors sort of

1585
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:19,520
underestimated her popularity on campus

1586
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:21,119
and all the faculty and students came

1587
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:25,200
out on the lawn and protested and she

1588
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:27,280
got rehired. Um but you know um like

1589
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:29,280
like you know imagine if MI you know

1590
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:31,040
MIT's president UMass president got

1591
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:33,119
fired this week because they weren't

1592
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:35,200
moving fast enough on AI. Like that was

1593
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:37,040
sort of like the equivalent of of what

1594
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:39,040
was happening in 2013. It was just

1595
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:41,200
madness. Um and I had just finished my

1596
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:44,079
PhD. Um so I had just finished at

1597
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:45,359
Harvard in uh 2012. I spent a year

1598
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:47,119
working at an organization nearby called

1599
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:48,720
Facing History and Ourselves. Um and I

1600
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:51,040
got hired at Harvard as the first

1601
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:52,720
researcher whose responsibility was to

1602
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:54,960
sort of um create a research

1603
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:57,440
infrastructure for Harvard X. Um there

1604
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:59,359
were three big bets that when that when

1605
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:01,800
Harvard and MIT came together to create

1606
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:04,000
MOOs um to create

1607
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:06,319
edex mukes have been created in other

1608
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,680
places too. Um Corsera at Stanford most

1609
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:08,559
notably there are three things they're

1610
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,920
going to try to do. They're going to

1611
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:11,440
provide new pathways into higher

1612
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:13,280
education for people who have limited

1613
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:14,559
access. um that basically there are lots

1614
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:16,000
of places in the world where people

1615
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:17,280
can't get into higher education because

1616
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,880
they can't afford it because it's not

1617
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:21,359
nearby the programs they want aren't

1618
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:22,400
there if all that is online that as soon

1619
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:24,079
as you can connect people to the

1620
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:26,880
internet everybody can participate in

1621
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:28,880
everything um people thought that it

1622
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:30,880
would sort of reorganize disrupt

1623
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:32,240
unbundle sort of profoundly change

1624
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:33,599
systems of higher education so

1625
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:35,280
universities might still be around but

1626
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:37,440
they could be organized in totally new

1627
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:40,640
ways um you know we were talking just in

1628
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:42,240
the beginning about um how um research

1629
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:43,599
universities often hire hire people who

1630
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:45,520
are not particularly good at teaching.

1631
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:47,119
Um well, what if like all the teaching

1632
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:49,040
just got provided by these companies

1633
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:50,559
that like specialized in generating

1634
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:52,319
learning materials and then the you know

1635
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:53,680
your research professors could just go

1636
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:56,559
do their research and all of you could

1637
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:58,079
take 611 from an online course. Wasn't

1638
00:54:56,559 --> 00:55:01,119
there a quote from the book that was

1639
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:03,119
like in like 30 years there would only

1640
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:04,880
be like 10 universities left in the

1641
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:06,160
country and Udacity could be one of

1642
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,720
them. Yeah. Yeah. That was Sebastian

1643
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:10,240
Thur and the idea probably from that is

1644
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:11,920
probably not quite as crazy it seemed.

1645
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:13,920
It was probably not that there would not

1646
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:16,000
be institutions of higher education, but

1647
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:18,800
like you would go to UMass or Bunker

1648
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,559
Hill Community College and all of the

1649
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:25,160
classes being taught there would have

1650
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:28,720
been made at, you know, um, Shingua

1651
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:30,880
University, Stanford, Harvard, MIT, um,

1652
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:32,800
CMU and a handful of other at Udacity

1653
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:34,720
and a handful of other places. and like

1654
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:37,119
going to something like UMass or Bunker

1655
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:39,440
Hill Community College would mean taking

1656
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:41,680
online courses that were created by

1657
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:43,680
elite institutions elsewhere and you'd

1658
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:45,680
get a dorm room, you know, and be in a

1659
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:47,680
fraternity and be able to like have

1660
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:49,440
some, you know, a human dots and extra

1661
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:51,680
help and things like that. Um, but

1662
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:53,040
people really like that like it sounds

1663
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:54,720
ridiculous, but people like absolutely

1664
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:57,280
believe that people people thought for

1665
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:58,720
sure that higher education would be, you

1666
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:00,799
know, if we went if we went back into

1667
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:02,559
2012 and said that higher education is

1668
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:04,720
like basically the same except having

1669
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:07,200
more financial difficulties in 2024 than

1670
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:08,480
it would in 2012. Um, there would be

1671
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:11,960
lots of people who would be very

1672
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:15,680
surprised um by by that.

1673
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:16,960
Um, so this I guess this presentation I

1674
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:18,319
I don't know when I developed this,

1675
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:20,000
probably 2019 or something like that,

1676
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:21,440
but it was sort of at the moment where

1677
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,680
it was pretty clear that like none of

1678
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:25,520
these bets were going to pan out. Um,

1679
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:27,280
that uh that what that we were not going

1680
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:30,160
to accomplish these things and I was

1681
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:31,760
sort of trying to help a community. I

1682
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,880
know like sometimes you talking to like

1683
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:34,400
the people we talked to last time,

1684
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:38,240
education deans and stuff like that or

1685
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:40,000
provosts or um funders or or people

1686
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:41,839
educated in education like why didn't

1687
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,880
muks do the things that we wanted them

1688
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:45,839
to do? Um oh first of all actually I

1689
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,960
don't have to spend too much time

1690
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:48,720
because it sounds like everybody has

1691
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:50,079
taken a muk. Um but like the most

1692
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:52,000
important thing that you need like like

1693
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:53,359
the two most important buttons in a muk

1694
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,880
are the previous button and the next

1695
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:56,559
button. That's kind of like what makes

1696
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:57,680
an instructor guided learning at scale.

1697
00:56:56,559 --> 00:56:59,280
Like there's a bunch of stuff that we

1698
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:01,200
shove in the middle and then like you

1699
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:02,960
click next, you do some stuff. If you

1700
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:04,640
get it wrong or get confused, you click

1701
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:06,880
previous, but you sort of linearly make

1702
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:09,680
your way through some instructor guided

1703
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:12,240
um set of materials. A bunch of it is

1704
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:13,280
video or animations or text explanation

1705
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,640
or stuff like that. And then

1706
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:17,240
periodically there are some assessment

1707
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:21,119
questions that that come along.

1708
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:26,079
Um we realized as education researchers

1709
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:27,920
almost right away um that folks who were

1710
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:29,040
who are furthest from opportunity were

1711
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:31,680
not the ones who were signing up for

1712
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:33,599
mukes first um by this is a paper that

1713
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:35,520
was published in 2019 in nature by

1714
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:38,160
Ezekiel Emanuel who's actually a mostly

1715
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:39,760
a medical researcher um but he was like

1716
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:41,520
you know in the United States here's the

1717
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:42,799
population with a college degree here's

1718
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:44,960
the MOO student population with a

1719
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:46,799
college degree you know in Brazil Russia

1720
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:48,400
India China South Africa Here's the

1721
00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:49,680
population with a with a college degree.

1722
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:51,119
Here's the percent of people from those

1723
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:52,799
countries taking mukes have a college

1724
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:55,280
degree. So basically we could tell

1725
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:57,599
almost right away um that the people

1726
00:57:55,280 --> 00:58:02,400
that we were recruiting into MOOs were

1727
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:04,880
folks who were already educated. Um I I

1728
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:07,680
today I don't know that we we know

1729
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:09,520
everything about why that's the case. Um

1730
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:11,680
people who have earned an education

1731
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:13,359
probably enjoy education as leisure time

1732
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:14,880
activities more than people who don't

1733
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:17,119
pursue an education. That would be sort

1734
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:18,319
of normal. Um, but I would say that one

1735
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:20,480
thing that we've discovered in various

1736
00:58:18,319 --> 00:58:22,160
formats is that online self-paced

1737
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:24,960
learning is incredibly difficult for

1738
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:26,480
people. Um, the VA like you all sort of

1739
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,839
laughingly joked about that when I said,

1740
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:29,760
"How many of you have started a MOO that

1741
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:31,280
you didn't finish?" Um, and you all are

1742
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:32,720
some of the best people in the world at

1743
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:35,119
self-paced learning and you found it

1744
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:36,640
hard. Um, the entire population, the

1745
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:38,160
vast majority of people find online

1746
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:40,319
self-paced learning really, really

1747
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:42,480
difficult. Um, they have other

1748
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:43,760
priorities in their life. It's boring.

1749
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:45,200
Um and actually an interesting thing

1750
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:46,640
about people is that when they're

1751
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:48,720
studying something they really care

1752
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:50,480
about they can be quite persistent in

1753
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:52,640
learning. Um so like you study young

1754
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:57,280
people who are like you know right now

1755
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:59,839
um uh if you ask young young tween teens

1756
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:02,160
um to explore skincare routines online

1757
00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:04,400
um they will pursue that with great

1758
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:05,920
passion, great determination, persist

1759
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:07,839
through lots of difficulties and be

1760
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:10,240
successful. Um they will not do the same

1761
00:59:07,839 --> 00:59:11,599
with algebra. um you kind of wish as a

1762
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:13,040
society that they were better doing in

1763
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:14,240
algebra than skincare routines, but

1764
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:16,880
that's just not the way human beings

1765
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:18,960
seem to be wired. Um so online self the

1766
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:20,319
VA now who gets good at online

1767
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:23,040
self-paced learning like how do you

1768
00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:25,119
become good at being a good autodidact?

1769
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:26,400
Um I think the best guess we have is

1770
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:28,319
that you get an apprenticeship in the

1771
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:30,319
formal education system. The best way to

1772
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:32,160
be good at learning on your own is to

1773
00:59:30,319 --> 00:59:33,920
learn with a bunch of other people. Um

1774
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:35,760
so that means the way to become really

1775
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:38,000
good at taking these online self-paced

1776
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:40,799
mukes is to go get a college degree. But

1777
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,400
if your goal was to was to create new

1778
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:44,960
pathways into higher education for

1779
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:46,400
limited access, building a thing which

1780
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:48,000
you really have to have spent a lot of

1781
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:50,240
time in education to be good at is maybe

1782
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:52,720
not the best strategy. Um but people

1783
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:54,559
didn't know that at the time. Um this is

1784
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:58,000
an article that I wrote with Marano's

1785
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:59,760
adviser Jose. Um that was where we were

1786
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,799
um we're trying to figure out like why

1787
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:04,880
muks were not working. Um and uh one of

1788
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:06,240
the things that we observed is the these

1789
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:08,160
are charts of enrollment but they're

1790
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:10,400
charts of enrollment by sort of human

1791
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:12,079
development index category. So basically

1792
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:13,839
way more people were coming from the

1793
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:15,040
world's most affluent countries than

1794
01:00:13,839 --> 01:00:16,720
were coming from the world's least

1795
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:19,440
affluent countries. And we basically

1796
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:21,520
made no dent in it you know over the

1797
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:23,200
first eight years or so. Um you know you

1798
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:24,559
could you could imagine like oh well we

1799
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:26,079
started with a pretty big gap. you know,

1800
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:28,079
if these three lines on the bottom had

1801
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:29,359
sort of continued to traverse up, then

1802
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:31,200
maybe you could say, "Okay, we're making

1803
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:32,319
progress towards our goals." Um, the

1804
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:34,559
other thing that was kind of a problem

1805
01:00:32,319 --> 01:00:36,319
is is heading into the pandemic, um,

1806
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:37,520
enrollments and sort of like if you're

1807
01:00:36,319 --> 01:00:39,040
trying to run a company or something

1808
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:41,119
like that, it's really not good to have

1809
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:42,960
this line go down. You'd really like if

1810
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:45,200
this was Facebook's graph, it would just

1811
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:47,040
keep going up exponentially forever. Um,

1812
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:48,559
that was another problem with with MOOs

1813
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:50,000
compared to sort of other social media

1814
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:51,440
businesses. Like when you sign up for

1815
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,480
Facebook or Twitter or something like

1816
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:54,240
that, you're kind of stuck in there

1817
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:56,319
forever. um when you sign up for a

1818
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:57,680
class, the class ends. Um and then you

1819
01:00:56,319 --> 01:01:01,280
leave and go do something else with your

1820
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:03,040
life. Um so why didn't this work? Um or

1821
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:05,760
or or or

1822
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:06,640
um actually we'll talk about the um the

1823
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:09,520
second one next, but what were you going

1824
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:10,960
to say, Maria? I was just reflecting one

1825
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:13,359
thing that that I realized as well

1826
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:16,319
recently is that like everyone now

1827
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:18,480
creates their own course. Like every

1828
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:19,680
influencer has a course on something

1829
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:22,079
different, right? And I think that

1830
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:24,400
probably also affected this like ability

1831
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:26,240
of books to kind of spread because

1832
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:28,480
originally like five or six

1833
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:30,200
organizations were creating content and

1834
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:32,880
nowadays this is very

1835
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:34,480
decentralized. So even it's still hard

1836
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:37,119
for people to complete these courses

1837
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:40,079
online etc etc like there's also a lot

1838
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:42,799
more um competition right there's a lot

1839
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:44,559
of competition out there and traditional

1840
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:45,839
institutions proved to be very effective

1841
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:47,839
in that competition. So here's the thing

1842
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:49,119
which shocked even me. Um at the

1843
01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:51,119
beginning of the pandemic, you all

1844
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:53,280
remember this from like March 2020,

1845
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:55,760
April 2020, like we sent you all home.

1846
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:57,520
Um and here's something that could have

1847
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:59,359
happened. There could have like there

1848
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:01,280
were there were thousands of professors

1849
01:01:59,359 --> 01:02:03,359
in the United States who were teaching

1850
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:04,960
introduction to microeconomics and a

1851
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:06,880
bunch of them could have said, "There is

1852
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:08,160
no way I can do a good job continuing to

1853
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:09,760
teach you introduction to economics.

1854
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:11,280
Like my kids aren't in school. They're

1855
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:14,079
running underneath my feet right now.

1856
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:16,559
I've never taught online before. Just go

1857
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:18,400
to edex. go to go to John Hopkins, go to

1858
01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:20,280
MIT, take their courses and I'll give

1859
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:23,520
you a test at the end and help you out.

1860
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:25,520
Um, the alternative is that like I take

1861
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:27,200
my lectures, I put them online and we

1862
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:28,799
meet in Zoom once a week and I still

1863
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:30,720
keep giving you your lectures.

1864
01:02:28,799 --> 01:02:32,480
Basically, every learner and institution

1865
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:35,359
in the world preferred the latter

1866
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:36,720
option. um all throughout the pandemic

1867
01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:38,400
at all levels of the education around

1868
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:40,160
the world, we basically said like would

1869
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:42,240
you rather have this really high

1870
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:44,000
production value class kind of offered

1871
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:45,200
anonymously from some institution that

1872
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,839
maybe you've heard of but you have no

1873
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:50,079
connection with or with your own like

1874
01:02:47,839 --> 01:02:51,520
harried professor who's taking care of

1875
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:52,960
his kids while teaching you who doesn't

1876
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:55,119
know anything about online learning and

1877
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:56,880
people overwhelmingly pick the latter.

1878
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:58,000
Um I don't know why we don't know you

1879
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:59,280
know I don't know why we don't know why

1880
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,440
they picked the ladder other than the

1881
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:04,000
fact that human that like education is a

1882
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:05,440
profoundly social enterprise. Um even

1883
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,880
the comment you made about about

1884
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:08,079
influencers having their own closest and

1885
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:09,680
things like that like you have a

1886
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:11,520
parasocial relationship with those

1887
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:13,200
influencers in a way that you wouldn't

1888
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:14,640
you know from Josh Angress who teaches

1889
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:17,200
the economics class here or something

1890
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:18,960
like that. Um all right let me try to

1891
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:20,559
say two more things before we head out.

1892
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:24,160
Um oh well some of these things are on

1893
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:26,720
there. um that uh um the like the main

1894
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:28,960
advantage that mukes have is they reduce

1895
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:30,640
faculty labor. They pull faculty out of

1896
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:31,839
the equation. You know, they they just

1897
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:35,200
make them sort of television stars

1898
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:36,640
instead of teachers. Um and if you you

1899
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:38,160
know there's b like there's basically no

1900
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:40,960
way to do the economics of mukes except

1901
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:43,280
to dramatically reduce human contact. Um

1902
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:45,520
but like what helps people learn is

1903
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:47,520
human contact. like the like the way

1904
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:48,720
that you persist in most of your

1905
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:49,760
learning environments, especially when

1906
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:51,599
you're learning something you don't care

1907
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:53,039
about and are not that interested in is

1908
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:54,480
like you care what your faculty thinks

1909
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:55,760
about it. You care what your peers are.

1910
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:59,039
You have all these sort of other human

1911
01:03:55,760 --> 01:04:00,880
things that keep you connected. Um and

1912
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:02,640
uh and because of that, most people are

1913
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:03,760
not good at self-regulated learning. If

1914
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:05,359
the vast majority of people are not good

1915
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:06,799
at self-regulated learning, if the only

1916
01:04:05,359 --> 01:04:08,400
way to get better at self-regulated

1917
01:04:06,799 --> 01:04:10,240
learning is to, you know, go through the

1918
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:11,920
K12 system and go to college, then this

1919
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:13,680
is not going to be a good system for

1920
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:15,960
helping folks further from opportunity

1921
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:18,720
get into college.

1922
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:22,319
Um, the primary way that mukes were

1923
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:24,319
going to disrupt higher education um is

1924
01:04:22,319 --> 01:04:26,720
there was a very in for me influential

1925
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:28,480
article that said the act like the

1926
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:30,160
actual innovation nothing was innovative

1927
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:32,000
in muks a learning management system is

1928
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:33,440
not new. Edex was not new. Corsera was

1929
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,640
not new. Canvas was doing the same

1930
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:36,079
thing. Moodle was doing the same thing.

1931
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:38,000
Blackboard was doing the same thing.

1932
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:39,359
Autograders are not new. We had all

1933
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,200
kinds of autograders and all kinds of

1934
01:04:39,359 --> 01:04:43,599
systems. That the actual innovation in

1935
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:45,200
MOOs was putting a storefront on top of

1936
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:46,799
a learning management system. That the

1937
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:48,960
thing that was actually different was

1938
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:50,799
that like in the in the past if you

1939
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:53,119
wanted to buy a Harvard course, you had

1940
01:04:50,799 --> 01:04:54,960
to buy eight a year and you had to rent

1941
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:56,559
an apartment and you had to buy all your

1942
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:58,880
meals from the institution. Like you had

1943
01:04:56,559 --> 01:05:01,520
to buy this like giant bundle of stuff.

1944
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:03,039
Um, and so the bet that Harvard, MIT,

1945
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:05,200
Stanford, other folks made is like what

1946
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:07,039
if we sold just one course at a time?

1947
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:09,359
Um, like what if you could ca could come

1948
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:11,440
in and just take one intro to CS class,

1949
01:05:09,359 --> 01:05:14,720
one introduction to economics class. And

1950
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:16,799
that's and and millions of people were

1951
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:18,559
interested in that. Um, I mean, the

1952
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:19,839
number of signups that appeared in many

1953
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:21,760
of these courses were these

1954
01:05:19,839 --> 01:05:24,000
astronomically large numbers. You know,

1955
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:25,760
CS50 at Harvard had millions of people

1956
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,920
enrolled with just a couple of years. A

1957
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:29,440
tiny tiny fraction of them finish. you

1958
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:31,839
know, something like 1% of them finish.

1959
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:33,839
On average, MOO's about 5% of people um

1960
01:05:31,839 --> 01:05:36,160
who register. About 10% of people who

1961
01:05:33,839 --> 01:05:37,760
click into a course once um will persist

1962
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:38,920
in a class, but but pretty small

1963
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:43,920
numbers.

1964
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:46,079
Um however, it turned out um that just

1965
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:47,760
like storefronts didn't solve all of the

1966
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:49,280
problems at university stored. So,

1967
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:51,760
people were excited to try out

1968
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:53,599
storefronts. Um but storefronts by

1969
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:55,359
themselves didn't confer legitimacy.

1970
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:58,559
like really traditional things like

1971
01:05:55,359 --> 01:06:01,119
registar offices confirm legitimacy. Um

1972
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:03,839
things that publish transcripts um and

1973
01:06:01,119 --> 01:06:08,319
degrees and diplomas confer legitimacy.

1974
01:06:03,839 --> 01:06:10,000
Um and so and so this idea that mukes

1975
01:06:08,319 --> 01:06:13,359
could move forward just by selling one

1976
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:15,760
course at a time um proved untrue. So

1977
01:06:13,359 --> 01:06:17,119
then MOUS did something um which was

1978
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:18,559
surprising to people which they said

1979
01:06:17,119 --> 01:06:20,720
well all right why don't we start

1980
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:22,799
offering whole degree programs um how

1981
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:24,720
about instead of taking just one MOO at

1982
01:06:22,799 --> 01:06:27,039
a time you'll take eight MOOs and get an

1983
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:28,480
MBA you'll take eight mukes and get a a

1984
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:30,319
data science degree a computer science

1985
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:32,079
degree or something like that um there

1986
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:33,599
were companies that have been doing that

1987
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:36,559
for a long time those companies were

1988
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:39,599
called online program managers um they

1989
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:41,599
are some of the most sort of unreputable

1990
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:44,160
companies in the higher education space

1991
01:06:41,599 --> 01:06:46,960
for a few reasons Um, one is they tended

1992
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:48,880
to be pretty secretive. Um, so you would

1993
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:50,640
sign up for an online degree from an

1994
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:51,839
organization and you like think you're

1995
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:53,680
getting this degree from the University

1996
01:06:51,839 --> 01:06:55,920
of Chicago, but you like you slowly

1997
01:06:53,680 --> 01:07:00,319
realize um that there's a company called

1998
01:06:55,920 --> 01:07:01,760
TU or Embinet um or or or Pearson Ebinet

1999
01:07:00,319 --> 01:07:02,880
Services or something like that which is

2000
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:04,880
actually providing a bunch of your

2001
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:06,160
educational experiences. Um, the Wall

2002
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:08,319
Street Journal in the last couple of

2003
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:10,240
years has had a bunch of exposees of

2004
01:07:08,319 --> 01:07:11,599
boot camps that are branded by state

2005
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:13,039
universities, but they're actually just

2006
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:14,960
run by a company. You know, it's called

2007
01:07:13,039 --> 01:07:16,720
like the Oregon computer science boot

2008
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:18,799
camp or whatever, computer programming

2009
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:20,160
boot camp, but nobody who teaches in it

2010
01:07:18,799 --> 01:07:23,280
works for the University of Oregon and

2011
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:25,599
things like that. Um, uh, I mean, the

2012
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:28,960
other problem that universities faced

2013
01:07:25,599 --> 01:07:31,920
was that, um, like a a key precept of

2014
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:33,920
businesses is that you do not outsource

2015
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:35,280
your core competencies. Um, so if you're

2016
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:36,799
a university and you outsource your

2017
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:38,559
janitorial services, that is a great

2018
01:07:36,799 --> 01:07:40,160
idea. If you outsource your accounting

2019
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:42,000
services, that is a great idea. If you

2020
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:43,839
outsource your teaching and learning,

2021
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:46,000
that is a bad idea. The teaching and

2022
01:07:43,839 --> 01:07:50,559
learning is the thing that you do as a

2023
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:53,760
university. Um, so uh um I don't know, I

2024
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:55,760
wrote this paper in in 2019 um which

2025
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:57,440
said something like, man, these massive

2026
01:07:55,760 --> 01:08:00,160
open online courses, they sure seem to

2027
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:01,359
be behaving like online programs or

2028
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:02,960
they're sort of partnering with these

2029
01:08:01,359 --> 01:08:04,079
organizations. You know, part of the

2030
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:05,760
ways that they were compelling to

2031
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:08,640
organizations is that they would go to a

2032
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:10,720
university and say, "We will pay upfront

2033
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:12,880
for the development of these degree

2034
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:16,400
programs, but then for the next 15

2035
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:19,040
years, we'll take 40% 50% 60% of all the

2036
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:21,759
tuition revenue that comes in." um at

2037
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:23,040
the you know in year one that might seem

2038
01:08:21,759 --> 01:08:24,560
like a good idea because you didn't

2039
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:26,560
spend any money and you got this new

2040
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:29,120
tuition revenue but like 10 years from

2041
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:32,960
now you're like why am I paying you know

2042
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:34,400
to you Corsera Edex you know 60 50 40%

2043
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:36,159
of all the tuition revenue that's coming

2044
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:37,679
in when like what they're doing is in

2045
01:08:36,159 --> 01:08:39,120
some respects not that hard like they're

2046
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:40,480
running a learning management system and

2047
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:42,719
doing some online learning we can figure

2048
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:44,560
out how to do those things um this was a

2049
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:45,839
bit of a controversial paper when I

2050
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:48,000
published it and there was a whole bunch

2051
01:08:45,839 --> 01:08:49,600
of people um who said come on Justin,

2052
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,759
that's really not fair. You can't you

2053
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:53,520
can't say that mukes are turning into um

2054
01:08:51,759 --> 01:08:55,839
online program managers. But then two

2055
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:58,640
years later, Tuyu, who was the largest

2056
01:08:55,839 --> 01:09:01,759
online program manager, bought EdX. Um

2057
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:03,040
and uh and even that was a was a

2058
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:06,239
convergence that I wouldn't have

2059
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:08,799
projected. Um so I know um some of you

2060
01:09:06,239 --> 01:09:12,799
may know that um all of the proceeds

2061
01:09:08,799 --> 01:09:14,640
from um from the sale of Edex went to

2062
01:09:12,799 --> 01:09:18,319
this nonprofit controlled by Harvard and

2063
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:21,359
MIT called Axom. Um, so, uh, so, uh, Tu

2064
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:22,960
paid $800 million for edex. Um, and that

2065
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:25,920
$800 million went to start a new

2066
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:27,120
nonprofit. Um, like headlines like this

2067
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:29,040
were kind of funny to me. You know,

2068
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:31,120
Harvard and MIT led nonprofit to tackle

2069
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:33,359
long-standing inequities in education.

2070
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:36,080
Um, but like that's exactly what Edex

2071
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:37,679
was. Um, Edex was a nonprofit designed

2072
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:39,279
to tackle inequities in education. I was

2073
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:41,199
like, well, that didn't work, so we're

2074
01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:42,719
starting a new one. Um, and it's like,

2075
01:09:41,199 --> 01:09:44,080
you know, like I just like how the big

2076
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:45,839
headline is like, "This is this brand

2077
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:47,359
new thing that we're doing. And by the

2078
01:09:45,839 --> 01:09:49,520
way, it's because we sold the last

2079
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:53,600
version of this that we just did. Tiny

2080
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:56,719
font at the bottom." Um, uh, this was

2081
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:59,520
last year's sales price for Edex. Um, or

2082
01:09:56,719 --> 01:10:01,520
for TU 2. Um, and, uh, yeah, their stock

2083
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:02,880
has declined 90% over the last five

2084
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:04,159
years. You can sort of see the pandemic

2085
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:06,320
bubble here. People did a bunch of

2086
01:10:04,159 --> 01:10:07,920
online learning. Um and then they were

2087
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:09,760
partly they were less enthusiastic about

2088
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:11,600
it but also as universities get better

2089
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:12,960
at offering online learning um they

2090
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:16,320
don't have to partner with groups like

2091
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:18,440
TU anymore. Um this is actually today's

2092
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:22,159
stock quote where it is down

2093
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:25,360
99.36% over the last five years. Um uh

2094
01:10:22,159 --> 01:10:26,960
so you know um TU paid for edex like

2095
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:29,120
substantially more than the entire

2096
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:30,719
company of 2U is currently worth today.

2097
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:33,440
Um, I guess I was just looking for like

2098
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:35,360
clarification on like EdX and like MITx

2099
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:37,040
and like Harvard X. Like is that all the

2100
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:39,280
same thing? Like the MITx that we use

2101
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:43,040
now? No. So, well, all right. So,

2102
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:45,760
Harvard and MIT each put $30 million.

2103
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:49,280
Um, they create units called Harvard X

2104
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:51,280
and MITx. Um, those are like sort of

2105
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:52,960
independent brands. The shared

2106
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:55,280
infrastructure that those things used

2107
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:57,679
was this thing called Edex. Um, Edex was

2108
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:59,199
a company. It also created an open

2109
01:10:57,679 --> 01:11:02,640
source learning management system called

2110
01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:05,520
open edex. So the com the like nonprofit

2111
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:07,840
edex was sold to to you to become part

2112
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:10,560
of a company but there still is an open

2113
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:12,560
source project called edex um which is a

2114
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:14,560
a learning management system software

2115
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:16,239
MITx and if there's still a thing called

2116
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:19,440
Harvard X to some extent in their

2117
01:11:16,239 --> 01:11:20,560
products use this thing called open edex

2118
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:22,480
as what they're doing like the

2119
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:24,800
infrastructure but MIT like the content

2120
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:29,000
that we look at when we go on MITx as

2121
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:31,679
students is not owned by this company

2122
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:33,199
uh Uh yes, but although it's sort of

2123
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:36,400
slightly more complicated than that

2124
01:11:33,199 --> 01:11:39,360
because I think like I um they

2125
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:41,280
definitely bought the right to display

2126
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:42,719
all or most of maybe they could display

2127
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:44,400
anything that they had instructors

2128
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:46,960
permission to be able to display. Like I

2129
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:50,159
took all of my courses off of Edex um

2130
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:51,520
when it was bought by TU um because

2131
01:11:50,159 --> 01:11:52,560
because I don't want to support online

2132
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:54,159
program managers. I don't think they're

2133
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:55,760
good for higher education. Um some

2134
01:11:54,159 --> 01:11:57,199
departments did that, things like that.

2135
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:58,640
They still might have some rights to

2136
01:11:57,199 --> 01:11:59,840
display some of it, but they still sort

2137
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:01,840
of basically did what they wanted

2138
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:03,520
because if you look at it, a lot of it

2139
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:06,080
and like even open courseware is also

2140
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:08,000
from like 2008 updated years. Yeah.

2141
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:09,920
Which I guess makes sense. Yeah. You

2142
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,520
know, and in some ways in theor you know

2143
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:12,880
like like a lot of the argument is that

2144
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:16,080
it shouldn't have to be, right? Like how

2145
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:17,920
you know how much did uh um did did

2146
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:20,320
multivariable calculus change since

2147
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:21,840
2008? Like you know not that much. Um

2148
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:23,280
and part of the way that you gain the

2149
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:24,400
economy of scale is by sort of leaving

2150
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:25,600
these things alone. All right, we'll

2151
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:28,080
come back and I'll sort of finish this

2152
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:29,840
in here except to say that we uh we

2153
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:31,600
tried a whole lot of stuff to develop a

2154
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:33,040
new science of learning and like

2155
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:34,880
probably the main thing that we learned

2156
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:36,400
is that like people who click a lot into

2157
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:38,480
things do better than people who click

2158
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:40,560
less into things. Um which you probably

2159
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:42,239
didn't need a $60 million investment to

2160
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:43,840
be able to figure out. Um but I'll

2161
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:45,440
finish with this next time. Um you'll

2162
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:47,199
turn in your papers by email and we'll

2163
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:49,280
talk a little bit more about uh

2164
01:12:47,199 --> 01:12:51,120
intelligent tutors as well um both on

2165
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:52,480
Wednesday and the following Monday. Um

2166
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:53,280
if I can help you at all with paper one

2167
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:54,880
or anything else, let me know.

2168
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:57,880
Otherwise, have a wonderful rest of your

2169
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:57,880
week.
