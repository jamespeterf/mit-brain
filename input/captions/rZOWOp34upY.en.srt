00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,760
Quantum computing represents a

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:05,520
fundamentally new approach to processing

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,120
information. It's the only computing

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,720
model we know of today that's

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,639
qualitatively different from existing

6
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,400
computers. This difference and the

7
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,480
potential promise of a quantum computer

8
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,480
is reflected in the fact that simulating

9
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,039
a quantum computer using a classical

10
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,039
computer requires exponential overhead.

11
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,960
This means that as we add one cubit to

12
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,720
our quantum computer, the size of the

13
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,119
classical computer required to simulate

14
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,960
it will grow exponentially. representing

15
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,960
all of the quantum states of just 30

16
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,040
cubits would require at least a very

17
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,640
powerful laptop. Increase that to just

18
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,719
40 cubits and now you need a

19
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,480
supercomput. Double that to just 80

20
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,320
cubits and you would need all of the

21
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,879
classical computers we have on Earth.

22
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,559
Double that again to 160 cubits and now

23
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,480
you need all of the silicon atoms on

24
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,000
Earth. Even small increases in the

25
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,520
number of cubits translates to

26
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,920
exponential growth in the amount of

27
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,480
memory required to represent all 2 to

28
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,960
the n numbers that n cubits can store.
