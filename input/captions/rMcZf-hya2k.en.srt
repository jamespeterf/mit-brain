1
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:12,400
Okay, good morning everyone. Um, welcome

2
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:15,440
to our um, second annual uh, ladders to

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:18,000
cures accelerator symposium. Uh, my name

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,880
is Anna Gre. I'm a uh, core faculty here

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:27,119
at the broad and um, physician scientist

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:29,760
uh, at MGB. Um and uh I it is my great

7
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:33,200
pleasure to um open the symposium um

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,600
today. Um we have a great uh program

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,480
lined up uh and I'm very excited uh for

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,480
the whole u day. Um I hope that you can

11
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,320
all whether you're online or with us in

12
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,760
person uh you can um stay um and stay

13
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,200
engaged. Um I just wanted to make some

14
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,200
introductory comments about what the

15
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:53,039
ladder secures accelerator is and where

16
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,680
we stand now. Um this whole activity uh

17
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,680
was launched um more than two years ago

18
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,640
now. Uh our our official inaugural

19
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,480
symposium was uh exactly two years ago.

20
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,199
Um but the process actually the

21
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,040
brainstorming process uh started

22
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,040
uh maybe three years ago when we

23
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,200
gathered many of you here in this

24
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,360
community to think about um how can we

25
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,360
take um all of our genetic and genomic

26
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,600
discoveries uh that the broad has been

27
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,200
at the center of for so many years and

28
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,759
try to harness them for the benefit of

29
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,799
patients. And of course uh rare genetic

30
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,640
diseases are an area that is ripe for um

31
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,159
you know translation into therapies. And

32
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,920
this was uh something that we really

33
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,720
wanted to see how we can accelerate

34
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,479
further. And through basically

35
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,880
brainstorming with the entire community,

36
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,960
we came up with this idea of launching

37
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,479
uh the latter secures accelerator which

38
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,119
is really a scientific accelerator

39
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:45,360
aiming at bridging you know genetic

40
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,439
discoveries and work in rare diseases

41
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,520
hopefully um all the way to therapeutic

42
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:52,560
hypotheses and therapies uh for the

43
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:55,680
benefit of patients. And so um this is

44
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,079
really how this uh idea was born. Uh and

45
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,439
it's really been a tremendous uh couple

46
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,680
of years, you know, building this

47
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:05,040
community. Uh this is officially our

48
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,960
mission. Um which was actually uh very

49
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,800
well articulated by our very own

50
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,720
director Todd Gallib. He had a lot to do

51
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,720
with articulating this uh mission

52
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,239
statement very clearly. Catalyze

53
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,760
progress across the research ecosystem

54
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,120
and accelerate advances leading to

55
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,280
treatments and cures for patients with

56
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,440
rare genetic diseases. So this is what

57
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,280
we aim to do. It's a big ambitious goal,

58
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,239
but I think the time is right uh for us

59
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,920
to make progress in this space. And so

60
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,520
to really try to articulate a little bit

61
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,800
further what it is that we're actually

62
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:35,280
hoping to do, you know, the idea is to

63
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,760
actually build a platform uh that can

64
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,879
uncover nodal mechanisms across uh many

65
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:45,040
rare genetic diseases. Um so I just want

66
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:47,200
to uh point out that uh nodes doesn't

67
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,400
necessarily only mean biological nodes

68
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,400
although of course that's a lot of what

69
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,160
we do and we will be hearing about today

70
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,239
but it can also mean technological

71
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,000
nodes. So ways in which we can bring

72
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,000
technologies that can be applied across

73
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,239
many different diseases and find ways to

74
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,560
accelerate uh getting these technologies

75
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,040
to patients. And so, uh, for example,

76
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,640
you know, our our, um, symposium is

77
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,480
timed perfectly with this, you know,

78
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,560
incredible story that, uh, was in the

79
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,599
news yesterday, uh, about little, uh,

80
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,080
baby KJ who, you know, received, um, a

81
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,840
base editor to treat his disease, uh, at

82
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,159
just a few months of age and he's doing

83
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,920
very well and it's just such a miracle.

84
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,360
uh and I want to celebrate that and you

85
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,959
know of course the entire rare disease

86
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,440
community has been celebrating this news

87
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,280
since yesterday but to also say that

88
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,879
that's a technological node you know

89
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,599
being able to figure out ways in which

90
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:35,360
we can make KJ not the exception that we

91
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,840
celebrate but the beginning of a

92
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,080
revolution of many many other babies or

93
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,840
people like KJ who receive these

94
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,440
therapies. So harnessing these

95
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,519
technologies and finding ways to deploy

96
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,799
them for patients in uh in a way that is

97
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,640
um actually applied you know to dozens

98
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,000
and then hundreds and maybe thousands of

99
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,519
patients, millions of patients

100
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,920
ultimately across the planet so that

101
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,519
everyone can benefit. Um I think we will

102
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,840
uh be hearing from Jimmy later today

103
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,920
about some of those ideas. But that's to

104
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,680
me that's a technological node and a

105
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,760
biological node would be you know you

106
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,519
find a target like some of the work that

107
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,280
you know our lab has been working on and

108
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,360
you develop treatments and then you know

109
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,599
targeting that particular node actually

110
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,360
can deorphan multiple upstream diseases

111
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,680
that's another way to harness the

112
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,759
opportunity to help more patients um but

113
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,600
you know in both cases I think the idea

114
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,040
of finding these nodes searching for

115
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,880
nodes and finding them and then

116
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,199
deploying them for therapeutic benefit

117
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,040
is really what we're um hoping uh to

118
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,800
accomplish and so you know rare rare

119
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,720
diseases are collectively common and we

120
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,639
should find these nodes so we can find

121
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,080
therapies that can ultimately help more

122
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,360
and more patients. It shouldn't be the

123
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,160
exception. It should be something that

124
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,000
we do in a highly repeatable uh fashion

125
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,560
as as we move forward. That's how I

126
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,479
would um define success. So as we make

127
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,160
small steps in that direction beyond

128
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,560
building a platform that can harness

129
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,800
nodes or multiple platforms really for

130
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,639
uh harnessing these nodes, we also uh

131
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,880
are hoping to have some proof of concept

132
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,479
therapeutic projects. And so you this is

133
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,639
what we call our leading edge projects.

134
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,240
Um we have started by seeding 10 of

135
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,240
them. You will hear about all of them

136
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,600
today. This is part of this symposium

137
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,440
hearing about our leading edge projects

138
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,960
and the progress that they have made. It

139
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,320
is clearly work in progress because

140
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,600
we're only about six months into uh

141
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:15,680
beginning this process of having seated

142
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,600
these projects. So all of the uh

143
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,120
presenters know that this is work in

144
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,479
progress that they're showing us and

145
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,440
we're really just all working together

146
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:26,639
as a community to uh come to uh uh come

147
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,400
to uh u progress in that space. Of

148
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,800
course, nothing in rare diseases happens

149
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:34,400
with without patients. So this is very

150
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,560
much um uh a space and a an initiative

151
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,479
that is uh led by patients and patient

152
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,080
advocacy groups. And many of you will

153
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,400
know that in our open call for leading

154
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,400
edge projects, leading edge ideas, we

155
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,120
actually had a requirement that all of

156
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,960
the uh scientists uh you know leading

157
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,960
the ideas will actually have a patient

158
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,479
advocacy group with them and we did

159
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,240
indeed have that. That was a requirement

160
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,759
for the process and that was really to

161
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,199
galvanize this idea that you know

162
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,720
patients are our partners on this

163
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,560
journey to therapies and they're you

164
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,320
know the most important stakeholder for

165
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,600
everything that we do and of course it

166
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,520
goes without saying that all of this

167
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,360
requires collaboration. So of course you

168
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,360
know a big goal of our ladder secures

169
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,160
mission is to uh have a collaborative

170
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:15,120
effort. So just some numbers uh so far

171
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:17,199
we count 12129 scientists who are

172
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,840
working collaboratively um as part of

173
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,919
this accelerator. We have 10 uh cohort

174
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,759
projects uh in our first cohort that you

175
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,000
will hear about. We have so far

176
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,680
organized um six symposium and community

177
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,919
events. These are our rare disease day

178
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:33,120
events which uh we celebrated a decade

179
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,400
of those this past um February. And

180
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,759
we've had, you know, our inaugural

181
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,199
symposium and a couple of additional

182
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:41,120
symposia on AAVs, on using AI for the

183
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,600
benefit of uh genetic diseases and

184
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,960
making progress and uh many other ideas

185
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,039
that are part of this important

186
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,440
ecosystem uh so that we can all make

187
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,759
progress uh toward our mission. Uh and

188
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,440
finally, none of this would actually be

189
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,400
possible without uh philanthropic

190
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:59,280
support. So, I'm incredibly grateful um

191
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,360
to uh two anonymous uh philanthropic

192
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,039
organizations who support our work as

193
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,520
well as the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative

194
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:07,680
and so we're just really um delighted to

195
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,680
have their support and uh hope of course

196
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,080
to uh continue to make progress uh in

197
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,520
that space as well. Okay, I will not

198
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,199
read the names of the projects but I

199
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,560
just wanted to show you the breadth and

200
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,199
depth of the different projects that

201
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,720
we're um uh discussing today. Some of

202
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,639
them are leading edge projects that are

203
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,919
focused more on nodal biology and some

204
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,000
of them are leading edge projects that

205
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,160
are focused more on nodal technologies.

206
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,599
But in both uh directions, I think we're

207
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,560
making some good progress in many

208
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:35,280
different um diverse areas and uh you

209
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,039
will see a lot of uh tremendous uh ideas

210
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,360
uh being shared by um our colleagues

211
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,960
later today. This is just to uh show you

212
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,960
the symposia and events that we have

213
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,960
organized over the last couple of years.

214
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,560
Um there's been a lot of activity and of

215
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,560
course we hope to continue to bring the

216
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,360
community together uh across many

217
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,840
different um ideas and while this was

218
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,080
not um a priority we are finally we've

219
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,319
finally um secured some funding to to

220
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,680
launch a nice website. So we wanted to

221
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,440
get into the substance of the science

222
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,520
but now we're also getting a website

223
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,560
together so that we have you know a sort

224
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:09,199
of a a place um a launching pad if you

225
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,440
will for for the uh accelerator. And so

226
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,039
this is uh coming in the next uh couple

227
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,680
of weeks and I just wanted to give you a

228
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:18,319
preview that uh we have uh um our

229
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,960
website um coming up. And so I just

230
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,319
wanted to end my uh remarks by uh

231
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,759
speaking of the people who are most

232
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,440
important for bringing us together

233
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,840
today. The first person I want to

234
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,440
acknowledge is Dr. Jillian Shaw. Uh no

235
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,120
one is luckier than me for having the

236
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,039
opportunity to work with uh someone like

237
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,479
Jillian who really all of you know I'm

238
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,479
sure because she brings our community

239
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:39,039
together and she's really the glue that

240
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,839
makes all of it happen. this uh

241
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:44,000
beautiful website and all the logistics

242
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,240
uh for today would not be possible

243
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,720
without Katie Legui. So I'm also

244
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,040
incredibly lucky to um have Katie in the

245
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,839
office and she really makes everything

246
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,600
tick really including including me. So

247
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,880
I'm really really uh grateful for

248
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,480
everything that they do. But something

249
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,640
that you may not know is that Katie

250
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,120
actually also has a design degree. So a

251
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,120
lot of the designs for what you see, the

252
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,040
logos, the website, I'm just so lucky

253
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,760
that she actually also puts her, you

254
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,600
know, design genius uh to work. And so

255
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,839
uh we we all get to benefit from that

256
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,000
beautiful work as well. So uh very lucky

257
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:19,040
for that. Uh and then just some final

258
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,200
logistics for today. Um we uh have

259
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,279
incredible keynote speakers. I'm about

260
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,040
to introduce the first one. Uh but I

261
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,959
just wanted to say we'll have uh Q&A

262
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,480
after each of the keynotes. Uh but then

263
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,880
when we get into the sessions and also

264
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:34,560
in the interest of time we will ask our

265
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:36,399
speakers um to uh uh sit back down after

266
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,920
they've spoken and then at the end

267
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,320
everybody if you wouldn't mind coming

268
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,480
back up here and uh we won't have chairs

269
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,040
we'll just uh have the speakers um stand

270
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,440
with mics and we can do a Q&A like in a

271
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,760
kind of friendly informal way. We're all

272
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,680
colleagues here and you know um and um

273
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,519
uh we can have uh Q&A for at the end of

274
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,080
each of the sessions. So save your

275
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,519
questions for that. Um and I think

276
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,440
that's it. We have an exciting day

277
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,680
ahead. Uh we will end with a very

278
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,839
interesting uh panel discussion which uh

279
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,760
David Mer will be leading. Thank you.

280
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,200
And so hopefully this will actually

281
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,040
allow us to have a lot of interesting

282
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,800
conversations during during the

283
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,800
symposium during the breaks bring the

284
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,279
community together and uh hopefully make

285
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:18,000
progress uh as much progress as possible

286
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,760
um all together. So uh it's my honor to

287
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,640
open the day today. Thank you all for

288
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:25,680
coming. Um, and let me now just uh skip

289
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:28,160
to uh introducing our uh first uh

290
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:31,440
keynote speaker to really open the day

291
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:34,000
with some inspiring science and a really

292
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,519
truly inspiring uh story I will say

293
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,519
behind the science which is really

294
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,760
remarkable. So our first keynote speaker

295
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,360
is um is uh professor Jonathan Weissman.

296
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,519
Uh Jonathan is an investigator of the

297
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,959
Howard Hughes Medical Institute. He's a

298
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,480
member of the Whitehead Institute right

299
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:49,279
next door and he's a professor of

300
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,600
biology at MIT. Um his lab is really

301
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:54,320
known for uh incredible breadth and

302
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,480
depth of uh work uh both in the way

303
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,320
proteins fold and how things go

304
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,760
orienting disease which is an area that

305
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,920
uh we share in terms of scientific

306
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,480
interest but also further his lab really

307
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:07,760
has done incredible innovative work in

308
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:10,800
areas like uh ribosome profiling um uh

309
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:13,680
crisper IA screening in very innovative

310
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:16,399
ways uh including uh ways in which uh

311
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,880
one um edits u um come comes up with

312
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:21,519
epigenetic editors and how those may be

313
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,680
now deployed uh in uh different areas uh

314
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:26,640
for therapeutics. And so I think we're u

315
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,720
here to uh uh hear an incredible story

316
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:33,160
about that. And so without further ado,

317
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,160
please uh welcome Jonathan Weissman.

318
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,480
Thank you so

319
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,839
much. I have a feeling you can't Oh, you

320
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,079
can hear me. Thank you so much for the

321
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,480
uh kind introduction and for of course

322
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:56,640
for the invitation to speak today about

323
00:11:52,480 --> 00:12:00,360
our work on silencing uh pron disease uh

324
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:03,680
causing protein. So back

325
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:07,519
in sort of year zero of crisper to the

326
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:11,279
summer of 2012, uh right after um

327
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:15,120
Jennifer Nwell had published their

328
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:17,240
description of a single um protein and

329
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,160
guide RNA that could be a programmable

330
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:21,600
nucleus. A few of us, Jennifer included,

331
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,240
thought that we should take this

332
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,600
beautiful nucleus uh and break its

333
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,760
scissors so that it couldn't cut

334
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,839
anything. And you might think why would

335
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,760
you want to do that? Uh and the reason

336
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,480
is now you had a programmable DNA

337
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:37,440
binding protein. And if you then

338
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,360
fusedector domains so for example in the

339
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,959
very early work we've used

340
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,120
transcriptional inhibitors or

341
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:46,240
transcriptional activators you could now

342
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:49,839
in a programmable way uh bring in

343
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,760
epigenetic marks. In essence we got a

344
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,000
volume switch that allowed us to control

345
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,000
the expression of any gene or any

346
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,639
combination of genes. And if you are

347
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,240
interested as my lab had been for some

348
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:04,560
time in the function of uh of different

349
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,800
genes and in trying to understand what

350
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,920
is information encoded in our genomes

351
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:12,320
and what are modifiers of disease states

352
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:15,040
uh this these turned out to be extremely

353
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,880
powerful tools. Uh but from a

354
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,959
therapeutic point of view uh they

355
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,880
weren't particularly useful because they

356
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,160
were

357
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:24,560
intrinsically unstable. As soon as you

358
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:27,360
stopped expressing the cast 9, the

359
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:29,279
epigenetic marks would uh dissipate with

360
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,040
often within a few days and gene

361
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:34,800
expression would go back to its normal

362
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:37,920
level. So this motivated us uh to uh

363
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:41,000
instead of doing epig marks on histones

364
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:43,680
for example to bring in uh DNA methyl

365
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,240
transferases uh that would again in a

366
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:49,120
programmable way be able to methylate

367
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,800
the DNA. And the reason why uh this was

368
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,360
uh transformative or potentially

369
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:56,480
transformative is uh there are systems

370
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:59,360
in your cells that once the DNA uh is

371
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:02,240
methylated that both ensure that that uh

372
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,480
represses transcription but critically

373
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,360
for propagating this. So now you could

374
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,600
in a hit and run way bring in your

375
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,480
epigenetic editor your DNA methyl

376
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:15,760
transferase and permanently silence a

377
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:18,399
gene. And the reason why uh one of the

378
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:20,399
reasons why these are so stable is that

379
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:23,519
uh these are systems that are used by

380
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:25,560
the cell uh to uh silence elements like

381
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,519
in parasitic elements like indogenous

382
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:30,639
retroviruses. So that you're

383
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:33,199
piggybacking on the cell system for once

384
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:37,040
you put these methyl methylation marks

385
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:41,519
in uh CPGs uh for propagating them. So

386
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:43,600
for example uh when uh DNA replicates of

387
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:46,720
course only one of the two strands uh

388
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:49,600
will uh inherit the methylation on the C

389
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,800
and of course C CPG is a palendrome so

390
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,040
if you have it on one strand you have it

391
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,040
on the other so you then end up with uh

392
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:59,120
two hemthylated

393
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:02,000
uh uh double helix helixes and uh

394
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,560
there's then a um a so-called

395
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,120
maintenance methyl transferase DNMT1

396
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,839
that recognizes these hem methylated

397
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,560
states and then restores the methylation

398
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:15,199
mark to the

399
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:18,000
second to the second strand. So sort of

400
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:20,720
to cut to uh make a long story short,

401
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,399
working off of a beautiful work from uh

402
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:27,839
Angela Lombardo and Luigi Naldini, uh we

403
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:30,639
brought together uh in a single uh

404
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:33,199
aector protein uh that contain crab

405
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:35,199
domain, a 3L which is a helper protein

406
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:38,480
and 3A which is actual methyl

407
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:41,600
transferase um a crisper off machinery

408
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,519
and we here is a example of this where

409
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,680
you see there's transient expression

410
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:48,399
over over the course of a week or so. Uh

411
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:51,120
but the methylation and the silencing of

412
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,959
the gene that's been targeted uh after

413
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,360
uh a few iterations we're able to get it

414
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:57,600
extremely stable. So here's an example

415
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,519
where uh James Nunees who was a posttock

416
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,880
who led this work and is now system

417
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:04,480
professor at Berkeley uh silenced a gene

418
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,959
through this transient expression of

419
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,920
Chris off uh and then propagated the

420
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:11,920
cells in this case uh for 15 months and

421
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,519
the vast majority and made individual

422
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,160
clones and the vast majority of these

423
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:18,000
clones uh remained completely silenced.

424
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,320
And unlike the volume switch where you

425
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,880
could tune down and up, the epigenetic

426
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:25,920
silencing was really an off switch like

427
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:28,000
a a a sort of a digital was it on or was

428
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,959
it off? And the off was as far as we can

429
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:34,720
tell completely

430
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:37,440
unexpressed and uh and work that we uh

431
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,279
was not ours at all. We we uh work from

432
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,839
Chroma Medicine which uh in full

433
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:44,880
disclosure uh I was a founder of has

434
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:47,120
used this in LMP delivery uh to the

435
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,759
liver and shown that you can with a

436
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:53,120
single dose and actually very low dose

437
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:56,480
um get uh permanent silencing and this

438
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:59,120
is in NHP data uh permanent silencing of

439
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:02,079
the PCSK9 gene and this causes a

440
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:06,480
dramatic decrease in uh serum uh

441
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:09,360
cholesterol LDL uh levels. So uh this

442
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,520
sort of a proof of principle that uh in

443
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:14,559
at least in non-human primate that these

444
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,600
uh could be a therapeutic and we thought

445
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:17,199
uh there would be sort of this

446
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,039
separation of church and state. We would

447
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,280
use the epigenetic editors. We were

448
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:23,760
scientists and about discovery. We would

449
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:26,240
use epigenetic editors to understand how

450
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,880
these marks are initiated and propagated

451
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,799
and the basic biology of epigenetics and

452
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,960
chromas or the chromas of the world

453
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:37,280
would use these for therapeutics. And

454
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:40,080
that equation changed when um one day uh

455
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:42,400
this couple Sonia Valib and Eric Mikol

456
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:45,600
came into my office and said uh we're

457
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:48,480
writing a grant uh that the goal is to

458
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:52,480
fund up into an IND enabling study uh

459
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:54,320
for PON disease. Um and I I knew Sonia

460
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,160
and Eric. interviewed them a decade

461
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,799
earlier when they were going to graduate

462
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:01,200
school before they had graduated and now

463
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:03,440
were running a lab at the Broad uh to

464
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,000
treat and understand PON dise and

465
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,720
prevent pron diseases uh and I also of

466
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,520
course knew Sonia's story which is uh

467
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:15,600
she was a Harvard trained lawyer uh her

468
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:18,080
Eric was a a city planner uh and um at

469
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,480
some point early in their career uh

470
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,799
Sonia's mother died of fatal familial

471
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,360
insomnia which is one of these inherited

472
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:29,200
pron diseases and that she herself had

473
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:31,520
inherited uh uh uh this alil and it was

474
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:35,039
an alil that had very high penetrance.

475
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:38,400
Uh so she was uh at some point almost

476
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:40,640
certainly uh in her typically around 50s

477
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,600
or 60s was going to um have the same

478
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,440
fate as her mother unless of course they

479
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,600
could do something about it. So they

480
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,559
just being Sonia and Eric that they

481
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:53,120
really they were full in they they quit

482
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:55,200
their day jobs went to graduate school

483
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:58,960
learned science and now we're running a

484
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,799
lab. So with that as you know when it's

485
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,559
not often you have you have the

486
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,720
privilege of of being asked to

487
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:07,440
participate in in something like this.

488
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:11,120
So of course uh we were we were all in

489
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:14,799
on this and so I should just say uh the

490
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:17,520
pion disease is one of the uh more broad

491
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:20,559
I think motivations for uh using this as

492
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,080
sort of a a first uh proof of principle

493
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,400
uh for treating neurodeenerative

494
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,880
diseases is that biology was so clear

495
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,559
and so remind I'll remind you uh prons

496
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,080
are infectious proteins where an

497
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:33,760
endogenous protein the pron protein has

498
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:35,760
misfolded into self-propagating

499
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,880
confirmation. Essentially that acts as a

500
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:42,480
seed and when either through because of

501
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:44,440
a mutation or spontaneously or through

502
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:47,760
uh through

503
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:50,960
infection you have uh these seeds they

504
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,919
then co-opt the normal protein and

505
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:56,080
propagate and grow

506
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:59,360
exponentially. And the other key piece

507
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:02,240
is that uh we seem to be able to live

508
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:05,039
mammals well without this pon protein.

509
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,960
So you could knock out the pon protein

510
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:09,120
and if you didn't have you weren't

511
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,120
expressing the endogenous protein you

512
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:14,480
would have no substrate for this seed to

513
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:16,400
act on. And we knew this from a

514
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:20,160
beautiful work 20 years earlier from

515
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:22,320
Giovani Giovani Maluchcci who made a

516
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:25,760
genetically engineered mouse with a

517
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:29,200
crelock system where they uh could at at

518
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,880
in a defined time uh knock out the pron

519
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,200
protein across the central nervous

520
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:36,960
system. What Jiovanna showed was that

521
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:39,360
even after infection if you uh prevented

522
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:43,039
expression of new PON protein you could

523
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:45,200
block the PON disease. Um so silencing

524
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:48,000
we had a very clear biological

525
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,799
hypothesis. Silencing PON protein will

526
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,679
have a therapeutic benefit. Uh the

527
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:56,000
second and I say this is work led by uh

528
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:59,559
Edwin Newman a graduate student in lab

529
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:04,320
and Tessa Bertosi a posttock in the lab.

530
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:06,559
um uh they quickly showed that uh the

531
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,559
pron the human pron and mouse pron

532
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:10,880
protein had a promoter that could be

533
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,880
readily methylated. So you transiently

534
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,200
express the crisper off and it caused

535
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:18,520
permanent silencing of the pron gene and

536
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:21,840
that silencing was uh uh caused by

537
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:27,640
methylation of the so-called CPG island

538
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:27,640
upstream of the pron uh promoter.

539
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:33,840
So now it was essentially a delivery

540
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,440
problem. We knew that silencing of the

541
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,600
pram protein from the from the

542
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,200
engineered mice that it within the

543
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,280
central nervous system would be

544
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:46,840
sufficient to block the disease even in

545
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:49,280
an actively uh infected uh individual

546
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:51,120
and but we also knew that it could

547
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,559
affect most of the CNS. So you really

548
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,280
had to have a way of delivering across

549
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:58,240
the CNS and really the only approach at

550
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:01,200
the moment to to do that in an adult uh

551
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,640
was through AEV and uh fortunately we

552
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,280
had a wonder we have a wonderful

553
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:08,919
collaborator Ben Deman who is the world

554
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:13,520
experts on AEV delivery uh to the

555
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:16,640
CNS. The problem is that uh crisper cast

556
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:18,720
9ines are big proteins and AES have

557
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:21,280
small payloads. So just to give you an

558
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,600
idea of the scale uh the cast 9 alone

559
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,520
was pretty much too big to to fit in the

560
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:29,440
AEV let alone all the other bells and

561
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:32,000
whistles. So this motivated us uh to

562
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:34,880
then go back to an earlier technology

563
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,960
zinc finger proteins uh which are um

564
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,880
programmable DNA binding proteins. they

565
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,679
don't have the beauty of having the

566
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:44,640
simple rules of a guide RNA but uh

567
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:46,799
through a lot of work and work that was

568
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,960
uh found the foundation work for this

569
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:52,159
work was done across the street in Carl

570
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:54,880
Pabbo's lab uh we had rules that through

571
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:57,679
a lot of engineering uh you could for a

572
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,520
given site uh design a zinc finger and

573
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:02,080
there's a couple of uh critical

574
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:06,240
advantages of zinc fingers uh one is

575
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:08,000
that they're they're very small so it's

576
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,720
Even a six-finger zinc finger is only

577
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,720
about 540 nucleotides. So they could

578
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,520
readily fit in. In fact, we can put in

579
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:19,039
three different uh zincfinger silencers

580
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:21,440
in in an AV. Um the other is that there

581
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:23,919
were human in origin. And the third is

582
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,159
that um these crab domains, one of the

583
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,600
key components in the endogenous system

584
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:31,280
for silencing these indogenous

585
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:34,799
retroviruses are almost always fused to

586
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:37,600
zinc fingers. So it it was really the

587
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:41,200
natural way of delivering onto DNA the

588
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:43,120
epigenetic silencers and unlike uh the

589
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,280
like the beautiful editors from from

590
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,679
David Louu like base editor or prime

591
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:49,840
editor which really rely on

592
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,919
idiosyncrasies of cast 9 the ability to

593
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,960
do nick one strand and not the other the

594
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:56,080
ability to create a bubble

595
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:58,960
thrinase we didn't need to do any of

596
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,799
this in fact having a small DNA binding

597
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,440
protein that would that would be right

598
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:07,840
at on the DNA and bringing that the DNA

599
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:10,640
methyl transferes was um was a um both

600
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:12,600
more effective and and more uh an

601
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,360
elegant way of delivering their

602
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:17,679
silencers. The problem we had so this

603
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,600
all seemed very simple problem is we

604
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:22,640
made our zinc finger off the equivalent

605
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:25,600
of the crisper off and uh even in vitro

606
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:28,320
in cells these were these were toxic. So

607
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,520
why why and we showed it was the DNMT3A

608
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,000
the methyl transfer race that was

609
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,559
causing the toxicity. So, why are these

610
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,760
why were these

611
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:37,360
toxic? And bear with me. I'm going to

612
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:40,000
have to tell you go into a little bit of

613
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:43,039
the nuts and bolts about DNMT3A to show

614
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,559
how we solve the problem. So, DNMT3A is

615
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:47,039
actually a more complicated

616
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:49,159
multi-dommain protein and it exists in

617
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:52,000
an autoinhibited

618
00:24:49,159 --> 00:24:54,720
form. What we and others have done is

619
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:58,159
take only the methyl transferase. So, it

620
00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:00,400
removing this inhibition um so that we

621
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:01,679
circumvent this. The problem is you now

622
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,760
essentially have a mutagen. You were

623
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:06,080
overexpressing this uncontrolled methyl

624
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:08,559
transferase that whenever it landed or

625
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:11,039
wherever it was uh uh brought to

626
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:13,760
inadvertently on DNA would cause these

627
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:16,240
marks on the DNA and because you had the

628
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,440
DNMT1 the maintenance methyl transferase

629
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,600
once you put the marks they could

630
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,200
propagate

631
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:25,840
indefinitely. And we also knew from uh

632
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:28,880
the beautiful work in um that uh the way

633
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:31,039
uh this uh methyl this in auto

634
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,120
inhibition is released or one way is

635
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:35,039
through uh the histone tail. So

636
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,919
basically methyl transfer race is

637
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:40,480
sniffing around and if it's a a K4

638
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:42,720
methylation that is an indication of

639
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:45,039
active transcription the methyl transfer

640
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:48,080
race can't be activated but if you have

641
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:50,799
the K4 unmodified it binds to this ADD

642
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:53,440
domain releasing the inhibition and

643
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:56,320
allowing activation methyl transferase.

644
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:59,200
So Edwin had this idea that we could

645
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:02,000
take the 3L and not express any methyl

646
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:04,080
transface or any enzyme at all in the

647
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,720
cell and just recruit the endogenous

648
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:09,360
methyl transferase. It wouldn't be in an

649
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:12,159
active form uh but it could recruit it

650
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:15,120
through the 3L. But then he thought what

651
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:16,799
if we put on this histone tail in a way

652
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:20,159
and played with the linkers in a way

653
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:22,960
that it could bind to the ADD domain.

654
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:25,120
This should in principle allow you to

655
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,520
recruit and activate the nauseous methyl

656
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,840
transferase. To make a long story short,

657
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:32,159
this worked uh like a charm. Thus our

658
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:34,159
name coupled his own tail for auto

659
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,720
inhibition release of methyl transferase

660
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:39,200
or or charm. Um and through a lot of

661
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,679
optimization he was able to get this

662
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,360
crisper charm to work uh in general

663
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:46,159
actually better than the original

664
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:48,400
crisper off. So now uh and he also

665
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:51,120
showed that this eliminated or largely

666
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:54,240
eliminated any of the toxicity they saw.

667
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:57,840
So now we're able we had a non-toxic

668
00:26:54,240 --> 00:27:00,480
zinc finger uh charm that could readily

669
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:03,600
fit into nav and we were now able to do

670
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:06,400
the experiment with uh Ben's AVs that

671
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:09,919
could go uh reach across the central

672
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:11,440
nervous system in a mouse and really

673
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:14,640
beautifully almost in this first

674
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:16,080
experiment we got dramatic and brainwide

675
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,159
and we showed it was actually in the

676
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:21,360
neurons themselves uh silencing of the

677
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:24,240
pram protein uh to uh in this case uh

678
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:26,880
more than 80% silencing almost to the

679
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:29,440
limit of detection and this silencing

680
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,120
was being mediated uh by methylation. So

681
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,159
we had a reason to believe that it would

682
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:37,520
be uh not uh not transient but permanent

683
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:41,039
in nature because it was permanent once

684
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:43,440
you methylated the the pronot which we

685
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:45,600
knew happened relatively quickly. Uh

686
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,600
continually expressing the charm could

687
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:50,320
only cause offtarget effects because

688
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:52,960
you've you've done the ontarget. So uh

689
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:56,000
what uh we did in the work that was led

690
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:58,799
by Tessa Bertosi is she developed a

691
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,279
self- silencing charm. So by tuning she

692
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:04,080
put in a binding site for the ZFP charm

693
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:06,080
uh in the promoter that was expressing

694
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,320
the charm itself and then tuned this

695
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,960
promoter such this binding site such

696
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:13,279
that the ZFP charm first silenced the

697
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,520
endogenous gene and then more slowly

698
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:18,200
silenced itself. So now you sort of have

699
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:21,679
the perfect hit and run. it came in,

700
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:24,080
silenced the the pron protein, silenced

701
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:27,679
itself, and you were left in the neuron

702
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:30,840
with a silenced pron uh gene and a

703
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:33,520
neutral piece of DNA that can't be

704
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:36,480
expressed. Uh, and this worked a lot of

705
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:38,159
tinkering. Um, we now have data actually

706
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,159
up to 12 months. I'll show you here six

707
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,960
months data showing that the charm or

708
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:45,360
the self silencing charm has very uh

709
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,520
robust stability. uh but then we could

710
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,760
look at what were the offtarget effects

711
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:52,080
and what we saw was if we had continue

712
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:54,240
expression of charm pon protein was by

713
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,559
far the biggest gene most gene that was

714
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:59,600
most affected but there were clearly the

715
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:02,559
uh offtarget effects on this whereas uh

716
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:04,640
the the self silencing charm was really

717
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:06,880
squeaky clean. So this one gene here was

718
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,120
keratin which means someone managed to

719
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:13,039
probably contaminate it with their uh

720
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:15,520
with uh with RNA from their fingers or

721
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:17,600
from the sample but other than that

722
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:19,760
there was nothing above the detection

723
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:23,000
limit and the pron the knockdown of pron

724
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:25,760
was actually if anything uh more

725
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:29,080
effective. So now we were able to do the

726
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:32,159
the actually validation experiment uh

727
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:34,080
and and I should say all of this stuff

728
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,840
was we were able to move so quickly

729
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,840
because a beautiful system Sonia and

730
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,399
Eric had set up that allowed us to

731
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:43,679
quickly go into mice and test go from

732
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:47,360
cells to mice uh in a matter of weeks.

733
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:51,520
So here you infect you inoculate a mouse

734
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:53,919
with the pron um wait till 120 days or

735
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:56,880
so when the animal is actually now

736
00:29:53,919 --> 00:30:00,960
visibly sick and would die within within

737
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:03,919
tens of days uh um after if you didn't

738
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:07,200
intervene come in with an AEV and you

739
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:09,760
can see uh from these both the the self-

740
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:12,080
silencing or the non-self silencing form

741
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:14,880
are really able to dramatically increase

742
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:16,720
the life of the animal and I say this is

743
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,440
you know it's not a perfect cure in this

744
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,279
but it's also a very uh very challenging

745
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,679
problem. You're talking about an already

746
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:26,080
sick animal who who's got a very that

747
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:29,240
has a very high burden of the pron

748
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:32,559
disease pron uh infectious

749
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:36,480
pron. Uh so next step was that was all

750
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:39,200
mouse. So we uh uh then went to making

751
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:41,039
uh zinc fingers against a human uh pron

752
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:44,159
using a humani and then using a

753
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:45,840
humanized mouse model. Uh there were

754
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:48,000
some zinc fingers against the pron

755
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:50,720
promoter and literature. They were quite

756
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,559
effective when we made the zip charm at

757
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:56,240
silencing, but they're really quite

758
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:58,960
dirty. So through a lot of optimization,

759
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:01,520
uh Edwin was able to uh turn this into

760
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,679
this. And not only was he able to get

761
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:05,840
rid of essentially virtually all of the

762
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:08,159
off target visible offtargets and this

763
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:11,840
is with continuous expression not not

764
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:14,320
long after uh with self silencing. So we

765
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,919
think it'll be even cleaner but not only

766
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,360
get rid of off targets but actually have

767
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:22,320
better efficacy about against the

768
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:24,640
pron was still a a great silencer and

769
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:27,120
when we went into humanized mouse we

770
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:29,880
were can get very robust brainwide

771
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:33,279
silencing uh almost to the limit of

772
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:36,960
detection. Um so uh what's the next

773
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:39,360
step? Uh we and again we is really uh

774
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:42,159
really led by Sonia and Eric have had

775
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:45,720
had an FDA interact in February. Uh they

776
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:50,720
were uh very enthusiastic and about the

777
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:54,000
approach and uh really uh gave a a lot

778
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:56,080
of um uh support for the strategy of

779
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,880
going using the mouse data and then

780
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:01,279
going into human. So we're doing uh lead

781
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,960
optimization finalizing promoters the

782
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:06,640
UTR uh doing self silencing and

783
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:09,840
humanization. Uh they have a a contract

784
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:12,960
CRO Verilogen that's going to produce uh

785
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:16,480
enough AAV for about 10 doses uh over

786
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:18,880
the next year or so. Uh GLP talk studies

787
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:22,799
uh next year and aiming either in second

788
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:25,919
half of 2026 or early in 2027 uh for uh

789
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:27,360
the IND uh study in symptomatic

790
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:29,519
patients.

791
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:32,799
So finally where is it going to go from

792
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:34,559
here? Um as I said you know we're focus

793
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:37,279
of course was on the pronun disease that

794
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:39,679
is that is our central goal but um we

795
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:41,919
also think that both by the ae and

796
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:43,679
de-risking all this and as a proof of

797
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:45,919
principle uh this could be have much

798
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:48,080
broader applications because uh this

799
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:51,279
theme of protein aggregation and neuro

800
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:54,000
degeneration is common throughout m many

801
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:56,159
inherited or uh spontaneous

802
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,600
neurodeenerative diseases including the

803
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:00,240
triplet repeat diseases like

804
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,760
Huntington's and more common even much

805
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:05,360
more common ones like Alzheimer's

806
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:07,679
disease. Uh and so uh we hope that the

807
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,919
ability to shut off specific genes in

808
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:13,039
the brain uh will could prevent these

809
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:16,240
aggregates and uh potentially impact uh

810
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:18,159
diseases that affect millions uh uh of

811
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,919
people uh where there currently are

812
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:22,000
minimal effective treatments. So with

813
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:24,080
that, I'll end and uh thank everyone

814
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,679
again. I I mentioned most of the people

815
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:29,200
along the way, but I think it's worth a

816
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:31,679
shout out again for Edwin and Tessa um

817
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:34,799
and our wonderful collaborators Ben

818
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:37,840
Deman, Sonia Valib, Eric Menol, and also

819
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:40,240
uh Fiona and Alisa who just did a huge

820
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:42,080
amount of work uh behind the scenes to

821
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:46,600
make all this possible. Uh with that,

822
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:46,600
I'll end. Uh thank you.

823
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:54,679
questions.

824
00:33:55,320 --> 00:34:02,159
Yes, we have a mic. Oh, sorry.

825
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,679
Thank you. Um, I'm sure you get this

826
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:05,200
question a lot, Jonathan. First, this is

827
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:06,880
it's just incredible work and I love

828
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:10,079
seeing every time you present it, it

829
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:12,000
it's just so exciting. Um, how do you

830
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:14,720
think about from the mouse experiments

831
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,679
the effects of dosing prey symptoms

832
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:19,520
versus post symptoms? Um and then how do

833
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:22,000
you think about that in the context of

834
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:24,560
clinical trials where you already have

835
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,359
quite a small patient population and you

836
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:29,520
may want to dose them like pre pre when

837
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:34,000
they're presymptomatic. Yeah. I mean so

838
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:36,000
this is a so the FDA was okay with the

839
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,079
strategy both for symptomatic and and

840
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,240
preymptomatic and it's a very different

841
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:42,560
situation. So for for uh people who are

842
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:44,560
symptomatic it's about 600 people in the

843
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:48,320
US are diagnosed with this a year. So

844
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:50,800
two a day. So not a challenge to get

845
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:53,280
patients at least at this scale um

846
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:55,440
because they're highly motivated. Um but

847
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,800
it's five months. So we only had two

848
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:00,079
months with the mouse. We have five

849
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:04,000
months from onset of symptoms uh to uh a

850
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:05,839
typical to typical time to death. Um so

851
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,760
and and there's nothing you can do to

852
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:10,240
intervene. So there there's a very

853
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:12,400
compelling case for doing uh for going

854
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:15,520
in for people are symptomatic. I think

855
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:17,359
that will be the first but the hope is

856
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:19,599
we're building in self silencing from

857
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:22,480
the very beginning. Uh the hope is that

858
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:25,160
that will um also that that same vector

859
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:28,320
could be uh also could be used for

860
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:30,720
preymptomatic. Uh that said, we're we're

861
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:33,440
like, you know, the one thing from my

862
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:35,680
voyeristic views of of pharma understand

863
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:38,640
is you always have a backup and we're

864
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:40,880
building in a V2 version that has some

865
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:43,920
extra bells and whistles that will we so

866
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:45,599
we're completely uh uh deimmunizing. So

867
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:48,000
any peptides that could be presented by

868
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:49,920
the MHC, we're putting in mutations. uh

869
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,960
we're we're doing things that will make

870
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:55,680
it even ultra better zinc fingers ultra

871
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:58,280
uh specific and better tuning of the

872
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:01,040
cell silencing. So I think it's going to

873
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:03,280
be you know it's going to see what

874
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:05,280
happens when we get into the clinic.

875
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:08,320
will be able to you can see PON levels

876
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:10,320
from the CSF so you can you can measure

877
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:12,320
um some have some measure of efficacy

878
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:15,119
and of course you'll have also a view of

879
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:17,720
any toxicity caused by the AAVs and at

880
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:20,560
that point it's going to be uh you know

881
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:22,400
a as they say a radio call about whether

882
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:25,400
you go presymptomatic or you wait for a

883
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,400
V2.

884
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:33,880
Thank you John.

885
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:33,880
[Applause]
