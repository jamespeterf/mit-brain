00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,480
I have two black cylinders in my hands

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,920
here and I will tell you that one of

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,640
them is a magnet and the other one is

4
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,639
not over here I have two pipes this one

5
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,200
is acrylic and this one is aluminum

6
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,519
neither is magnetic but now I'm going to

7
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,960
drop these through the two pipes so

8
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,440
let's start with the acrylic

9
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,400
one now I'll do the other

10
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:21,160
one so that is how strong gravity is so

11
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,119
now let's try the aluminum pipe so here

12
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,119
we

13
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:28,760
go same let's try this

14
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:30,840
one where is it there it is what's

15
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,960
happening is that as this magnet is

16
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,280
falling through the pipe that's changing

17
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,239
the magnetic flux through this Loop of

18
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,680
pipe when you change the magnetic flux

19
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:41,239
through a loop of aluminum or a loop of

20
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,800
pipe it induces a current that's

21
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:46,840
Faraday's law the fact that the current

22
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,360
that I induce exerts a force which slows

23
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,840
the magnet down this is this actually

24
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,440
gets a special name it's called lens's

25
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,039
law lens's law in action there you go

26
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,879
it's kind of amazing actually for more
