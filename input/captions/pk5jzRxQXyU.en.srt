startup exchange but first I'll give a

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:34,879
brief overview of our program

13
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:37,640
so MIT startup exchange was created

14
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:39,680
about close to 10 years ago now um to

15
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,640
support MIT connected startups as they

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,760
grow expand and solve some of the

17
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,360
world's greatest challenges and we do

18
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,320
this by fostering Partnerships and

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:52,440
collaboration with industry mostly

20
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:54,320
industrial yon um program or ILP members

21
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,199
represented by many of you joining us

22
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,559
today and also the MIT Innovation

23
00:00:56,199 --> 00:01:01,079
ecosystem and

24
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:04,799
Beyond the UPS in our program are

25
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:07,439
founded um by MIT faculty staff or Al Al

26
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,400
alumni or also based on licensed

27
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,880
technology and they can also be vetted

28
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:15,320
by some of our MIT Partners including

29
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:17,799
the engine Ventures the e14 fund cell or

30
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:21,119
MIT Nano just to name a

31
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:23,520
few the startups in our program are

32
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,040
close to a thousand and they don't

33
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,439
usually a pilot stage or Beyond and they

34
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,479
cover all sectors and all geographies

35
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:32,040
and here you can see some of the

36
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:34,360
trending Technologies of the startups

37
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,000
and I've highlighted in bold the ones

38
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,720
that uh will be represented by the

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,520
startups presenting to you today of

40
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:42,759
course we start with AI and ml big data

41
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:45,280
and analytics AR and VR we also have

42
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:47,200
sustainability Robotics and autonomy and

43
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,520
life science and health

44
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,320
care when it comes to Value startups in

45
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,399
our program have exposure to a Global

46
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,759
Network of Industry decision makers and

47
00:01:55,399 --> 00:02:00,079
corporates have access to vetted MIT

48
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,000
connected startups

49
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,159
we also have events which are an

50
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,600
important component we host a variety of

51
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,080
them throughout the year locally

52
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,720
nationally internationally and some

53
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,879
consist of conferences where there's

54
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,000
startup lining talks and Exhibits also

55
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:17,400
demo days like today other types of

56
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,560
webinars workshops trainings one-on-one

57
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,319
meetings and much more so the benefit to

58
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,680
you as an ILP member is that we can

59
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,360
tailor an event according to your needs

60
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,000
and the benefit to the startups is that

61
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,879
we can take you to other markets that

62
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,519
you're expanding into and you have this

63
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:33,840
ibility into new

64
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,080
ecosystems we also launch calls for

65
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,760
startups we call these opportunities and

66
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,959
they're based on corporates priorities

67
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,280
and internal challenges and so the

68
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:45,879
startups in our program can apply

69
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:47,440
through the website our website and if

70
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:50,040
selected they can work with you as an

71
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,640
ILP member and help you solve a problem

72
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,879
that you may be facing in your industry

73
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,200
so all in all this is a customized and

74
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,319
curated approach and I hope that

75
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,680
