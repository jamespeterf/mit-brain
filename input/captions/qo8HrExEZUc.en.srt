00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,080
hello and welcome to energy reads your

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,360
source for a handpicked audio articles

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:14,320
on the latest energy news from

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,720
MIT my name is Kelly Travers and I've

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,439
been the one reading to you today we're

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,880
doing something a little different

7
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:21,840
instead of reading one of our recently

8
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,599
released articles we will be teasing

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,199
several that are upcoming and have yet

10
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:28,720
to be published if you're familiar with

11
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:31,160
the MIT energy initiative or Mighty as

12
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,520
we call ourselves you may know that we

13
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:36,239
publish a magazine called Energy Futures

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,680
twice a year in addition to reading you

15
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:41,160
the news I'm also our magazine managing

16
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,640
editor sorry for the lowkey flex there

17
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:47,320
but it puts me in a position to say that

18
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,960
I'm very excited with absolutely no bias

19
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,760
to share with you some of the cool

20
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,680
stories we have coming out soon in our

21
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,359
next

22
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,239
issue let me set the stage by sharing

23
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:58,879
that in May 2022 Mighty completed a

24
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:01,160
three-year study that explored how

25
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:04,280
energy storage techn can be harnessed to

26
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:06,320
decarbonize our Global Energy Systems

27
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,040
what is so cool about storage is that it

28
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,200
allows us to really take advantage of

29
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,920
renewable energy sources that we refer

30
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,360
to as variable meaning they aren't

31
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,960
always available so when the Sun is up

32
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,159
and doing its thing or the wind is

33
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:23,280
blowing storage makes it possible to you

34
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,520
guessed it store the energy collected at

35
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,159
those times so it can be used once the

36
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:31,200
sun is set and the wind has died down so

37
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,640
then you can do things like charge

38
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,240
whatever it is you're using to listen to

39
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,479
this podcast for

40
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,439
instance building on the completion of

41
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,680
our energy storage study the research

42
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:42,479
articles in this issue of Energy Futures

43
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,280
focus a lot on different storage and

44
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,280
battery

45
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,360
technologies in one article we introduce

46
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,079
a new modeling framework that can help

47
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,360
guide the development of flow batteries

48
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,439
these are electrochemical devices that

49
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,560
can store hundreds of megawatt hours of

50
00:01:56,439 --> 00:02:00,560
energy which would be really beneficial

51
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,360
for large scale long duration

52
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,560
electricity storage especially on a

53
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,319
future grid dominated by intermittent

54
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,360
solar and wind power generators current

55
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,040
flow batteries rely on vadium which is

56
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,640
an energy storage material that's

57
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,200
expensive and not always readily

58
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:18,040
available investigators worldwide are

59
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,280
exploring a variety of other less

60
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:23,000
expensive more abundant options to

61
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,959
replace vadium and using their modeling

62
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,319
framework the MIT researchers calculated

63
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:30,560
the total cost of some of those options

64
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,120
considering operating expenses as well

65
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,519
as initial Capital costs the results

66
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,720
show that in many cases the low Capital

67
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,640
costs may be more than offset by high

68
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:42,000
operating costs over the lifetime of the

69
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,840
battery such results can help Focus

70
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,920
today's disperate efforts on designs

71
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,239
with the most promise which will help

72
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,080
speed

73
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:52,480
development in another article we share

74
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,640
the work of an MIT team seeking to lower

75
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,599
the high cost of making lithium ion

76
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,680
batteries they do this by using

77
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:01,040
combustion but not for burning coal or

78
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,360
oil they they realized that much of the

79
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,360
cost of making a lithium ion battery can

80
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,360
be traced to the manufacturing materials

81
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,959
used to make the cathode which is one of

82
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,920
its two electrodes the team developed a

83
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:14,519
system that under carefully controlled

84
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,400
conditions uses combusting Flames to

85
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:18,720
produce not polluting foot but rather

86
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,440
valuable materials including some that

87
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,879
are critical in the manufacturer of

88
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:25,840
lithium ion batteries their system

89
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:28,840
promises to be simpler much quicker less

90
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,319
expensive and far less energy intensive

91
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,680
than the conventional me now used and

92
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:35,360
most importantly it does this without

93
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,959
sacrificing battery

94
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,640
performance this issue of Energy Futures

95
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:42,159
also highlights some of the cool stuff

96
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:43,879
going on in our education department I

97
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,480
am particularly excited about an

98
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:48,120
interview we did with mighty's Director

99
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:51,239
of Education Ana Danielson she and her

100
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,840
team lead energy education at MIT they

101
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:54,720
have been developing a robust

102
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,480
educational toolkit not just for

103
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,280
undergraduate and graduate students at

104
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,159
MIT but also for online Learners around

105
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,040
the world and high school students who

106
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:05,640
want to contribute to a world powered by

107
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,439
Clean Energy a big piece of mighty's

108
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,200
educational programming is preparing

109
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,640
Learners to take an active role in

110
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,599
climate action it does this in part by

111
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,680
really emphasizing practice and

112
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,400
experience in addition to giving the

113
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,160
students the knowledge skills and

114
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,759
courage to be ready to jump into action

115
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,320
one thing AA said that really stood out

116
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,520
to me was that if Done Right education

117
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,000
is an energy transition

118
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:31,800
accelerator we profile one student who

119
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,600
really seems to embody this idea syus

120
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,639
Horowitz is currently a senior at MIT

121
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,320
majoring in mechanical engineering and

122
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,680
minoring in energy studies and

123
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,240
environment and sustainability the

124
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,600
article Dives straight into one of

125
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,400
silas's projects taking us right to the

126
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,560
edge of a marsh where they are tinkering

127
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,880
with a blue and black robot about the

128
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,360
size and shape of a shoe box and studded

129
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:57,000
with lights and mini propellers this

130
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:59,160
remotely operated vehicle or ROV is an

131
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,400
underwater drone destined to collect

132
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,520
water s from beneath a sheet of Arctic

133
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:06,120
ice it will be employed to measure

134
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,560
carbon dioxide and methane in the water

135
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,479
in the summer of 2022 the Rover was

136
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,039
successfully deployed on a field run in

137
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,560
the Canadian High

138
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:16,560
Arctic in another profile we meet

139
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,440
Michael Howland he is an assistant

140
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,080
professor of civil and environmental

141
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:22,960
engineering and MIT he is working to get

142
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:25,199
more electricity out of renewable energy

143
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,919
systems and to prepare young scientists

144
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,120
and Engineers with the training and

145
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:30,600
tools they need to tackle climate change

146
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,520
mitigation

147
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,080
he also does a lot of work with wind

148
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,680
energy and recently he and his team

149
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,759
developed a model that predicts the

150
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:41,199
power produced by each individual

151
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:44,280
turbine on a wind farm based on the

152
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:46,319
physics of the Wind Farm as a whole he

153
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,639
used this model to improve Wind Farm

154
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:50,960
efficiency by misaligning some of the

155
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,639
upwind turbines in certain conditions

156
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,880
the downwind units experience less wake

157
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:57,520
turbulence this increased the overall

158
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,560
energy output of the wind farm by as

159
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:05,600
much as 1 to 3% without requiring any

160
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:07,199
additional costs so crazy fact if a 1.2%

161
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,599
energy increase was applied to the

162
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,720
world's existing wind farms it would be

163
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:15,280
the equivalent of adding more than

164
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:17,639
3,600 new wind turbines that's enough to

165
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,680
power about 3 million

166
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:22,479
homes this issue of Energy Futures also

167
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,560
digs into two programs geared towards

168
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,160
high school

169
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:29,080
students the first is climate action

170
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,720
through education also known as Kate

171
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,199
this program is developing climate

172
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,240
change curriculum for youth in high

173
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:35,919
schools so what's particularly cool

174
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,919
about K is that it's creating

175
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:40,240
climate-based lessons for a range of

176
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,639
disciplines Beyond just science from

177
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,479
math to history to language arts

178
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,080
Christopher kidle who is leading this

179
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:49,759
project and among his many titles is

180
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:52,039
mighty's deputy director for policy told

181
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,080
us we will be honest about the threats

182
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:55,960
posed by climate change but also give

183
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,440
students a sense of agency that they can

184
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:01,000
do something about this and for the many

185
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,599
teachers especially non-science teachers

186
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,080
starved for knowledge and background

187
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:06,759
material Kate offers resources to give

188
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,919
them confidence to implement our

189
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:11,160

00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,000
reading these stories to you in full
