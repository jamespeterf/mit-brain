75
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:55,760
to rethink Antiquated business models

00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,400
extending the grid will be most cost-

82
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:10,640
effective and where other solutions

83
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,840
would be more practical I always say we

84
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,400
are agnostic to the technology amacha

85
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,400
says traditionally the only way to

86
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,720
provide long-term reliable access was

87
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,599
through the grid but that's changing in

88
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,480
many developing countries there are many

89
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,519
more challenges for utilities to provide

90
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:28,080
reliable

of the MIT Tata center for technology

95
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:38,080
and design recognized early on that

96
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,680
connecting homes to existing

97
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,080

98
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,319
economically feasible what's more

99
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,760
billions of people with great

100
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:47,799
connections had unreliable access due to

101
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,519
uneven regulation and challenging

they dubbed the integrated distribution

00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,319
optimal planning as well as novel

business models and regulation getting

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:17,199
all three right is necessary Stoner says

115
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:19,959
if you want a viable long-term outcome

116
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,639
amach says initially we designed ourem

117
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:23,199
to understand what the level of demand

118
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:25,600
is in these countries with very rural

119
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:28,120
and poor populations and what the system

120
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,800
should look like to serve it we took a

121
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:33,080
lot of that input into developing the

122
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,800
model in 2019 W was created to

123
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,400
commercialize the software and add

advising governments and Regulators on

127
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,720
how to expand existing grids y proposes

128
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,440
options such as a mini grid powered by

129
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:50,639
Renewables like wind hydropower or solar

130
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:53,479
to serve single Villages or large- scale

131
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,440
minigrid solutions for larger areas in

132
00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:57,960
some cases an even more localized

133
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,960
scalable solution is a mesh grid which

134
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:02,360
might consist of a single solar pannel

135
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:04,240
for a few houses that over time can be

136
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:07,160
expanded and ultimately connected to the

137
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,160

138
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,800

00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,240
years she was traveling to off-grade

192
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,840
communities in India as a research

193
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,240
scientist exploring potential

194
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:14,039
Technologies for providing access there

195
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:16,280
were unexpected challenges at the time

196
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:19,560
digitized geospatial data didn't exist

197
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:21,240
for many regions in India in 2013 the

198
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,639
team used phones to take pictures of

199
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,840
paper maps spread out on tables team

200
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:28,039
members now scour Digital Data available

201
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,240
through Facebook Google Microsoft and

202
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:32,360
other sources for useful G geographical

203
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,360
information it's one thing to create a

204
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,479
plan Amatea says but how it gets

205
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,960
utilized and implemented becomes a big

206
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:41,199
question with all the players involved

207
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,840
funding agencies elected officials

208
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,280
utilities private companies and

209
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,240
Regulators within the countries

210
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:48,919
themselves it's sometimes hard to know

211
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,879
who's responsible for next steps besides

212
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:52,720
providing technical expertise our team

213
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,240
engages with governments to let's say

214
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,599
develop a financial plan or an

215
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,560
implementation plan she says ideally W

216
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,280
hopes to stay involved with each project

217
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,919
long enough to ensure that its proposal

218
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,120
becomes the national electrification

219
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:07,120
strategy of the country that's no small

220
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,159
feat given the multiple players the

221
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,120
opaque nature of government and the need

222
00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:14,400
to enact a regulatory framework where

223
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,440
none may have existed for Rwanda W

224
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,639
identified areas without service

225
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:20,360
estimated future demand and proposed the

226
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,520
most cost-effective ways to meet that

227
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,680
Demand with a mix of grid and off-grid

228
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:27,080
solutions based on the electrification

229
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,680
plan developed by the W team officials

230
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:32,760
have said they hope to have the entire

231
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:34,479
country electrified by 2024 in 2017 by

232
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,599
the time the team submitted its master

233
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:39,039
plan which included an off-grid solution

234
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:40,599
for kambi amantia was surprised to learn

235
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,959
that electrification in the village had

236
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:45,320
already occurred an example she says of

237
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:47,040
the challenging nature of local planning

238
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,279
perhaps because of W's focus and

239
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,880
Outreach efforts kambi had become a

240
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:54,200
priority however it happened amantia is

241
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:57,920
happy that kabi's 200 families finally

242
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,920
have access to electricity
