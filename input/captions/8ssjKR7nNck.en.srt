1
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:18,439
um let's get started this is uh

2
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:19,840
1401 uh microeconomics uh the uh and um

3
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:23,039
I'm professor John

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:25,400
Gruber now couple notes about the course

5
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,000
uh there's a distinct policy angle to

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,480
this course um I think personally what

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,680
makes economics most exciting is it can

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,440
you you can use it to think

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,520
intelligently about the problems that

10
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,719
policy makers face every day as they try

11
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:41,280
to decide how to make the economy work

12
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,039
the best for its citizens um in fact I

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,920
teach a whole course about this called

14
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:46,440
1441 uh but I'm going to bring some of

15
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,079
those insights into this class and use

16
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,600
policy based examples and things like

17
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,320
that to try to motivate uh and organize

18
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,879
our thinking about

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,320
economics um lastly uh three points

20
00:00:55,879 --> 00:01:00,239
about my teaching style first of all I

21
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,519
don't write everything on the board uh

22
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,239
for the Freshman here we're not in high

23
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:05,000
schoool anymore you need to pay

24
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:07,560
attention and listen to what I say not

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,360
just what I write um so it's important

26
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:13,600
to remember that um uh uh the second

27
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,560
point is as you can tell I talk really

28
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,680
fast and my handwriting is really bad

29
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,600
okay so please please don't be afraid to

30
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,400
ask what the hell I just said or wrote

31
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:27,200
okay there is if you don't know chances

32
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,200
are at least 40% of the class doesn't

33
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,360
know either we'll learn later this

34
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,640
semester about the con a public good a

35
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,240
public good is something you do which

36
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,119
has a personal cost and a social benefit

37
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,799
I understand raising your raising your

38
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,759
hand in a class as large as this can be

39
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,840
intimidating but remember in doing so

40
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:44,399
you're not just helping yourself you're

41
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,079
helping your fellow classmates so please

42
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,640
don't lean and Whisper loudly what the

43
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,240
hell did you just say to the person next

44
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,920
to you raise your hand and ask me

45
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,880
because if you didn't understand many

46
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,640
other people didn't as well more

47
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,320
generally it's hard to get class

48
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,840
participation in a class this large but

49
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,840
I really encourage people to participate

50
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,000
as much as

51
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,159
possible I've never had a year in this

52
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,520
class where there's been too much

53
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,960
participation I've had every single year

54
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:09,319
too little participation so please

55
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,480
follow up with questions uh things like

56
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:13,120
that and then finally the third point

57
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,040
about my teaching style is I have a bad

58
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,800
tendency to use the term guys in a

59
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,200
gender neutral sense so when I say guys

60
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:23,120
I don't mean men I mean economic agents

61
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,360
people everyone and I'm sorry guys has a

62
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,000
gendered word often I don't mean it that

63
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,840
way it's just kind of a economist talk

64
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,720
for for economic agents we call them

65
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,879
guys what we're going to do today is

66
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,040
talk about what is microeconomics what

67
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:37,640
are you going to learn in this course

68
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:41,040
what is the basic field about and then

69
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:43,200
we'll dive in next time into actually

70
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,800
starting to learn about the models that

71
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,239
make up basic

72
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,760
microeconomics um

73
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,760
microeconomics is fundamentally in a

74
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:57,120
sentence the study of how individuals

75
00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:00,239
and firms make themselves as well off as

76
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,280
possible in a world of scarcity it's how

77
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,920
individuals and firms make themselves as

78
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:09,680
well off as possible in a world of

79
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:12,920
scarcity scarcity is key the core of

80
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,799
microeconomics is constrained

81
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:19,480
optimization basically individuals or

82
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:22,760
firms assessing the tradeoffs they face

83
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:25,640
every day in the decisions they make and

84
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,480
then trying to decide the best decision

85
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:30,080
given those

86
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:32,280
tradeoffs so that is microeconomics is

87
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,599
really about trade-offs mic economics is

88
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,560
really about you can't have it all so

89
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:37,439
what are you going to do with what you

90
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,799
can have how are you best going to use

91
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:42,120
your limited

92
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:44,879
resources and the key concept behind all

93
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,439
this the sort of probably the I'm going

94
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,840
to say about 100 times this is one of

95
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:49,040
the most important Concepts in economics

96
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,120
I'm sorry about that but this is really

97
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:54,480
one of the most important Concepts in

98
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:54,480
economics is the concept of opportunity

99
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:04,400
cost opportunity cost

100
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,840
okay and opportunity cost is the notion

101
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:11,239
that every

102
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:12,840
action or in action has cost in terms of

103
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:15,440
what you could have done instead in

104
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,519
terms of the next best

105
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:20,479
opportunity if you buy a shirt you are

106
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:22,120
forgoing spending that money on buying

107
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:23,639
something else so if you're deciding

108
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,800
between shirts and pants you buy the

109
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,600
shirt you're for going buying the pair

110
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,680
of

111
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,840
pants if you

112
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,120
study if you spend all night studying

113
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,800
you're forg going the opportunity to go

114
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:37,280
see a band you like in concert and vice

115
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,919
versa every action you take is a

116
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,000
trade-off every decision you make

117
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:41,840
involves a trade-off because there's

118
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,840
always an opportunity cost there's

119
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,320
always something you could have done

120
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,320
instead

121
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:50,039
yeah great question um actually let me

122
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:54,440
come back to that in one minute I want

123
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:57,880
to come back to that or five minutes um

124
00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:00,199
okay so this is why economics is called

125
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,560
the Dismal science we're called the

126
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:03,720
Dismal science because the role of the

127
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,840
economist is to basically say well you

128
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,240
think that's free but it's not you think

129
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,639
you can just relax and watch TV but you

130
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,840
know by watching TV you're giving up the

131
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,039
opportunity to study the opportunity to

132
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,440
go out see a concert or the opportunity

133
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,280
to do something else okay so that's why

134
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,960
they call disal science now some people

135
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,240
may call dismal I call it fun and maybe

136
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,319
that's because I was an MIT

137
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,680
undergraduate and what is an engineering

138
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:23,160
school but the land of constrainted

139
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,440
optimization that's what engineering and

140
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,199
science is it's all about what

141
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,240
engineering is tra and optimization what

142
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,319
better example could there be in the

143
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,039
two7 contests you're given a set of

144
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:33,400
materials and asked to build something

145
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:37,000
that's a constrained optimization

146
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:39,759
exercise indeed economics was invented

147
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,880
modern economics invented at MIT by The

148
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,000
Economist Paul Samuelson who essentially

149
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:46,919
said the mathematics that science

150
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,880
Engineers use can be applied to analyze

151
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:50,639
really the sort of essay likee approach

152
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,400
that people had taken economics before

153
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,400
him so he basically brought the tools of

154
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:58,199
science to economics and basically

155
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,199
developed the course I'll teach today

156
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,919
and the course that's taught all over

157
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,319
the world was developed right here at

158
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:04,880
MIT modern economics was born here

159
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:06,880
because we introduced the tools of

160
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,960
constraint

161
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,080
optimization now oh over here I'm

162
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,400
usually going to try to do like an

163
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,160
outline of what we're covering so we

164
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,560
talked about course details what is

165
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,039
micro just did now let's talk about how

166
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,759
we do that what economics does which is

167
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:23,440
we use models and I'm talk about a model

168
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:23,440
of supply and

169
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:29,880
demand how do we actually teach you all

170
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,319
about these tradeoffs

171
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:35,880
okay the way we do it is by building

172
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:38,039
simplified models okay what is a Model A

173
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,800
model is technically the description of

174
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:41,919
any relationship between two or more

175
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:45,560
variables is a

176
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:47,560
model um now but unlike explaining

177
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,479
relationship between energy and mass we

178
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:52,680
do not have scientific laws and

179
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:54,560
constants in our universe okay economics

180
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,199
is as much as we hate to say it not a

181
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,840
real science it is a social science

182
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,440
which means that basically we don't have

183
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,560
rigid laws that we can write down say

184
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,199
they're all they're everywhere

185
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:09,000
applicable okay we we have to use models

186
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:11,120
to basically try to explain the world as

187
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,919
much as we can and so in doing so we

188
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,759
have to make a set of simplifying

189
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,599
assumptions a set of simplifying

190
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,879
assumptions to try to essentially trade

191
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:22,520
off two

192
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:24,759
goals one goal is to explain as much as

193
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:27,479
we can the other goal is to have

194
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:29,800
parsimonious models that I can teach

195
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:31,039
you okay the more complicated the model

196
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,520
gets the harder it is to teach the

197
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,560
harder it is to solve this comes to the

198
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,919
earlier question about are you really

199
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,199
just trading off two goods well of

200
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:37,879
course you're never just trading off two

201
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:39,919
goods but we're going to write our

202
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:41,440
models like you are and it's going to

203
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,919
turn out that gives you all the

204
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,360
intuition you need for a model with this

205
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:46,319
three or four Goods it's just a lot

206
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,840
easier math so it turns out everything

207
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,800
you learn in the model with two goods

208
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,960
tells you everything you need to know

209
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,800
for a model with n Goods just with

210
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,800
easier math so that's the kind of

211
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,720
simplifying assumption that's a

212
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,840
fairly um uh that's a fairly uh

213
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,919
non-offensive simplifying assumption

214
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,199
think it doesn't really change anything

215
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:04,720
we'll make other simplifying assumptions

216
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:07,639
which are noxious and offensive and

217
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,039
we'll talk about those and if you are

218
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:10,280
offended by them and bothered and want

219
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,599
to see what happens without those

220
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,159
assumptions then that's exactly why you

221
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,319
should be economics major because that's

222
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:17,560
we go on and do in the rest of the

223
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:18,879
classes say okay now let's move on from

224
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,080
these simplified models add some

225
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:24,280
richness and see what it does to the

226
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:26,800
world okay uh the statistician George

227
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:30,000
box uh once wrote that all models are

228
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,560
wrong but some are useful okay okay and

229
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,800
that's exactly what we're going to try

230
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:36,360
to work with today okay when I teach you

231
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,880
economics I'm going to try to teach it

232
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:41,800
to you on three levels okay the first is

233
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:44,320
word MIT is

234
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,760
mathematical the second is graphical and

235
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,880
the third is

236
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,440
intuitive really if you want to succeed

237
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:52,279
in this class you need to understand all

238
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,920
three now not every model will I use all

239
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:56,600
three but you want to understand all

240
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,320
three of those Concepts to really

241
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:01,440
understand the material we're learning

242
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,480
here and and we'll start with the model

243
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,720
of supply and demand the very first

244
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,880
economic model developed by Adam Smith

245
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:10,040
in 1776 in the book that was sort of the

246
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:14,839
founding of Economics The Wealth of

247
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:16,480
Nations Adam Smith asked the question um

248
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:17,560
think about two goods think about water

249
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,640
and think about

250
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:23,000
diamonds okay nothing is more essential

251
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,600
for life than water we cannot function

252
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,959
without it nothing is probably less

253
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,000
essential for life than diamonds

254
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,200
especially back then when diamonds

255
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,200
didn't have industrial uses they were

256
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,240
just

257
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:35,440
bobbles okay water is clearly just

258
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,600
essential diamonds aren't yet the price

259
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,279
of diamonds is very high and water is

260
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,560
essentially free he asked how could this

261
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:46,240
be and the answer is because what I've

262
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:48,240
just described is only one half of the

263
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:52,120
model of where we get the price of water

264
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:55,240
or diamonds I've described the

265
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:56,720
demand I've describe the demand for

266
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,399
water and diamonds I've said the demand

267
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,320
for water is much much larger than the

268
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:03,240
demand for diamonds

269
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,720
what I haven't talked about is the

270
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:08,360
supply which is the supply of water is

271
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:10,360
even more Rel the supply of diamonds

272
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:13,839
water is everywhere diamonds are rare to

273
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:16,959
find and what Adam Smith said is that

274
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,920
while the demand for diamonds may not be

275
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,200
as high as the demand for water the

276
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:23,600
supply of diamonds is much much smaller

277
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,720
than the supply of water and that is why

278
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,760
you could end up with a good that's

279
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,920
inherently less valuable to life having

280
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,399
a higher price

281
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:35,120
okay and Smith's point is you can't just

282
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:39,200
think of supply and demand and isolation

283
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:41,279
you need to think of them uh together um

284
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:45,839
is uh oh Pedro could you grab me a copy

285
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:47,360
of the handout fix um okay so that's

286
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,360
sort of the

287
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,160
intuition that's the intuition Spider

288
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,839
Man model now let's talk about the

289
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:56,040
graphics and the math okay so now let's

290
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,959
talk about an example of a supply demand

291
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,680
model and let's focus on the market for

292
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:01,120
roses

293
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,000
what is a market a Market's what it

294
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,480
sounds like it's buyers and sellers

295
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,760
coming together are there any more any

296
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,839
extra handouts around is everyone have

297
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,720
one everyone have a

298
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,920
handout okay good that's fine then okay

299
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,120
let's talk about the the markets for D

300
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:20,279
let's talk about the market for Roses

301
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:23,639
okay first of all what is a market a

302
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:26,839
market is think of a market to start

303
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:31,560
yeah like another page right the hand

304
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:31,560
has graphs on it does anyone have hand

305
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,600
out did how me you

306
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,839
print what's that is there any is there

307
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:45,000
an extra pile sitting around there of

308
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:47,040
handouts we got some extras there okay

309
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,480
pass those around make sure you know

310
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:52,600
pass those around and

311
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:54,360
uh yeah next time they'll be in the back

312
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,399
so please you know raise your hand if

313
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,200
you don't have a hand out and let's try

314
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:59,839
to pass those around okay pedri can you

315
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,000
grab one for me

316
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,959
um okay so basically let's think about

317
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,440
the market for Roses what is a market a

318
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,839
market is a place where buyers and

319
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:11,680
sellers come together to make

320
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:14,160
transactions okay think of it like the

321
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,560
old timey markets of ancient England

322
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,839
were literally the only way to transact

323
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,959
was physically being in the same

324
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:22,199
place where the buyers and sellers would

325
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,560
come to Market once a week and the

326
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:25,040
people bring their cows and people who

327
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:27,760
wanted milk would come in or meat would

328
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,880
come in and they would transact think of

329
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,040
the market that way now of course that's

330
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,880
not how the modern Market works but

331
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,959
that's the way we want you to

332
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,760
intuitively think of a market it's

333
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,480
literally a place where buyers and sells

334
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,320
are

335
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,320
interacting and it turns out that

336
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,480
intuition will work even even given the

337
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,959
modern

338
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:47,000
economy okay so now who else doesn't

339
00:12:43,959 --> 00:12:50,480
have handouts everyone got the

340
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,160
graphs okay all right so um now let's

341
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,839
talk about the market for roses in

342
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:59,760
figure 11 one we have the market for

343
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:01,920
Roses okay on the xaxis the horizontal

344
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,399
we have the quantity of roses I'm going

345
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,720
to by the way try to have handouts for

346
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:07,639
all the graphs because my handwriting is

347
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,320
so brutal so uh uh you shouldn't have to

348
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:10,440
see hopefully if all goes well the sem

349
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:14,000
you should never see me draw a graph on

350
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:15,760
the board um so uh on the x-axis with

351
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,279
the quantity of roses on the y axis we

352
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:21,279
have the price of

353
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:23,760
roses okay um the demand curve

354
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:26,800
represents the relationship between

355
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:29,160
price and quantity from the consumer's

356
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:32,440
perspective so the domain curve in this

357
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:37,079
this case is represented by the

358
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:41,120
equation Q equals

359
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:41,120
1,800 minus 400

360
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,480
P okay now you're immediately say well

361
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,279
what where's 1800 400 come from it

362
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,320
doesn't matter right now that's what

363
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,199
we're going to teach you in the next few

364
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,199
lectures right now that's just that's an

365
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:55,279
equation that represents a line and it's

366
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:57,399
the critical aspect of that equation is

367
00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:00,120
that there's a negative

368
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:04,000
relationship between

369
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:06,440
price and quantity as price goes up

370
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,120
consumers want fewer

371
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:12,000
roses why is that well it's just because

372
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,440
of opportunity cost the more expensive

373
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,720
is a rose the more you have to give up

374
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:19,959
to buy it so its opportunity cost is

375
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:23,480
higher so you want it

376
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:25,079
less okay so the higher is the price the

377
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:28,680
fewer roses you want so we get a

378
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:30,800
downward sloping demand curve the blue

379
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:33,519
line

380
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,320
now the supply curve represents the same

381
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,480
relationship between price and quantity

382
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:39,720
but from the supplier's

383
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:42,680
perspective a supply curve in this case

384
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:46,440
that we've drawn here has the equation

385
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:46,440
Q equals

386
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:53,920
200p 200p you'll see here there is a

387
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:56,639
positive relationship between price and

388
00:14:53,920 --> 00:15:00,240
quantity that is supply curve is upward

389
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:02,920
sloping as price goes up firms will prod

390
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,360
firms will produce more roses why once

391
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:08,040
again opportunity

392
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:09,880
cost with a low price producing a rose

393
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,000
means you can't use that farm to produce

394
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,680
something

395
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,880
else if the price of Rose is low you're

396
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,560
going to use the farm for something else

397
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,160
the price of roses is high you will then

398
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,160
use that far to produce roses because

399
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,000
that is a better choice than the next

400
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,000
best

401
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,240
alternative so once again this concept

402
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,920
of opportunity has already helped

403
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,279
explain the basic model of Economics the

404
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,319
single most important model of Economics

405
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:31,560
is represented in this graph and you can

406
00:15:30,319 --> 00:15:34,399
understand it just by the concept of

407
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:36,079
opportunity cost that is why we are such

408
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,360
a powerful social science that's why all

409
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:41,399
the other social sciences are [ __ ]

410
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:43,560
jealous of us okay because we can use

411
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:45,680
Simple tools to explain much to explain

412
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:50,079
much of the world and here's a perfect

413
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:52,759
example okay now we call the point where

414
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:55,360
those two curves meet the

415
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:58,160
equilibrium the point where supply and

416
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,959
demand are in agreement is the

417
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:04,399
equilibrium that is the point at which

418
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:06,600
suppliers are willing to sell roses at

419
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:10,279
the same price consumers are willing to

420
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:13,079
pay for them so with 600 roses 600 box

421
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:16,240
of roses or whatever it is the the

422
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:18,360
equilibrium price is $3 well it's a row

423
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,399
so with 600 rows the equili price is $3

424
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:23,800
that is both parties are happy in

425
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:26,000
equilibrium the key point about

426
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:29,040
equilibrium as the name

427
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,319
implies as the term equilibrium implies

428
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,720
it's the point where the system has come

429
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:35,560
to rest where both parties are happy

430
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,279
with the outcome both parties are happy

431
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:39,920
because it's on the demand and supply

432
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:44,600
curve since it's on the demand curve

433
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:48,079
consumers are willing to pay $3 for 600

434
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:50,959
roses they wouldn't pay $4 600 roses but

435
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:52,839
they pay three since it's on the supply

436
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:55,680
curve suppliers are willing to accept

437
00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:58,040
$3600 roses they wouldn't accept $2600

438
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,440
roses but they'll accept $3 because it's

439
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,920
on the Curve

440
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,120
so basically it's just two equations and

441
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,280
two unknowns you set these two things

442
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,199
equal to each other and you solve and

443
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:12,880
you get

444
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:16,919
qar equals uh qar equals

445
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:18,959
600 and P star equals three just by two

446
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:20,720
equations and two unknowns once again

447
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,600
why we only have two goods I could have

448
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,720
done this in three dimensions the graph

449
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,640
would have been uglier the math would

450
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,160
have been harder but nothing would have

451
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,160
changed yeah

452
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,400
oh that's a great question basically

453
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,240
they

454
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,600
are it's a good question we write down

455
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,559
the function are basically invertible

456
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,240
and we use them both ways is the bottom

457
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:47,200
line it doesn't we're really writing

458
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,600
down equili relation between q and P it

459
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,200
doesn't really matter what X and Y is

460
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,880
we're really just writing down an equili

461
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:54,080
relationship it's just the convention is

462
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,840
to put Q on the xaxis even though the

463
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,200
con even though the convention will

464
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,960
sometimes right toand curs was p on the

465
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,559
left hand side the graphic convention

466
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,880
will never change but how you write the

467
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:04,000
curves might change how we write the

468
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:07,679
equations might change

469
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,480
yeah use opportunity cost to justify why

470
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,600
demand down sloping great question okay

471
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,280
let's go through it that's exactly kind

472
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,280
of question I want to hear the semester

473
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,559
the reason demand is to someone take a

474
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:21,480
crack at

475
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:24,960
it any anyone to explain yeah and speak

476
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:27,120
up if the price is higher in order to

477
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,320
get that Rose you had to give up more

478
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,440
because the price represents like your

479
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:33,320
opportunity right PR the opportunity

480
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,200
cost of any good in the free market is

481
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,600
its

482
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:39,760
price so as the as the price goes up the

483
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,159
opportunity cost goes up why because

484
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,840
there's more other stuff you could have

485
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:45,799
bought so if it's three bucks a row you

486
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,200
could have bought you know a slice of

487
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:50,360
pizza and a Coke but if four Buck if

488
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,600
it's if it's four bucks a rose you uh

489
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,120
four bucks a rose you don't have enough

490
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,080
money left to buy both the Coke and the

491
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,960
and the slice of pizza so and but that's

492
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,360
a great question because that's exactly

493
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:02,440
where we're going to go next is the next

494
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:04,679
three lectures are going to tell you

495
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:07,440
where this equation comes from we're

496
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:10,360
going to start with the basic principles

497
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,440
of people's preferences really almost

498
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,840
philosophical and we're going to derive

499
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,080
this

500
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,280
curve then after that the next five

501
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,120
lectures will be deriving this curve

502
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:22,320
we'll start with the basic principles of

503
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:25,799
how firms make decisions and we'll

504
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,799
derive the supply curve

505
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:30,720
yeah that that

506
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:33,679
well it depends on on what I've written

507
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,919
on the axis you're right this is this is

508
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,000
confusing pedri should make a note we

509
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:37,280
should probably make this clearer next

510
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,720
time we should have called this number

511
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,360
of roses or shouldn't have been called

512
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,799
quantity of roses that's a great point

513
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,760
we should call this number of roses or

514
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:46,520
boxes of roses but it's per a quantity

515
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,640
that's specified in the model great

516
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:50,120
question thinking with MIT you cannot

517
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,799
get away with with sloppiness here I

518
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:54,520
love it Harvard what the hell you write

519
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:56,799
whatever you want

520
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:59,520
yeah

521
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:01,520
usually great question in indeed uh this

522
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,880
is another cheat we'll do which we'll

523
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,640
often write down nonlinear

524
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,799
representations but draw them

525
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,640
linearly um this is a linear

526
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:10,080
representation but sometimes we'll have

527
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,360
nonlinear curves and draw them linearly

528
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,200
when we do think of it as a local

529
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:16,799
approximation think of the linear piece

530
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,799
as the local approximation to the larger

531
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:25,000
function okay great questions I love it

532
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:27,159
okay now this raises this model raises a

533
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,360
very important distinction that we're

534
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:29,640
going to focus on the semester it's

535
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,720
going to trip you up I guarantee a

536
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,679
number of times so I want you to very

537
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,960
careful thinking about this which is the

538
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:36,679
distinction between

539
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:40,840
positive

540
00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:40,840
economics and normative

541
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:46,880
economics positive economics is the

542
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:50,520
study of the way things

543
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:53,840
are while normative economics is the

544
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:55,240
study of the way things should be okay

545
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,600
positive economics study the way things

546
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,360
are normative economics to study the way

547
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,799
things should be

548
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,320
okay now to consider to understand this

549
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:08,240
let's consider a great example of

550
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:11,520
Economics at work which is eBay okay

551
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,919
when eBay came along okay I know it is

552
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,320
older than all of you but it's younger

553
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:18,360
than me when eBay came along economists

554
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:21,200
are very excited because economists love

555
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:23,400
auctions auctions are if you will The

556
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:26,200
Standard Market that used to exist in

557
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:28,039
you know 15th century England okay it's

558
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:31,159
literally people beating against each

559
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:33,679
other in a way that reveals who wants

560
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:34,679
the good the most and what's wonderful

561
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,080
about that and we'll come back to this

562
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:38,360
throughout the semester is it has two

563
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,240
great features one is it makes sure the

564
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:41,400
right amount gets produced and two is it

565
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,000
makes sure the people who want it the

566
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:46,760
most get it one beautiful feature of

567
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,799
free markets is that they don't just get

568
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:50,480
you to the right aggregate quantity they

569
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,400
also get the get the goods in the hands

570
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,120
of people who are willing to pay the

571
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:56,400
most for them and that's what what eBay

572
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:58,640
did now one auction eBay got a lot of

573
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,159
example got a lot of attention I'm sorry

574
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,279
got a lot of attention which is that

575
00:22:01,159 --> 00:22:05,200
somebody put their kidney for auction on

576
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:06,559
eBay they auctioned their kidney they

577
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,760
said I'll give you my kidney for let the

578
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,919
bidding started

579
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,520
$225,000 the bidding got up to $5

580
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,440
million before eBay shut it down and

581
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,080
said no auctioning human body parts on

582
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,960
eBay

583
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:18,919
okay now I don't know why they stopped

584
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,679
at five million out earlier but whatever

585
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:23,520
okay so we can with this example we can

586
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:26,520
ask both a positive and a normative

587
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:29,400
question the positive question is why

588
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:32,080
did the price get so high

589
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,960
and here we only need AAL to supply

590
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,240
demand

591
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,919
model the demand for a kidney is going

592
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,159
to be pretty high if you need a kidney

593
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:40,799
to live you're going to pay

594
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:43,120
approximately everything you have to get

595
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:44,720
it the supply of kidneys on the free

596
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,360
market is pretty low like that was the

597
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,440
only one I know of okay so it's a

598
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,279
classic case with a very high demand and

599
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,320
a very low Supply you're going to get a

600
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:54,480
very high price and so it's not

601
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,480
surprising the price went up and

602
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,279
probably would have gone up further if

603
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:59,960
eBay hadn't shut it

604
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:01,760
down but but now we come to the

605
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,559
normative question which is more

606
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,799
interesting and

607
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:09,679
harder which is um should we be allowed

608
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:10,919
to sell our bodily organs on eBay okay

609
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,919
you might think that this is a question

610
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:14,159
here in philosophy class but

611
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:17,159
fundamentally it's an economics

612
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,600
question okay many folks die in America

613
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:21,039
because though because we do not have

614
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:23,080
enough organs to help those with organ

615
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:25,840
failure we we have a limited supply of

616
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:27,559
organs I hope you all are organ donors

617
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,120
on your driver to licenses doesn't cost

618
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:30,480
you anything you're gone in anyway and

619
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:34,440
it can save a

620
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:36,159
life um but um many people don't do that

621
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,840
and uh even if they did we're just we

622
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:42,760
have a higher demand for organs than we

623
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:46,120
can fit now if someone who wants an

624
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:47,520
organ is wealthy and willing to pay a

625
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:50,919
lot of money for

626
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:53,240
it and there's someone else who says

627
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:55,480
look I got two kidneys you can function

628
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:57,960
just fine with one the oddy of kidney

629
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:00,880
failure is really low someone says look

630
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:02,840
I am desperate Straits I can't feed my

631
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,880
family I can't house my

632
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:09,159
family I could sell one kidney still

633
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:11,320
function fine and change my life forever

634
00:24:09,159 --> 00:24:13,880
educate my children build a house do the

635
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:17,240
things I need to do why shouldn't we let

636
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:20,200
that happen so standard economics would

637
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:25,200
say great let them auction their body

638
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:27,600
parts but in fact there's reasons why we

639
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:30,039
don't think many there's many reasons

640
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,960
why that may not a good outcome what are

641
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:33,760
those what are reasons we might not want

642
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:39,320
to just say sure let a

643
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:39,320
rip what are some reasons yeah go

644
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,279
ahead yeah so there's fundamentally two

645
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:50,799
kinds of reasons the first kind is what

646
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,799
we'll call market

647
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,799
failures market failures are something

648
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:01,360
we're not going to cover for about the

649
00:24:57,799 --> 00:25:04,520
first 11 lectures for the first 11

650
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:06,640
lectures the free market is going to be

651
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:08,720
king let me be very clear with you

652
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,720
economics is fundamentally a right-wing

653
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,640
science okay as we'll come clear through

654
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,880
the semester I'm kind of a leftwing guy

655
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,440
but economics is pretty much a

656
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:18,880
right-wing science in basic economics

657
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:21,559
says the market knows

658
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,120
best and the and there's only two

659
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:25,520
reasons why you should ever interfere

660
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,840
with with the market and the first is

661
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:30,240
because for some reason the Market's not

662
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:31,880
working properly this is an example we

663
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,760
it would be fine if everyone

664
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:37,000
knowledgeably went into this

665
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:39,279
transaction but what if this turns out

666
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,640
this can cause people to like force

667
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:43,640
force their children to give up their

668
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:46,360
kidney or do things against their will

669
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:48,840
other criminal activities um what if

670
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:50,960
people don't really understand how

671
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,720
dangerous it is to give your kidney

672
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,200
there's 50,000 Americans every year

673
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,159
there's now currently about 100,000

674
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:58,840
Americans living with hepatitis C which

675
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,039
causes kidney failure he C can live

676
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:02,240
dormant for years before you know you

677
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:05,159
have it what if you give up your kidney

678
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,600
find hepatitis C then you're dead so

679
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:08,039
there's lots of reasons why I think well

680
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,559
maybe this Market doesn't work quite as

681
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:11,840
well as economists say it does people

682
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:15,159
might be misinformed people might be F

683
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:17,320
people might be forced to do it what's

684
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:19,480
interesting is the black market is not

685
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:22,080
necessarily one of those reasons and

686
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:24,559
here's why because the black market

687
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:27,159
economists just say is a market let's

688
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:28,919
say eBay doesn't allow you to sell your

689
00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:31,080
kidneys so you have to sell it on the

690
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:33,200
black market well if there's no other

691
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,440
market failures that's okay for the same

692
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,000
reason economists think it'd be okay to

693
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,080
sell your body parts there's no reason

694
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,919
why I tell your body parts on a form

695
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:41,399
Market informal Market the only reason

696
00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:43,320
why it would be bad would that informal

697
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:45,080
Market comes with other unsavory

698
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:46,840
features like forcing people to sell

699
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:49,640
their body parts or not being informed

700
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:51,480
that's what it be bad okay what other

701
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:53,760
reasons might we care might be worried

702
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:55,080
about people selling the kidneys yeah

703
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,640
why T shouldn't the

704
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:59,200
back it would mean that only like really

705
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,799
rich people

706
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:04,039
great great answers guys the second

707
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:06,200
reason we care is what we call Equity or

708
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:07,679
fairness which is we might not think

709
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,240
it's fair that rich people get to live

710
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,640
and poor get to live longer and buy the

711
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:13,200
organs and poor people

712
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:15,559
don't okay we might think this is that

713
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:18,200
that this is an unfair

714
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:21,200
outcome now this is what's fascinating

715
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:22,760
about America which is even though we

716
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,799
pride ourselves on being the land of the

717
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:28,679
market economy we also care a lot about

718
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:30,840
fairness as a nation and this is viewed

719
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:31,960
by many as being complately unfair that

720
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:34,159
the Richer you are the more you can just

721
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:36,240
buy part body parts off poor

722
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,000
people now here's what's a little bit

723
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,679
sad about this class and the sad about

724
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,640
the limitation of only having you know

725
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,080
the number of weeks we have which is I'm

726
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:46,159
not going to talk nearly as much about

727
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:47,960
Equity as I'd like to 90% of this course

728
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:49,679
is going to be about efficiency it's

729
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:51,760
going to be about does the market work

730
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:54,480
does the market deliver the right

731
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,720
quantity of goods it's not about equity

732
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,399
which is well does that right quantity

733
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,760
end up going end up causing huge

734
00:27:57,399 --> 00:28:01,039
inequality in

735
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:03,720
Society so that is kind of another

736
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:05,159
reason why we might care okay and we

737
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:07,760
will discuss Equity leing the semester

738
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:11,279
but unfortunately not to much later all

739
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,279
right other questions or thoughts about

740
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:17,279
that okay let me finally talk about one

741
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,039
last thing which sort of seems like you

742
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:22,159
got to talk about in the first lecture

743
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:23,799
of of an economics class which is what

744
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,840
about the underlying structure of the

745
00:28:23,799 --> 00:28:28,200
economy how do we think about different

746
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:30,399
models of how economies function and the

747
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:33,039
fundamental conflict is between a

748
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:33,039
capitalist

749
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:37,640
model and a command

750
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:45,240
model the capitalist model in its purest

751
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:49,519
form What's called the LA fair or let it

752
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:52,679
be uh model is one where individuals

753
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:55,799
decide what to produce and consume with

754
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:58,159
no interference it's a purely free

755
00:28:55,799 --> 00:29:01,200
market okay it's the market that sort of

756
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:03,360
existed 500 years ago before we had sort

757
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,120
of the truth is it never existed there's

758
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,640
no such thing we will do a lot of

759
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,320
teaching by Extremes in this course

760
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,000
we'll talk about extremes it's a great

761
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,799
learning device but there's no never

762
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,399
been such as a purely capitalistic

763
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:17,760
economy most economies like the US are

764
00:29:15,399 --> 00:29:20,320
Market driven but government and

765
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:23,799
socially constrained what does that mean

766
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:26,240
that means yes we let GM decide how many

767
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:28,200
cars to produce but we have standards on

768
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:30,399
what emissions those cars can have and

769
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,960
how safe they have to be in a purely

770
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:34,240
capitalist economy GM could produce the

771
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:36,120
most dangerous cars they wanted no one

772
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,919
would care and they could be smog Laden

773
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:40,039
and no one would care obviously we don't

774
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:43,240
have that in America we have regulations

775
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:44,240
we have taxes on gas we have rules on

776
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:47,159
what you can learn and where you can

777
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:50,120
learn it Etc so we have what we call a

778
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:51,519
sort of constrained capitalist economy

779
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:53,080
where fundamentally the decisions on

780
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:55,080
what to produce and what to consume are

781
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:57,519
made by individuals within a set of

782
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:59,840
rules set up by the government and some

783
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:04,240
also set up by social

784
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:06,320
norms okay now the opposite extreme is

785
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,840
what we call a command economy and we

786
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,760
actually had almost the closest model

787
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:12,240
that could exist to this which was the

788
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:13,279
Soviet Union of my youth the Soviet

789
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,519
Union of my youth it's typically

790
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:16,039
associated with Communism although it

791
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:16,880
doesn't have to be command economies

792
00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:19,000
don't have to be associated with

793
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,679
Communism Germany in World War II was a

794
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,720
command economy in the service of

795
00:30:20,679 --> 00:30:24,039
fascism it's typically associated with

796
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,519
Communism is what we call a command

797
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:28,720
economy in in that extreme the

798
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:31,480
government makes all production

799
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:33,320
allocation decisions people don't decide

800
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:35,440
what they get the government decides

801
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:36,840
what they get so it's the other extreme

802
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,640
there's no free

803
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:41,120
transactions it's the government making

804
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,799
all the rules not just about how much

805
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,480
should be produced but who gets what's

806
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:47,440
produced okay so in the free market the

807
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,840
market subject set of government sort of

808
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,919
you guys have bowled there's like the

809
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,039
bumpers you can up when you're little

810
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:53,120
kid and you bowl and they keep the ball

811
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:54,440
on that bowling lane so think of the

812
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,880
government you know in a capital economy

813
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:58,240
is those sort of those those those uh

814
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,159
guides on the side that help keep the

815
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,360
ball in the lane but but you get to

816
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,279
throw the ball on decide what if you're

817
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,720
going to which pin you're going to go

818
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:06,159
for in in command economy they literally

819
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:09,600
they tell you go to the end of Lane and

820
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:11,080
knock down pin seven okay uh it's a very

821
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:14,279
it's a very different

822
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:16,679
model now in

823
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:19,799
theory the argument for the command

824
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:21,639
model is that it can ensure that the

825
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:24,320
right Goods get produced and distributed

826
00:31:21,639 --> 00:31:25,679
as fairly as possible the idea this the

827
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:28,799
theory is quite simple it goes back to

828
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:31,080
KL marks the theory makes a lot of sense

829
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:32,679
which is look the government's job is to

830
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:35,080
make sure society's as well off as

831
00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:37,399
possible it does that by making sure the

832
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:39,760
right things get produced and get to the

833
00:31:37,399 --> 00:31:40,919
right people and we can't trust the

834
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,880
market to do that only the government

835
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:45,720
can do that okay this is a great

836
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:48,679
argument in theory in practice it

837
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:51,440
doesn't work and it doesn't work for two

838
00:31:48,679 --> 00:31:54,480
reasons it first of all it's just too

839
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:56,519
damn hard to make all those

840
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,440
decisions any government no matter how

841
00:31:56,519 --> 00:32:01,000
large and how benevolent cannot make the

842
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:02,399
enormous massive quantity of billions

843
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,039
and billions of decisions that need to

844
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:06,519
be made think about every good we

845
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:08,080
consume in America a government deciding

846
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:10,519
how much of it to make and literally who

847
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,679
gets it okay it's overwhelming

848
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:12,799
governments can't do it so that led to

849
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,639
things like in East Germany I was in

850
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:16,679
East Germany a year ago and I went to

851
00:32:14,639 --> 00:32:19,159
went to the Museum of East Germany and

852
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:21,639
uh they talk about how in in back in

853
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:23,399
communist days in East Germany uh no one

854
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:25,760
had cars but they had so much bread they

855
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:26,600
would feed bread to their pigs for food

856
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,440
okay because the government sort of

857
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:30,000
screwed up and decided you know

858
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:32,559
commanded too many too much bread and

859
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,679
too few cars okay that's natural it's

860
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:38,760
going to happen it's just too hard okay

861
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:41,120
the second problem is that human nature

862
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:43,720
being what it is a command economy

863
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,360
inevita leads to massive corruption

864
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,960
because when a handful of people are in

865
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,960
charge of deciding everything of course

866
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,880
they're going to make their lives the

867
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:51,240
best

868
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,120
first so I'm not saying there's not

869
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:55,200
corruption in capitalist economies but

870
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,799
it's sort of inherent in a command

871
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,679
economy it's inherent because you're

872
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:00,320
giving a set of people the power to

873
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:01,760
decide who gets what and it's inevitably

874
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,240
in human nature they'll decide to give

875
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:06,240
themselves the most and

876
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:08,159
first so that is why really why the

877
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,279
Soviet Union collapsed because the

878
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:12,760
command economy simply couldn't get it

879
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:14,720
done and let's be clear it did not

880
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:18,240
appear inevitable in the

881
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:19,840
1950s there was huge Envy in the US of

882
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,880
what the Soviet Union was accomplishing

883
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,440
they came out of a devastating war and

884
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:25,519
built a manufacturing base that was the

885
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:28,440
Envy of the entire world even the US

886
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:30,240
almost overnight it was incredible

887
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,480
and a lot of people questioned whether

888
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,000
that might after all not be the right

889
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,600
model it just it turns out over about 30

890
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,760
years it fell apart because it just

891
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,799
wasn't

892
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:41,480
sustainable now the alternative of

893
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:42,840
course is the uh US economy the capital

894
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,720
economy which operates by what the

895
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:47,360
famous the father of economics Adam

896
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,360
Smith calls the Invisible Hand the

897
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,120
notion invisible hand is you don't need

898
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,639
a government to make all these decisions

899
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:55,559
because the market makes it for you the

900
00:33:52,639 --> 00:33:56,679
Invisible Hand of the market decides how

901
00:33:55,559 --> 00:33:58,480
much you get produced and who should get

902
00:33:56,679 --> 00:33:59,919
it not through any one person making

903
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,799
decisions but just through people coming

904
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:02,799
together in a market and working

905
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:03,600
together to make those decisions and

906
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:06,080
that's what we'll teach you this

907
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:08,079
semester how the market works and how

908
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,919
those that invisible hand can lead

909
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:11,079
through the magic of the market to the

910
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:14,079
right Goods being produced and getting

911
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:16,079
in the hands of the right people okay so

912
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:17,280
that's a huge advantage and it's worked

913
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:20,440
America is the richest nation in the

914
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:24,440
world we've grown rapidly for centuries

915
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:27,800
now um and we are um and and we're very

916
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:29,359
successful on the other hand it leads to

917
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:31,520
tremendous

918
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:32,760
inequality because the way the right

919
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,399
person to have the good is the person

920
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:36,879
who can pay the most for it right in the

921
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:39,639
command economy the right person have

922
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:40,560
the good corruption aside is who needs

923
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:42,879
it the

924
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,919
most we take our kidney example the

925
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:45,119
command economy would say well let's

926
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:47,000
find the person close to death and give

927
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:48,079
them the kidney the capital econ say

928
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,240
let's find the person willing to pay the

929
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:53,000
most to give them the kidney well that's

930
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:55,280
unfair and that is an inevitable outcome

931
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,760
of a capitalist economy America is the

932
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:01,000
most unequal major nation in the world

933
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,920
World our inequality dwarfs what we see

934
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,920
in other countries around the world the

935
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:09,720
top 1% of Americans control 25% of all

936
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:11,440
the income in the US which is which is

937
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:13,960
at least 5% higher than any other major

938
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:17,359
nation in the world okay so we have

939
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:18,800
large inequality because basically the

940
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:19,839
Mark it's inevitable in a market that'll

941
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,119
happen because people who want to pay

942
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:24,960
the most get the

943
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:28,440
stuff okay so that gives you the

944
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:32,200
tradeoff the consensus I would say among

945
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:35,000
virtually every Economist is that a

946
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:37,440
command economy is not the way to go the

947
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,240
debate is within the capitalist

948
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:42,400
model how far the government should

949
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:44,640
intervene if you look at countries like

950
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,000
Europe they have a much more intervenous

951
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,680
Economist you'll Europe countries being

952
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,720
called socialist they're not socialist

953
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:53,359
socialist means the government controls

954
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:55,040
the industry socialist would be there

955
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,599
still consumers don't going decide what

956
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,920
to buy but the government produces

957
00:35:56,599 --> 00:35:59,920
everything the government runs the banks

958
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,960
the government runs the airplanes the

959
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,560
government decides how much steel to

960
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,079
produce the government so in substance a

961
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:06,119
socialist is sort of halfway between

962
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:08,040
capitalist and command economy where the

963
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:09,880
government does the production but

964
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:11,920
Market forces decide the

965
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:14,680
allocation that's not true in any other

966
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:17,000
major country in the world okay these

967
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:18,760
countries are all different levels of

968
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,800
constrained capitalist economies they're

969
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:23,520
all different width of those bowling

970
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,920
alleys okay in Europe and many European

971
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,839
nations they have much more constrained

972
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:28,960
capitalist economies much higher taxes

973
00:36:26,839 --> 00:36:31,359
much more government prevention also

974
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,280
much more equal and we'll be talking

975
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:35,720
about this semester and what I focus on

976
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,960
much more in my course 1441 is how do we

977
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:40,040
think about those

978
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:42,079
trade-offs between a Freer economy which

979
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:44,560
is larger but leads to more inequality

980
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:45,680
than the US and a less free economy with

981
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,359
less

982
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,560
inequality okay so to guide you to where

983
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:50,960
we're going to go I'm really big on sort

984
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:52,200
of making sure you have a big picture of

985
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,599
where we are in this class and once

986
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,640
again if you're confused not just about

987
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:58,119
the little picture but the big picture

988
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:59,760
let's talk I do urge people come talk to

989
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:01,560
me I generally my rule is if it's like a

990
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,480
question about a problem set go see the

991
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:05,000
Tas if it's a question about like I

992
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:06,480
don't understand a concept or I want to

993
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,240
talk about economics in general or life

994
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,800
in general or music or whatever then

995
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:12,800
come see me okay and I really do urge

996
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,839
you folks to come come see me uh now

997
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,520
that I'm chair going I have to be around

998
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:16,760
all the time so I'm around plenty of

999
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:19,240
time please just make an appointment and

1000
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:20,960
come see me so where we're going to go

1001
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:22,040
from here what we're going to do like I

1002
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,920
said is the next few lectures we're

1003
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:25,839
going to map out what makes a demand

1004
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,880
curve then we're going to map out what

1005
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:29,880
makes a supply curve then we're going to

1006
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:31,480
put them together and talk about

1007
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,720
basically in some sense come back to

1008
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:35,160
where we started but now with an

1009
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:37,520
understanding of what demand and Supply

1010
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:39,200
mean and why the equilibrium makes sense

1011
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,200
we'll then talk about we'll then turn to

1012
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,520
normative economics and talk about why

1013
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,440
the market equilibrium is really the

1014
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,560
best

1015
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,760
outcome we're then going to start to

1016
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:50,440
talk about where the standard so it's

1017
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:53,640
been about the first I would say half of

1018
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:55,359
the class on the standard economic model

1019
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,760
the second half of the class will be

1020
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:58,079
focused on where the standard model

1021
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,880
breaks down

1022
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:01,880
what happens when there's monopolies

1023
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:04,880
like Google effectively a monopoly on

1024
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:07,079
search engines what happens when we want

1025
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,640
to trade with other countries what

1026
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:10,680
happens when we have to decide how much

1027
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,760
to save and how hard to work what

1028
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:14,720
happens when we have to decide um where

1029
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:16,560
to invest and what to do about global

1030
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,079
warming these are all the questions

1031
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:20,680
we'll tackle in the second half of the

1032
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:22,160
class okay so let me stop there and I

1033
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:26,119
hope I'll be seeing you all uh every

1034
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:26,119
Monday and Wednesday thank you
