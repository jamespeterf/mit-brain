1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:06,240
uh it's a pleasure to be here um and uh

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,080
I'm excited to be uh presenting to this

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,160
audience today we'll talk a little bit

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:14,240
about uh enabling Innovation and you'll

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:18,520
get a little bit of a an Insider look as

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:21,480
to uh mit's own administrative systems

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:25,400
processes and services and some of the

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:29,599
work that we're doing to really um uh

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:31,960
innovate and uh modernize a lot of those

10
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,559
uhst systems I think you know sometimes

11
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:37,960
we think about all the great uh Leading

12
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:40,440
Edge research uh that MIT does in the

13
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:43,079
area of Technology uh but we don't

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:46,280
always think about the fact that uh MIT

15
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:49,879
itself is an organization with its own

16
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:51,760
uh internal systems um and in some cases

17
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:54,359
those internal systems don't always take

18
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,719
number one priority uh it's a little bit

19
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:59,440
like the the shoemakers kids have no

20
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:02,280
shoes um a lot of the the focus and the

21
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:05,199
priori ation goes to the research and

22
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:08,200
The Innovation uh but uh looking

23
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:10,400
internally at MIT systems um you know

24
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,200
we'll talk about kind of the journey

25
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,240
that we've been through and what we're

26
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,360
looking to undertake over the next

27
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,560
several

28
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:23,640
years let's see

29
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:25,400
here okay so um I am part of the

30
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:29,240
organization of the Executive Vice

31
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:31,960
President and Treasurer um and I'm uh

32
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:36,200
partnering with the uh Chief Information

33
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:38,399
officer at MIT to undertake a multi-year

34
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:42,479
business and digital transformation

35
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:45,240
Journey um uh Glenn Shore who I report

36
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,320
into uh I think had a great statement

37
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,600
which was when you walk around campus

38
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:51,520
you see a lot of cranes often you'll

39
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,280
hear loud construction noises and might

40
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,360
have to rroo from time to time as we

41
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,360
pursue the work of expanding and

42
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,039
renewing our campus's physical

43
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,680
infrastructure to give MIT the spaces

44
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:05,000
needs to do its best work well now is

45
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:07,640
the time to similarly renew our digital

46
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,280
landscape and we'll talk about what that

47
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,120
means and how we're going about that and

48
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,760
how we're leveraging Innovation to

49
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,519
really Drive some of that

50
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:18,519
work um when we talk about our digital

51
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:20,720
landscape a lot of the areas we focus on

52
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:23,040
again are our internal administrative

53
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:26,160
systems so what do those systems enable

54
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,360
us to do they uh really enable us to do

55
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,599
everything from fundraising and

56
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,920
connecting with our community

57
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:35,480
uh of alumni to buying goods and

58
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,760
services and managing our finances

59
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:40,400
recruiting hiring paying and supporting

60
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:43,159
our employees through our HR and payroll

61
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,440
functions conducting research uh and

62
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:47,560
meeting compliance requirements through

63
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,840
both our pre-award and post- awward

64
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:54,360
administrative processes and of course

65
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:57,560
educating advising and supporting our

66
00:02:54,360 --> 00:03:01,239
students um if we look a little bit at

67
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:03,760
the history of some of these systems

68
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:06,560
you'll see that um they've been around

69
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:09,680
for quite a while uh I myself was a

70
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:13,040
graduate student at MIT I graduated in

71
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,840
1995 so I'm dating myself U but I'm also

72
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,519
dating our administrative systems some

73
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:21,080
of which are as old as I am um and so we

74
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:23,519
you you will see here um our finance

75
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:26,159
system and data warehouse uh application

76
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:29,280
launched in 1986 our student system

77
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:32,080
launched in 1984 our budgeting system

78
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,760
launched in 2001 our HR System somewhere

79
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,439
in the early 2000s and our advancement

80
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:40,680
or fundraising system launched in 2013

81
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:43,000
so um I was brought on board um in

82
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:46,480
September about a little over a year ago

83
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,920
2023 to really uh help to lead an effort

84
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,920
for MIT to modernize and transform and

85
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,079
innovate its internal administrative

86
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,400
systems in order to be able to reduce

87
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:59,159
the administrative burden on the MIT

88
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,959
community so you know our our systems

89
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:03,400
are aging they're they're out of date

90
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:05,239
there hasn't really been a lot of data

91
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,439
governance you know there's I think a

92
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:10,959
wonderful spirit of

93
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:14,239
innovation uh at MIT um which is which

94
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:17,440
is wonderful uh but at the same time um

95
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:21,079
over time uh that needs to be balanced

96
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:24,360
with uh making sure that uh we have um

97
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:26,120
alignment data governance best practices

98
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,960
um and a little bit more structure to

99
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,720
ensure that we avoid duplication of

100
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,720
effort and streamline our

101
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,720
operations so what digital

102
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,440
transformation means to us is not just

103
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:41,199
popping in a new system it's really a

104
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:44,759
holistic engagement with our community

105
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:48,759
on systems processes capacities and

106
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:51,320
support it's also not just customizing

107
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:53,840
the way we do our systems to do things

108
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:55,240
the way we we've always done them and um

109
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,680
if you look at some of the systems that

110
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:00,360
we have in place we have sap for finance

111
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,320
and HR which were implemented some 25

112
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:07,680
years ago um at that time MIT went from

113
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:10,479
a paper based uh set of processes to uh

114
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,800
sap and a lot of it was really just hey

115
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:16,320
I want to do in the system uh things

116
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:20,000
exactly the way I do them on paper today

117
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:23,240
um so not a lot of um streamlining of

118
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,280
processes uh not a lot of trying to to

119
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,280
find

120
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,720
commonalities um and I think that's one

121
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:31,120
of the challenges that MIT has seen over

122
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,479
time is the fact that it's been very

123
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,400
difficult to keep our systems up to dat

124
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:37,039
and upgraded because of the heavy

125
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,280
customization that we placed upon them

126
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,639
25 years ago so we're trying to really

127
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,800
find the right balance between

128
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:47,440
simplification and accommodating unique

129
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:49,919
needs going forward um considered done

130
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,560
as soon as deployed is also not our

131
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,000
approach we want to make sure that we're

132
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:58,039
providing ongoing support across campus

133
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,800
after implementation to ensure uh we uh

134
00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:03,360
maximize the benefit of these changes

135
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,280
changes so our approach if you really

136
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,680
think about the different dimensions or

137
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:12,520
pillars of our approach there's really

138
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:15,199
four key pillars um and these are people

139
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:17,120
process technology and data now you've

140
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,080
probably heard these a number of times

141
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,120
before but what do they really mean to

142
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:24,599
us so from a people perspective it's

143
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:28,000
really about having a robust support

144
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:30,039
model and engaged and able users a lot

145
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,280
of this revolves around providing good

146
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:34,240
training good Communications what's

147
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,599
often referred to as organizational

148
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,919
change management to make sure that the

149
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:41,240
community is supported every step of the

150
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:44,120
way through the change process and there

151
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:46,039
are some methodologies that we leverage

152
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,800
uh there's one called the adcar model

153
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:50,720
which was developed by prosi which walks

154
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,080
through the different stages of change

155
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,800
adoption and that we look to leverage in

156
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,280
order to make sure that the community is

157
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,639
supported every step of the way the

158
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,800
second is around processes so as I

159
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:04,479
talked about before it's really about

160
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:07,160
reexamining and simplifying our business

161
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,599
processes wherever possible um we like

162
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,160
to say that we want our business

163
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:13,440
processes to be as common as possible

164
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,919
but as different as necessary and the

165
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,560
word necessary is really important where

166
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:22,240
we think there are unique needs and

167
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,400
unique um aspects that provide value to

168
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,039
the community then we will we will make

169
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,120
sure that those unique needs are are met

170
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:32,280
otherwise you know as much commonality

171
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,879
as we can can provide um the easier it

172
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,240
will be and the less the administrative

173
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:37,919
burden from a technology perspective

174
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,680
we're looking at seamless Cutting Edge

175
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:43,199
systems to power our administrative

176
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:46,159
functions a lot of these are um U start

177
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:48,280
with off-the-shelf packages uh that are

178
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:50,440
cloud-based software as a service

179
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:53,919
platforms uh we'll talk a little bit

180
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:55,840
also about uh some of the AI related

181
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:58,800
work that we're doing uh with specific

182
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,840
use cases uh because no presentation is

183
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,560
complete without talking about AI these

184
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:06,280
days uh so we'll make sure to cover that

185
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:09,319
as well and then um from a data

186
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:12,280
perspective having access to Salient and

187
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:14,400
understandable data for informed and

188
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,960
enhanced decision-making I think a lot

189
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,960
of the environment right now in the

190
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:21,720
administrative functions at MIT um are

191
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:24,560
focused on reconciling data across a lot

192
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,360
of data sets uh because a lot of systems

193
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,520
either are disjointed or don't talk to

194
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,680
each other so we want to move away from

195
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:34,440
the focus on data reconciliation and

196
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:37,240
validation to really focusing on Data

197
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:41,000
Insights and uh having informed and

198
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:44,080
enhan decision- making through those

199
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,320
insights so what you'll see here is a is

200
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:50,720
a multi-year view of our initial road

201
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:53,440
map that we've developed um on the left

202
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,120
hand side you'll see the various tracks

203
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,760
uh that we've broken them into there

204
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:01,760
there's a total of 16 projects um some

205
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:03,760
of consolid validated into one bar there

206
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,560
um but you'll see that we have a

207
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,600
foundational track which really focuses

208
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,200
on a lot of the work that we plan to do

209
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,519
around data governance reporting and

210
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,959
analytics uh we'll talk more about data

211
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,880
governance but a lot of that is around

212
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:20,600
ensuring that we have common data

213
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,560
definitions you know we have uh five

214
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:25,160
schools and one college and something

215
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,800
like 15 different department labs and

216
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:31,000
centers and institutes at

217
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:32,640
MIT and that can lead to a lot of

218
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,560
different ways of interpreting data a

219
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,519
lot of different ways of defining data

220
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,120
elements so we want to make sure there's

221
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:41,200
consistency across that that's really

222
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,040
foundational um in order to make sure

223
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,000
that we have good uh data and uh that

224
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,079
people are speaking the same language

225
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,079
the other element around data governance

226
00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:51,800
is uh defining data stewardship roles

227
00:09:51,079 --> 00:09:54,279
and

228
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:56,959
responsibilities and those data stewards

229
00:09:54,279 --> 00:10:00,200
will be responsible and accountable for

230
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:02,880
the quality completeness of specific

231
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:06,399
data elements so to the extent that we

232
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:08,200
find issues with specific data elements

233
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,720
we can go back to those data stewards

234
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,000
and make sure that those issues are

235
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:15,720
fixed at the

236
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,680
source um then we look at uh HR um so

237
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,519
we're planning and implementing a new HR

238
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:23,959
payroll solution uh we've been spending

239
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:28,079
the last several months looking at um

240
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:32,040
three platforms sap workday and Oracle

241
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:34,079
um to provide that that uh that platform

242
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:36,320
um and again it's people process

243
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:38,120
technology and data so we often talk

244
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,000
about the systems because it's easier to

245
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:43,959
refer to the systems um but we're we're

246
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,720
looking at that in conjunction with best

247
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:49,279
leveraging best practices around

248
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:53,560
business processes um making sure that

249
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:55,560
we are uh developing um Communications

250
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:58,160
and training capabilities to support our

251
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,760
community Through the change effort and

252
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,760
making sure that we have

253
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,560
good data governance practices in place

254
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,959
for each one of these projects um around

255
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:09,040
the finance space um you'll see we've

256
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,760
pushed off financials and post award

257
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,399
grants management solution a little bit

258
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:14,880
we thought we're already taking on a lot

259
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:17,079
in those first three or four years but

260
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,200
we are looking at the possibility of

261
00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:21,959
trying to bring that forward right now

262
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,920
we have a six to sevene road map we'd

263
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:25,959
like to try to get as much as we can

264
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,399
done within the next four years four to

265
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:30,240
five years to provide the most benefit

266
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,880
to the community so we're actually

267
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:36,120
looking at a possibility of moving that

268
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:38,120
forward in the research space um

269
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:41,000
providing the community with the ability

270
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:44,600
to do research forecasting so to be able

271
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,120
to say if we add another postto to this

272
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,839
grant um how is that going to impact my

273
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,200
grand budget uh when am I going to run

274
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:53,839
out of money doing what if scenario

275
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,880
analysis um that's really uh an

276
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,680
important need for the community we've

277
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:00,639
developed some pilots in that space and

278
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,959
we'll continue to uh further enhance

279
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,639
those those capabilities to do research

280
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,720
forecasting uh we have some new

281
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,240
compliance modules around research that

282
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,880
are going in and then we're going to

283
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,240
focus on a new pre-award grants

284
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:14,800
management solution so this is around

285
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:18,320
really supporting the proposal

286
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:21,160
development um uh process for MIT which

287
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:24,440
is really really critical MIT being such

288
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:26,360
a strong uh research institution uh

289
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,560
everything we can do to really make sure

290
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:31,680
that we have streamlined processes

291
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:34,360
around um uh grants proposal development

292
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:37,480
is is really core uh to the

293
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:39,560
organization from a student perspective

294
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:42,000
uh we currently don't have a Student

295
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:44,360
Success and degree audit solution so

296
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
what does that mean Student Success is

297
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,959
really about making sure that we

298
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,519
identify when students may be at risk

299
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:53,079
and when they may need some additional

300
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:55,320
help where how it's a providing them

301
00:12:53,079 --> 00:12:57,480
with a platform where they can connect

302
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,760
with their advisers and get realtime

303
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:02,360
support um so we don't have a formal

304
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:05,199
platform around that and uh that's

305
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:07,399
really a key priority for us as well as

306
00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:09,199
from a degree auditing perspective how

307
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:11,079
do we make sure that our students are on

308
00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:12,800
track to complete their degree and meet

309
00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:15,279
all of the requirements associated with

310
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,800
their degree within the the expected

311
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:19,959
time frame so that's another area where

312
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:22,160
we're very focused on uh we've been

313
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:23,880
looking at various Platforms in the

314
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,120
marketplace and we're currently

315
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:29,199
evaluating those

316
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:31,519
platforms um and then finally the two

317
00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:33,880
areas uh here at the bottom are around

318
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,720
advancement so this is really our

319
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:38,560
fundraising um platform uh implementing

320
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,000
a new customer relationship management

321
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:44,160
platform to keep track of all of our

322
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,959
alumni um and be able to better connect

323
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:51,079
with our alumni um and other donors uh

324
00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:53,240
through uh those platforms and finally

325
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:55,720
we're developing a new MIT

326
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:58,759
intrnet uh which we're calling Community

327
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:01,560
Home uh so this is a platform where we

328
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:05,000
really want to create a bigger sense of

329
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:07,360
community within MIT I think we do a

330
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,440
really great job of communicating to the

331
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,279
broader Community about all the

332
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,240
interesting uh research that's happening

333
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:16,839
at MIT but how do we make sure that

334
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,600
people are connecting internally as well

335
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:21,839
identifying those places where um they

336
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:25,680
can leverage each other's areas of

337
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:29,440
expertise and uh find out how to uh

338
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:32,639
connect so um as you can see a lot of

339
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:36,519
work uh over the next uh especially 3 or

340
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:39,600
four years um but um we're we're excited

341
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:42,000
about uh the the journey uh and and the

342
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,160
leap forward that MIT will take now a

343
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
lot of these projects take two to three

344
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,160
years to implement so how do we make

345
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,880
sure that we balance that with shorter

346
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:54,759
term quick wins and and improvements and

347
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:56,480
of course this is where AI comes in um

348
00:14:54,759 --> 00:15:00,120
so we've recently kicked off two

349
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:03,000
workstream relating to um AI in

350
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:06,199
administration and operations um the

351
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:09,240
first one is partnering with MIT faculty

352
00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:11,240
from mit's computer science and AI lab

353
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,759
as well as from the Sloan School of

354
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:16,399
Management um we're very fortunate to

355
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:20,519
have Simon Johnson who is a recent Nobel

356
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:21,880
Prize uh uh Laur winner um from the SL

357
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:25,240
School of Management who's part of our

358
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:28,399
working group on AI uh really studying

359
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:29,480
um how AI will impact uh the future of

360
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,839
work

361
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:34,959
um and this is you know MIT is is a

362
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,800
great use case uh internally for that

363
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:39,560
understanding how a lot of the work that

364
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:43,600
we're doing around leveraging AI will

365
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:46,160
help to streamline Administration and uh

366
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,720
operations um and that first working

367
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,880
group will help to establish some

368
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,759
guidelines around responsible and

369
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,680
ethical use of AI and and other things

370
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:56,600
we'll talk about more in the next slide

371
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,560
and then the second working group um is

372
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,040
around focusing and identifying and

373
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,360
deployment

374
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:04,959
um aib based systems that could lead to

375
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:07,519
high impact improvements in these areas

376
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:09,040
so the community has already submitted

377
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,639
we we kicked just kicked this off a

378
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,839
couple of months ago we've already

379
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:16,240
gotten over 30 different use cases uh

380
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,319
from the community that we're evaluating

381
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,800
and determining uh which ones we're

382
00:16:18,319 --> 00:16:23,199
going to move forward with so the first

383
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:25,680
working group we're calling setting the

384
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:28,160
foundation and this is where you know we

385
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,720
do have a unique opportunity at MIT

386
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,440
because we have such great research

387
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,680
that's happening in the space such

388
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:37,680
leading research we want to make sure

389
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:41,360
that uh we leverage um that uh research

390
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:43,839
in defining our AI Vision developing our

391
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,959
strategy um planning and prioritizing

392
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:48,399
the work that we do and making sure that

393
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:50,199
we can measure uh the benefits that

394
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:54,279
we're going to get from these AI use

395
00:16:50,199 --> 00:16:55,880
cases so um we are focusing on

396
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:58,120
understanding the technical complexities

397
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:01,480
involved in pursuing these opportunities

398
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:03,160
including legal constraints and uh

399
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,760
making sure that we evaluate potential

400
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:07,319
pitfalls I think a lot of people have

401
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:10,400
heard about AI

402
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:14,280
hallucinations uh and other challenges

403
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:16,720
um including uh bias in AI so our

404
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:19,079
faculty members are making sure that we

405
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,760
are um really taking those things into

406
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:23,280
consideration as we look at these use

407
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:24,640
cases and understand the implications of

408
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:28,360
implementing AI within our

409
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:30,240
administrative areas um and you know

410
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:32,360
really provide us with guidance around

411
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,280
policies and security and privacy

412
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:38,520
considerations as well so this is really

413
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:41,600
around setting that core Foundation

414
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:44,400
which will help to really uh advise the

415
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,760
second working group um which is really

416
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,840
we're calling high impact opportunities

417
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:52,440
and this is where we're focused more on

418
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:54,280
evaluating value versus cost and risk

419
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:57,679
and if you look at that chart it means

420
00:17:54,280 --> 00:18:01,320
everything from simple tasks like

421
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:04,280
automating exist listing tasks through

422
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:06,880
embedded assistance and co-pilots um

423
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:08,679
copy generation coding assistance in

424
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,039
fact a lot of the software as a service

425
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:13,360
platforms that we're looking at today

426
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:15,400
are making significant investments in

427
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:19,080
their platforms for example on HR

428
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:24,080
payroll helping with u reviewing resumés

429
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:26,520
and providing um um feedback on uh those

430
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:29,360
resumés and and evaluating them against

431
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:32,120
job descriptions or things such such as

432
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:34,200
creating new job descriptions as opposed

433
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:36,520
to having to start from scratch really

434
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,840
being able to put in a few key words of

435
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:41,360
what you're looking for and it can

436
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,840
really help you to get a head start on

437
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,600
developing those job descriptions so

438
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:47,200
there's a lot of opportunities to

439
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:49,080
leverage AI as part of the the software

440
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,840
as a service solutions and we're

441
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:53,320
evaluating those things as well if we

442
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,760
know something's coming uh a couple of

443
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:57,000
years down the line does it make sense

444
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,919
for us to build our own probably not

445
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,960
unless we have a dire need for it so

446
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:03,880
we're really going to focus on use cases

447
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:06,360
on areas where we think there's really

448
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:08,159
uh quick wins and high value for

449
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:10,360
relatively little effort and that's how

450
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:13,039
we're evaluating all of those those

451
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:16,280
requests um so de we're developing

452
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:18,520
business cases um to identify those

453
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,960
Pilots that we're going to focus on we'd

454
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:22,640
rather focus on a few key Pilots that we

455
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,440
think are going to provide high value to

456
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:28,960
the community rather than spreading

457
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:32,919
ourselves too thin um and uh we are

458
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:34,799
going to uh leverage the the the the

459
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:38,039
guidelines that we're getting from the

460
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:41,120
first working group to really uh advise

461
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:43,200
on um the use cases that we're going to

462
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,360
select here so we're very excited about

463
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,520
this work we're starting the journey uh

464
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:50,000
we're also bringing in guest speakers

465
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,919
from other organizations uh we have the

466
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,960
CIO of Harvard who's speaking to the

467
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:55,600
group they're a little bit ahead of us

468
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:57,640
uh they've been doing some of this work

469
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,400
for a year or so they have some great

470
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,159
Lessons Learned they have some great use

471
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,000
cases that they've implemented they've

472
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:04,400
seen what's worked what's not worked so

473
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,880
we're looking to leverage that

474
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,559
experience as well um so it's an

475
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:12,440
exciting journey and it's important for

476
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:14,480
MIT to uh to make sure that we're uh

477
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:16,720
we're along for that Journey uh and

478
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,000
leveraging the the capabilities of AI

479
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,120
it's it's not very often that you get a

480
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,559
chance in the administrative world to

481
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,400
really leverage some of the research

482
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:27,120
that's going on in the academic world

483
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,720
and this is a unique opportunity where

484
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,000
we can do that so we're quite excited

485
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,000
about

486
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:41,240
that in terms of um the the benefits

487
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:44,120
that these projects and this Innovation

488
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,799
is going to provide to the community um

489
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,880
you know we think about we I've talked a

490
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:50,240
lot about the administrative side of

491
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:52,280
things but the administrators are not

492
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,600
really are not the only group that are

493
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:56,840
going to benefit from this it's really

494
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:59,120
ultimately about reducing the

495
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:02,200
administrative burden on the entire

496
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:06,240
community and that includes faculty and

497
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:09,159
students so what does that mean well um

498
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:11,760
it means that U you know faculty will be

499
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:13,919
able to get reports more quickly they'll

500
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,480
be able to get better insights from

501
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:18,480
those reports because their

502
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:20,039
administrators will be able to focus on

503
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,880
uh developing insights as opposed to

504
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:23,799
spending a lot of time manipulating data

505
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:26,760
reconciling data as I said

506
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:29,159
earlier um and and provide greater

507
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:33,159
efficiency to the community as a result

508
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:36,200
some specific examples of that are in um

509
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:38,080
improving the research planning process

510
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:40,120
um so providing enhanced tools for

511
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,640
forecasting research expenses against

512
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:45,679
budgets I mentioned the example of like

513
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:47,919
adding a postdoc to a grant and

514
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:50,679
understanding when that Grant uh will

515
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:53,039
run out of money for example as a result

516
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:56,760
um it also revolves around more accurate

517
00:21:53,039 --> 00:22:01,440
budgeting and planning um for faculty um

518
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:04,799
to look at uh you know when um these

519
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:07,320
various uh you know how do we how do we

520
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:12,039
leverage um the need for control and

521
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:14,080
accuracy while balancing uh our budgets

522
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:17,320
um automated proposal management that's

523
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,799
really key uh better workflows and

524
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:22,120
collaboration Tools around the

525
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:24,679
development of project proposals um and

526
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:26,760
providing um uh fewer bottlenecks in the

527
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:29,320
grand application process so making it

528
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,679
easier and faster for for us to secure

529
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:34,679
those

530
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:37,360
grants it's also uh from um a

531
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:39,799
centralized funding overview perspective

532
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:42,120
it's looking at a place where faculty

533
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:44,480
can easily see how to map people to

534
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:46,320
funding sources including detailed

535
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:50,080
insights into the researchers that are

536
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:52,120
appointed to each research Grant um it's

537
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,159
from a student perspective providing

538
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,520
more holistic student advising I was

539
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:58,960
giving the example of the Student

540
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:00,880
Success platform um so enabling uh

541
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,159
students to progress through their

542
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,799
degree more quickly have more visibility

543
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:08,799
have more support um early student

544
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:11,640
intervention tools for atrisk students

545
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,720
um and then finally streamline Student

546
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,080
Success

547
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,799
communication um throughout their

548
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:18,360
academic careers uh through the

549
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,559
development of some of these tools as

550
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:23,039
well so even though we we talk a lot

551
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:25,679
about how do we make administrators

552
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:27,880
worlds easier how do we increase

553
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:30,840
efficiency and productivity within the

554
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:34,840
administration function there are direct

555
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:36,760
relationships and impacts to how our

556
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,840
community including our faculty and our

557
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:41,159
students are going to benefit from a lot

558
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,159
of those

559
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:49,440
improvements so um what is my role in

560
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:51,520
all this and my team's role um so the

561
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:54,919
the digital transformation team which is

562
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:59,120
the team that I lead really tries to

563
00:23:54,919 --> 00:24:02,159
direct um the organization to uh really

564
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:04,200
focus on modernizing systems and our

565
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:07,039
business processes so we really act as a

566
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:09,440
funnel to try to focus resources on the

567
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:12,320
work ahead that's required to provide

568
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:16,520
expertise on best practices that we've

569
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:19,159
seen both across um the uh higher red

570
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:20,400
industry as well as other Industries um

571
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:22,880
I spent a lot of time working in

572
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,440
financial services in the past um and

573
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:29,200
I've seen best practices across both

574
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:32,440
Industries um to really help Drive the

575
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:34,960
successful execution of pretty complex

576
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:37,679
projects as you saw we're taking on five

577
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,799
tracks of really kind of heavy uh

578
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:41,880
projects and complex projects with a lot

579
00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:44,240
of interdependencies and interactions

580
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:46,080
across those various tracks so making

581
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,320
sure that we keep track of all that

582
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,360
identify those interdependencies making

583
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,360
sure everybody's connected making sure

584
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:55,679
everybody understand what comes next and

585
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:57,720
what role they need to play in that and

586
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:00,480
understanding how their day-to-day work

587
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:03,880
will change right so when we talk about

588
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:06,960
the future of work um post digital

589
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:08,960
transformation and the use of AI I get

590
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,240
that question a lot is what will my job

591
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:14,399
look like uh in five years once we're

592
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:17,240
done with this and really the goal is to

593
00:25:14,399 --> 00:25:19,960
uh enable people to focus on higher

594
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:22,360
value added activities and let some of

595
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:24,679
the technology and some of the AI take

596
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:26,880
on some of the more administrative tasks

597
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:28,880
that they're doing today um so again

598
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:32,240
people can focus on insight

599
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:35,159
and more complex analysis rather than on

600
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,720
repetitive administrative tasks um and

601
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:39,919
then really making sure that the whole

602
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:42,840
Community is engaged so as we looked at

603
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:46,159
new platforms for our finance HR and

604
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:49,039
payroll platforms we engaged over 400

605
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:51,200
members of the MIT community in demos

606
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:53,919
over this past summer to make sure that

607
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,960
we could make to to get their input and

608
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:58,960
feedback on where they felt that uh

609
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,960
these various platforms could add value

610
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,240
to their day-to-day work and what their

611
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,679
preference were across those platforms

612
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:07,279
so Community engagement is really key

613
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:09,360
especially in high right it's a highly

614
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:11,720
decentralized environment and we want to

615
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,960
make sure everybody feels like they're

616
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:16,440
part of the journey and not the

617
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:18,559
transformation journey is being done

618
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:21,159
onto themselves but really they're

619
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:24,679
they're part of it every step of the way

620
00:26:21,159 --> 00:26:28,720
so um there are four core disciplines

621
00:26:24,679 --> 00:26:30,279
that go along with uh providing uh the

622
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,640
the the services that I mentioned

623
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:35,399
earlier and those are project governance

624
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,559
and project management business process

625
00:26:35,399 --> 00:26:40,200
Improvement organizational change

626
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:42,440
management and data governance analytics

627
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:45,120
and business intelligence and those are

628
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:48,880
really the four key pillars of what my

629
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:51,240
organization does and brings to to the

630
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,880
table um I'm not going to go through all

631
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,399
the sub bullets here but just to kind of

632
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,919
give you a flavor of each one I've

633
00:26:54,399 --> 00:26:58,360
talked about some of these already from

634
00:26:56,919 --> 00:27:00,600
a project governance and project

635
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:02,080
management perspective it's around um

636
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:04,960
establishing a clear governance

637
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,440
structure making sure that we have good

638
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,919
escalation procedures and

639
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:12,679
decision-making processes um identifying

640
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:14,760
and clearly communicating team roles and

641
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:17,440
responsibilities overseeing scope

642
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:19,840
schedule and budget actively managing

643
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,760
those risks using agile methodologies

644
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,200
wherever possible from a business

645
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,760
process Improvement it's making sure

646
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:29,240
that we're looking at processes end to

647
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:31,000
end it's very easy to um uh look at a

648
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:33,440
process but only really look at a part

649
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,200
of the process and try to optimize that

650
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,159
I kind of call it squeezing the balloon

651
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,360
at one end if you're only optimizing a

652
00:27:37,159 --> 00:27:42,039
part of the process you risk actually

653
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,600
making things worse Downstream um so

654
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:47,080
it's really important to look at those

655
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:48,640
processes end to end um and again

656
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:51,000
finding the right balance between

657
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:53,240
simplification and accommodating unique

658
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,399
needs uh from a change management

659
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:58,600
perspective I've talked about um

660
00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:01,640
targeted Communications

661
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:04,360
making sure that we um uh provide

662
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:06,960
continuous support we'll use metrics to

663
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:09,279
track adoption and make sure that once

664
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,480
we've implemented change the change

665
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:13,919
sticks and people don't revert back to

666
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:15,760
the old ways of doing things uh which is

667
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:17,600
always a risk from a change management

668
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,120
perspective and then from a data

669
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,519
governance reporting and analytics

670
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:24,360
perspective I talked about establishing

671
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:27,000
a robust data governance model aligning

672
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:29,440
and common data definitions establishing

673
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,320
data Steward and data trustee roles and

674
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:36,000
responsibilities to make sure we have

675
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:37,480
complete accurate uh data um and um

676
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,399
making sure that we're providing the

677
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:42,000
community with flexible Tools around

678
00:28:39,399 --> 00:28:42,000
reporting and

679
00:28:43,399 --> 00:28:48,880
analytics um so from a just to emphasize

680
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:50,679
that point you know we're really

681
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:53,039
focusing from a data governance

682
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:55,159
perspective on making sure we have data

683
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:57,399
informed decisions that we have

684
00:28:55,159 --> 00:29:00,080
centralized access to data with common

685
00:28:57,399 --> 00:29:01,519
data definition and enhanced support

686
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:04,799
those are some of the foundational

687
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:07,399
pieces that will ensure um that we build

688
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:10,880
a robust business intelligence and

689
00:29:07,399 --> 00:29:13,440
analytics suite and a community of data

690
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:16,440
informed decisionmaking going

691
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:18,279
forward so there's a lot of work uh

692
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:21,000
ahead of us uh to go through this

693
00:29:18,279 --> 00:29:24,240
transformation Journey um we're looking

694
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,519
to uh really innovate in the space of uh

695
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,360
leveraging AI to keep our community

696
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:31,440
engaged and excited and providing them

697
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:36,080
with quick wins every step of the way um

698
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:38,679
we have some pretty uh ambitious plans

699
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:41,120
looking at people process technology and

700
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:43,720
data um and making sure that all four of

701
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:46,000
those dimensions are aligned um as I

702
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:47,559
talked about you know we need to make

703
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,320
sure from a people perspective that we

704
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:52,120
have solid governance and sponsorship we

705
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:55,080
need to make sure also that our key

706
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:56,480
subject matter experts are available to

707
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,720
participate in the transformation

708
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,320
activities and one of the things we're

709
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:01,760
doing is really looking at who are those

710
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,600
subject matter experts across the

711
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,360
community and how do we make sure that

712
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,720
we free them up to participate in this

713
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,279
work they have a day job today so how do

714
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:11,519
we make sure we can create enough

715
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:15,640
bandwidth either through backfill

716
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:18,159
resources um through uh various um uh

717
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:21,080
compensation programs through in some

718
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:23,840
cases bringing in retirees who have

719
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:26,320
recently left MIT um because MIT has

720
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:28,799
such a complex environment of systems

721
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:30,559
and processes today it takes a long time

722
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:32,600
to bring somebody from the outside and

723
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:34,720
ramp them up the learning curve so

724
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:36,279
that's one of our big challenges is how

725
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,480
do we make sure that we free up our

726
00:30:36,279 --> 00:30:40,679
subject matter experts but we only have

727
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,559
a limited amount of time to bring new

728
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:44,720
people in and get them up the learning

729
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:46,919
curve so the idea of bringing back

730
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,440
retirees part-time who can act as

731
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:50,480
rotational resource provide more

732
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:53,440
bandwidth that's already worked in a

733
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:56,720
couple of areas where we've piloted that

734
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:59,279
um and provide change management support

735
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:01,120
uh every step of the way including what

736
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:03,639
is our ongoing support model going to

737
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:06,679
look like so you know we talk about new

738
00:31:03,639 --> 00:31:09,360
technology I think technology is a great

739
00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:11,600
um enabler for business transformation

740
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:13,279
but we really need to think about what

741
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,679
how do we improve the quality of the

742
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:16,600
services that we provide to the

743
00:31:14,679 --> 00:31:18,639
community how do we need to in some

744
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:20,799
cases restructure our internal

745
00:31:18,639 --> 00:31:22,559
departments and organizations to make

746
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:24,639
sure that we're providing high quality

747
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:27,600
service and how do we measure that going

748
00:31:24,639 --> 00:31:28,880
forward how long should it take for a

749
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,639
particular particular service to be

750
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,000
provided to the community establishing

751
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:34,559
service level agreements for example to

752
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,360
be able to measure that how long does it

753
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:38,240
take today what do we think it should

754
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,679
take and then measuring the improvements

755
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,360
that we've done once we've actually

756
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:43,440
implemented the new

757
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:45,320
transformation um from a process

758
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,279
perspective I talked about end to-end

759
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:50,720
processes common as possible different

760
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:53,000
as necessary approach um technology

761
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,760
using the AI to really enable us to get

762
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,480
quick wins leveraging best-in-class Erp

763
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:00,360
technology platforms and finally

764
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,080
from a data perspective establishing

765
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:03,240
those common data definitions and those

766
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,559
data stewardship roles and

767
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:10,559
responsibilities so we're excited about

768
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:13,080
the Leap Forward um and uh uh really uh

769
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:17,279
you know uh partnering with the entire

770
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:20,840
Community to really bring MIT to uh the

771
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:23,159
same level of quality and Innovation uh

772
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:25,240
that we have in our research and

773
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:28,519
academic Enterprises to our

774
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:30,720
administrative Enterprise

775
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:30,720
thank

776
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:38,880
you thank you Reno so much for a great

777
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:41,080
talk there's a couple of questions that

778
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,399
have come up here I guess I I'll read

779
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:45,080
them to try to facilitate getting four

780
00:32:43,399 --> 00:32:47,320
votes glad you are collaborating with

781
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:50,080
the other school in Cambridge why not

782
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:53,000
toine problems for startups to solve

783
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:55,080
instead of old systems like workday

784
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,480
invest in problems to be

785
00:32:55,080 --> 00:33:01,519
solved yeah so that's a good question I

786
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:03,399
think um you know there are uh we're

787
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:07,320
trying to find the right balance between

788
00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:11,159
what I would call buy versus build uh

789
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:13,480
and so um when you look at um some of

790
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:18,480
the platforms that I talked about like

791
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:20,279
work day and Oracle and sap um there are

792
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:23,960
uh there's a lot of there's a tremendous

793
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:26,720
amount of investment being um uh put in

794
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:28,559
by these companies to stay relevant and

795
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,320
modernize their platform form so when we

796
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:34,519
talk about AI a lot of AI advances that

797
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:38,760
are being built into work into workday

798
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:41,039
um uh oral Etc service now Salesforce a

799
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:43,799
lot of the big platforms out there and

800
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:45,600
so uh there are some cases where it

801
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:47,960
doesn't make sense for us to invest in

802
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,760
building our own Solutions because these

803
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:51,519
are

804
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:54,360
industry um uh platforms that are built

805
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:56,880
on best practices and where there's uh

806
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:59,200
so much investment being put in to their

807
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,639
road map over the next several years

808
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,559
that you know we wouldn't be able to

809
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:04,679
match that level of investment and keep

810
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:07,720
up with modern technology in the same

811
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:11,200
way um while in other areas that I think

812
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:14,839
are more Niche and unique to um the

813
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:17,679
needs of MIT uh there are opportunities

814
00:34:14,839 --> 00:34:19,679
there to focus on um you know

815
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:23,119
potentially leveraging startup

816
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:26,040
activities and uh finding unique and and

817
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:27,879
modern and and Innovative and more agile

818
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:30,480
ways to solve some of those problems so

819
00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:33,079
we're trying to find that right balance

820
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:36,159
U between leveraging established

821
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:39,159
companies that will continue to innovate

822
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:41,960
um in some of the core areas but also

823
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:44,240
finding those areas where we can get you

824
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:47,159
know a competitive advantage through

825
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:49,599
leveraging smaller more agile startup

826
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:50,960
companies just a quick comment too here

827
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:52,119
on that same question maybe you've

828
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:56,159
touched on this already but have you

829
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:56,159
ever considered using an open source

830
00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:01,680
approach yes so I I that's part of what

831
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:04,440
we're looking at as well when we look at

832
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:07,440
some of the the smaller uh organizations

833
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:12,760
and the areas where we might be able to

834
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:14,400
um uh leverage uh unique uh Solutions is

835
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:18,000
is leveraging op Source data where it

836
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:20,160
makes sense great thanks our next

837
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,040
question is from innovator when

838
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,520
designing innovative business processes

839
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:25,320
through digital

840
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:29,640
transformation what is the most

841
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:29,640
important factor to consider in the ini

842
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:37,440
stage yeah so I think you know it's it's

843
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:41,359
really key to think about the fact that

844
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:43,359
uh again we don't want uh in many cases

845
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:44,440
what we'll do is we don't want to start

846
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:47,599
with

847
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:51,079
necessarily um documenting the current

848
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:53,200
state um the old way of doing things was

849
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:55,440
you document your current state you

850
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:58,680
define your future State and then you do

851
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:00,839
an Asis to 2B map mapping and you

852
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:03,520
identify where those key areas of

853
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:05,760
differences are um the problem is when

854
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:08,280
you've got 150 Department lab centers

855
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,280
and institutes and a lot of do a lot of

856
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:12,200
them are doing things their own way it

857
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:14,520
would take you two years to document all

858
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:16,079
of the current ways of doing things uh

859
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:19,160
and by the time you're done documenting

860
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:21,200
them they've changed uh so instead what

861
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:25,040
we do is we really focus on best

862
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:28,160
practice uh PL uh processes to start off

863
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:30,200
with um and uh we bring our subject

864
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:33,359
matter experts who know how things are

865
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:36,040
done today and we walk through with them

866
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:38,359
what the best practices are and then we

867
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:41,680
talk about where we think there's going

868
00:36:38,359 --> 00:36:44,000
to be change and change impact and

869
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:46,839
really have them participate in saying

870
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,160
hey that's not how we do things today

871
00:36:46,839 --> 00:36:51,480
and then we can question okay well why

872
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:54,240
are we doing things that way today is it

873
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:55,920
because there is valid uniqueness is it

874
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:59,440
some regulatory requirement that we need

875
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:01,720
to meet um or is it more because we've

876
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:04,240
done it like that for the last 25 years

877
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:06,240
and we're really wanting to challenge

878
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:09,560
the way people think about the way they

879
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:13,000
do their processes today um CH challenge

880
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:15,640
the status quo um and really drill in to

881
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:19,480
understand how can we create as much

882
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:21,520
efficiency as we can um in uh designing

883
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:24,280
the future state for our business

884
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:27,200
processes um so I think that's the most

885
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:30,800
important is really coming at it with a

886
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:33,359
uh um an open mindset uh and thinking

887
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:35,920
about looking at things with a fresh

888
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:39,160
perspective of what's you know what's

889
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:41,720
best practice um rather than just kind

890
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:43,599
of you know carrying maybe some of the

891
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:46,319
baggage that we have from the way we've

892
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:48,720
done things over the last 20 25 years

893
00:37:46,319 --> 00:37:50,560
fair enough fair enough thanks okay I

894
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,880
think we have time for one question I'm

895
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:55,440
gonna see a sort of thread here in some

896
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:57,200
of the questions having to do with uh

897
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:59,880
resistance so I'm going to read this

898
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,880
question question

899
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:06,720
here see um how excuse me digital

900
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:09,160
transformation impacts both work

901
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:11,160
processes and organizational culture

902
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:13,599
often causing employee resistance how

903
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:15,760
can such resistance be effectively manag

904
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:17,520
and and any hints you have from uh the

905
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,599
home crowd here at MIT if you have any

906
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:22,520
stories that'd be great too yeah yeah oh

907
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:26,119
no this is a great topic and um you know

908
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:28,200
just like uh AI when you say Ai and you

909
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:30,079
talk about leveraging AI

910
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,839
um to many people it sounds great to a

911
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:33,880
lot of people it's very scary right

912
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:36,560
because it means what how is my job

913
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:41,560
going to change am I going to be able to

914
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:45,160
adapt to leveraging new technology um so

915
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:47,200
um we we do follow um so so

916
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:49,480
organizational change management is

917
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:51,200
really the reason I talk about people

918
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:53,400
process technology and data and I always

919
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:55,960
talk about people first is because the

920
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:58,040
hardest part is the people part uh and

921
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:00,359
it's all about organizational change

922
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:02,880
management um and I mentioned I

923
00:39:00,359 --> 00:39:05,440
referenced a model that we use which is

924
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:09,400
a prosize atar model and that's an

925
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:11,839
acronym for awareness desire knowledge

926
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:14,920
ability and reinforcement and those are

927
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:16,640
the five stages of change adoption so

928
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:19,200
what that means is first you want to

929
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:23,280
make people aware of why are we doing

930
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:25,680
this right um and then with that comes

931
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,520
the next phase which is desire so you

932
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,440
want to get people excited about what

933
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,880
the future is going to look like you

934
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,319
want to get them excited about the fact

935
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:35,079
that they're not going to have to do as

936
00:39:32,319 --> 00:39:38,160
many administrative repetitive tasks um

937
00:39:35,079 --> 00:39:40,960
our goal is to really enable people and

938
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:42,839
support them through um these different

939
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,480
ways of working and leveraging this new

940
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:46,119
technology we want everybody to still

941
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:49,520
have a job we want them to have a better

942
00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:51,640
job uh at the end of this process um so

943
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,720
building that desire in people is

944
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:55,440
important and then giving them the

945
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:56,720
knowledge of how are we going to get

946
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,920
there and we're going to get there

947
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:01,160
together and these are the steps of how

948
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:03,359
we're going to get there um and then

949
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:04,599
giving them the ability to get there so

950
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:06,200
now we've told you how we're going to

951
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:08,599
get there but now we need to give you

952
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:10,640
the skills to get there right so we're

953
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:12,119
going to train you we're going to hold

954
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,920
your hand every step of the way we're

955
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:17,000
going to make sure that you're feeling

956
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:19,359
comfortable um and we're not going to

957
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,160
move forward until you know you've been

958
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:23,160
trained you feel comfortable you

959
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:27,839
understand how your role is going to

960
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:29,240
change um and um

961
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:31,359
uh and then you have really

962
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:34,000
reinforcement is the last stage of the

963
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:35,520
outar model and reinforcement is once

964
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,240
we've implemented the new ways of

965
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,000
working how do we make sure that you

966
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:40,440
don't revert back to the old ways of

967
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,880
doing things how do we make sure to

968
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:45,880
