00:00:04,437 --> 00:00:06,770
BRIAN SCHAGEN: We're on this
bridge in Great Barrington.

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:09,590
This bridge has a
very large history

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:11,543
with repairs and maintenance.

5
00:00:11,543 --> 00:00:13,460
HADEN QUINLAN: So the
problem in Massachusetts

6
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:14,940
is very significant.

7
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,290
There's about 2,200 bridges that
need some sort of repair to be

8
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:20,720
done in the near future.

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,970
BRIAN SCHAGEN: As you can
see, the corrosion is still

10
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:26,150
very visible in this bridge.

11
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:28,970
SIMOS GERASIMIDIS: And we're
going to try to apply a new

12
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:32,810
technology called Cold Spray,
which is sort of a 3D printing

13
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:37,590
technology of metals on a bridge
to try to repair corroded parts.

14
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,530
One other advantage is
that we can be very local.

15
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:41,857
We can scan the beam.

16
00:00:41,857 --> 00:00:43,440
We know exactly where
it has corroded,

17
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,660
and we can go to these
particular places and spray.

18
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,610
We don't need to do
a whole big plate.

19
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,010
We don't have to encase
big stuff in concrete.

20
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,500
We can be very
localized, very precise.

21
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,460
HADEN QUINLAN: We accelerate
particles, so powder.

22
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:56,490
Powdered steel.

23
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:59,010
Accelerate it to a very,
very high velocity,

24
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,550
and then use an
applicator to spray

25
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:04,190
that metal onto a
corroded element

26
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,090
to restore thickness
to that element,

27
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,790
and also restore
structural capacities

28
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:09,570
necessary for the
bridge to operate.

29
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:10,220
SIMOS GERASIMIDIS:
This is a problem

30
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:11,730
that every state is facing.

31
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:13,350
The resources are very limited.

32
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,227
It's a huge thing, in
terms of efficiency.

33
00:01:15,227 --> 00:01:17,810
CHENGBO ALI: We think that this
is the most cost-effective way

34
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:19,050
for repairing bridges.

35
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:21,690
And then the reality of
repairing thousands of bridges,

36
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:24,110
I think billions of
dollars will be saved.

37
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:27,170
RICHARD COOK: It's just an
exciting time in manufacturing

38
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,550
in the state of Massachusetts.
