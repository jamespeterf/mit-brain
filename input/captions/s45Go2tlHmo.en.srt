14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:40,480
>> Okay. So, so today we've got uh a guest

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:44,840
panel uh of folks from uh the education

16
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,840
arcade uh folks from

17
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,640
news network uh which is actually very

18
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:53,280
closely related. Um these are folks uh

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,920
the the is the comparative media studies

20
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,199
uh research group over based in the in

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,960
the old media lab building where I'm

22
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,920
working right now. Um and you work with

23
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,320
the shadow uh teacher education program.

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,760
Um for folks who are unaware of of this

25
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,119
MIT actually has a teacher education

26
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,159
program. If you want to be like a

27
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,520
certified teacher uh to teach uh I guess

28
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,360
>> middle school math and I not middle

29
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,439
school, secondary math and science.

30
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,960
>> Um then that you can take classes and

31
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,400
basically get your certification or

32
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,200
apply for your certification at the end

33
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:24,000
of all those classes. Um but then they

34
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,720
also make games. They uh they they make

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,439
augmented reality games using uh

36
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:33,040
portable devices like like iPhones and

37
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:34,720
uh and PCs. uh games that run on flash

38
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,840
um together with campus to prototype

39
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,280
stuff before and uh focusing a lot on

40
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,720
games for learning. So the education arc

41
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,079
is the research group learning the

42
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,079
learning games network is kind of like

43
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:47,920
the spin-off company of the education

44
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:49,840
arcade that basically sort of works on

45
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,240
uh on projects that will be too

46
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,759
expensive to do inside universities

47
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:58,799
because universities are really

48
00:01:53,759 --> 00:02:03,479
inefficient. Um anyway um maybe some uh

49
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,479
can you get start introducing yourself

50
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,679
I'm the latest in the group. So okay

51
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,720
yeah hi I'm Constantine. I come from

52
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:17,120
Austria. I'm at the moment researcher at

53
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:19,200
the education and um so I come from an I

54
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,520
I'd say I'd come from an I come from an

55
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,520
educational background. So I did my PhD

56
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,599
on on learning through failure, learning

57
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,800
through mistakes. And I kind of like

58
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:31,040
worked on on theories that explain why

59
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,400
we why we learn through mistakes and why

60
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,840
we most of the time don't want to learn

61
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,879
through failure. But in games we think

62
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,480
it's really funny or entertaining or or

63
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:42,640
challenging. So I was really interested

64
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,720
in how games um can be tools to um

65
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,400
understand learning and also is it

66
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,480
possible or this is like one of my

67
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,959
research questions. Is it possible that

68
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,800
people maybe learn who play games how to

69
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,280
cope with failure better like even be

70
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,120
more open to realize maybe sometimes in

71
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,000
life we make failure and our

72
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,879
expectations are not true or sometimes

73
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,560
not maybe they're wrong so I do um

74
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,840
research on a theoretical level with

75
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,959
that and um do um interviews with

76
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,800
players on learning demographies how um

77
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,599
learning experiences through games were

78
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:19,680
important in their lives and in in the

79
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:21,440
summer um I was um happy to um for for

80
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,120
and designing a game in the summer

81
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,040
workshop. Maybe they heard about that

82
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,519
anyway or not.

83
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,599
>> Okay, so it's just like I had um eight

84
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,480
weeks I was product owner on a team and

85
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:35,599
kind of like my theory was was used as

86
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:39,440
basis to develop a game a learning game

87
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:41,360
um called Afterland. Um of course it's

88
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,920
free online

89
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,640
um and I think our students did a really

90
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,519
good job on that game and it's it's a

91
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,879
platformer where um I will not tell you

92
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,599
what's about because then I would ruin

93
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,599
it. But there is twist.

94
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,840
>> Yes. And um and what I'm going to do now

95
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:02,720
in the next um year is um as it looks at

96
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,200
I I join game for a few months and do

97
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,799
research on how the game um is used by

98
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,720
players, how they learn in the game, how

99
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:12,560
they reflect on the game and I would use

100
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:16,040
I would work and hopefully even elderly

101
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,040
people on that.

102
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,440
Very good.

103
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:25,199
Hi, I'm Dan Roy. I'm a CMS alum. I did a

104
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,800
master's and finished in 07.

105
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,520
Worked with Philip a little bit here and

106
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,720
there. Um, mostly I worked with the

107
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:35,520
education arcade during my time at CMS

108
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,800
and with Scott

109
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,639
and we worked on a project called lure

110
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,639
of the labyrinth which you may have

111
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:47,440
heard of. It teaches middle school math

112
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:50,080
and literacy skills particularly to

113
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,960
But I believe to anyone who's interested

114
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,280
>> free online.

115
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,759
>> Free and online. Yeah. So go play.

116
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,759
Better than after.

117
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,560
>> Just trying to keep it interesting.

118
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,320
>> Is there a twist?

119
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,560
>> Is there a twist?

120
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,080
>> Yes. Well,

121
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,080
>> not as good a twist as we originally

122
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,080
wanted.

123
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,080
>> There was a twist in the development

124
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,080
process.

125
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:23,919
So that one was uh funded by the

126
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,080
department of education and that's the

127
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:29,039
it was a larger scale project but the

128
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,639
grant didn't go to MIT it went to

129
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:35,199
Maryland public television. So that was

130
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:36,720
part of the I believe the impetus for

131
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:41,360
the spin-off of the learning games

132
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:44,320
network is to have a structure that can

133
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:47,199
accommodate

134
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:50,000
the sorts of larger scale projects and

135
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,840
think about them in more sustainable

136
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,160
ways. But I'll let Scott talk about

137
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,479
that. Um

138
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,680
so

139
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:02,240
how did I get into this?

140
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:06,400
Um my interest in learning games is

141
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:09,919
mostly around engagement.

142
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:12,720
I feel like people who are extremely

143
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,319
motivated and enthralled with a

144
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,520
particular subject will find a way to

145
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:20,160
learn it and that a game may or may not

146
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,000
be the best way to learn anything in

147
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,680
particular.

148
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,240
but that there are many people out there

149
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:29,919
who struggle to get interested in a

150
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:33,440
topic if they're even trying and that a

151
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:37,199
game can be useful there. So as a an

152
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:40,319
exploratory tool say well I never really

153
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:42,160
thought about history but I like this

154
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,479
game and I want to spend some time with

155
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,240
it and I want to be good at it and it's

156
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,560
social

157
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,560
now I'm finding myself asking the kinds

158
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,919
of questions that other people are

159
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,440
telling me ask and I don't know what

160
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,919
label they want to put on it but I think

161
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:01,840
it's interesting and just sort of having

162
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:07,199
that kind of introduction to a topic

163
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:10,240
also I think games are helpful for uh I

164
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:13,440
guess I'd call it identity exploration

165
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,520
so for people particularly learners who

166
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,639
may not think of themselves as learners

167
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,800
or as competent learners that they can

168
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,039
sort of put that identity behind them

169
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,080
when they enter the game because you

170
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:28,720
know it's a game and anyone can play it

171
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,759
or maybe I'm particularly good at games

172
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:35,120
so I can play games and then I can

173
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,560
suddenly realize that I might be good at

174
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,720
other things as well or I might be

175
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,199
interested in other things that I

176
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,680
wouldn't allow myself to discover if

177
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:48,400
whether or not I was interested because

178
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:50,720
it was a risky sphere to enter.

179
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,199
So current projects, we're doing a

180
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:57,039
language learning game. Uh it's a casual

181
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:59,759
and massively multiplayer online game

182
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:01,440
with a grant targeting a population of

183
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:06,080
Spanish speaking high school students in

184
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:07,919
the US. Um and that is from the Hila

185
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:11,599
Foundation. And then we have a couple of

186
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:14,240
other projects going on as well, science

187
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:16,080
and some other stuff. So that's about

188
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,400
it.

189
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,879
So I'm Scottwell. I'm the research

190
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,639
director of the education arcade.

191
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,360
Research I share two titles, research

192
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,520
director and creative director. Um the

193
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,199
education arcade, but also one of the

194
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,640
co-founders of learning games network.

195
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:36,080
Um and I don't want to repeat too much

196
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:38,240
of what's been said except that I I at

197
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,640
the same time as as I do this for a

198
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,240
living, I still struggle with the term

199
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,399
educational game because it's not the

200
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:48,480
way I think of what I do primarily. The

201
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:50,720
first I before working in this set, the

202
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,320
first game I did was a commercial game.

203
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,839
It wasn't designed as an educational

204
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,920
game. It was designed just as a puzzle

205
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,440
adventure game. It happened to be about

206
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,720
math and logic, but that was just

207
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,760
because that's what we thought was

208
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:04,480
interesting. Um, it got marketed because

209
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,000
of changes in the marketplace as sort of

210
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,279
enterainment. But when I started in the

211
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,320
business, there was no such word as

212
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:12,480
enterainment. Most most games, if you go

213
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,399
back to the early 90s, were sort of

214
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,760
exploratory environments. I mean they

215
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,519
either either they were sort of twitch

216
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,040
games or they were exploratory

217
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,080
environments. I have nothing against

218
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,440
Twitch games but the exploratory

219
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,680
environments are all about thinking and

220
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,120
problem solving. And to me that's what's

221
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,160
interesting. No matter what domain

222
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,399
you're working in, whether it's

223
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:31,279
mathematical or whether it's historical,

224
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,519
it's still the process are the same. And

225
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,600
just to one slight twist I want to put

226
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,920
on what Dan Dan said. I think we are on

227
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,360
the same page. But because he led the

228
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,720
idea of engagement, it's possible to

229
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,399
think that I'm talking about games as

230
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,920
sort of an inducement to do something we

231
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,680
don't want to do.

232
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,200
And I think it's games are an

233
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,040
opportunity to discover how much fun

234
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,959
something is which is very different

235
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,519
from sort of we ah we tricked you just

236
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:55,279
mad but rather

237
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:58,160
this is really interesting. Don't you

238
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,920
like doing this and um you can do more

239
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,000
and then then maybe and that and that's

240
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,920
all that you get out of it that's fine.

241
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,760
If you later realize oh I like doing

242
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,680
that and that's math and I'm going to do

243
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,200
more of that. That's also that's even

244
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,279
better. And then I think it's not so

245
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,279
much because we just said it's fun. It's

246
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:16,240
because I think

247
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,600
the um very process I think the very

248
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,880
process of thinking and problem solving

249
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,120
is rewarding and I want people to

250
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,040
understand that better

251
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,279
and people do get that in games and I

252
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,959
just think it's important to tell people

253
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,240
realize if you enjoyed it in a game you

254
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,519
can enjoy it in life and maybe this

255
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,680
comes from my own realization but if

256
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,360
anyone told me if when I was in sixth

257
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,079
grade instead of them saying scientific

258
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:39,120
method and writing this list of dull

259
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:41,040
steps on the on the blackboard they had

260
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,640
said play this puzzle and let's talk

261
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:46,480
about how you solve the ple

262
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:49,760
that science. Um I think I might have

263
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:54,240
ended up working at MIT.

264
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:57,040
>> So anyway, um that's so so so talking a

265
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:00,720
little bit about finding about

266
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:02,880
identifying how you're going to make

267
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,959
how you're going to locate what's

268
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,920
enjoyable about the thing that you

269
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:10,079
wanted people to engage with. like how

270
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:13,600
can you talk a little bit about maybe in

271
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:16,240
a in a recent project or in past project

272
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,240
uh how you went about that process?

273
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,680
Let's let's let's talk about the the

274
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,200
things that you worked on. Um and maybe

275
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,640
sometimes it's more difficult than you

276
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,200
have some challenges. Maybe sometimes it

277
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,200
was just pretty obvious.

278
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:33,920
>> Yeah.

279
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:36,720
I'll take it

280
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,800
always.

281
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,600
I'd like to congratulate Scott on this

282
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,920
personal group.

283
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,959
So, with the language learning game that

284
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,560
we're working on at the moment,

285
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,800
there are approaches to language

286
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,720
learning out there in the world that

287
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:57,120
emphasize

288
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:59,600
vocabulary memorization or

289
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,680
grammar. Grammar meaning memorizing

290
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,680
tables of conjugations.

291
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,519
Um,

292
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,480
and

293
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:11,040
It's pretty much stripped of any sort of

294
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:14,160
meaningful context. So, and a meaningful

295
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:16,800
context could either be

296
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:20,000
a text, and I use that word loosely,

297
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:22,079
that is engaging. It could be a film

298
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,320
that you want to see that happens to be

299
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:29,040
in a language that you're trying to

300
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:30,480
learn, or it could be uh a means of

301
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:34,079
communication. After all, that's what

302
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,519
language is. So if you're thinking about

303
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,360
using language as a means of

304
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,639
communication, then of course you need

305
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,240
to think about what are you

306
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,240
communicating

307
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,920
and fortunately games are full of

308
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,519
communication between the game and the

309
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,440
player and the player in the game. And

310
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:51,440
if it's a multiplayer game between the

311
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:53,519
players in the game. So it was almost

312
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,600
like if you start from that philosophy,

313
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,120
it's almost a trivial exercise to say,

314
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,079
okay, well, what's something interesting

315
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:03,040
for people to talk about in a game? And

316
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:05,600
so you come up interesting game. And

317
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:10,800
instead of having the mechanic be click

318
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:13,760
this button to uh activate whatever the

319
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,680
nuclear missile, you have to you build

320
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,200
in collaboration. So I have part of the

321
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,079
piece and you have part of the piece and

322
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:23,040
we need to talk about uh when to use

323
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:26,079
what and which contexts and

324
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,240
on whom. And

325
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:31,279
so suddenly we're talking and it doesn't

326
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,320
even feel like we're learning a

327
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:35,040
language. It just feels like we're

328
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,120
playing a game. Uh and then if you're

329
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,839
doing it in a language that you're

330
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,839
attempting to learn, then there there's

331
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,000
the barrier there where you might want

332
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,399
to say something that you just don't

333
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
have the skill yet to say. So it's not

334
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:52,160
quite as simple as just saying, "Hey, go

335
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:55,200
talk." Um, but there's

336
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:58,000
slightly innovative ways that you can

337
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,519
give people tools to allow themselves to

338
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,160
express themselves in a fairly

339
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,519
constrained context. So, because you've

340
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,199
designed the game, you sort of break the

341
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,880
system, you know that people aren't

342
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:09,199
going to talk about absolutely anything.

343
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,360
Maybe they will in the chat, but

344
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:13,839
primarily in the game, you're

345
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,360
incentivizing their discussion around a

346
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,399
particular topic. So if you give them

347
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,560
tools to discuss that particular topic,

348
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,639
uh not only does it make the game play

349
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,560
more efficient, but that's also how the

350
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:28,240
learning can happen because there can be

351
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:30,399
some sort of selection mechanism whereby

352
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,959
I am able to say something that I want

353
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,480
to say but without needing to bring all

354
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,560
of the knowledge of how to construct

355
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,240
that on my own. You know, there's some

356
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:41,440
amount of oh, I can just recognize that

357
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:43,760
that's more or less what I want.

358
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,839
Uh, and then by seeing it repeatedly and

359
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:48,480
by seeing other players use the same

360
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,880
tools to communicate and knowing that

361
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,440
the communication in certain contexts is

362
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,839
is valid that I can pay close attention

363
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,800
to that and start to become familiar and

364
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:02,560
learn. But it's it's not a I have to

365
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:04,560
memorize it so that I can use it. It's

366
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:08,240
I'm using it and I'm using it so much

367
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,279
that I just naturally learn it.

368
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,560
>> Question on that.

369
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,240
>> So if you're trying to encourage me to

370
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,360
talk Spanish and you talk Spanish. We're

371
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,959
trying to work something out. Yeah.

372
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,079
>> What prevents you from just typing

373
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,120
something in in English and having you

374
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,279
read it in English?

375
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,680
>> Right. So, it depends on the game. Uh,

376
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:24,240
and in some games that's totally fine.

377
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,959
In other games, we have uh teams

378
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,360
moderate other teams. In other games, we

379
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:33,279
have some sort of communication tool

380
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:37,519
that's not free text entry. So it's uh

381
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:39,600
not so one extreme is here's a list of

382
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,000
10 sentences that you could say click

383
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:45,360
one of them and that's not the direction

384
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,480
we tend to go in but that's an example

385
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,079
of how to communicate something without

386
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,959
free text entry. So there could be some

387
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:55,440
sort of sentence construction kit, let's

388
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:57,279
say, uh where you have a pool of

389
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:01,839
different words that you can assemble in

390
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:05,199
a variety of orders to express a small

391
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:07,199
set of meanings.

392
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:10,320
And if you think about games like

393
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:13,040
charades or pictionary,

394
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,880
the need to communicate with constraints

395
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,560
doesn't stop us from necessarily

396
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,040
enjoying the game if we make it

397
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,040
interesting.

398
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,440
In fact, that's part of the game. Part

399
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,480
of our insight was thinking about our

400
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:29,759
own experiences learning languages and

401
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,279
sort of the game of say and this gets at

402
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,759
my sort of core idea which is to find

403
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:35,759
the game that's already there. So a game

404
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,279
that I always play when I'm travel

405
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,639
particularly

406
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:41,199
when I've traveled in France where I

407
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,480
speak the language sort of is how far

408
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,880
can I get into a conversation before

409
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,040
they figure out I'm not American.

410
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,920
So that becomes a game and sort of the

411
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:53,440
whole and and then and how how can I

412
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,880
have it or if I know someone uh who's

413
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,199
friends how much of a conversation can

414
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,880
we have in French that's again from at

415
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,079
that point it becomes kind of fun. So I

416
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,839
think we were just really trying to

417
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:04,000
access that and I think that really gets

418
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:06,240
back to your larger question when you

419
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,720
take on something new I want to know

420
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,240
where is the game already in this and I

421
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,720
mentioned it to Raj from my the first

422
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,760
game I did was math and colleague with

423
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,959
my who designed the game we both spent a

424
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,400
lot of time saying when we were kids how

425
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,079
do we play with numbers what kind of

426
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,079
things did we do what was interesting to

427
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:25,839
us with numbers we really try to access

428
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:29,760
our own our own play um and similarly

429
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:31,919
now uh I try to if I can try to meet

430
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,960
practitioners in the field and say you

431
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,120
know what do you think about in the

432
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,400
shower or when you run it where's the

433
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,840
because that's where the play is

434
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,600
actually happening um in the field and I

435
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,840
think that's where that's where people

436
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,280
who love their jobs it's the play in it

437
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:48,320
that they love about it and that's what

438
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:50,240
I think you try to access in any in any

439
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:54,160
service um so Dan talking about the

440
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:56,640
language one um we're doing a game with

441
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,679
the Royal Shakespeare Company if we can

442
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,880
get funding

443
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:03,840
around the Tempest and trying to figure

444
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,919
out how to make a game of it. And um I

445
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:09,360
realized that that part of the challenge

446
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:11,200
with Shakespeare is to some degree the

447
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,880
language too is sort of making sense out

448
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,280
of the language which is now somewhat

449
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,600
archaic but really interesting. And so

450
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,520
we try we made a game that's sort of a

451
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,520
um

452
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,760
puzzle that you assemble by finding

453
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:26,480
pieces of the play and associating

454
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:29,039
things. So you find a hedgehog and you

455
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,400
find some text that makes a reference

456
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,679
that somehow makes you think of the

457
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,880
hedgehog and you put them together and

458
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,480
you actually start building a visual

459
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,160
puzzle. So it's really sort of a

460
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,799
challenge of making sense of snippets of

461
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:41,520
text that gradually grow out and the

462
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:44,000
picture of the play starts to of the

463
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,760
Shakespeare play tennis starts to emerge

464
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,720
through the game play. So you a story

465
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:51,200
sort of appears out of the way a picture

466
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,480
appears in a jigsaw puzzle. So it's a

467
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,559
game you can play without knowing

468
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,960
without knowing without ever having seen

469
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:59,360
it. Um but that is sort of part of the

470
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,880
experience of theater is the way stories

471
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,440
emerge from I mean they emerge from

472
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,360
different pattern but still we're still

473
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,280
trying to make a story through

474
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,440
exploration

475
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:12,080
that was

476
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,080
maybe if if I if I talk about my

477
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,400
experience coming I think I come from an

478
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,240
area where we made really bad games like

479
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,760
we made there's this saying like

480
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,840
education games are like chocolate

481
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,600
covered broccoli like not healthy not

482
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,559
sweets you know and I think I come from

483
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:29,280
a background where um teachers or

484
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:31,840
educators were asked to build games for

485
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,840
somebody and what you had is content and

486
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,200
then it was like and I I I can say that

487
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,120
because I think most of my colleagues

488
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,960
didn't know better. They thought okay I

489
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,400
have content that content is good and

490
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,799
now I just make it a little fun and the

491
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,600
kids going to love it. And I think we as

492
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:47,760
you all sit here, we all know how um as

493
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,640
how quick kids realize that this is not

494
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:53,200
fun, you know, and um and I think um

495
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,840
there there are tons of bad games out

496
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,760
there um that that ruins the reputation

497
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,480
of educational games in that sense. And

498
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:03,200
coming here to MIT and working um with

499
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,440
Scotland and people like Dan

500
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:08,000
that I realized more the question is

501
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,080
more what makes us curious about a

502
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,440
problem about the learning content. Of

503
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,720
course, we can have the content in the

504
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,720
game. Sometimes we don't even have the

505
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,640
content. It's more abstract. We we look

506
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,200
for metaphors that kind of like, you

507
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,280
know, you you can understand how to be

508
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,520
interested in history without really

509
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,440
learning all the the the the real data.

510
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,919
Maybe you learn other history, but you

511
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,679
get interested in how history works. And

512
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,919
I think that's that's kind of like what

513
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:34,880
I learned here. And and I I realize now

514
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:37,440
that it's really useful that that um we

515
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,919
don't we don't use the chocolate cow

516
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:43,039
broccoli anymore. um we ask more about

517
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:44,720
what do we really want? Um do we want to

518
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,720
have something that is healthy or sweet

519
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,640
or something different? Let's cook it,

520
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:52,080
you know, let's not just combine two

521
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:54,000
things. And um and I think that's

522
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,840
something um that also like the good

523
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,720
educational games that are out there are

524
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,720
kind of heading in that direction.

525
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,720
>> You have counter examples from your own

526
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:06,320
work of like, you know, a something that

527
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,120
seemed fruitful but then kind of turned

528
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:11,200
out to be a dead end. uh

529
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:13,039
some you know maybe you're trying trying

530
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,200
to address some subject area and then

531
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:16,799
you're trying to marry some some

532
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,039
specific game mechanics you thought it

533
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:21,280
might work but it didn't quite

534
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:24,880
>> um I can talk about one that I'm it's

535
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:28,240
not resolved yet I'm struggling

536
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:31,200
I'm starting to work I'm doing a game

537
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:33,840
with a um professor here in ocean and

538
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,760
environmental engineering um about

539
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:39,200
microbes he does all this work studying

540
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:41,360
microbes in the which I I learned about

541
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,840
I mean half the biomass of the ocean are

542
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:46,159
microbes and we know almost nothing

543
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:48,320
about them because until people like him

544
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:50,400
which is one of the few built apparatus

545
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,320
to study oceanlike conditions in the

546
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,679
laboratory they had no way of knowing

547
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,760
what was going on with them. So, I mean,

548
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,120
that's interesting if if you get into

549
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,799
it. It's not something that a middle

550
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,840
school kid is dying to know about,

551
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:03,039
right? Um, although it could be I, you

552
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:06,559
know, so anyway, so we're doing a

553
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:08,480
simulation where we try, well, where you

554
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,080
the premise is that you've got a part of

555
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,039
the ocean that's dead and you're trying

556
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,720
to re-engineer it by putting plates by

557
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:18,000
introducing nanobots which you can

558
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:20,400
build. Um and these nanobots would

559
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,080
simulate the functions what microbes do

560
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:25,520
because microbes are doing at the

561
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:29,679
microbial level what does too which is

562
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:32,400
processing oxygen or rather plants and

563
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:36,240
you know plants plants and processing

564
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:39,120
either oxygen and producing CO2 and

565
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:42,880
energy or the reverse taking CO2 and

566
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:44,640
sunlight. Anyway, um so we so the

567
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,320
challenge we made a sort of interesting

568
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,120
playable simulation where you build this

569
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,520
stuff. But I I haven't figured out yet.

570
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:55,280
I'm struggling with

571
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:58,240
uh is it is it sufficiently

572
00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:00,000
does the have we found the way to entice

573
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,919
you to do this stuff without having to

574
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,120
give you too much information? I mean,

575
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:06,720
I'm a big believer that a game this game

576
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,159
does not start with instructions. I

577
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,840
mean, because I don't believe games

578
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,120
should ever start with instructions, but

579
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,400
I'm still struggling with the

580
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,200
information we're providing along the

581
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:18,240
way. It's too much too much need this

582
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,159
now as opposed to and and I think the

583
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,919
problem is because simulations are very

584
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:24,080
wide open environments and it's very

585
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:26,159
hard to constrain a simulation enough

586
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:29,039
that the brain says ah now I understand

587
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:30,480
what variable I just used and and

588
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:32,880
particular because kids has have a

589
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,200
tendency to see simulations as black

590
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,440
boxes. So they'll throw in they'll

591
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,559
change three variables at once and not

592
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,240
notice that they've changed three

593
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:41,600
variables and not think about well which

594
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,919
variable wasn't. they just don't have

595
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,840
the they haven't got the habit of mind

596
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,760
to practice changing you know really

597
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,360
controlling the variables and if you

598
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,640
don't do that simulations do become

599
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,720
these black boxes and I'm still

600
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,320
struggling with how to how to not sort

601
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,480
of say mark down mark the kid down the

602
00:23:54,320 --> 00:24:00,320
road and say okay now make this choice

603
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:02,720
now make that choice because that's

604
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,400
too constrained and not fun I want to

605
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,960
have have them have a lot of choices but

606
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,559
also help them understand the the effect

607
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,120
of the choices they made that's the best

608
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:16,360
way so I had to have just processing

609
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:16,360
I'm not speaking with a very clear way.

610
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,279
I can give you a bad example. So I was

611
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:23,440
working on this game like I wasn't

612
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:25,120
really working on that to my excuse. I

613
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,640
was beginning to work with these people

614
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,880
and then realized this is not the way

615
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,880
it's it's I want to go and then I

616
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,240
stepped out of it and I think it's u

617
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,720
it's a good example what you shouldn't

618
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:37,679
do. So this this um small town in

619
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:40,159
Austria is is um using their waste to

620
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:41,840
produce energy like renewable energy.

621
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,440
It's it's really it's interesting the

622
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,360
town is like somewhere in the

623
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,840
countryside nobody was interested. They

624
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:50,480
make so much power now that they can um

625
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:52,400
give power for free in their um the town

626
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,080
companies and the neighbor companies uh

627
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,240
the yeah neighbor companies in neighbor

628
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,320
towns. So a lot of people are interested

629
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:01,039
in how they do that and they thought wow

630
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:03,840
we want to be a cool town we make a game

631
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:05,440
instead of was providing the content.

632
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,200
But what they did they gave us all the

633
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,200
content and said this is what what you

634
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,720
should like teach to people and do it

635
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,640
make it fun and and in the end you know

636
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,559
like you know these people were sitting

637
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,559
together like okay what do people like

638
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:21,120
comics and you have to have a character

639
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:23,679
that is moving around and then we make

640
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:26,000
small multiple choice tests and

641
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:27,919
afterwards you get a reward and you get

642
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,279
the reward out and it says your name and

643
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:31,840
it says you are trained in that

644
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:34,799
discipline and what was interesting for

645
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:36,880
me that they built the game and the the

646
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:38,559
game's been bad and it's very sad and

647
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,279
it's horrible. But the funniest thing

648
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:42,880
for me was who was the target group like

649
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:44,400
and and they never talked about that.

650
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,679
They always thought who cares about

651
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,640
target groups? We make this game,

652
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,799
everybody's going to love it.

653
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:52,400
Everybody's so interested. The idea was

654
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:54,559
who decides if you can do that. It's the

655
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,720
major of towns. They say, "Oh, we we

656
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:58,480
want to have a company like that." And

657
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,480
so now we're talking about Austrian

658
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:03,360
European majors of towns and they are

659
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,880
normally fat and like to drink wine. You

660
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,720
know, normally they sit with another

661
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,240
major and have lunch and then they say,

662
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,840
"Wow, this works." And then they decide

663
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,159
to do it or not. But now they were

664
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,760
sending these games to the majors. They

665
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,520
didn't know at all what to do with this.

666
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:18,640
You know, they they they they couldn't

667
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:20,320
get into the game. Um and so not that

668
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,559
the game was bad, they didn't even think

669
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:26,159
about their target group. And um I think

670
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:28,880
that's one one um one aspect that

671
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:31,120
interests me the most is you have to

672
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,279
have the the context of the game and the

673
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,880
learning experience has to be suitable.

674
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:37,600
If this is not happening you know you

675
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,520
can play the most interesting game um if

676
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,039
somebody doesn't want to be like doesn't

677
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:43,440
get the problem doesn't get engaged to

678
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:45,760
the problem it's just you know it's just

679
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,919
um something happening is not really

680
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:50,400
interested in that. And um I think

681
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:55,279
that's that's a major problem that this

682
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:57,440
this example was totally addressing. So

683
00:26:55,279 --> 00:27:00,799
>> So know know who you're designing your

684
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:03,039
game for and how and and how they tend

685
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:06,799
to get engaged with things.

686
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:10,720
>> Yes. I think um um

687
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:12,400
if I so I mean just to do a simplistic

688
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,880
example but it's one that's just as

689
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:17,120
applicable. If I wanted a game for my

690
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,360
mother who occasionally would play a

691
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,520
casual game, I wouldn't do a massively

692
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,679
multiplayer game with lots of stuff

693
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,799
going on. All these senior systems are

694
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,159
going to get into this massively

695
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:27,679
multiplayer game. I mean, in some ways,

696
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:28,960
it would be really great to come with a

697
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,559
massively multiplayer game for senior

698
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,600
systems because they're isolated. But

699
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:35,039
you also know that they're not they're

700
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,320
they didn't grow up with computers and

701
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:40,880
they're not going to be able to navigate

702
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:42,400
a 3D space. So I mean that's a that's a

703
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,919
simplified example of why it's

704
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,679
important.

705
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:47,919
>> What is really beautiful if if like a

706
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:50,880
game like like Remish the the cancer

707
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:53,360
game maybe some of you know that like a

708
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,760
cancer game actually it was actually

709
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:57,919
mentioned in

710
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,600
>> but it's probably one of the best

711
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,679
learning games out there. But the good

712
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:04,159
thing for them is people that play that

713
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:06,720
game have cancer and they you know so

714
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:09,200
you have the problem to the game is so

715
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,120
close that people will not play oh I

716
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,640
don't care about cancer no like they

717
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,200
care about cancer because they have

718
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:18,320
cancer the game is about cancer and the

719
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,080
way how chemotherapy works so the the

720
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,720
context and the engagement is

721
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:24,720
automatically um kind of like the

722
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,159
problem is solved but what about as as

723
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,320
Dan said what about a learning game

724
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:29,840
where it's about language learning um

725
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,679
are these people already interested to

726
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:34,000
learn the language. Do they come there

727
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:36,000
with a language problem or or do we want

728
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,840
to to introduce them to the problem or

729
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,600
or show that maybe they don't have to be

730
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,039
afraid to learn language or whatever.

731
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,279
this this question has to be addressed.

732
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:45,360
It's a very very early stage otherwise

733
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:48,000
you if if you'd stop design it and then

734
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,520
address the question it's

735
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,440
late

736
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,200
I do think I mean it's the question is

737
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:56,320
sort of about sort of the explicit

738
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:58,799
versus the hidden so if you played the

739
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:01,039
game Waker

740
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:02,559
that was really designed to introduce

741
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:05,039
basically

742
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:06,720
what an idea that people have struggled

743
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:10,240
with which are what position and

744
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:12,480
velocity graphs actually mean um but the

745
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,399
game doesn't mention velocity and it

746
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,159
doesn't mention graphs. And in fact, in

747
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:18,159
the same reviews that got lots of good

748
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:19,600
reviews when it came out, a lot of them

749
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:22,480
said that I had no idea this was

750
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:24,080
educational. Um

751
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,520
I

752
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,279
I would sort of I don't believe that

753
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,880
that's fine that people don't

754
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,159
necessarily know that as they play a

755
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,159
game that that they you're still

756
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,679
building up some conceptual knowledge. I

757
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,200
don't think that I think that some large

758
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:36,960
percentage of people who play a game at

759
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,799
that setting will probably they walk

760
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,799
away from the game and do nothing else

761
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:42,159
but three months later it'll have gone.

762
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:44,480
I mean that that experience for most

763
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:45,760
people will not be resilient not because

764
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,520
they didn't enjoy it but because they

765
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,440
got lots of interesting resil lots of

766
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,039
things going on in life and there's more

767
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,240
information coming out of something on

768
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,760
the other hand the kid plays that game

769
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,000
and then you sit down and have a

770
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,840
conversation about velocity and position

771
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,840
grass there might be some real

772
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,120
meaningful learning that occurs and so I

773
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,919
think it's really important to not

774
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,520
overreach in that sense um I try to

775
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:07,600
avoid although we slip into saying it

776
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,679
that our games teach anything because I

777
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,919
think teaching is a much more active and

778
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:13,520
explicit activities that our games do. I

779
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:16,480
think our games let people play with

780
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:18,159
things, let people learn things and then

781
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,679
just like if you write a you write a

782
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:22,960
book, the book doesn't teach anything.

783
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:25,200
The books the information it's available

784
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:27,520
and I think that's really sort of part

785
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:30,720
of what I think we have to be modest and

786
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:32,320
humble about as we do this stuff.

787
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,320
So, but that also puts on us the

788
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,480
challenge at an audience of thinking

789
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,679
about if if you do want some learning to

790
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,159
occur, where do you want the learning to

791
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:42,480
occur? is for people's personal lives.

792
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:46,080
Is it in a mediated setting like a

793
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,440
hospital or is it in a school that it's

794
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:50,399
really those are really critical

795
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,600
questions? It's not it's not just the

796
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:53,200
audience but the setting for the

797
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,880
audience

798
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,679
>> and who's introducing the game to them

799
00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:00,320
for instance to the teacher doctor

800
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:01,600
>> right and while they play it like with

801
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:05,279
Labyrinth which is this middle school

802
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:07,919
math game that Dan and I worked on uh we

803
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:10,559
knew that if we didn't if we didn't push

804
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:11,919
in another direction the implementation

805
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:14,399
was going to be well we'll create this

806
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:17,279
game that gets played in classrooms. If

807
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:19,039
you've ever seen your all, if you

808
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:21,360
remember your own computer labs in

809
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:23,279
school, if that was your edge, which is

810
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,960
true, actually,

811
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,960
it meant every now and then you went,

812
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,559
you had to line up and walk down the

813
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,000
hall to this other place. So, what you

814
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:31,679
could only get to occasionally and it

815
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,440
took by the time you settled in your

816
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,200
chairs and booted up, you had maybe 20

817
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,559
minutes on a computer that it was time.

818
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,000
So, that was all, you know, if you're

819
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:39,840
designing for schools, you're talking

820
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,840
about a 20 minute experience once every

821
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:44,000
two or three weeks.

822
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:46,880
I'm not sure that was was worth thinking

823
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,799
about anything for that sense. So we

824
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:52,000
designed a game to be played online at

825
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:53,679
home and encouraged teachers to let the

826
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,120
kids just play it. And there was another

827
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:57,200
advantage of that which was to go back

828
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:59,200
to who introduces it. If you're playing

829
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,960
that even if we have a perfect 20-minute

830
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,480
game for the computer lab, if the

831
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,640
teacher's walking around, I mean there's

832
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,320
some I shouldn't say I've seen good uses

833
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,279
of that space, but there's some greater

834
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,440
probability that you're going to feel

835
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:10,720
like this is just a lesson. Whereas if

836
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,640
the teacher said, "Go play this at

837
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,399
home," there's some greater probability

838
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,159
that you'll sort of forget about school

839
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,200
and get playful. And it's not that

840
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:18,640
again, it's not that we want to trick

841
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,080
you when you're doing math. It's that we

842
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:23,039
want you to engage with the math in the

843
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:25,519
most playful spirit possible. And the

844
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:28,159
few the less we make it give the rapper

845
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:30,799
of scroll to it, the more playful you're

846
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:33,279
likely to be, even if we're not denying

847
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:37,880
that it's math or science. So that was

848
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:37,880
the other that was part of

849
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:42,640
you had said um that the cancer game was

850
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:45,039
really well evaluated. So, did any of

851
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:47,039
you have like stories or experiences

852
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:49,200
from seeing your games out in the world

853
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:53,799
that like like have you gotten feedback

854
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,799
from teachers who have tried this class?

855
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:03,760
>> No.

856
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:07,120
>> Yeah. No, no. Was it um Oh, um

857
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:10,080
yes. I from the from this this game I

858
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:12,559
just talked about about um renewable

859
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:14,240
energies. It totally failed. Like people

860
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:17,440
played them and didn't understand it,

861
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:21,679
hated it or or um before. So I think

862
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:24,640
like total failure. Um and I think I

863
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:26,720
think just to kind of like

864
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:30,320
to start with this this conversation is

865
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:33,519
this is a this is um problematic thing

866
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:36,320
because we hardly have any um we there

867
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:38,480
is very little um research going on on

868
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:40,880
evaluation of games because it's it's

869
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,799
also very hard takes a lot of effort and

870
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:46,799
and it also would take a lot of money to

871
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:49,279
re to evaluate the the research the

872
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:53,519
success of the of the game for learning

873
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:55,519
purposes. Um I I just know very little

874
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:56,960
studies that do that in the end. And I

875
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:59,200
think we just kind of like reach that

876
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:01,519
moment where where people start to think

877
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:04,240
that this is um an interesting way to do

878
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:07,279
it. And remission as I said is is

879
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,800
probably the only I I just like I hope

880
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:10,800
maybe you're correct in a second, but I

881
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,879
think that's the only game I would put

882
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,399
my hand into the fire for it. But what

883
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:16,800
but the question is what do they learn

884
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:18,720
in the game? They learned about self

885
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,720
agency. They learned that that they that

886
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:23,119
there is something they can do and they

887
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:26,159
they learned a more positive um

888
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:28,000
perspective and positive um relation to

889
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,599
medicine. They didn't learn anything

890
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,919
else, you know. It's like they didn't

891
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:33,040
learn like in the research because they

892
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:34,399
didn't change their illness.

893
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,760
>> Yes. And they and they didn't get

894
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:37,679
happier, you know. It's like not that

895
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,359
they said, "Wow, now I can Yeah. I

896
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:41,359
cannot they couldn't cope better with

897
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:43,839
their with their illness. They just took

898
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:47,040
their medicine." And so the doctors were

899
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:48,639
really happy with that. But you know,

900
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:51,919
And that's the stated goal of remission

901
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:54,480
actually is is this this is a it's a 3D

902
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:57,200
game where I think you play like a a

903
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:59,200
woman in space suit something um going

904
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:02,400
you know shock down and and and suddenly

905
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:04,000
someone blood bloodstream u but but but

906
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,599
say the goal of the game at least of the

907
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,240
people who are making it was to try to

908
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:09,839
encourage uh people who are suffering

909
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:12,240
from cancer to keep up with their

910
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:14,720
medication. uh you know just don't don't

911
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:17,680
don't

912
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:20,560
fall on your don't fail keeping up the

913
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:23,280
schedule of taking your chemotherapy

914
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:25,200
drugs basically and uh and again

915
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,200
designed to sort of show what happens

916
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:30,240
what what these drugs actually try to do

917
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:32,079
and some sort of like fictional or

918
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:35,119
fantastical I'm not going to say the

919
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:37,760
fictional yet all based in science um so

920
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:38,560
that's that's that's remission is this

921
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,280
famous

922
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:43,040
>> yeah so you can Google So um on

923
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,200
labyrinth the the original grant

924
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:48,400
included an extensive one-year

925
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:50,400
evaluation um of the game abuse and then

926
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,960
when Congress cut back the funding of

927
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:55,359
the larger program which is just one

928
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:57,040
small piece that got cut off and so the

929
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:59,280
research didn't happen. We're now

930
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:03,880
looking for a grant because it's being

931
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,880
used aggressively in Maryland schools.

932
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,079
So we are going to look for money but

933
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,440
generally there's less m as little money

934
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:11,280
as there is for developing interesting

935
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,040
engage is even less for researching them

936
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:16,800
and

937
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:18,640
and I think some of what I think our

938
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,920
work about is design research. We figure

939
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,760
out what we can learn by making the

940
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,920
games and we publish what we've learned

941
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,760
in the hope that other people will pick

942
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:28,240
up the ball. People who are have more of

943
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:30,400
a researcher bent

944
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:32,480
traditional sense we'll start doing the

945
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,480
research about it. I think we're on the

946
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:37,280
brink of that. I think with stuff like

947
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,720
the quest to learn school. I think

948
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,119
increasing numbers of educators are

949
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:43,440
interested in asking those questions. Um

950
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:46,880
I do have only anecdotal evidence but

951
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:48,960
the very first game that I did which was

952
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:51,760
this math and scienceoriented game a

953
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:54,800
math and logic oriented game um ended up

954
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:58,000
being not particularly well marketed um

955
00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:00,320
and nevertheless sold a million copies.

956
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,079
And the anecdotal evidence I got was

957
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:04,320
that it was one of those rare cases

958
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:05,599
where parents would bring it in and

959
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,040
recommend to teachers or teachers would

960
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:09,440
recommend to parents or kids would come

961
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:11,200
home from school and recommend and and

962
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,119
there seemed to be this fairly broad

963
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:15,200
acceptance by both parents and teachers

964
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:17,119
and kids without without kids having the

965
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,440
sense that oh my teachers make them do

966
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:21,920
this and I hear that now that there's

967
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:24,640
original players in their 20s I will

968
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:26,800
hear from them and some of them say it's

969
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:31,119
what interested them in math and stuff.

970
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:33,119
So that's all anecdotal and maybe every

971
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:37,480
that's

972
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:37,480
but I think the million copies is

973
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:51,440
>> sure I'll just add a little bit to that

974
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:54,160
I also have some anecdotal stuff around

975
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,760
some of the other games but

976
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,960
the most interesting thing that I've

977
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:00,960
discovered

978
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:02,960
was with Labyrinth in a target audience

979
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:06,400
that I've seen play it that it was not

980
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:10,240
specifically designed for, which is uh

981
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:13,200
kids with some sort of um attention

982
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:16,880
disorder, whether it's ADD or autism or

983
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:19,520
something. and

984
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:21,440
seeing these kids engage with the game,

985
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:26,720
even engage with the game in a social

986
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:30,160
way. Uh, and be hyperfocused on the game

987
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:32,640
and be highly confident with the game

988
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:34,640
and

989
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:39,599
to really

990
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:43,839
calm down and adopt pro-social behaviors

991
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:46,640
that were not characteristic of them.

992
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:49,200
or that their peers or families hadn't

993
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:50,960
seen in them before. I think there's a

994
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,800
lot of power there.

995
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:56,079
>> The first two teachers I met who used

996
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,440
Labyrinth um said that they were seeing

997
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:58,880
performance from kids they didn't expect

998
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,720
to see in the program which is exactly

999
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:03,040
what I think we were hoping for because

1000
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:04,560
we our sense was that lots of kids have

1001
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:07,520
competencies and skills that they don't

1002
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:09,359
show off in the format of school. School

1003
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:12,560
being its own kind of game which only

1004
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:14,079
certain people are good at. Um and so

1005
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,760
having a be able to demonstrate

1006
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:17,599
competency at a different kind of game

1007
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,760
and let the teacher see it because part

1008
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:22,240
of the design lab is that teachers can

1009
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:24,960
track progress online.

1010
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:26,800
Um that was one of our goals that was

1011
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,320
that was

1012
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:31,200
>> Chris

1013
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:33,520
said it possible to look it up.

1014
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:35,040
>> Yeah, sure. We've been talking about it.

1015
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,200
>> Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.

1016
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:40,400
>> Doesn't actually exist.

1017
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:45,320
It's just a notion that

1018
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:45,320
>> other people can keep a little bit

1019
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:55,240
while while we're setting it up. Um I

1020
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:55,240
think talk ask a bit about prototyping.

1021
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:15,119
So I mean in the process of um in the

1022
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,320
process of designing the these are

1023
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:18,079
mostly digital games that we've been

1024
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:20,400
talking about all this time but I'd like

1025
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:22,960
to talk about you know sort of the early

1026
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:27,200
stage when you're working with paper or

1027
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:28,880
um or simple digital prototypes. uh uh

1028
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,400
how

1029
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,800
maybe you can talk talk a little bit

1030
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:36,400
about how you how that might be similar

1031
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:38,720
or different from designing um uh other

1032
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:41,599
kinds of computer games or even board

1033
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:43,200
games? I mean do do you do do you test

1034
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:46,000
it differently because you're designing

1035
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:48,240
it explicitly for a specific audience?

1036
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,200
Do you test it with instructors as well

1037
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:53,359
as players or independent players? I

1038
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,119
think it's always best to try to test

1039
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:57,119
with your target audiences. The things

1040
00:40:55,119 --> 00:41:00,119
you've learned from

1041
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:00,119
uh

1042
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,480
um there's things you learn you can

1043
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:07,520
learn from any audience particularly

1044
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:09,680
usability which is important. Frequently

1045
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:11,760
the flaw in a game is not the core

1046
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,640
mechanic but the ease with which the

1047
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,240
player can understand what they're

1048
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:17,920
supposed to do. And you can test that

1049
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:20,000
with that with any wide range of people.

1050
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:22,079
anyone who you think is roughly as

1051
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,480
computer or game literate as your target

1052
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:26,720
audience. But I think if your goal is

1053
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,000
sort of to interest kids, for example,

1054
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:32,000
middle school kids like we were with

1055
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:35,000
this game, just turn this on.

1056
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Um

1057
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:40,319
um then you do want to because there are

1058
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:48,200
questions about age appropriateness. Um

1059
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:48,200
or uh sorry for let me mirror my screen.

1060
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:55,200
All right. So we're about to get the

1061
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,280
screen here. So this is just a login

1062
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,800
screen. And this is not really this is

1063
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:01,440
not the first screen you would come to

1064
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,880
if you'd started again from scratch. But

1065
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,280
um you get some more information about

1066
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:07,599
but I've already logged in. So but

1067
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:11,760
you'll notice um

1068
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:13,599
oh let's just let me just log here.

1069
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,200
So it's online. You can play from any

1070
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:16,640
computer. That was important because we

1071
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,400
were concerned about underserved

1072
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:21,440
populations who either don't have

1073
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:23,119
computers at home or

1074
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,640
or who have less control over their

1075
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:26,880
time, don't have a computer in the room

1076
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:28,720
certainly or might do all their work in

1077
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,800
in an after school setting or in a

1078
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:32,160
library. So basically you can log in

1079
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,720
from any computer. Once you have an

1080
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:36,560
identity, you can log in from anywhere.

1081
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:40,280
I'm going to briefly enter the game

1082
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:40,280
space, but then we're going to actually

1083
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,400
So here we're already in the middle of

1084
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:47,520
the game. This is a puzzle adventure

1085
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:49,520
game. And um the plot is someone stolen

1086
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:51,440
my pet. I've tracked it down to this

1087
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:53,599
underground factory that's being run by

1088
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,280
monsters with the help of remember

1089
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:58,960
there's middle schoolers with the help

1090
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:02,240
of um a mysterious woman with kind of

1091
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:04,160
bluish skin and wings um I've been given

1092
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:07,119
a monster costume. So in the guise of a

1093
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:09,040
monster myself

1094
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:11,280
I can go around and sort of do jobs at

1095
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,800
the factory find my pet figure out what

1096
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:16,800
what the monsters are up to which is

1097
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:18,480
indeed no good. Um, and uh, I'm in the

1098
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:21,200
middle of this game, so I've already ran

1099
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,480
some. There's a sequence of rooms, which

1100
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,000
part of the game is just finding the

1101
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,560
room where the puzzles are. So, for

1102
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,560
example, we're going here.

1103
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:29,560
Uh,

1104
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:35,200
one of the wings of the factory.

1105
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:37,280
There's 100 doors here, and I can click

1106
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:39,280
on every door if I have to, but I have I

1107
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:44,000
get map, which is itself a mathematical

1108
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:46,400
tool to find where I want to go. Um

1109
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,720
and uh and as I go through each each

1110
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:50,480
room represents a different puzzle. Um

1111
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:55,240
anyway, having said that, I want to

1112
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:55,240
actually go back and oh the other big

1113
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,760
the other big feature in an egg is that

1114
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,200
um

1115
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,839
you play on teams and you can

1116
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:06,880
communicate with your teammates um

1117
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:09,040
through this communicator.

1118
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:10,560
Um, and the reason there is to actually

1119
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,800
get kids reading and writing about what

1120
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:14,160
they're doing with math because if you

1121
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,359
want to help your teammates, but you

1122
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,720
can't give each other the answers

1123
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:21,119
because you'll see we're about to play a

1124
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:22,160
puzzle. Um, every uh every puzzle is

1125
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,599
every time you play it's a different

1126
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,880
solution. So, you can't tell each other

1127
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:28,319
the answer. All you can do is talk about

1128
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:29,440
your strategies. So,

1129
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:33,400
you're going to leave your game and go

1130
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:33,400
to puzzle mode play.

1131
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,680
This is like a shortcut.

1132
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,880
>> Yeah. Shortcut to puzzles, right? You

1133
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,400
don't have to play in the in the context

1134
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:50,280
of the game. You play any puzzle that

1135
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,280
you want. Um,

1136
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,520
well, I'm going to try one. I don't I've

1137
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:56,160
never played this with a group before.

1138
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:58,319
So, usually uh usually I pick the same

1139
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,520
game play because I get used to playing

1140
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:03,200
with people. But let's just try this

1141
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:06,720
one. This will be a real

1142
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:08,319
I think I try level one.

1143
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,920
>> Okay. So, you So, I'm trying to remember

1144
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:13,040
what you know here. You have to

1145
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:15,119
basically you're in the fac the shipping

1146
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:17,839
area and you've got to come up with a

1147
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:19,520
manifest to um ship the number of

1148
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:22,160
objects that you've got. That's all you

1149
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:23,280
know. Okay. You got to give it the right

1150
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:25,680
you got to basically give them the right

1151
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:30,760
instructions to ship it. And so, now

1152
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:30,760
just tell me what to do here.

1153
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,359
Quick.

1154
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,920
>> Yeah.

1155
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:39,240
>> Okay. Of course. And that's what you

1156
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:39,240
know kids

1157
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,920
up into the

1158
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:45,200
>> drag. Okay.

1159
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:47,280
>> Up into the slots up there as one zeros.

1160
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:49,599
>> Okay.

1161
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:51,760
>> Can we put that crazy fish head second

1162
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:52,880
to the right on everyone in the equal

1163
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:55,920
spot?

1164
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,960
>> Yes, you can.

1165
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,040
>> Yeah.

1166
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:02,760
>> You want to try in the equal spot? Go

1167
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:02,760
equals on this one.

1168
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,119
>> Just tell me what your thinking was.

1169
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:10,560
>> Well, it looks like we're trying to

1170
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:13,760
build math equations and usually they

1171
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:16,079
end with equals something

1172
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:17,359
>> and you saw the Now, just so you know,

1173
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:19,200
the equation that we're going to build,

1174
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:20,560
you're right. And just as a short, this

1175
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,680
is not about arithmetic. The equations

1176
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,359
are simple. I'm not interested in

1177
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:25,760
drilling kids at arithmetic. This is

1178
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:27,760
really about the fact about uh number

1179
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:29,280
systems and

1180
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:31,040
that number systems are just symbol

1181
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,480
systems. But there's also some algebra

1182
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:34,720
that's going to go on as we start to do

1183
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:36,240
this too. And at higher levels of the

1184
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,760
puzzle, this gets into other basics. You

1185
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:41,359
start doing stuff in base two and base

1186
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:43,200
six which sort of dubtales with the

1187
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:44,240
notion that that number that our

1188
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:49,040
representation of numbers are

1189
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:51,680
disembodied. So zero a one a one zero

1190
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:54,079
doesn't have to always mean 10. It's

1191
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,800
It's just a symbol. Anyway, so now what

1192
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:57,359
should we do?

1193
00:46:54,800 --> 00:47:00,079
>> Pac-Man should be minus because the only

1194
00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:00,880
ones with six digits have Pac-Man as the

1195
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:01,920
third digit.

1196
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,400
>> Sounds good.

1197
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:08,760
>> Okay. I'm not sure which one is

1198
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:08,760
>> right. This guy

1199
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:23,440
>> thing is if you look at the top left

1200
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:25,280
then what is the twodigit number that

1201
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:29,359
minus the last digit gives a single

1202
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:30,640
digit number. So 24

1203
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:32,000
>> so yeah

1204
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,520
>> oh that's a good point. Yeah, it has to

1205
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,960
be divided by

1206
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,319
>> Yeah. Yeah. See, but but now what you're

1207
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,560
really doing is thinking about the

1208
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:40,240
structure of sort of math, which is

1209
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:42,240
exactly what we want.

1210
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:44,880
>> So, what you say that is divided?

1211
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:47,200
>> Yeah.

1212
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:50,200
>> So, I'm going to guess the banana is

1213
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,200
four.

1214
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:54,400
>> And you want to say why?

1215
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:56,880
>> Four. Oh, because well, like using that

1216
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:58,800
same logic, that first equation, it's

1217
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:02,800
something

1218
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:06,079
nxid x= some single number.

1219
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:08,160
>> I'm guessing X is four.

1220
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:10,880
>> By the way, I think by the way, you guys

1221
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:12,240
have have avoided have not noticed a

1222
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:15,839
piece of information which would make

1223
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:16,960
your work even more um

1224
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:19,119
>> what's that thing?

1225
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,400
>> The thing at the top.

1226
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:22,800
>> What's the thing at the top?

1227
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,640
>> The thing at the bottom.

1228
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,000
>> Oh, it could be two actually as well.

1229
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,480
>> What are all the green things? Can we

1230
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,359
click one?

1231
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:30,000
>> Those are the things you're shipping.

1232
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:30,800
Those are jars of stuff. Oh, pepper. Oh,

1233
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,680
that makes sense.

1234
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,240
>> Banana something banana

1235
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:36,000
>> banana

1236
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:38,720
>> equals

1237
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:42,760
>> something banana.

1238
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:42,760
>> So try banana.

1239
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:48,319
>> Well, banana could actually be two cuz

1240
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:51,319
12

1241
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:51,319
doubles

1242
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:57,359
36.

1243
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:59,359
>> 5 * 5 is 25.

1244
00:48:57,359 --> 00:49:00,640
Oh, with in that respect that means the

1245
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:03,040
little um the four.

1246
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:04,720
>> Yeah, the four squares is times.

1247
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,680
>> We try that.

1248
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,559
>> Has to be 01.

1249
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,839
>> By the way, every time you play the

1250
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:10,240
game, the symbols are different. I mean,

1251
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:15,200
the same symbols, but they're different.

1252
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:16,400
>> Triple dash has to be Oh, no.

1253
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,520
>> You're still missing a piece of

1254
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,520
information, but that's okay. That's

1255
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:21,119
what games are all about.

1256
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:22,720
>> So, what's this thing in the top left?

1257
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:24,559
Can we like put things in there and

1258
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:28,640
press enter? And will it evaluate them

1259
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:32,520
for us? Um, yeah, but right now you're

1260
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:32,520
not done yet until decid.

1261
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:44,240
>> Oh, triple dash is one because one times

1262
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:46,480
banana is bananas.

1263
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:49,720
>> Unless banana is zero.

1264
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,720
>> But I can't

1265
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:55,359
banana.

1266
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:57,040
>> That would be a banana. six. I think

1267
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:59,119
>> by the way, I've never done this game

1268
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:00,240
before. You know, the fact that you're

1269
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:02,660
naming all these symbols, which of

1270
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:05,830
course they were just symbols.

1271
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:05,830
[Music]

1272
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:09,920
>> What am I telling you? I can tell that

1273
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:12,640
you're wrong.

1274
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:13,280
>> I think banana because it's banana

1275
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:15,760
banana.

1276
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:16,960
>> So, banana squared is equal to something

1277
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:18,400
times banana.

1278
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,839
>> Not as many times.

1279
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:22,400
>> So, yeah, it could be 25.

1280
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:23,599
>> It could be five banana. Now remember, I

1281
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,680
didn't know the solution to this when it

1282
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:27,440
came in, but I actually have enough data

1283
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:28,960
to know that you're wrong.

1284
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:32,559
>> No, it's on the screen.

1285
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:33,200
>> Banana definitely is

1286
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:36,400
>> five.

1287
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:41,040
>> It's five because banana squared is uh

1288
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:43,680
>> something is like anchor banana but uh

1289
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:45,520
but flower banana divided by banana is

1290
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:48,400
also an integer.

1291
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:50,480
So if flower banana and anchor banana

1292
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:52,480
are a multiple of banana, then banana

1293
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,880
should be five and not six.

1294
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:57,240
>> Yes,

1295
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:57,240
>> because flower minus anchor time.

1296
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:00,880
>> I love your math.

1297
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:03,280
>> All right. No, that's good. So you're

1298
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,400
saying it's what? I think it's

1299
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,680
>> okay.

1300
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,520
>> Well, it could work, but you could have

1301
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:09,440
done it in a simpler way

1302
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:10,880
>> or you could have surmised it. Not known

1303
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:12,240
it, but surmise. Remember this wasn't

1304
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,520
the first thing like subsequent times

1305
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,240
you'd have other information you don't

1306
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:16,400
have. So,

1307
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:18,559
>> oh yeah,

1308
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:20,480
the number of blocks

1309
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:22,880
25.

1310
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:25,280
>> Oh, so the maximum number is 25.

1311
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:26,720
>> That's what you're actually

1312
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:28,160
sort of short. So, normally in the group

1313
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:30,960
I don't give away this much. So, give it

1314
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:33,920
away. But in fact, you're making a ship.

1315
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:35,680
That's sort of those that's the describe

1316
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,800
the thing on the pallet.

1317
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,680
>> So, anchor is 20.

1318
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,400
>> Anchor's two.

1319
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,599
>> Yeah.

1320
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,200
>> Sorry. Two.

1321
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:46,720
>> You call this the anchor. Yeah.

1322
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:47,760
>> Anchors anchors to claw. Claw zero.

1323
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:50,720
>> Wait, where's claw?

1324
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:53,040
>> Claw is the one on the top left

1325
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:54,640
>> of of the squares that are left.

1326
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:56,960
>> Oh, you mean press circles. That makes

1327
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:58,240
sense.

1328
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:59,119
>> Yep.

1329
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,920
>> Oh. Oh, that

1330
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:02,960
>> that's zero. Has to be zero.

1331
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:04,559
>> Wait, why is it zero?

1332
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,280
>> Uh cuz if you look at the the equation

1333
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:07,280
at the bottom,

1334
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:09,280
>> wrong one. I'm looking wrong.

1335
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,480
>> It's definitely

1336
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:12,079
zero. Ninja star is four.

1337
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:16,800
>> Ninja star is four

1338
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:20,920
>> which contains epsilon is five.

1339
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,920
>> Wait, dude.

1340
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:25,040
>> Nine. No, I guess it is a sigma.

1341
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:28,680
>> Sigma is nine. Sigma is nine.

1342
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:28,680
>> Yeah, sigma is nine.

1343
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,680
>> Uh, see

1344
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,160
>> wait.

1345
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:40,160
>> Okay. It shows the other

1346
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:43,119
>> like the scythe is scythe is a plus.

1347
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:44,960
Scythe is plus.

1348
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:49,240
>> No, it has to be minus.

1349
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:49,240
>> No, it has to be something.

1350
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:55,359
>> And then uh the crescent moon dot the

1351
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:58,240
banana banana is three.

1352
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:58,240
>> Oh, that's banana.

1353
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:09,280
The sticks is

1354
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:12,680
>> No, I'm not talking about that one.

1355
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,680
>> Look at the bottom.

1356
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:21,319
No, I was talking about

1357
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:21,319
>> the backwards thing has to be triangles.

1358
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:25,920
>> That one the triangle

1359
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,160
that one that looks kind of like the

1360
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,839
last one.

1361
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:30,160
>> But I'm just curious anyone who who was

1362
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:31,839
having trouble and and this happens in

1363
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:33,359
the group and so please anyone have

1364
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:35,599
trouble following it as people were

1365
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:37,520
making stuff up finding stuff because if

1366
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:39,440
you did it's okay. In fact, sometimes

1367
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:41,440
you got to play the game yourself for it

1368
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:42,800
to make sense. So I didn't have said in

1369
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:44,559
front of the crowd. I could have told

1370
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,800
you. I actually think I could have told

1371
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:47,920
you a lot about the game going into it

1372
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:49,040
and there would still be a high

1373
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:51,359
probability that when you started

1374
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:53,119
playing it, you would have not absorbed

1375
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:54,640
anything I'd say. That's my experience.

1376
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:55,680
I can almost give it a wall away and

1377
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,480
people still don't get it until they

1378
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:58,720
play it.

1379
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:03,559
>> So theta talks about the value of play.

1380
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:03,559
>> Theta doubles upside down as eight.

1381
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:07,800
No, not really.

1382
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:12,119
Quickly enter that now.

1383
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:14,559
All right.

1384
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,280
>> Oh, so now you have to type in one times

1385
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:16,960
whatever equals

1386
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:18,240
>> you have to type in what this is. So

1387
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:20,000
this actually is getting at an alternate

1388
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:22,400
another representation.

1389
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,720
>> So let's see

1390
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:26,559
>> 8 + 9

1391
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,760
>> 8 + 9 is 17.

1392
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:31,640
>> All right, let's try that. And then here

1393
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:31,640
you don't actually have to remember

1394
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:38,520
just divide by six, right?

1395
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:55,839
P

1396
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:56,640
is the top right time. It's puzzle mode.

1397
00:54:55,839 --> 00:54:58,000
>> So 56.

1398
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:01,319
>> Yeah. And by the way, it can take it in

1399
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,319
either order.

1400
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:09,559
library=

1401
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:09,559
52.

1402
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:15,000
>> I think there's only addition in this

1403
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:15,000
level. There's only addition.

1404
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,640
>> We actually come up with a way of

1405
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,920
representing subtraction division plus

1406
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:24,800
>> 2. Yeah.

1407
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:26,960
>> Or we could do 10us 2.

1408
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:28,960
>> Anyway, I just point out that that when

1409
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,880
you were solving that, you were doing

1410
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:32,319
10us. when you were solving for those

1411
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:35,040
numbers, you were doing Algeb, you were

1412
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:37,440
really sort of thinking about X and the

1413
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:39,599
structure of the math and and the the

1414
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:41,119
numerical quality of it and and like I

1415
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:42,400
said, now this is simpler, but it's

1416
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:43,760
still getting at the fact that that

1417
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,880
there are multiple ways of representing

1418
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,319
numbers and quantities.

1419
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,839
>> Is there any mechanic to prevent like

1420
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:49,599
brute force,

1421
00:55:47,839 --> 00:55:50,559
>> you run out of yes, those lights go out,

1422
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:52,720
you run out,

1423
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:55,200
>> but you do earn points along the way in

1424
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:57,280
the game if you make some progress. And

1425
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:59,200
so we we try not none of these puzzles

1426
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:00,960
are brick walls because you can always

1427
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:02,799
play multiple puzzles at once. You can

1428
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:04,720
leave this puzzle go to another puzzle.

1429
00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:06,079
And if you do make any progress at all,

1430
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:07,440
you're accumulating points for the end

1431
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:08,799
of the game. You can actually get to the

1432
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:11,359
end of the game story without having to

1433
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:13,200
solve any puzzles. Takes a long time.

1434
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:14,799
The rewards are there for doing well.

1435
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:17,119
And there are rewards for doing well,

1436
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:20,160
but there isn't punishment for not doing

1437
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:22,079
well. There isn't sort of a we don't say

1438
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:24,880
you can't we don't we don't make you

1439
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:25,760
sort of stop in the tracks.

1440
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,799
You can do it again.

1441
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:28,079
>> Yes, that's right. You can do it again

1442
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:30,240
instantaneously.

1443
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:32,799
>> And there's no cost. There is no cost in

1444
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:36,000
the game to having failed

1445
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:37,440
repeatedly. It's not if you eventually

1446
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,040
solve it, you end up with the same score

1447
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:42,400
whether you solve it on the 20th time or

1448
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:43,839
the first time. This um that's what

1449
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:46,480
really problem solving about is not

1450
00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:49,280
about being the fastest. It's just it's

1451
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:51,520
just about learning how to solve things.

1452
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:54,880
Speed speed is underrated.

1453
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:56,079
And in math it's much very you know big

1454
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:59,040
kids think they have to be able to do

1455
00:56:56,079 --> 00:57:00,240
calculations in their heads. Anyway I

1456
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:02,480
don't want to go any I mean it's just

1457
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:03,839
more of this and higher levels we do

1458
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:05,440
have come up with we came up with

1459
00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:07,839
representations of subtraction which is

1460
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:09,920
that you have like a large number like

1461
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:13,640
you have 10 jars and five of them are

1462
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:13,640
empty so it's 10us.

1463
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:19,680
>> How is division?

1464
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:20,880
>> Um are they 10 rows of jars?

1465
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:23,680
rows are empty.

1466
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:25,760
>> Yeah, I think it's the same. I think

1467
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:28,799
that's it. I think that's the same. Ah,

1468
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:31,920
it's in the it's in the it's in a grid

1469
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:32,720
pattern. Um

1470
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:35,280
so,

1471
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:36,960
>> and how would you do uh I guess uh

1472
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:40,559
there's algebra in there, but do you

1473
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:42,720
have any algebra such this like format?

1474
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:44,640
Uh no no but what so what we encourage

1475
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:46,400
is that so what comes with this is

1476
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:48,559
material for teachers to relate this to

1477
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:50,319
the curriculum and what we really want

1478
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:52,160
to happen is the kids have played the

1479
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:54,319
game before they get the subject where

1480
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:56,559
the teacher introduces symbol systems or

1481
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:59,119
base six or whatever it is that relates

1482
00:57:56,559 --> 00:58:00,960
to this instead of saying all right you

1483
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:02,559
start up a new unit you are get you

1484
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:04,240
again know nothing we're start you're

1485
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:05,839
starting again at square one and have to

1486
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:08,079
start all over again with something new

1487
00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:10,000
instead the teacher comes in and says I

1488
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:12,079
want to introduce a new concept but it's

1489
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,960
one that you've really already begun to

1490
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:17,119
master and uh it's called basis. It's

1491
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:18,640
called basis and it pulls up, you know,

1492
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:20,400
the higher level of this game. How did

1493
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:23,760
you solve this? What was going on in

1494
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:24,799
this game? Um and they have a

1495
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:28,160
conversation about what they already

1496
00:58:24,799 --> 00:58:31,119
know as a way of leveraging into

1497
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:32,960
leveraging what I mean I arguably don't

1498
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:34,720
know. I mean I don't I again I would

1499
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:36,319
argue that the way we deal with bases by

1500
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:38,480
the way is you have boxes, you have

1501
00:58:36,319 --> 00:58:42,480
things in cartons. So a carton of six

1502
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:44,240
jars plus some leftover would be a

1503
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:47,200
carton of six jars plus three left over

1504
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:51,599
would be one three in basics.

1505
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:52,880
So uh so anyway the point is that the

1506
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:54,559
kids begin to build up this sort of

1507
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:55,839
robust conceptual understanding and

1508
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:57,359
hopefully with a play a sense of

1509
00:58:55,839 --> 00:58:58,720
playfulness about it so that when the

1510
00:58:57,359 --> 00:59:00,880
teacher talks about it it's something

1511
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:03,280
they actually feel kind of good about

1512
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:04,559
instead of here's one more here's one

1513
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:06,880
more reason you'll ever be a

1514
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:08,799
mathematician which I think math

1515
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:10,640
education is largely designed to gate

1516
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:12,240
everybody so that at the end of the high

1517
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:14,480
school only 7% of the population thinks

1518
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:16,960
they're good at math which means that

1519
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:18,400
we've taken 12 years teaching 93% of the

1520
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:20,079
population no better than math and they

1521
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:21,599
should stop doing it and I don't know

1522
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:24,559
why we waste 12 years we could just tell

1523
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:25,839
everyone to kindergarten um but that's

1524
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:27,280
sort of what we end up doing anyway I

1525
00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:30,480
think that's true with every subject

1526
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:31,599
that's how you know the number is so I'd

1527
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:33,680
like to turn it around where everyone

1528
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:36,680
says there's things about math I can do

1529
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:36,680
that

1530
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:44,160
>> yeah can I talk a little bit maybe about

1531
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:46,559
how that process

1532
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:48,720
>> sure I also wanted that provide a little

1533
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:51,119
extra nuance to one of the questions

1534
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:54,000
about what if you just brute force your

1535
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:55,839
way through it and the higher levels um

1536
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,000
it won't tell you when you put a symbol

1537
00:59:55,839 --> 00:59:58,559
in a spot whether it's correct or not.

1538
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,920
>> Yeah.

1539
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:01,200
>> So which actually you can learn

1540
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:04,400
something kind of interesting because

1541
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:06,079
you can start doing something like

1542
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,760
suddenly you end up with something that

1543
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:10,319
doesn't add up. That's actually mean

1544
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:12,640
you're learning something.

1545
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:15,520
>> So

1546
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:22,960
there's 10 puzzles or how many nine

1547
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:27,359
puzzles and we came up with 9 plus x and

1548
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:29,760
some of that x was uh

1549
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:32,880
slated for implementation and we never

1550
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:35,040
got there and some of that x was uh

1551
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:36,960
puzzles or activities that we ended up

1552
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:39,760
deciding deciding were not as compelling

1553
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:42,319
as the others and our process for that

1554
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:44,880
uh we did a hybrid approach with paper

1555
01:00:42,319 --> 01:00:46,400
and computer programing And in general,

1556
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:48,480
the rule is if it can be paper

1557
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:51,119
prototyped, paper prototype it. It's so

1558
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:52,559
much faster. Uh but there are certain

1559
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:54,400
kinds of activities that really can't.

1560
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:56,400
So for instance, this one is perfect for

1561
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:58,720
for paper prototyping. You just take out

1562
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:01,440
a piece of paper and a pen and you

1563
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:03,839
create uh I mean you have to create some

1564
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:06,000
of these uh equations so that you then

1565
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:07,760
have a system of equations to solve. But

1566
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,839
once you've created some of those data

1567
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:12,000
sets which would need to be done whether

1568
01:01:09,839 --> 01:01:13,839
it's a paper or a computer prototype

1569
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,680
then it's trivial to put it in front of

1570
01:01:13,839 --> 01:01:19,119
someone with paper. So this is an

1571
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:22,720
example of something where we would uh

1572
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:26,880
for the first round test internally with

1573
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:29,440
just symbols and numbers and then uh

1574
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:31,280
probably we would do we might even test

1575
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:33,440
that version with people in our target

1576
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:36,640
audience. But probably we would try to

1577
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:38,640
do some rudimentary art treatment

1578
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:40,079
>> uh before we put it in front of people

1579
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:41,359
just so there's a little bit of context

1580
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:43,520
and it looks a little bit more like a

1581
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:45,280
game. And then in general

1582
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:46,880
>> and sometimes we try to if there's story

1583
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:49,440
this one has less story about it but if

1584
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:51,760
there's story as you are in some places

1585
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:53,200
we actually try to act it out even I

1586
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:55,119
mean you have to sort of get over your

1587
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:57,119
resistance to doing that you sort of act

1588
01:01:55,119 --> 01:02:00,079
out the character in even if it's you're

1589
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:01,599
the computer when you do and so even if

1590
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:03,920
it's just a character giving a response

1591
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:05,839
to something that the player does um you

1592
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:07,599
try to do it in character you try to get

1593
01:02:05,839 --> 01:02:09,520
a sense of what because I think even

1594
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:10,640
even in that kind of rudimentary form

1595
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:11,839
you are engaging the player's

1596
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:13,440
imagination

1597
01:02:11,839 --> 01:02:18,200
So you know whether or not they're

1598
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:18,200
interested in this character or the ide

1599
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:25,359
>> and like a dungeon master you need to

1600
01:02:22,799 --> 01:02:27,040
prepare because it's hard to be the

1601
01:02:25,359 --> 01:02:28,559
computer without also being the

1602
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:28,960
bottleneck if you're a human.

1603
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:32,000
>> Yeah.

1604
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:33,520
>> So uh and in fact we've done some game

1605
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:36,240
not represented here. We've done some

1606
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:39,359
games uh that are real time that if you

1607
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:41,359
want to prototype with people and then

1608
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:42,720
especially on paper and you want to keep

1609
01:02:41,359 --> 01:02:44,799
things moving then you need to have more

1610
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:46,640
than one person be the computer because

1611
01:02:44,799 --> 01:02:49,200
there's just too much to track for one

1612
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:52,079
person do it all. Um or if you want to

1613
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:53,839
do sometimes we do hybrids where we'll

1614
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:55,280
do a computer prototype but there's

1615
01:02:53,839 --> 01:02:56,640
aspects of the game that are not

1616
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:58,480
represented through the interface or

1617
01:02:56,640 --> 01:03:02,000
that logically we haven't modeled and so

1618
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:04,799
we'll do you know players directing

1619
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:08,880
human interactions with the computer or

1620
01:03:04,799 --> 01:03:10,559
uh I guess not players designers uh you

1621
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:12,079
know

1622
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:13,839
influencing

1623
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:16,799
those interactions. So anyway, this is a

1624
01:03:13,839 --> 01:03:19,359
game that uh moved pretty much all the

1625
01:03:16,799 --> 01:03:21,039
way to final design on paper and then

1626
01:03:19,359 --> 01:03:22,799
went straight to implementation. Some of

1627
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:27,920
the other games, so for instance,

1628
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:28,799
there's a game um you want to show bats

1629
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:32,000
maybe.

1630
01:03:28,799 --> 01:03:33,760
>> Bats. Yeah.

1631
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,920
>> That's an example of a game that's a

1632
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:37,280
little bit harder to think about playing

1633
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:39,520
just on paper.

1634
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:40,960
>> I just want to think we implemented this

1635
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:44,079
early.

1636
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:44,079
>> Yeah, we did.

1637
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:55,280
So this is a game um about

1638
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:58,400
modular arithmetic

1639
01:03:55,280 --> 01:04:01,119
>> and common multiples and that sort of

1640
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:02,880
thing. So it's very hard to see on the

1641
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:03,440
screen. In the upper left there is an

1642
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:06,760
avatar.

1643
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:06,760
>> There's you

1644
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:12,880
>> and you know from the story that your

1645
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:15,280
goal is to get the golden eggs.

1646
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:17,520
and avoid this guy that that much you

1647
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:20,720
know and you're in a factory where they

1648
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:21,760
mix stuff. So

1649
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:23,839
>> let's put

1650
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:27,160
>> Do you move your avatar

1651
01:04:23,839 --> 01:04:27,160
>> one and two?

1652
01:04:30,820 --> 01:04:35,640
[Music]

1653
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:35,640
>> What?

1654
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:42,400
>> Oh

1655
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:45,400
>> how about one in class? Oh, with 11. All

1656
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:45,400
right.

1657
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:49,359
[Music]

1658
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:50,720
>> Yeah.

1659
01:04:49,359 --> 01:04:53,039
>> Yeah.

1660
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:57,039
>> There is one flaw, by the way, in the in

1661
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:58,079
the fence in the um interface. People

1662
01:04:57,039 --> 01:05:00,000
don't realize they're going to have to

1663
01:04:58,079 --> 01:05:02,400
click to get their guy onto that

1664
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:05,440
>> thing. And it was supposed to start with

1665
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:07,599
with it up right where he was so that

1666
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:09,920
people

1667
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:12,920
now. What should I try now?

1668
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:12,920
>> Four.

1669
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:18,400
>> What?

1670
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:19,200
>> Six.

1671
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:20,240
>> Or four.

1672
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:24,119
>> Why? Four.

1673
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:24,119
>> Six. Then you can move against.

1674
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:32,960
Bam.

1675
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:33,599
>> Four is stuck at the top.

1676
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:34,960
>> Oh, can we move?

1677
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:36,640
>> But you'll notice that these bats all

1678
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:38,720
are different amounts. And so it's

1679
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:41,119
really about modular arithmetic. So

1680
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:43,599
what's 12 will take you once around on

1681
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:46,720
one of them, but it'll take one and

1682
01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:48,559
third around on on another one. And and

1683
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:50,960
you start doing simultaneous equations

1684
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:52,880
to solve to solve this. This is this

1685
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:54,319
level is hard. I I think maybe the

1686
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:56,319
hardest puzzle we designed the whole

1687
01:05:54,319 --> 01:05:58,640
game is level three of this where you've

1688
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:59,920
got to every step you've got to align

1689
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:00,880
two bridges.

1690
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:02,720
>> Oh, that's fun.

1691
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:04,160
>> And yeah, it's it's serious work.

1692
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:05,359
>> Oh, you're trying to avoid that monster.

1693
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:05,839
>> Yeah, you kind of avoid the monster.

1694
01:06:05,359 --> 01:06:07,200
>> Oh, okay.

1695
01:06:05,839 --> 01:06:08,319
>> Which isn't always hard, but but you do

1696
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:09,440
have you have to sort of keep in mind

1697
01:06:08,319 --> 01:06:11,200
sometimes it means instead of going

1698
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:14,240
around once like nine, you know, instead

1699
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:18,880
of going one on the nine thing, maybe

1700
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:20,480
you go um 10 and that'll c and he'll

1701
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:22,000
he'll always go on the grid that shows

1702
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:24,240
up. So maybe that'll cause another

1703
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:26,720
bridge to show up and get your way. So

1704
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:27,039
this is really Chinese.

1705
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:29,920
>> What?

1706
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:31,839
>> Yes.

1707
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:33,520
>> Anyway, again,

1708
01:06:31,839 --> 01:06:35,359
you know, you can play a game without

1709
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:37,119
without think about math school math at

1710
01:06:35,359 --> 01:06:39,200
all. There's no school math in this

1711
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:40,799
game.

1712
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:42,480
>> But I think there are really interesting

1713
01:06:40,799 --> 01:06:44,079
things to think about.

1714
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:46,079
>> But I think I want to highlight what you

1715
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:49,440
just said with the character if he walks

1716
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:51,119
or not. Like I think if we far it's

1717
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:52,319
clear anyway, but You have to keep in

1718
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:53,920
mind there are two forms of learning.

1719
01:06:52,319 --> 01:06:55,440
One one is learning the game, how to

1720
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:57,520
play the game. The other one is the

1721
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:59,039
learning like the the problem solving or

1722
01:06:57,520 --> 01:07:01,440
the puzzle in the game. And I I think

1723
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:03,280
it's sometimes especially my experience

1724
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:04,240
in educational games. It's so easy to

1725
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:05,839
mix it. Yeah.

1726
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:07,440
>> You know, because sometimes you make it

1727
01:07:05,839 --> 01:07:09,599
cool that it's educational game and it's

1728
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:11,440
really interesting but but you know like

1729
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:13,440
for inance the character wouldn't move

1730
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:14,720
if you don't press the mouse button. So

1731
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:16,559
he would always stand there in the

1732
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:18,240
beginning and he would get that effect

1733
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:20,559
you know. And I think the mixture of

1734
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:22,079
both forms of learning is quite

1735
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:23,039
interesting to keep in mind when you

1736
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:24,559
prototyping.

1737
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:26,319
>> Yeah. And it's actually there's two

1738
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:28,079
there's two add that one is I never

1739
01:07:26,319 --> 01:07:29,839
think just because you want people to

1740
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:30,880
think hard. I don't think the interface

1741
01:07:29,839 --> 01:07:32,960
should be the thing they have to think

1742
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:35,359
hard about. It's always tempting to say

1743
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:36,880
oh that's really good and t that's a

1744
01:07:35,359 --> 01:07:38,960
really hard thing to solve. How do I you

1745
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:40,799
know how do I make them jump? But no, I

1746
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:42,000
mean I think generally it should not be

1747
01:07:40,799 --> 01:07:45,280
hard to figure out how to make him in

1748
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:47,599
trouble walk left or right or how to

1749
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:50,079
open a door or you know unless that's a

1750
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:51,680
puzzle and it's easy to delude yourself

1751
01:07:50,079 --> 01:07:53,200
that by making the interface hard. On

1752
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:55,839
the other hand, there is this other

1753
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:57,520
challenge which is that kids do have

1754
01:07:55,839 --> 01:07:59,359
different degrees of sort of literacy

1755
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:01,039
around games and it's hard to figure out

1756
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:02,799
the sweet spot of this. That's one I

1757
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:04,160
don't have an easy answer for because

1758
01:08:02,799 --> 01:08:06,640
some large percentage of the audience

1759
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:08,799
naturally knows, you know, try to get to

1760
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:10,400
the edge, try to, you know, knows what

1761
01:08:08,799 --> 01:08:12,160
winning means. But there's some kids who

1762
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:13,760
don't. And the question is, do you if

1763
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:16,239
you make the game, if you bend over it

1764
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:18,239
backwards, like if if tried to do I I

1765
01:08:16,239 --> 01:08:21,679
watched my mother play this and it was

1766
01:08:18,239 --> 01:08:23,600
horrible. Um because she just didn't she

1767
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:25,279
just was totally clueless about where to

1768
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:28,560
go with this. But I think if I tried to

1769
01:08:25,279 --> 01:08:30,480
set up the game to work for my mother um

1770
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:33,120
you it would only work with all this

1771
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:35,279
explicit instruction that so so they

1772
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:37,120
hopefully with kids it's less of an

1773
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:39,199
issue that they there's more I think

1774
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:41,440
uniform game literacy but it's always a

1775
01:08:39,199 --> 01:08:44,159
challenge. No game appeals to everybody

1776
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:45,120
and you do want I don't think we I don't

1777
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:46,560
think those of us who make learning

1778
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:48,000
games have a good answer to that. I

1779
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:52,319
don't think we can ever make a game that

1780
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:54,080
every kid will play with equal fervor

1781
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:57,120
and we should never claim that you know

1782
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:58,719
that we're going to get 100% on that.

1783
01:08:57,120 --> 01:09:01,040
>> Um,

1784
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:04,480
>> one thing that I know that uh you've

1785
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:07,600
you've noticed uh is the amount of

1786
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:11,279
tolerance that kids and adults have for

1787
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:14,480
frustration. You know, when when I seen

1788
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:17,120
kids say, "I hate this game. This game

1789
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:20,239
is too hard." And they will just keep

1790
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:23,440
keep going at it.

1791
01:09:20,239 --> 01:09:25,679
You adults have this tendency to get

1792
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:26,640
really embarrassed if they console the

1793
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:30,560
first time.

1794
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:31,839
>> It happens when you're uh 26

1795
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:33,679
and you suddenly sit down and say,

1796
01:09:31,839 --> 01:09:34,960
"Well, I'm not very good at this."

1797
01:09:33,679 --> 01:09:36,400
People who were you may you may have

1798
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:37,759
been a gamer all your life, but at some

1799
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:39,759
point it's it's what having another

1800
01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:40,880
adult watching you. I don't know. You

1801
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:42,159
know, there's some point in life when

1802
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:43,920
you suddenly say, "Oh, I'm not good at

1803
01:09:42,159 --> 01:09:46,159
this."

1804
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:49,359
I don't know why why it happens, but it

1805
01:09:46,159 --> 01:09:49,359
doesn't it hasn't happened.

1806
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:53,319
useful.

1807
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:56,960
>> Can you negative numbers?

1808
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:58,640
>> Uh, not on this one. No, that's a good

1809
01:09:56,960 --> 01:10:00,159
idea though. It's initially thought.

1810
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:01,600
Yeah, we didn't think about

1811
01:10:00,159 --> 01:10:03,280
>> Well, you could in modular arithmetic.

1812
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:06,239
You could always do it as just put in a

1813
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:08,880
larger number.

1814
01:10:06,239 --> 01:10:11,199
>> I I have a question for content because

1815
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:13,600
so far we've been hearing from you guys

1816
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:17,360
about coming more or less from a design

1817
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:20,480
from a game design angle into playing

1818
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:22,000
games for as a learning purpose and you

1819
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:24,000
kind of came the other way around. You

1820
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:26,400
came in from the education and pedagogy

1821
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:28,320
side. Are there things to keep in mind

1822
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:33,199
when you're working across disciplines

1823
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:37,120
that you might need to know?

1824
01:10:33,199 --> 01:10:39,840
>> Yeah. Um, so I think I I think one one

1825
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:41,760
one difference that I still have um or

1826
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:43,360
see between the way I approach games and

1827
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:45,920
the way educational games approaching

1828
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:47,920
games is I'm I'm I'm more focusing on on

1829
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:49,840
learning as an experience like more in

1830
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:50,960
abstract form. It doesn't mean that I

1831
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:53,120
wouldn't be interested in that but

1832
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:56,080
that's not what I've been working on yet

1833
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:59,600
here. Um so for instance in in after it

1834
01:10:56,080 --> 01:11:02,000
was so the re research question was how

1835
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:05,520
can players overcome expectations that

1836
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:08,800
are wrong and um and I didn't um so the

1837
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:11,600
idea was not to use um educational stuff

1838
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:14,640
like numbers or whatever but more can we

1839
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:16,960
develop patterns in games that players

1840
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:18,640
realize very quickly and are they ready

1841
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:20,719
to give them up if they realize that

1842
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:23,440
they that they think what they've seen

1843
01:11:20,719 --> 01:11:24,560
is wrong. So um for me it was very

1844
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:27,840
interesting because I come with an

1845
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:29,679
abstract theory inside and then u so we

1846
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:30,560
were developing prototypes and it's very

1847
01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:33,040
interesting when you come from the

1848
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:35,600
abstract idea to prototypes and I

1849
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:37,840
thought paper prototyping is perfect

1850
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:39,600
because it really you know like it made

1851
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:41,120
me as a scientist come to the grounds

1852
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:42,880
you know like because I can of course I

1853
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:45,679
can read and all these people and say

1854
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:48,080
wow um experiences this and that and

1855
01:11:45,679 --> 01:11:50,640
then you suddenly have pen and paper and

1856
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:54,000
sit there and think about a game that

1857
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:57,360
kind of like is is a metaphor for your

1858
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:59,679
theory. And um so I think my so kind of

1859
01:11:57,360 --> 01:12:02,239
like my takeaway was that paper

1860
01:11:59,679 --> 01:12:04,239
prototyping was very healthy for me and

1861
01:12:02,239 --> 01:12:06,080
with the team to come down to the fact

1862
01:12:04,239 --> 01:12:07,760
what is really doable in the game. what

1863
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:09,280
can we really I think and in the

1864
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:11,679
beginning I was a bit like being not

1865
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:13,760
that experienced in prototyping like wow

1866
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:15,600
we can all do that later um we can do

1867
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:17,600
the cool stuff when when we get to

1868
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:19,280
programming but then I realized no we

1869
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:22,080
can't you know if we cannot do it as a

1870
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:23,920
paper prototype how should we do it you

1871
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:27,360
know like in programming what what what

1872
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:29,679
is changing you know and um and I think

1873
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:32,320
for us it was very interesting we had so

1874
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:35,199
I think one experience we had is we had

1875
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:37,120
them develop different prototypes and so

1876
01:12:35,199 --> 01:12:39,199
I That was healthy for us not to make

1877
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:40,800
one paper prototype and then think how

1878
01:12:39,199 --> 01:12:43,120
we can do it better. But that's what

1879
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:45,600
what what education kit anyway makes a

1880
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:48,080
lot of prototypes you know like and and

1881
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:50,159
and to stay open and even if you spend

1882
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:51,679
like three or four days on a prototype

1883
01:12:50,159 --> 01:12:53,040
if it doesn't work with others the

1884
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:54,800
moment you show them and they go like

1885
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:57,360
what like these are the rules are you

1886
01:12:54,800 --> 01:13:00,080
sure I don't get it you know and if you

1887
01:12:57,360 --> 01:13:02,000
explain the 10th time maybe maybe you

1888
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:03,760
know it was a cool idea back home or

1889
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:06,159
with your friend maybe it just doesn't

1890
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:08,000
work you know and um so this kind of

1891
01:13:06,159 --> 01:13:10,159
like experimenting with prototypes was

1892
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:12,000
very healthy for us and then coming to

1893
01:13:10,159 --> 01:13:14,000
the point and I realized for me it was

1894
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:15,679
important that somebody coming in the

1895
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:17,760
room and playing the prototype for five

1896
01:13:15,679 --> 01:13:20,400
minutes kind of like understands the

1897
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:22,080
core mechanic. If this is not happening,

1898
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:23,760
you know, like who takes the five

1899
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:25,440
minutes to understand the core mechanic,

1900
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:27,440
you know, nobody today.

1901
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:28,880
>> Be like in this game like walking onto a

1902
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:30,560
bridge.

1903
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:34,080
>> That's right. That's right.

1904
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:36,000
>> And um so yeah, I think coming from a

1905
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:39,120
different perspective again prototyping

1906
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:40,960
is kind of like the way to to to to get

1907
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:43,679
in the game, you know, even as the

1908
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:45,120
designer. Um because from then on, you

1909
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:46,480
know what you're talking about. And I

1910
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:48,560
had to lose a lot of my abstract

1911
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:51,040
thoughts in the process. and then the

1912
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:52,800
play testing you know so I so it was

1913
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:54,400
interesting sometimes to see even if the

1914
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:56,560
prototype is cool then you you have a

1915
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:58,320
prototype and then people come in and

1916
01:13:56,560 --> 01:14:00,159
say I don't I don't get it again and you

1917
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:02,800
go that can't be true you know it's so

1918
01:14:00,159 --> 01:14:05,120
easy but then you know you can start to

1919
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:07,360
stick with your idea or say no if if

1920
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:10,080
maybe I have to go down with the

1921
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:13,199
theoretical aspect and and really look

1922
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:14,800
what is suitable for the players so

1923
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:18,480
another thing about prototyping it's

1924
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:20,480
temp it's not focus groups So it it's

1925
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:22,320
not a case of it's sure you want to do

1926
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:24,560
as put it in front of as many people as

1927
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:26,880
possible but you really want to I think

1928
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:28,880
avoid stuff like what did you like what

1929
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:30,719
didn't you like those kind of questions

1930
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:32,159
because people want to be helpful and

1931
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:33,600
sometimes when what people say they

1932
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:36,239
didn't like is actually the part where

1933
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:37,440
they were working hardest you know so I

1934
01:14:36,239 --> 01:14:39,360
didn't like that I had to jump over the

1935
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:41,760
wall well in fact you have to jump over

1936
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:43,280
the wall and and it may not really mean

1937
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:44,640
that that that if you took that out they

1938
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:46,400
would enjoy the game more in fact they

1939
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:47,840
might not enjoy it at all so you have to

1940
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:48,960
be really careful about and people want

1941
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:50,480
to please you and they'll say, "Oh, it's

1942
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:52,719
good." And some of that I think it's

1943
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:56,560
really important that what you do with

1944
01:14:52,719 --> 01:14:59,199
prototyping is watch the player and then

1945
01:14:56,560 --> 01:15:01,760
trust yourself as a designer rather than

1946
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:02,880
ask them what you should do because they

1947
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:04,719
won't they'll try and be helpful and

1948
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:06,880
they'll come up with wrong suggestions.

1949
01:15:04,719 --> 01:15:08,239
watch them and try your use your best

1950
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:10,080
judgment as a designer as to what

1951
01:15:08,239 --> 01:15:12,239
they're reacting to and why they're

1952
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:14,800
reacting the way they are and try to fix

1953
01:15:12,239 --> 01:15:16,960
it and maybe ask them try to get some

1954
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:18,719
questions to try to maybe get some

1955
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:20,800
access to their thinking but don't think

1956
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:23,600
that they necessarily know what what was

1957
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:25,440
interesting to them or what how or how

1958
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:26,640
or what would make them happen. Don't

1959
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:28,320
ask those questions. Those are focus

1960
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:30,000
group questions and you shouldn't ask

1961
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:31,520
them because it's not going to give you

1962
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:34,400
the answers you want. You got to trust

1963
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:36,560
yourself at some level as well. And

1964
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:38,480
something that I also had to learn was

1965
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:40,960
if you have the focus chest or like or

1966
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:42,960
or the play test and and and then you

1967
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:44,320
you realize there are problems and it's

1968
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:46,880
really healthy to write down the

1969
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:49,040
problems and then brainstorm different

1970
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:50,719
solutions. Don't ever like when you

1971
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:52,239
discuss it, try to come up with a

1972
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:54,159
solution immediately because what

1973
01:15:52,239 --> 01:15:56,320
happens is you quickly develop one

1974
01:15:54,159 --> 01:15:57,840
solution and then you go in with another

1975
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:59,840
problem but you don't realize that

1976
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:02,159
sometimes you know like some problems

1977
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:03,600
stick together or sometimes you realize

1978
01:16:02,159 --> 01:16:05,199
wow we have so many problems just

1979
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:07,679
because of this little aspect we have in

1980
01:16:05,199 --> 01:16:09,760
the game why don't we just you know and

1981
01:16:07,679 --> 01:16:11,199
if you don't do that you start to you

1982
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:13,840
spend two hours on solving a problem

1983
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:15,600
then realize it was wrong or you never

1984
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:17,679
realize it again. to kind of like seek

1985
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:19,840
more to the problems and quick solutions

1986
01:16:17,679 --> 01:16:21,679
where you are still movable and not make

1987
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:23,440
solution solution solution and then have

1988
01:16:21,679 --> 01:16:26,320
the same problem a few weeks later

1989
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:29,679
again. Yeah, I just want to clarify

1990
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:31,520
focus test and focus uh focus group two

1991
01:16:29,679 --> 01:16:34,159
two very different things you know we're

1992
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:35,679
talking um the kinds of results you're

1993
01:16:34,159 --> 01:16:37,600
talking about focus testing which is

1994
01:16:35,679 --> 01:16:39,520
which is specifically identifying

1995
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:42,480
individual problems in your game

1996
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:44,560
>> and focus group is asking them what what

1997
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:47,120
they like which is actually very not

1998
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:49,360
useful for most product design in fact

1999
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:50,960
uh games

2000
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:52,080
>> one piece of advice because you're all

2001
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:53,760
that I think is really important if

2002
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:56,640
you're a smart college student like an

2003
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:58,239
MIT student is that you probably learned

2004
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:59,920
you probably learned in spite of your

2005
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:01,440
education. You learned by having someone

2006
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:03,199
sit in front of the class and tell you

2007
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:06,960
what was going on and you somehow you

2008
01:17:03,199 --> 01:17:08,880
absorbed it. Um that's why you got here.

2009
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:11,280
But lots of people don't learn that. And

2010
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:12,880
it's really hard to avoid the tendency

2011
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:15,360
in the game to just tell people what

2012
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:17,040
they should know which is sort of for my

2013
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:19,280
money like when you meet up someone who

2014
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:20,320
speaks a foreign language and so you're

2015
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:23,120
not understanding each other. So you

2016
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:24,719
both start speaking slower and louder.

2017
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:26,239
to no effect and I think that's what a

2018
01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:28,400
lot of education that's a lot of bad

2019
01:17:26,239 --> 01:17:30,239
education in general does speak slowly

2020
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:32,880
aloud and certainly a lot of bad

2021
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:34,320
educational games so so and just

2022
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:35,600
remember that just because you got the

2023
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:37,760
first time and someone told you doesn't

2024
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:40,080
mean that everybody else it's not just

2025
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:44,120
about explaining it better giving you a

2026
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:44,120
different way of learning

2027
01:17:45,199 --> 01:17:47,360
questions

2028
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:58,239
Just wanted to say something. You ever

2029
01:17:56,320 --> 01:18:01,040
heard of Fire Hose Game? Post this on

2030
01:17:58,239 --> 01:18:04,480
the forum. Uh so I told him I know a guy

2031
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:07,440
works there and he said we got focus

2032
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:09,520
group tomorrow night or PS3 central a

2033
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:10,960
few months and they didn't want to go

2034
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:12,480
tomorrow night 7 o'clock. for an hour

2035
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:18,159
and a half.

2036
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:19,280
>> That's that includes NK alums part of

2037
01:18:18,159 --> 01:18:20,719
people who haven't played the game

2038
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:23,719
before.

2039
01:18:20,719 --> 01:18:23,719
>> Maybe

2040
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:30,960
they're not.

2041
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:32,239
>> Can I ask a question? Can I ask

2042
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:35,719
questions?

2043
01:18:32,239 --> 01:18:35,719
>> Let me know in the next.

2044
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:41,360
>> So the question I would have for you is

2045
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:44,560
is did anybody of you have his in this

2046
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:46,400
in this play biography educational game

2047
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:47,920
that you played that you would say was

2048
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:49,600
was kind of like an important experience

2049
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:50,800
to you that even you know like I know

2050
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:52,239
maybe it's embarrassing now with the

2051
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:55,600
other ones are listening but does

2052
01:18:52,239 --> 01:18:58,400
anybody out there yeah like Sam Bon

2053
01:18:55,600 --> 01:19:00,320
whatever that game was best game of all

2054
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:02,239
time

2055
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:04,080
I mean it was it was similar in that you

2056
01:19:02,239 --> 01:19:06,400
you had like an avatar they taken around

2057
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:09,040
and had to solve little puzzles that you

2058
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:12,800
know underlying them was math and like

2059
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:15,040
simple m equations, but like pizzas like

2060
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:18,280
just divide up pizzas. Cool.

2061
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:18,280
>> It was awesome.

2062
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:23,600
>> We can't let that that's got me.

2063
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:27,000
>> Oh, it is. I was going to ask you. I was

2064
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:27,000
like I was like

2065
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:31,000
you.

2066
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:34,719
>> No, but

2067
01:19:33,199 --> 01:19:36,000
but and I think it's interesting to

2068
01:19:34,719 --> 01:19:37,600
think about if you had an experience

2069
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,280
like that, what was it that made you

2070
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:41,280
like the game? you know, like I think

2071
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:42,960
it's worth very rich because a lot of

2072
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:44,400
people have um have bad experience with

2073
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:46,000
educational games and then think about

2074
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:48,080
them when they design it. Think about

2075
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:49,600
the the cool ones that have um there's

2076
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:54,640
this series of games called thinking

2077
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:56,640
things and one of them had a mode that

2078
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:59,120
basically was kind of like programming

2079
01:19:56,640 --> 01:20:02,560
in that you could place different types

2080
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:04,480
of units on a grid and then give them

2081
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:05,920
instructions in a loop. So say go

2082
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:08,080
forward then left and right and they

2083
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:09,600
could they could paint a square. And so

2084
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:10,880
what you could end up doing is with

2085
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:12,159
certain configuration a certain set of

2086
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:13,520
rules you could get them to draw

2087
01:20:12,159 --> 01:20:15,120
patterns and stuff like that. And what

2088
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:18,080
used to happen is my dad would say can

2089
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:19,520
you get um you know two like inverted

2090
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:21,199
triangles drawn on the screen and then I

2091
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:22,800
would like sit there and try to like

2092
01:20:21,199 --> 01:20:24,960
basically program without realizing that

2093
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:27,280
it was actually a programming game. So

2094
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:29,840
>> does that

2095
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:31,280
made a game which is there's a bunch of

2096
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:32,719
games that have done that. Um, the last

2097
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:35,360
puzzles and beans actually did some of

2098
01:20:32,719 --> 01:20:37,760
that stuff, too. Um, and there's a

2099
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:39,120
product out just now called that I'm

2100
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:40,880
hooked on right now called Trainard,

2101
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:42,560
which is on the iPad. The I

2102
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:44,800
>> Yeah, I thought that be

2103
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:47,600
>> what? I thought that would be your name.

2104
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:49,600
>> Yeah. And and it really is about um it

2105
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:52,719
really is a programming game basically.

2106
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:56,199
It's kind of cool.

2107
01:20:52,719 --> 01:20:56,199
>> The iPhone version.

2108
01:20:57,199 --> 01:21:00,880
I was just going to say that two games

2109
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:04,480
which are really informative for me like

2110
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:07,520
in the educational context were Dinosaur

2111
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:09,199
Discovery which is an ancient game

2112
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:10,880
>> and I would have played it when I was in

2113
01:21:09,199 --> 01:21:13,520
kindergarten and I'm all most of the

2114
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:17,040
people here

2115
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:19,520
um and it was it was a an adventure text

2116
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:23,719
puzzle game which was which was the year

2117
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:23,719
and then where in the world is San

2118
01:21:24,239 --> 01:21:29,040
>> another classic game that I played back

2119
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:30,320
when I think it was back when about the

2120
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:33,679
time when the internet started getting

2121
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:37,120
popular because mid9s it was uh math

2122
01:21:33,679 --> 01:21:38,880
blasters or something

2123
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:40,640
>> Mario teaches typing that's

2124
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:44,360
>> oh

2125
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:44,360
Mario teaches typing

2126
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:50,480
>> the incredible

2127
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:54,960
>> machine

2128
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:58,199
that's like thinking it's really

2129
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:58,199
I love

2130
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:04,880
>> and I think this this is a even this

2131
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:07,199
romantized wow that back in the good

2132
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:08,800
days you know like I really enjoyed that

2133
01:22:07,199 --> 01:22:09,920
game that's that's kind of like I think

2134
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:12,320
where we all want to have to with

2135
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:14,000
educational games it's not like oh my

2136
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:16,560
god you know I have to play an education

2137
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:18,239
game but more they can be really and I

2138
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:20,080
think the best convers was it came with

2139
01:22:18,239 --> 01:22:23,360
an almanac they encouraged you

2140
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:25,520
>> yeah to look use research search of fact

2141
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:27,199
answers. In fact, it wasn't cheating to

2142
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:30,679
look up the answers. It was smart to

2143
01:22:27,199 --> 01:22:30,679
look up the answers.
