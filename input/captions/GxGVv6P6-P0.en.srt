1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,279
howdy I'm shiv CEO and co-founder of

2
00:00:02,679 --> 00:00:07,319
active

3
00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:09,280
Services that's me on the left uh I come

4
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:10,960
from Exon Mobile grew up here in Houston

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,320
and worked at the US doe before coming

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,559
to MIT my co-founder is actually the

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,840
smart guy he invented this stuff along

8
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:20,640
with these prolific MIT professors

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,680
Vladimir bovich who runs MIT Nano and

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,160
mji bendi who won a Nobel Prize last

11
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,960
year uh we also have advisers like Seth

12
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:30,400
kolivan who have spun out and sold

13
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:34,399
multiple deep tech companies so what do

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:36,399
we do who here has seen a solar panel a

15
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,800
ton right there's one meter by two meter

16
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,640
bricks are normally in the middle of

17
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:43,000
nowhere we think that solar has grown

18
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,680
tremendously and it has this is a chart

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,199
of every Year's iea projection of how

20
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,920
quickly solar will be adopted over the

21
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:52,000
next 10 years and you can see that we've

22
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:55,520
outpaced it year over year for 20 years

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,239
straight but let's put this growth in

24
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,600
perspective right now if you add up the

25
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,399
entire solar capacity of the entire

26
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,960
planet we're at one

27
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,400
terawatt to achieve Net Zero we need the

28
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:10,520
minimum 20

29
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:13,360
terawatts this Gap is equivalent to the

30
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:16,360
world's largest solar farm which is in

31
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:19,200
India a couple gws it's three times the

32
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:21,079
size of Cambridge Mass that size being

33
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,040
deployed every single day for two

34
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:25,759
decades that's what we

35
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,079
need but there's barriers to this level

36
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,640
of scale transmission is a big pain

37
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:32,119
because people don't want

38
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,399
Transmission in their backyard and it's

39
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:37,240
hard to get the power from North Texas

40
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:39,119
to the coast soft costs are dominating

41
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:41,000
the instulation cost now the modules are

42
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,640
cheap but labor and structural support

43
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,280
is expensive and then energy security is

44
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:49,439
the big issue because 95% of those 1

45
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:52,159
meter by 2 meter panels are made in

46
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,159
China all of this is happening because a

47
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,840
core technology that we are working with

48
00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:00,439
is based with silicon it's in a glass

49
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:02,159
packaged module and it's heavy that form

50
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:04,520
factor has been the same for 50 years if

51
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,560
you Google solar panel White House in

52
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:10,520
the 1970s the same exact form factor

53
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:14,040
existed what we're offering is something

54
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:16,760
entirely new this is a 100 times lighter

55
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:20,440
can be integrated into any surface could

56
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:22,480
be on Fabrics or Plastics and could be

57
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,800
rolled around like a yoga mat and then

58
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,560
deployed on

59
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,280
buildings if you want to come see it

60
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,280
later we're over

61
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,920
there we're not the first company to

62
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,840
think of flexible solar this has been

63
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,160
around for 20 years but we're the first

64
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,800
company to do it at a cost that actually

65
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:41,680
makes sense for widescale adoption we do

66
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,360
this because our efficiencies are high

67
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,560
our manufacturing input or materials are

68
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:49,000
low and then we're able to have the

69
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,680
benefit of the form factor without uh

70
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,040
lower

71
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,640
performance we unlock this with three

72
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,519
different Innovations manufacturing

73
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,000
packaging and materials for

74
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,560
manufacturing we do roll to- roll

75
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,360
Manufacturing imagine like a big

76
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,519
Polaroid plant or New York Times or you

77
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:07,560
print we do that multiple times for each

78
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:09,040
layer of the semiconductor for packaging

79
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,879
we have innovations that allow us to

80
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,120
decouple the substrate you're printing

81
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,680
on to the final device package which

82
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,879
means that if you print on glass you're

83
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,720
stuck on glass for us you can print on a

84
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,959
piece of plastic and then laminate it

85
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,280
onto whatever the hell you want Fabrics

86
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:26,159
glass Plastics no other company can do

87
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,680
that and then materials we use commodity

88
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,959
materials that could be Source from your

89
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,720
region so if you build a plant in

90
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,680
America you could bu sorage materials in

91
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,599
America or from Europe or from South

92
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,720
Asia or from East Asia from wherever

93
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:38,799
you're locally

94
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:40,159
manufacturing and you could do it using

95
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,480
uh commodity domestically Source

96
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,400
materials that aren't susceptible to

97
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:45,360
supply chain risks so none of this

98
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,560
together has been

99
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,439
possible in a summary we're cheaper than

100
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,959
solar today we're glass free and

101
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:54,159
flexible we're locally sourced we're way

102
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:56,640
lighter same performance and faster

103
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:59,319
install this can go literally anywhere

104
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,840
from facades to roofs to Shades and this

105
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:02,640
is what it was look like on a commercial

106
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,079
building like a yoga mat being deployed

107
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,599
and rolled

108
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:10,280
out in terms of development we spun out

109
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:12,480
of uh Technologies validated in 22 we

110
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:15,880
won some prizes and some big checks uh

111
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:18,400
early 23 got support from climatech

112
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,840
accelerators uh have raised .5 million

113
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,639
dollar and use that to build a

114
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:26,320
manufacturing research facility and now

115
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:28,440
we set ambitious goals for this year to

116
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,840
move faster than any solar uh older to

117
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,039
move faster than any Solar Company in

118
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,840
history we try to do these four things

119
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:36,720
by the end of 24 make a solar module

120
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,199
make a solar roll get some commercial

121
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,199
interest and do an outdoor demo if we

122
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,600
could do any of these that would be

123
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:42,440
faster than any Solar Company so where

124
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,080
are

125
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:47,639
we we made our first solar module 3 q24

126
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,400
we made our first solar roll which is

127
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:51,759
here I'll unravel it as I talk about the

128
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,680
next stuff that's us on a commercial

129
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,919
install and then we also have our first

130
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,240
outdoor demo scheduled for next month or

131
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:00,560
this month is December

132
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,800
now uh quick history on a connection to

133
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,759
Houston solar is big in north Texas I'm

134
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,479
sure you guys know this uh scaleup

135
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:07,960
expertise is Big here I worked for Exxon

136
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,960
I've seen these big refineries we know

137
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:14,039
how to build things and then I grew up

138
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:16,199
here so I went to CF cyer High U ofh uh

139
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:19,080
Aon I'm the Houston

140
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:20,880
Alum so my ask here is if you own a

141
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,600
building or you're interested in the

142
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,639
application of solar in your operations

143
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,560
let me know uh or if you just want to

144
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,000
high five and support a new technology

145
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,020
always down for

146
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,180
that thank you

147
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:35,180
[Applause]
