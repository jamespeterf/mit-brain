1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,679
Now, let me be clear for a second. I

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,920
want to distinguish comparative

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:08,639
advantage from just the term advantage

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,760
or what we call absolute advantage. I

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,360
want to distinguish those. The best way

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,320
to distinguish those is of course think

7
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,839
about LeBron James mowing his lawn.

8
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,640
Okay, let's think about LeBron James

9
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,080
mowing his lawn. Now, LeBron James does

10
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:24,480
two things. Play basketball and mow his

11
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:26,000
lawn. Okay, and let's assert LeBron

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,359
James better than anyone in the world at

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,119
both playing basketball and mowing his

14
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,720
lawn. LeBron James awesome. I mean, the

15
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,360
guy's built, right? He just crank on

16
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,360
that lawn. Okay, so let's assert LeBron

17
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,280
James is the best person at both mowing

18
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,120
his lawn and playing basketball. He has

19
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,040
an absolute advantage in both

20
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,680
activities,

21
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,160
but he has a comparative advantage in

22
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,239
playing basketball. In other words, he's

23
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,800
way better. Let's take LeBron James

24
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,320
versus me. Now, there's two goods

25
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,640
playing basketball, mowing lawns in two

26
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,760
countries, LeBron James and Gruber.

27
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,039
Okay, LeBron James has a massive

28
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,520
comparative advantage in playing

29
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,640
basketball. I suck at basketball. Okay,

30
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,400
he's a un a billion to one comparative

31
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,560
advantage in playing basketball. Mowing

32
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,600
lawns, he's maybe five to one. He's

33
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,960
certainly better than me at mowing a

34
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,400
lawn, but is he more than five times?

35
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,720
Could he do it five times faster than

36
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,320
me? Probably not.

37
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,200
So, LeBron James is an absolute

38
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,759
advantage over me in basketball and lawn

39
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,119
mowing. But his comparative advantage is

40
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,320
basketball. LeBron James should, and

41
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,320
this will be the hint of where we're

42
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,360
going, LeBron James should specialize in

43
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,439
basketball. Let me mow the lawn.

44
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,960
Now, in fact, I shouldn't mow the lawn

45
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,240
either

46
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,320
because let's take me versus a a uh

47
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,040
landscape contractor and let's do

48
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,680
economics and lawnmowing.

49
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,880
I am certainly better than the land the

50
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,640
average landscape contractor at

51
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,840
economics.

52
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,040
I'm probably worse at lawnmowing. So, I

53
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,520
should then hire the landscape

54
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,920
contractor. It's all about comparative

55
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,920
advantage.
