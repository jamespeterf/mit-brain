1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,679
I decided to pursue [music] the energy

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,520
studies minor because I really care

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:09,225
about combating climate change and

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,225
helping the environment. [music]

5
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:15,599
I feel like my major in mechanical

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,199
engineering really helps me on the

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,119
technical side of learning about [music]

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,199
energy conversion and how to make

9
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,960
systems more efficient, whereas my

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,880
energy studies minor really helps fill

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,960
in some gaps in regards [music] to

12
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,820
economics and policies. To me,

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,960
mechanical engineering is really about

14
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,800
[music] solving problems and creating

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,239
something new. To do so, an energy

16
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,079
problem I'd like to be a part of [music]

17
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,645
solving is a transition from using

18
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,320
fossil fuels to using renewables, as

19
00:00:38,645 --> 00:00:42,800
[music] well as learning how to optimize

20
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,120
our existing energy systems. That way,

21
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,879
the energy we use can be both clean and

22
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,200
efficient, and we're not using more than

23
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,200
what we need.
