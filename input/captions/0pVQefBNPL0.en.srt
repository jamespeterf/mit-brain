00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,680
day of our annual R&D conference and in

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,320
celebration of the 40th anniversary of

8
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:24,880
MTL uh it was 51 years ago that I

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,400
entered MIT as a freshman and I was

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:30,560
delighted to hear on this video that MIT

11
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:33,000
helped invent modern meteorology because

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,719
I am a recovering meteorologist I

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,760
registered in the department of Earth

14
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,719
atmospheric and planetary Sciences

15
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:41,079
president R course

16
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,399
number 12

17
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:44,920
right turning the tables a little bit on

18
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:48,800
him from when he would welcome The

19
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:51,160
Freshman all those years it's um really

20
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:54,120
interesting opportunity to talk to you

21
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:56,640
today about the intersection of what our

22
00:00:54,120 --> 00:01:01,079
industrial liaison program does and some

23
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:03,359
of the Premier Laboratories here at MIT

24
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:06,080
but as a very quick introduction you are

25
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:10,280
sitting in one of the most innovated

26
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:14,880
places on Earth Kendall Square Cambridge

27
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:18,000
where MIT industry government all come

28
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,720
together to invent the future in MIT we

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,079
have a beautiful view of Boston that's

30
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:24,280
where our roots are from 1861 we moved

31
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:26,680
across the river here in

32
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:29,240
196 the main group of buildings then

33
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:31,280
spread its wings all across Cambridge

34
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:33,000
all the way to the the Eastern side of

35
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,799
Kendall Square where our office is

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,280
located and now the Locust of all the

37
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:41,560
life sciences and Pharma companies right

38
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,960
here in the center of Kendall Square

39
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,840
look at the kinds of companies that have

40
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:49,439
flourished here because they wanted to

41
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:52,880
be surrounding

42
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:55,280
MIT MIT does three things obviously we

43
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,360
educate students how many alums do we

44
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,600
have in the

45
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:01,880
audience excellent we do

46
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:04,600
entrepreneurship we do Innovation but I

47
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:06,880
think most importantly we do research

48
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,720
and Discovery and I want to spend a

49
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,680
couple of minutes talking about What

50
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,239
discovery means here at MIT and a tip of

51
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,239
the hat to my colleague Randall Wright

52
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:19,400
who brings this to the Forefront every

53
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:21,280
time that he talks to ILP members and

54
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:24,480
that Discovery is the act of

55
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,080
participating in the ongoing discourse

56
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:30,200
on campus you hear differences of

57
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:32,800
opinions you debate their impact on

58
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:35,840
society and when you as members of

59
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,239
Industry come here to MIT you

60
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,519
participate in those discussions and

61
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:43,159
that can be critically important for the

62
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:45,680
future of your organization because when

63
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:48,599
you become a part of the discourse on

64
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,360
campus you as Executives get to learn

65
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:53,080
the relevant and breakthrough

66
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:56,200
discoveries that could be transformative

67
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:58,400
to your company you learn the emerging

68
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:01,480
technologies that could transform or

69
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,440
disrupt your company over the future you

70
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,879
get to learn about them before you hear

71
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,879
them at conferences read about them on

72
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:11,480
websites because you are part of those

73
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:14,000
discussions as these Technologies are

74
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:16,519
emerging and here at the MIT industrial

75
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,799
liaison program we provide actively

76
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:22,920
managed and facilitated access to all of

77
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:25,360
the resources at MIT all five schools

78
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,959
the College of computing the dozens and

79
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,920
dozens of research centers and

80
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,920
Laboratories from those that are very

81
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,720
small with just a few people to the

82
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,200
biggest ones that have hundreds and

83
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,159
hundreds of

84
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:40,439
people now as I mentioned ILP brings

85
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:43,120
access to all of MIT to our corporate

86
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:46,599
members and often these discussions are

87
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:49,640
facilitated by us resulting in companies

88
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:52,319
partnering with Laboratories like MTL

89
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:54,799
and it allows them to Deep dive into the

90
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:57,599
critical Technologies while maintaining

91
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:01,480
their overall MIT experience through the

92
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:03,159
industrial a and program MTL it's been a

93
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,239
training ground for thousands of

94
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:08,319
students many of whom have become

95
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:10,400
leaders in Academia in industry and

96
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:13,079
Entrepreneurship the lab's Partnerships

97
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,079
with global companies have accelerated

98
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:18,000
the translation of research into

99
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:21,000
practical applications ensuring its

100
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,919
impact reaches beyond the lab now in

101
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,560
celebrating its Legacy MTL stands as a

102
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,960
testament to the power of

really been key to transform our society

174
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:51,520
many many times in the last 75 years

175
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,639

every one of these

183
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:19,720
revolutions when when I was studying

184
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:23,039
microelectronics as an

185
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:26,440
undergrad I I was pretty depressed I I

186
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:29,520
used to to Envy the the 60s and the 70s

187
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:33,240
of of the past Century I I used to to

188
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:35,680
tell myself that the that time period

189
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,959
was when everything in semiconductors

190
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,360
was discovered when the seminal

191
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:43,839
textbooks were written and the most

192
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:46,600
successful companies it

193
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:49,519
started I no longer think in that way I

194
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:52,160
was completely wrong the conversion of

195
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,480
new materials with extraordinary new

196
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:57,320
properties Noel heterogeneous

197
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:00,519
integration approaches and Technologies

198
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,760
Advanced packaging and the use use of AI

199
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:04,000
and machine

200
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,480
learning enabled by

201
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,959
microelectronics and used in micro

202
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:12,399
Electronics is quickly making today the

203
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:16,920
present time the most exciting time for

204
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:20,079
semiconductors and Microsystems in

205
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:22,800
history and the MTL Community is ready

206
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:24,959
for the amazing future ahead and during

207
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,880
today's celebration we are looking

208

continue to invent the future of

226
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,480
Microsystems and we will be talking a

227
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,680
lot about how to do that over the next

228
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,200

introduction

274
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,680
but do not assume Thomas that that

275
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:39,839
introduction will make me forget or

276
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:43,639
forgive that you took my lap space in

277
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,639
building 39 when you arrived at

278
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:50,399
MIP what Gody head it is a tremendous

279
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:54,120
honor to be here and to celebrate the

280
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:56,399
40th anniversary of MTL with all of

281
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:59,480
you I vividly

282
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:02,920
remember or perhaps Dimitri I Viv

283
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:07,360
imagined remembering in December

284
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:09,360
79 almost 45 years ago receiving a phone

285
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,760
call from Demitri

286
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:15,160
antoniadis I had just gotten to the

287
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:18,000
Cambridge Boston area to start at MIT on

288
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:19,079
January 1st and I was looking for a

289
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,959
place to

290
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:25,000
leave Dimitri called to share the

291
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:28,160
absolutely terrific news that MIT had

292
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,760
decided to establish what was then

293
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:36,079
called if I remember correctly an LSI

294
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:39,480
fabrication facility which later became

295
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:43,160
MTL I was thrilled and it was obvious to

296
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:45,760
me Dimitri was thrilled too Dimitri had

297
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:49,160
been recruited to MIT a year and a half

298
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:53,920
earlier to reinvigorate mit's efforts in

299
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:59,120
Silicon technology and came I came after

300
00:13:53,920 --> 00:14:01,519
him sometime afterwards and before MTL

301
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:06,399
formally open in building

302
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:09,079
39 mtl's celebrated sense of community

303
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:12,519
was born in Building

304
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:16,240
13 Steve Centuria faculty colleague of

305
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:18,120
ours organized what he called and again

306
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:21,079
Dimitri I may imagine all this but I

307
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:25,120
think I remember it with what he called

308
00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:27,759
then the gang of four as he clead

309
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:30,759
Dimitri and myself started meeting every

310
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:33,160
week it was the beginning of the micro

311
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:35,279
lunch which I'm delighted to say

312
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:37,759
continues to this

313
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:41,320
day then in

314
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:44,040
1984 building 39 and MTL open their

315
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:47,920
doors and some of us with offices in

316
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:50,320
Building 13 Steve Centuria Hank Smith

317
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:54,040
Demitri antoniadis Charlie sodini Harry

318
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:58,040
Lee and myself moved from there to

319
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:59,880
MTL those were exciting days at MTL and

320
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:03,040
40 years later

321
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:07,360
MIT MTL reminds a tremendously exciting

322
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:09,560
place to teach to learn to discover and

323
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:13,279
to

324
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:16,680
invent meld has done a lot of good at

325
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:19,759
MIT but also nationally and

326
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:22,720
globally there are many many MTL

327
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:25,480
graduates many of you here today who

328
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:28,440
became key leaders and drivers of the

329
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,480
micro and nano technology industry in

330
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,480
the US

331
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:34,240
and

332
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:37,480
abroad I could not be prouder of my MIT

333
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:41,240
beginnings and my growing up at

334
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:45,160
MTL my colleagues here were and are the

335
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:47,680
very best and inspired the best out of

336
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:51,120
me and of every one of us the

337
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:53,519
collegiality of MTL was unar then and it

338
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:56,800
continues to be unar

339
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:59,480
today the MTL graduate students what

340
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:02,279
many of you were some time ago

341
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:05,360
created their own wonderful community

342
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:07,399
that exists to this day from the very

343
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,440
beginning they interacted with each

344
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:12,759
other ATL not just within the research

345
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,440
groups but beyond their research groups

346
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:17,519
as

347
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,519
well in fact I just returned from a trip

348
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:22,319
to

349
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:25,880
Taiwan there I met at their request with

350
00:16:22,319 --> 00:16:29,639
a group of MTL graduates from different

351
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:31,000
MTL advisors who are doing a spectacular

352
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:33,480
job

353
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,480
advancing at the semiconductor stateof

354
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:38,880
the art in industry and Academia in

355
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:42,720
Taiwan and it was to me an immense

356
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:45,480
pleasure to feel at home at MTL home so

357
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,480
far away from

358
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:56,639
MIT MTL in my very unbiased objective

359
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:58,600
opinion is a role model of an academic

360
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:02,079
interdisciplinary research laboratory

361
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:05,199
and Community should aspire to be and

362
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:06,120
I'm thrilled I played a small role in

363
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,640
his

364
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:10,079
creation and thank you toas for inviting

part of MTL as as Professor palasio

420
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:12,400
mentioned since I first joined the MIT

421
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:15,240
faculty more than 30 years ago my office

422
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:18,720
was initially in building 39 which had

423
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:22,120
the iconic fabrication facility where

424
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:25,679
thousands of students were

425
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:29,280
trained over my tenure at MIT I have

426
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:33,400
seen firsthand how extraordinary L

427
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:35,640
strong the community is I greatly

428
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:39,480
benefited from the deep

429
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:43,159
collaborations with faculty members and

430
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:46,320
students given the breath of topics in

431
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:49,280
MTL my students and I have always found

432
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:52,960
an expert within the MTL Community who

433
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:56,320
could provide valuable advice and
