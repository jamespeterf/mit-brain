1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,169
I have literally, a very good memories from

2
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:06,089
my childhood a lot of books because this

3
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:08,174
was the main entertainment.

4
00:00:08,633 --> 00:00:11,761
It sounded like life in a totally totally

5
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:15,223
different world because the life was very

6
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:17,058
much limited to what you know.

7
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:20,019
There was no internet. The TV or radio

8
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:21,604
were very very filtered.

9
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:24,899
So the books were really the only way of

10
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:27,193
escape and seeing that there is much

11
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:29,195
bigger world out there.

12
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:37,579
I haven't been in Moldova since we left

13
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:39,372
and I was 20 when we left.

14
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:40,999
Surprisingly, despite the fact that it

15
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:42,834
was part of Soviet Union and it was

16
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:46,963
communist country, it was very peaceful.

17
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:50,633
A lot of light, sun, beautiful buildings,

18
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:52,343
a lot of flowers and plants.

19
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:56,639
I was always an excellent student. I was

20
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:57,891
always competing to be

21
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,184
number one in my class.

22
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,480
In my last year of high school when the

23
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,023
perestroika started and all of a sudden

24
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,357
from this very peaceful, maybe

25
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:08,193
artificially peaceful environment,

26
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:10,528
everything really falls

27
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:13,364
apart in a very short time.

28
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:15,366
There were demonstrations, there were a

29
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:17,744
lot of people who were misplaced and then

30
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,037
my family left to Israel.

31
00:01:22,081 --> 00:01:24,000
I always thought that I wanted to be a

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,169
maths teacher. It was clear to me that

33
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:28,963
that's kind of what I'm interested in.

34
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:32,801
And at the time I realized that maybe I

35
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:35,053
don't want just to do teaching because

36
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,137
you're always teaching

37
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:37,555
with the same textbook.

38
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:39,974
So I couldn't imagine myself, you know,

39
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:42,060
for the next 30 years coming

40
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,895
and teaching the same material.

41
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:46,940
That's how I ended up going and doing my

42
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,358
masters in computer science.

43
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:52,111
The internet was only in the very early

44
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:55,240
stages, but it was clear from the

45
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:55,865
beginning that there

46
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:57,659
are so many possibilities.

47
00:01:58,076 --> 00:01:59,953
I selected somebody who I liked as a

48
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,996
professor and he told me that he's doing

49
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:02,872
natural language processing.

50
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,458
What was interesting, that the field was

51
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:08,336
so early on, just jump in, claim some

52
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:09,963
territory, it's not building up.

53
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,757
And I really like this freedom of

54
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:16,928
uncovering new things and being able to

55
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:19,931
go in new direction and see how it works.

56
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:27,564
In 2014 I got breast cancer.

57
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:30,316
Information technology really didn't play a

58
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,735
significant part in what was going on in

59
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:33,987
patient diagnostics and treatment.

60
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:38,491
So when I came back to MIT, there are two

61
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,367
things that happened.

62
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:41,077
One, I really wanted to

63
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:42,620
do something to change it.

64
00:02:43,162 --> 00:02:45,331
And second, I started thinking in my

65
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,333
life, and at the time I was interested in

66
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,502
deciphering ancient languages, is it the

67
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,129
best way to contribute to humanity?

68
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:54,716
So I was in this big dilemma with myself,

69
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:55,341
you know, what is

70
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,802
meaningful? Like, what is my role?

71
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:02,515
I decided to work on machine learning for

72
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,225
small molecules. It

73
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:05,977
was really a new area.

74
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,104
Today, machine learning plays an

75
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:10,982
important role in drug discovery already,

76
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,651
but it's still not a dominant technology.

77
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:16,529
It's still not the case that for many

78
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,323
diseases for which we don't have the good

79
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:20,199
treatments like neurodegenerative

80
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,993
diseases or advanced cancer,

81
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:24,078
this machine learning really helped us to

82
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:26,372
change it. So I think it's something that

83
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,791
will come in the next few years, but we

84
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,376
really have to push it to

85
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,754
make this dream a reality.

86
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:38,468
MIT is a very special place, and the more

87
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,261
time is spent here, the more you see it,

88
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:41,471
because there are so many

89
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,598
brilliant people around you.

90
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:47,936
A lively place where a lot of

91
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:50,355
intellectual things happen. It actually

92
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,148
goes across different ages.

93
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,984
You see these students who really come

94
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,611
here, and they're ready to change the

95
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:59,906
world, and they would spend day and night

96
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,116
trying to think about ideas that other

97
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:03,785
perceive as crazy, and

98
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,161
they're excited about it.

99
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,163
It's really an exciting place to be.
