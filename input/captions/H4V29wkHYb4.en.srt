1
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:21,359
And so from last time uh we covered the

2
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:23,279
ETO formula for the single case

3
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,480
where

4
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:29,039
we have the integral

5
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,119
or sorry the function of a brownie in

6
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,320
motion

7
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:37,760
uh function of one variable. And

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,440
importantly um with this function of a

9
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,440
one variable, we get that the

10
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:46,160
differential of the function is equal to

11
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:49,840
the first derivative of the function

12
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:52,480
evaluated at the Brownian motion plus a

13
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,440
half the second derivative

14
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,039
uh of the function. And so this is Eto's

15
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,359
formula.

16
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:06,640
And when we uh apply eto's formula in

17
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:10,320
one dimension um we can consider

18
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:13,920
uh defining the anti-derivative

19
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:18,080
of the function f

20
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:22,479
and that's capital f. And so eto's

21
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:27,200
formula gives us this expression for the

22
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:32,960
integral of f of bs dbs. So this is a

23
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:37,119
very uh useful uh way to compute uh eto

24
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:39,840
integrals. Now when we go to functions

25
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:42,560
of two variables

26
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,640
so case two we're going to have a

27
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:50,000
function of time

28
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:54,320
and bt say um when we want to evaluate

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,680
this function of time and space as a

30
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,840
function of brownie motion then our

31
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,399
eto's formula

32
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,759
is expressed this way we basically have

33
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:09,119
the partials of little f with respect to

34
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:12,080
t and with respect to x and then a

35
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:16,239
second order term the second partial of

36
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:18,879
f with respect to x. So this is uh how

37
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:22,640
eto's formula generalizes.

38
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:27,440
Now what's really convenient to

39
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:31,920
highlight is that with eto's formula we

40
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:38,160
get this top formula for the change in

41
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:40,080
value of f of tx. So we have um this

42
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:44,800
theorem

43
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:48,959
uh which is for how f of bt

44
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:52,000
changes from an initial condition and in

45
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:56,480
looking at this expression it's a sum of

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:00,000
two terms. Okay, the first term is an

47
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:05,200
integral with respect to time ds

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:09,200
and so that function will be sort of

49
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:11,680
non-random on paths. The second term is

50
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:16,720
the integral of the partial of f with

51
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:19,120
respect to x dBs and that will be uh

52
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:25,840
that that will be random depending on

53
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:30,080
dbs. So if we have a uh this formula for

54
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:33,360
the increment then um we basically have

55
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:37,599
a constant term plus an integral of

56
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:42,239
brownie in motion which has mean zero as

57
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:44,720
a random variable. But if the term

58
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:49,360
that's in the integrant

59
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:54,480
over time, if that's equal to zero,

60
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:56,000
then this function f will be a

61
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:00,159
martingale.

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,319
So importantly in quantitative finance

63
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:05,280
uh we often are interested in solving

64
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:09,360
for values of functions where the

65
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:12,480
functions are the price or value of a

66
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,400
derivative over time. And if we can

67
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:18,959
express it sort of in the right

68
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:21,600
framework uh where the price function

69
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:26,479
follows a martingale

70
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:30,880
then it will satisfy this PTE condition.

71
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:33,840
Now the notion of the value of some

72
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:36,560
derivative contract or asset following a

73
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:40,400
martingale over time

74
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:44,080
means that it has a constant sort of

75
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:47,360
expected value over time. So we don't

76
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:50,560
have sort of the natural growth in value

77
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:54,639
according to the risk-free rate. So to

78
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:58,400
set this up, we'll need to normalize the

79
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:01,360
prices discounted to the present value.

80
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,120
So that comes into play in different

81
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,400
applications.

82
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:10,479
All right. Well, um there are some

83
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:13,759
examples of ETO's formula applying it

84
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:16,880
and with the brownie in motion with

85
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:20,960
drift. We went through that last time.

86
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:24,000
And then finally in this section um I

87
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,960
want to sort of highlight how geometric

88
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,600
brownian motion is represented in terms

89
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:36,400
of the stochastic differential equation

90
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:43,199
as given here. So dpt is equal to pt mu

91
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:46,160
ddt plus pt sigma dpt dbt.

92
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:48,479
Um and importantly

93
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:52,720
we basically have

94
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:55,120
these factors PT on both sides which

95
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:58,639
could be divided in both sides. So we

96
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:01,199
might think that we're working with the

97
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:04,160
derivative or differential of the log of

98
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:09,520
the price. Uh but it's we're it's a

99
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:13,360
little bit different. Um so with this uh

100
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:15,520
geometric brownie in motion if we apply

101
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:20,479
eto's lema

102
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:25,520
to the function log of pt so if we think

103
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:28,560
of log of pt is equal to g

104
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:33,280
of pt

105
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:36,560
then the partial of g with respect to p

106
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:40,639
is simply one over t the partial of G

107
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:45,120
with respect to T is zero and the second

108
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:47,919
partial of G with respect to P um is - 1

109
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:52,080
over P^2.

110
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:56,560
So it's lema gives us that the

111
00:06:52,080 --> 00:07:00,400
differential of log p is the sum of two

112
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:04,880
terms one that's times dt the other

113
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:09,039
that's times sigma db dbt

114
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:11,520
and so um log price

115
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:14,240
is going to follow a generalized vener

116
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,160
process with a drift rate given by mu

117
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,080
minus sigma squ over two and variance

118
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:22,720
rate equal to sigma

119
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:25,840
Now what's important about this

120
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:30,720
result is that the drift rate

121
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:32,400
changes from mu to mu minus sigma^ 2 /

122
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:37,759
2.

123
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:40,960
Um so the uh basically the drift rate on

124
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:45,919
the log scale um sort of has a drag due

125
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:49,280
to the uh quadratic variation.

126
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:54,879
And if we consider

127
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:56,400
uh normalizing the uh log return well

128
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,879
actually not normalizing but we look at

129
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,440
an increment of the log return that's

130
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:04,400
normally distributed

131
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:09,039
and then um

132
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:11,440
let's see if we consider uh I guess

133
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:15,440
looking at what the conditional

134
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:18,400
distribution is of log pt it's given by

135
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:21,840
this brownie in motion which gives

136
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:25,039
normally distributed log values with a

137
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:30,400
particular mean mu star and variance

138
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:32,640
sigma star. Um and so the expectation of

139
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:37,120
our price

140
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:40,240
at some time point capital t given the

141
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:43,680
value at time little t. It'll be a

142
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:46,560
lognormal random variable with

143
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:49,600
expectation equal to

144
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:52,399
the initial price pt p sub little t

145
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:57,839
times the exponential

146
00:08:52,399 --> 00:09:02,160
of uh mu * t minus t. There should be an

147
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:06,240
e here which um is in that factor. So,

148
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:09,040
so despite there being sort of a drag on

149
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:13,279
the drift

150
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:16,160
um the expectation of the exponential

151
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:18,880
of the log

152
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:23,680
doesn't have that drag due to drift. It

153
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:28,560
actually has the mean uh log return um

154
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:30,959
in that in that factor. And with uh logn

155
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,279
normal random variables we have formulas

156
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:35,200
for the mean and variance which we

157
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,120
covered actually in the first couple of

158
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,720
lectures.

159
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:44,080
Now interestingly um let's see if we

160
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:46,959
think about just what kinds of results

161
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:49,120
happen with values of mu and sigma that

162
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:53,440
we might expect to see in financial

163
00:09:49,120 --> 00:10:00,000
markets. Um here's an example where we

164
00:09:53,440 --> 00:10:02,000
consider um a drift rate mu of.3

165
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,600
per year

166
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,920
a

167
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:11,920
time period for obser uh the log normal

168
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:16,079
return of 1/ half year from time little

169
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:20,720
t to capital t and an annualized

170
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:25,120
volatility of 04 or 40%. So this is

171
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:29,680
perhaps reasonable for some moderately

172
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:33,839
uh risky uh stocks that have a modest

173
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:37,839
return uh expectation of sort of 30% per

174
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:41,600
year and a volatility rate of 40% per

175
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:46,160
year. And when we look compute the

176
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:51,680
expectation of the price,

177
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:55,040
it equals the initial price PT * 1.1618.

178
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:57,839
Now that 1.1618

179
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:00,880
says that we expect the price to

180
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:04,560
increase by about 16%.

181
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:07,200
And if we think of a half year and a

182
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:10,880
drift rate of.3,

183
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,640
we might have thought it would be 15%.

184
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,959
If we didn't, you know, follow through

185
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,920
the details. So it's it's a bit higher

186
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:21,760
return. And similarly for the uh

187
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:27,120
volatility or standard deviation of this

188
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:30,880
price, it turns out that the volatility

189
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:33,360
of the or variance of the price at time

190
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:36,320
capital T is

191
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:40,800
335 squared

192
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:42,800
times the square of PT. So the variance

193
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,360
is also a bit higher than you might

194
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,440
expect if you just naively interpreted

195
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,560
the mu and sigma as appropriate

196
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:55,040
annualized values.

197
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:59,519
Now with this result we can actually

198
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:04,800
uh compute the sort of continuously

199
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:11,760
compounded percent return of a geometric

200
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:15,120
brownie in motion. So we can look at the

201
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:17,279
change in value from time little t to

202
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,440
capital t.

203
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,279
The log of that ratio is the difference

204
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,360
in logs

205
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:26,560
and divide that by the length of the

206
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:30,720
period capital t minus t and we get the

207
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:34,480
basically the annualized rate of return

208
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:37,279
for the geometric brownie in motion. And

209
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:40,800
what that

210
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:45,440
rate of return as a random variable is

211
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:49,279
is normal with mean mu - a half sigma^ 2

212
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:51,200
and variance sigma^ 2 over t minus t. So

213
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,120
with this

214
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,399
what's

215
00:12:53,120 --> 00:13:00,399
significant or important is that the

216
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:03,680
sort of rate of return

217
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:07,600
over long periods of time

218
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:10,480
converges to a constant average rate and

219
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,720
the variance about that average rate is

220
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,200
going to zero as the time into the

221
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,040
future continues.

222
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:21,920
So this is an important property of

223
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:27,200
geometric brownie motion that the

224
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:31,440
growth of the uh of the process

225
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:33,440
uh basically grows at a constant rate

226
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,360
with some variability but that

227
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,600
variability

228
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:42,480
goes to zero as we consider very very

229
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:46,560
long periods. So um let's see.

230
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:50,720
So here uh let's say I have a simulation

231
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:54,560
of Brownian motion um where we consider

232
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:58,079
the same mu and sigma as the previous

233
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:01,440
slides and we consider a time period of

234
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:07,120
capital t equal to four years and we

235
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:10,560
define increments uh on that interval um

236
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,480
and look at basically brownie in motion

237
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,519
with the appropriate

238
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,920
mu and sigma then geometric brownian

239
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:21,360
motion which is the exponential

240
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:24,959
of that brownian motion and then the log

241
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:28,320
returns. So let's take a look at what we

242
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:31,399
have. Um

243
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,399
so so

244
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,399
here's some simulated paths of brownie

245
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,399
in motion with drift with those mu and

246
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,959
sigma parameters.

247
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:47,519
And importantly, we have sort of the

248
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:49,760
mean return as a function of time or the

249
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,440
mean value as a function of time of the

250
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,399
brownie in motion being given by the

251
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:57,440
blue line. And then plus or minus uh

252
00:14:54,399 --> 00:15:00,720
sort of two standard deviations is given

253
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:03,839
by the red uh curves.

254
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:07,199
And if we simulate not five but say 50

255
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,880
paths, this is what this Brownian motion

256
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,399
looks like.

257
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,680
Um

258
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:15,440
and if we I guess before doing this I'd

259
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,120
like everyone to just think about how is

260
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,480
this

261
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:23,839
set of paths going to transform when we

262
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:26,240
take the exponential of them. So the

263
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:30,320
basically the exponential of Brownian

264
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:33,360
motion with constant drift and variance.

265
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,199
Well, here's the geometric brownie in

266
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,760
motion

267
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:40,000
and uh what I've done is I've drawn the

268
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:42,720
same sort of blue line and the same red

269
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,839
lines as the for the Brownian motion and

270
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:49,759
how that translates to the exponential

271
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:57,199
scale. And what's rather striking here

272
00:15:49,759 --> 00:16:00,959
is that there are paths out of 50 that

273
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:02,800
really have extraordinary performance.

274
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:07,120
And so

275
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:10,720
you're basically growing in value from

276
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:14,720
by a factor of 10 or an order of 10

277
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:19,120
basically to an order of 20 um on the

278
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:21,279
exponential scale. And so what I think

279
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,519
is an interesting takeaway from this is

280
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:26,959
that if we have a simple brownie in

281
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:32,160
motion process defining the sort of log

282
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:36,240
price processes, then with reasonably

283
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:38,959
modest drift and volatility parameters,

284
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:43,199
there can be some realizations

285
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:46,079
that have phenomenal returns. And so

286
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:49,040
when you look at the price returns of

287
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:51,199
stocks, often our attention gravitates

288
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:55,839
towards those that have extraordinary

289
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:58,959
returns sort of like Nvidia or Tesla say

290
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:01,680
and over some periods in the past, maybe

291
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:04,640
not so much recently, but um these

292
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:07,120
extraordinary returns over a number of

293
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,919
years is actually

294
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:12,400
consistent with the possibility of sort

295
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:17,120
of geometric brownie motion models

296
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:20,799
underlying those. Now if we look at uh

297
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:25,520
the average log return

298
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:29,919
we get this graph for these 50 paths

299
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:32,240
just uh doing the time series of uh

300
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:36,480
volatilities

301
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:39,440
of the or sorry of uh returns um average

302
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:42,720
returns over across each of the paths.

303
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:46,720
And if we look at zooming in on that

304
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:48,880
path, this is the uh

305
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,520
space or it's an illustration of the

306
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:54,000
realizations of the average returns over

307
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,160
time. So over short periods we can

308
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,400
expect

309
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:02,400
very different

310
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:05,280
return magnitudes perhaps uh but as the

311
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:09,760
time period for measuring returns uh

312
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:13,039
increases it stabilizes to uh vary about

313
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,720
this uh constant level.

314
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:19,440
All right

315
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:23,360
so let's go back here. Um

316
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:26,559
all right so um with stochastic calculus

317
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,960
uh there are many sort of follow-on

318
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:32,160
topics. We're going to focus today on

319
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:35,200
stochastic differential equations. Um

320
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:37,919
but it's important to know that

321
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,559
stochastic calculus and differential

322
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:44,960
equations apply to other problems such

323
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:48,640
as population growth um and uh filtering

324
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:52,080
problems. um optimal stopping problems

325
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:54,240
and so uh you know it's a very sort of

326
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,919
rich set of applications of of the

327
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,120
theory.

328
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:00,720
So let's go to stochcastic differential

329
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:05,440
equations.

330
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:08,799
Um okay these slides are a bit dense uh

331
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,240
but I've colorcoded sort of some of the

332
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:14,960
pieces so we can go through it more

333
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:18,080
slowly. Um so let's go through the

334
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,679
derivation of the black scholes

335
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,679
differential equation. Now you've

336
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,600
already seen this a few times in the

337
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,640
class from a guest lecture and from

338
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:32,400
Vicil's lecture but I think it bears

339
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:34,960
repeating here. Um if we have a an asset

340
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,360
price that follows geometric brownie in

341
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,280
motion.

342
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,760
So dpt

343
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:48,559
is equal to mu

344
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:51,360
pt mud dt plus pt sigma u dbt. Then

345
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:54,640
let's consider the price of a derivative

346
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:58,880
that's contingent on pt

347
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:02,880
and as a motivating example say a call

348
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:06,240
option but we could consider arbitrary

349
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:11,360
options or derivatives.

350
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:13,679
And if we apply eto's lema to the price

351
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:17,200
function gt

352
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:19,039
then eto's lema gives us this sum of two

353
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,559
terms

354
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:26,000
dt times the partial of g with respect

355
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:29,679
to p mu pt partial of g with respect to

356
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:35,360
dt the second partial of g with respect

357
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:39,039
to p times a half time sigma^ 2 pt ^ 2

358
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:44,000
Um and then finally this partial of G

359
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:49,120
with respect to P times sigma PT DBT.

360
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:52,159
Now if we think about discretizing

361
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:55,919
the price dynamics

362
00:20:52,159 --> 00:21:00,480
of the stock or the asset as well as the

363
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:06,960
derivative then we can say okay the

364
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:11,919
change or increment in PT is a mean

365
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:16,640
growth rate times delta t plus sigma pt

366
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:21,120
delta bt. So there's a random term and a

367
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:24,080
deterministic term given time little t.

368
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:26,240
And if we do the same for the increment

369
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:31,120
of the derivative,

370
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:36,320
we then basically substitute into dg uh

371
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:41,120
delta t's and delta b's. So we get the

372
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:47,200
same constant factor times delta t plus

373
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:51,520
dg dp times sigma pt delta bt.

374
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:55,679
And the uh sort of brilliant argument

375
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:59,600
for solving for the uh

376
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:05,120
option price or derivative price is to

377
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:08,960
consider constructing a portfolio

378
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:10,960
VT that eliminates dependence on the

379
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,840
Brownian motion.

380
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:18,159
So if we eliminate dependence on the

381
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:20,320
Brownian motion then we basically have a

382
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:25,760
deterministic

383
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:29,600
price function for the portfolio.

384
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:33,280
So one way of doing this is to say let

385
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:36,640
us short one derivative.

386
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:39,280
So minus GT.

387
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:43,520
If we sell the derivative at price GT,

388
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:48,960
we receive uh GT dollars

389
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:53,440
and then um the uh we're going to add to

390
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:58,039
that a number of shares of the asset

391
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,039
given by DGP.

392
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:10,400
So if we basically take minus1 times

393
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:12,240
this plus the DGDP times the asset then

394
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,080
the increment

395
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,880
of value

396
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,720
of this portfolio

397
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:22,320
is simply

398
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:26,159
deltat t times this factor.

399
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:30,240
And we've cancelled out

400
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:35,919
the terms in green when multiplied by

401
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:40,000
minus1 for the derivative or uh dgdp for

402
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:44,400
the asset. So we end up getting a

403
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,960
portfolio whose change in value depends

404
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:50,080
just on this

405
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:53,919
bracketed term here with no

406
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:57,520
brownie in motion increment involved.

407
00:23:53,919 --> 00:24:02,640
And so having eliminated

408
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:04,880
the sort of risk in the portfolio,

409
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:09,280
arbitrage arguments

410
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:13,600
say that VT must be risk-f free

411
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:16,799
and as a risk-free asset equivalent, it

412
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:20,480
should earn the riskless interest rate.

413
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:25,039
So our change in value of this portfolio

414
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:28,559
is simply the initial value times the

415
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:33,200
rate of return of the riskless asset

416
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:36,159
over the period deltat t. And so what we

417
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:40,080
can do then is equate the two

418
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:42,000
expressions for what the increment in vt

419
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:45,440
should be.

420
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:49,919
If it's riskless, here's the right hand

421
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:53,039
side. And according to our uh ETO's

422
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:55,520
formulas, the portfolio has a

423
00:24:53,039 --> 00:25:00,559
incremented value given by this factor

424
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:03,039
of delta t. So if we

425
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:05,360
eliminate delta t from both sides, we

426
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:08,240
get this formula

427
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:13,279
which is called the blacksholes

428
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:16,159
differential equation. Now what's really

429
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:20,480
significant is that at least when one

430
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:22,080
studies blacksholes theory in finance

431
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,600
classes

432
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:27,520
um one thinks of call options and

433
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,559
deriving their price or put options

434
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:33,679
through put call parody. Um what's

435
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:36,240
really important here is that this black

436
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:39,120
shell's differential equation applies

437
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:43,200
for those vanilla options

438
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:44,880
but also for any contingent claim sort

439
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:49,120
of derivative

440
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:52,240
where the derivative where where the the

441
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:57,120
financial derivative GT

442
00:25:52,240 --> 00:26:01,120
uh basically depends upon um the value

443
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:04,320
of the underlying asset. that.

444
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:07,320
So we have GT which is a contingent

445
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,320
claim

446
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,400
um and we assume

447
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:21,120
that GT

448
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:26,039
is equal to some function f of pt and t.

449
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:26,039
So we assume that the derivative

450
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:36,720
depends only on the current level of the

451
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:38,960
asset and the current time. Yes.

452
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:42,640
>> So they won a Nobel Prize for it, right?

453
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:46,960
What what part of the paper was like the

454
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:52,559
Nobel Prize winning? Was it like the

455
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:56,159
right? Um I it it really was the uh sort

456
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:59,520
of extensions of the initial uh papers

457
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:01,120
to handle sort of uh modeling

458
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:05,840
derivatives

459
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:08,799
under arbit no arbitrage assumptions.

460
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:10,799
And so the the basic theory sort of

461
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:13,279
extends

462
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:14,799
amazingly you know to a broad range of

463
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:19,200
applications.

464
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:22,400
And um so yeah, I the initial papers

465
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:26,559
were rather

466
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:29,520
impressive in terms of solving these uh

467
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:31,120
pricing problems using

468
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:34,080
uh

469
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,520
analysis basically. Um and so the

470
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,120
initial papers were really quite

471
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:40,799
mathematical.

472
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:43,840
Um and since then uh arguments uh and

473
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:45,200
developments have been made that make it

474
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,760
more straightforward and what we're

475
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,440
showing here is essentially the uh

476
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,960
benefits from from those later

477
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,360
developments.

478
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:56,080
>> Yes.

479
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:59,520
>> Um every time

480
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:01,440
changing what the portfolio is.

481
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,240
>> I'm sorry. Can you say that?

482
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,960
>> Like the amount of the asset changes

483
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,799
over time.

484
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:10,880
>> Yes. Um, so then he's like not seeing

485
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:13,919
why the the value of portfolio is like

486
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,360
BT like is it the amount of PT has

487
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:18,480
changed and it's going to get bought or

488
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:22,240
sold some of it or should be that cash

489
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:24,880
alongside it that tracks what?

490
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:28,080
>> Well, okay. I guess this this equation

491
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:32,159
should be um interpreted in terms of

492
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:36,799
just infiniteesimal increments delta t.

493
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:40,720
And as you point out as

494
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:44,960
time evolves the value of the contract

495
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:47,600
evolves the uh

496
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,760
derivatives partial derivatives of the

497
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:53,679
asset with respect to time those are not

498
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:55,760
constant as well. So as as the uh

499
00:28:53,679 --> 00:29:01,120
process increments those will also

500
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:03,919
change. So it's this is

501
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:06,640
a a simplification I guess of the

502
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:09,120
argument. But if we're looking at sort

503
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:12,480
of what properties must hold in the

504
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:14,399
infiniteesmal time range then this is

505
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,279
exact.

506
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,799
But okay.

507
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:21,720
>> Yeah.

508
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:21,720
Like why can we always say that like

509
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:25,480
that term after

510
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:30,760
>> Oh, why can we say that this equals this

511
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,760
term?

512
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:41,320
>> Okay, I'm just just repeat the question.

513
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:47,520
So like the expression for DG at the top

514
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:50,520
like how like

515
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,520
all

516
00:29:53,679 --> 00:30:01,039
>> okay you're saying that the VT equaling

517
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:03,440
minus GT plus okay that's um going to be

518
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:08,399
the initial

519
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:11,360
value of the portfolio at time little t.

520
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:13,360
So at time little t

521
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:17,240
we are

522
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,240
combining a short

523
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,840
uh derivative claim

524
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,440
>> ignore what happens

525
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:26,159
>> exactly we ignore what happens before

526
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:28,480
and and but this highlights in a good

527
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:31,039
way you know it's a good question that

528
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:34,320
when t evolves

529
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:37,520
or the time involves past time little t

530
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:41,760
then the partial of g with respect to p

531
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:43,360
at that future time point will not

532
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:46,640
necessarily

533
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:48,880
um equal this. And in order to have a

534
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:52,240
portfolio that eliminates the Brownie in

535
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:58,159
motion term, one would need to adjust

536
00:30:52,240 --> 00:31:02,600
the number of shares in the uh asset. So

537
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:02,600
if we go back to

538
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:11,679
this argument here where we sell short

539
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:16,480
one derivative and buy this many shares

540
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:20,159
at time little t. This cancels out the

541
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:24,559
brownie motion. Then for increments of

542
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:28,640
time t or time after t, we still are

543
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:32,159
short the derivative, but we may need to

544
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:35,520
adjust the number of shares of the asset

545
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:37,840
to buy to hedge that derivative. And

546
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:39,200
that's where delta hedging comes into

547
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,880
play.

548
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,559
>> That expression doesn't mean like we're

549
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,159
not assuming that we've done this

550
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:47,279
through time.

551
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:49,519
>> No, not at all. Not at all. Yeah. And

552
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:51,279
and it's sort of helpful just to see

553
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:54,320
okay

554
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:56,960
if at any arbitrary time t you want to

555
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,799
consider buying the or selling the

556
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:03,919
derivative valuing the derivative how

557
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:08,080
should that be valued? Great. Okay. So,

558
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:09,600
so what's important uh with this uh

559
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:12,000
blacksholes

560
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:15,120
partial differential equation is that

561
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:19,039
there are different boundary conditions

562
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:21,840
that vary by the derivative

563
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:25,600
that we are working with. And so with

564
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:28,799
call options we have basically the final

565
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:32,799
value at time capital t the maturity of

566
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:36,000
the option is given by the hockey stick

567
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:38,960
function of pt minus k if that's greater

568
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:42,799
than zero or zero. And similarly for the

569
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:47,919
put option it has this this terminal uh

570
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:50,960
value. Now um what's what's as I said

571
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:54,559
very powerful about this theory is that

572
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:56,159
um the partial differential equation the

573
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:59,919
blacksholes partial differential

574
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:03,360
equation is satisfied by any derivative

575
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:04,880
so long as there's no arbitrage in the

576
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:08,320
market

577
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,919
um and so with different

578
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,880
derivatives

579
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:15,919
uh contracts there will be different

580
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:18,799
boundary conditions on those.

581
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:22,320
So what we now want to do is figure out

582
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:26,720
how to solve these partial differential

583
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:32,720
equations. And what we're going to do is

584
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:35,600
go through the uh diffusion equation.

585
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:37,519
And it turns out that

586
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:40,000
the black shaw's partial differential

587
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:43,679
equation can be transformed into this

588
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:47,200
diffusion equation by changing the scale

589
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:49,200
of time, reversing time and doing some

590
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:53,440
other normalizations.

591
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:57,440
Um so so this diffusion equation is very

592
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:59,919
fundamental to solving the blacksholes

593
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:02,880
partial differential equations and it's

594
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:05,600
sort of the simplest form of this second

595
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:09,119
order partial differential equation that

596
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:13,760
we can uh study and understand its

597
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:20,720
solutions. So the heat equation

598
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:25,040
um is a an equation that is satisfied by

599
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:29,040
um a function u if the partial of u with

600
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:31,679
respect to t is equal to lambda times

601
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:38,200
the second partial of u with respect to

602
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:38,200
x2. So this is the heat equation.

603
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,679
Okay. So,

604
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:49,480
and um

605
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,440
we're going to give an example here

606
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:57,040
which is

607
00:34:53,440 --> 00:35:00,560
uh very important and technical. But in

608
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:03,200
terms of what kinds of functions satisfy

609
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:05,200
this diffusion equation, we actually

610
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:08,240
went through

611
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:10,640
looking at um

612
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:13,640
the density

613
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,640
um

614
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:24,480
of a Gaussian distribution

615
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:28,720
which is equal to 1 / <unk>2 pi

616
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:31,839
roo<unk> P E - one2

617
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:36,839
X^2 / T.

618
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:36,839
So if we think of a Gaussian density

619
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:45,599
which basically is a bell-shaped curve

620
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:47,520
around zero with some standard deviation

621
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:53,079
here

622
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:53,079
given by sort of one. Um

623
00:35:53,119 --> 00:36:02,040
this would be the density perhaps for

624
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:02,040
t = 1.

625
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:09,520
The density function and this is the

626
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:13,839
density of a brownian motion starting at

627
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:15,440
time zero ending at time t. And if we

628
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:18,000
consider

629
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:21,280
increasing time

630
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,520
then the change in P.

631
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:27,359
So P subt

632
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:30,079
is equal to lambda * P subXX.

633
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:34,640
Um

634
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:38,240
and so the change over time is

635
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:41,119
proportional to the curvature of the

636
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:44,160
density. And so if you look back in the

637
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:48,400
course notes, course materials, we sort

638
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:53,440
of looked at how the density of Brownian

639
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:56,560
motion over time it drops where there's

640
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:59,280
strong negative curvature and it rises

641
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:03,680
where there's positive curvature and so

642
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:06,720
we basically get sort of flatter curves

643
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:08,880
as time increases. So, so the normal

644
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:11,440
density function follows this heat

645
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:15,280
equation.

646
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:18,880
And what we're going to see is that

647
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:22,240
functions that follow the heat equation

648
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:25,200
can actually be represented as linear

649
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:26,880
combinations of these Gaussian

650
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:29,520
densities.

651
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:33,359
So the special case of the Gaussian

652
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:36,000
density is in a sense very very general

653
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:38,160
in terms of defining solutions to the

654
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:42,240
heat equation.

655
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:44,320
So let's consider

656
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:46,880
um

657
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:49,920
I guess how the heat equation is often

658
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:52,000
set up. It says okay let's consider the

659
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:54,880
temperature in a long thin bar of

660
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,280
material that's perfectly insulated. So

661
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:02,320
temperature only varies with distance

662
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:05,760
along the bar at time t. So we have um

663
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:11,359
the uh

664
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:15,280
so we have uh so mu of xt is um is the

665
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:18,560
value of the temperature over over time.

666
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:21,920
Um and uh

667
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:23,520
if we consider an initial value

668
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:27,599
for

669
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:31,920
the heat in the bar given by u not of x

670
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:37,760
um then uh what we want to do is solve

671
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:43,359
for how that heat function changes.

672
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:45,760
And so some really neat uh sort of

673
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:49,599
properties to

674
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:51,520
use are similar properties to what we

675
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:54,240
have when we're trying to solve for

676
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:56,400
ordinary differential equations.

677
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:59,520
So

678
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:01,599
first observation is suppose we have two

679
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:04,640
solutions

680
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:07,440
u1 and u2 then the sum of those is going

681
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:09,359
to also be a solution. So solutions are

682
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:12,800
linear

683
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:15,440
and if we have

684
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:17,680
a collection of solutions indexed by

685
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:21,119
little s

686
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:24,480
um we can consider

687
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:27,760
taking a weighted sum of those

688
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:29,359
per an integral and this will also be a

689
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:32,480
solution.

690
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:36,160
So the linear

691
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:40,640
uh linearity of the solution spaces sort

692
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:44,000
of extends to this integral

693
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:47,000
of solutions index bys also being a

694
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
solution

695
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:53,920
let's see

696
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:57,680
okay so um

697
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:59,200
the simplest initial value

698
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:04,160
problem

699
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:08,640
is to consider this u function to be a

700
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:10,720
direct delta function at x= 0.

701
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:13,280
So,

702
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:18,400
so u of x0

703
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:21,960
equaling the uh

704
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,960
direct delta

705
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:29,839
direct delta function

706
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:31,680
at uh t equals z.

707
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:33,440
Um

708
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:36,960
and

709
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:40,800
if we consider this

710
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:42,560
function which is essentially the PDF of

711
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:45,760
a normal

712
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:53,040
with mean zero

713
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:57,599
and variance 2 lambda t. Then this

714
00:40:53,040 --> 00:41:00,960
density function is um

715
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:03,839
turns out to h solve the heat or satisfy

716
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:07,599
the heat equation but it also satisfies

717
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:12,400
the initial condition where when we let

718
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:15,839
t go to zero then it equals the direct

719
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:19,440
delta function. So so what's the direct

720
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:23,480
delta function? It's equal to zero

721
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:23,480
for um

722
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:32,440
it equals zero for x not equal to zero

723
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:32,440
and it equals um

724
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:42,480
and the integral of u of x0

725
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:47,599
dx is equal to 1.

726
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:51,760
So it's a function that's positive

727
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:55,440
but has weight under the integral equal

728
00:41:51,760 --> 00:42:00,800
to one. So this is a rather abstract

729
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:03,920
kind of function to work with. And uh

730
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:08,680
actually I don't know if

731
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:08,680
is anyone here familiar with Paul Durac?

732
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:14,640
there's a great he he was a physicist at

733
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:16,560
uh Cambridge University

734
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:18,160
and if you're familiar with I guess

735
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:20,480
Schroinger

736
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:23,040
and uh

737
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:25,440
other physicists he's like number three

738
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:29,680
or four in the list of top physicists at

739
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:33,359
the time and um he came up with this

740
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:35,040
direct delta function as something worth

741
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:37,520
working with. So it's in a sense an

742
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:41,440
imaginary function.

743
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:46,480
It's basically the limit of

744
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:51,040
this normal density function as

745
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:55,599
lambda or as t goes goes to zero. So it

746
00:42:51,040 --> 00:43:00,000
becomes totally concentrated at zero.

747
00:42:55,599 --> 00:43:04,880
So um so with this function u delta we

748
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:07,280
have this uh particular uh

749
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:11,040
u function satisfying the heat equation

750
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:15,040
with that initial condition. Now

751
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:16,640
if we want to generalize from

752
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:20,640
this

753
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:24,240
initial function uh or the direct sort

754
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:27,440
of delta function at zero. Suppose we

755
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:29,760
consider wanting

756
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:33,920
to solve where the initial conditions

757
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:37,440
are given by a function u knot of x. So

758
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:40,560
in this discussion we can think of you

759
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:43,680
not of

760
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:47,839
x the initial value

761
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:50,160
being some arbitrary known function.

762
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:54,800
So it's like the boundary conditions of

763
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:59,280
this function at time zero.

764
00:43:54,800 --> 00:44:01,280
And if we integrate

765
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:03,440
our

766
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:06,880
u not function

767
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:09,520
with the direct delta function evaluated

768
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:13,440
at x - s

769
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:16,880
then we simply get back this you not

770
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:19,680
function at x.

771
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:21,839
So the direct delta function allows us

772
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:23,839
to pull out

773
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:27,200
in an integral

774
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:30,000
um the uh you not function itself. So

775
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:32,240
there's like an identity uh relationship

776
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,680
between you not and this transform of

777
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:41,680
you not with the direct delta function.

778
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:43,440
Now if we uh consider

779
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:46,440
different

780
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,440
solutions.

781
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,760
We can

782
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:56,240
index

783
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:58,880
solutions to this heat equation by uh

784
00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:02,720
delta

785
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:06,000
uh or or by s rather.

786
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:09,280
And then we can integrate this u delta

787
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:13,680
function with respect to the factor u

788
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:18,079
not of s and we get this formula for u

789
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:21,359
of xt. So, so for any initial condition

790
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:24,079
function u not of s

791
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:30,000
this integral

792
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:34,560
will in fact give us the solution

793
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:38,240
function u whose initial value u of x0

794
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:41,760
equals u kn. And so for in order for

795
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:44,640
this to work, we need to have the

796
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:50,480
integrals existing.

797
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:55,599
And if we have uh

798
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:58,160
if the integrals exist and we can take

799
00:45:55,599 --> 00:46:01,839
partial derivatives sort of inside the

800
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:05,280
integral sign then we end up getting the

801
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:08,000
partial of u with respect to t is the

802
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:11,520
integral of the partial of u delta with

803
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:15,200
respect to dt. That's the only part that

804
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:18,560
depends on t. And similarly the partial

805
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:21,040
with respect to x second partial we can

806
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:25,599
take that under the integral sign and

807
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:28,000
get this uh expression here. So if this

808
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:31,599
holds then we have this function

809
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:35,040
satisfying the heat equation. Now under

810
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:39,440
what conditions can we differentiate

811
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:42,079
integrals underneath the integral sign?

812
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:47,480
And if you remember from calculus

813
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:47,480
with real calculus how that works.

814
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,920
>> Yes.

815
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:04,400
When does US converges? when it

816
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:06,400
converges. Well, the uh

817
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:11,119
let's see

818
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:14,480
okay well ux of t will exist

819
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:17,040
if sort of you knot is sufficiently

820
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:19,680
smooth

821
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:21,839
and um

822
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:24,960
so if the initial conditions are

823
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:26,800
sufficiently smooth then they're first

824
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:29,599
derivatives and second derivatives are

825
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:31,680
bounded and so these integrals are

826
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:34,400
bounded and we're and they're abs

827
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:36,000
absolutely integraable and so we're able

828
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:40,400
to take derivatives sort of underneath

829
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:44,319
the integral sign. So um so when you

830
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:47,280
have sort of unbounded functions you not

831
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:50,400
um that maybe are sufficiently smooth

832
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:53,200
then one can take limits as sort of the

833
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:56,640
bound on that function increases and if

834
00:47:53,200 --> 00:48:00,720
those limits exist then these solutions

835
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:03,119
apply. But what's what's important here

836
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:06,960
is to see that

837
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:13,520
we have this u knot of x is equal to

838
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:16,000
this sum of the direct deltas

839
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:18,319
multiplied by

840
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:24,960
you not of s value. So it's a weighted

841
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:28,000
sum of direct delta and um the uh

842
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:31,200
so the equation the equation for the sum

843
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:33,760
of these uh or integral of those

844
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:37,040
weighted by u you not of s um is given

845
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:38,720
by this expression here. Now when we can

846
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:46,480
differentiate underneath the integral

847
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:51,680
sign then basically um the values of

848
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:54,880
the or the u function is the

849
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:57,599
can be represented as um in a tailaylor

850
00:48:54,880 --> 00:49:00,480
series with uh the terms in the

851
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:04,079
tailaylor series corresponding to these

852
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:08,160
d differentials and they each of those

853
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:12,640
satisfy the heat equation alone.

854
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:17,440
Okay. So let's see how this works with

855
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:19,200
where you not is an indicator function.

856
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:24,119
Um

857
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:24,119
so we're thinking of

858
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:33,240
let's see let me just write here.

859
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:33,240
So,

860
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:42,319
so let's see. For this description, I I

861
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:45,040
want to um

862
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:50,599
actually think about

863
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:50,599
ultimately a Brownian motion process XT

864
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:58,000
that starts at zero.

865
00:49:54,559 --> 00:50:01,520
And so we have different paths,

866
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:03,200
possible paths for this brown in motion

867
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:05,599
process.

868
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:09,760
And um

869
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:12,720
we're going to be interested in

870
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:14,720
basically an indicator

871
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:19,280
for

872
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:21,760
the path line between the intervals A

873
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:25,119
and B.

874
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:29,280
So let's consider

875
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:33,359
a uh a you not function for the initial

876
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:36,559
condition to be the indicator of

877
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:39,839
um whether a process lies between a and

878
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:44,400
b. So there will be some paths that

879
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:46,400
start with the indicator being one and

880
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:48,400
others with the indicator being equal to

881
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:51,400
zero.

882
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:51,400
And

883
00:50:53,440 --> 00:51:01,119
it turns out that the expectation

884
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:02,960
of you not the indicator function with

885
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:05,839
respect to this Gaussian density is

886
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:07,920
simply the probability of lying between

887
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:13,760
a and b.

888
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:16,160
So u of xt as defined in the top is

889
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:19,119
simply the expectation

890
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:22,800
of the indicator function which is the

891
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:26,319
probability of lying between a and b

892
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:29,680
and we can solve for these this

893
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:31,280
probability in terms of the cumulative

894
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:35,040
normal

895
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:37,280
cdf standard normal evaluated at the

896
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:40,160
upper limit minus the mean divided by

897
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:43,440
the standard standard deviation

898
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:45,040
minus the CDF at the lower limit minus

899
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:49,280
the mean divided by the standard

900
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:54,079
deviation. So this u of xt which is the

901
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:58,240
difference of two functions of gaussian

902
00:51:54,079 --> 00:52:02,160
uh densities integrals of them um is a

903
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:09,680
solution to this uh problem.

904
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:14,400
So um so now in the next slide um

905
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:15,920
whoops okay so that's that solution now

906
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:20,880
um

907
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:24,000
all right so um so the next uh set of

908
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:27,040
concepts we want to introduce you to are

909
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:31,440
solving these equations using properties

910
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:33,359
of similarity and invariance

911
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:37,359
And so

912
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:41,040
we're going to be considering changes in

913
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:44,160
the time and space variables. So here we

914
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:48,319
have time variable and here we have the

915
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:53,920
space variable with Brownian motions.

916
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:58,200
And so what if we were to rescale time

917
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:58,200
to a tow

918
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:07,680
which is equal to alpha t

919
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:10,720
and we were to rescale x

920
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:14,520
to a variable y which is equal to some

921
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:14,520
beta x.

922
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:22,800
So we're just changing the units of time

923
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:27,680
and the units of uh space in a constant

924
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:29,839
way. Well, if we

925
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:32,800
consider

926
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:35,800
a v function which equals the u

927
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,800
function.

928
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:40,960
Then um

929
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:44,800
we basically

930
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:52,000
can map u into v

931
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:54,400
by redefining u in terms of y. and uh

932
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:58,000
um

933
00:53:54,400 --> 00:54:03,119
sorry u in terms of y and u in terms of

934
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:04,880
toao. And so if we apply the chain rule

935
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:07,880
to

936
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:07,880
utt

937
00:54:07,890 --> 00:54:12,640
[Music]

938
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:15,599
and if we apply the chain rule to the

939
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:19,920
partial of u with respect to x we get

940
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:27,760
beta v y and the second partial of u

941
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:31,680
with respect to u y is uh beta^ 2 v y.

942
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:38,559
And so we end up getting our initial

943
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:45,000
heat equation in x and t to be this

944
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:45,000
equation in terms of toao and y.

945
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:48,960
And if

946
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:50,640
alpha

947
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:55,200
equals

948
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:58,960
beta squared. So we could arbitrarily if

949
00:54:55,200 --> 00:55:00,720
we sort of knew the um if we have if

950
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:02,800
we're free to choose alpha and beta

951
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:07,359
arbitrarily we could choose alpha equal

952
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:10,240
to beta squared and we then get va is

953
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:13,119
equal to lambda vy.

954
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:16,400
So this

955
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:21,920
is a heat equation

956
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:24,480
in terms of variables towo and y

957
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:27,119
and um

958
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:30,880
this must solve the original problem if

959
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:33,839
we substitute back. So we can think of

960
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:37,760
looking for solutions

961
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:42,880
that are functions that are invariant

962
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:45,119
under rescaling time and rescaling the

963
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:50,880
space.

964
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:55,839
So we must have that u of xt is equal to

965
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:58,400
u of root alpha x and alpha t. If we

966
00:55:55,839 --> 00:56:00,480
consider these this particular

967
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:03,200
transformation

968
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:05,920
now with the choice of alpha and beta

969
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:09,040
those are arbitrary.

970
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:12,480
We can choose alpha

971
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:16,960
equal to 1 / t

972
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:21,359
and then that means our u of xt is equal

973
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:27,200
to u of x over roo<unk> t and 1 which is

974
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:31,119
a function just of x over root t. So we

975
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:36,240
have a transformation of our original

976
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:40,640
scales to a problem where our solution

977
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:44,079
function V um basically or our solution

978
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:47,280
function U has this form and so it's a

979
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:51,040
function just of one variable.

980
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:55,040
And so when this is a function of one

981
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:57,040
variable, if we substitute that into the

982
00:56:55,040 --> 00:57:00,799
heat equation,

983
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:04,000
we get the derivative of h with respect

984
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:06,160
to t on the left hand side is equal to

985
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:09,119
lambda times the partial of h with

986
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:12,319
respect to x second partial on the right

987
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:15,520
hand side. So those are easily computed

988
00:57:12,319 --> 00:57:18,480
to give that top equation.

989
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:20,160
And then we can say well let's stop

990
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:22,880
carrying around x over root t

991
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:26,640
everywhere. Let's just use y / roo<unk>

992
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:32,400
t as our variable of interest. And we

993
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:34,160
get h prime of y * y /2= lambda hp prime

994
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:38,720
which

995
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:41,040
is given by this last equation here. Now

996
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:43,760
this

997
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:46,880
second derivative of h / the first

998
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:49,520
derivative of h is equal to the

999
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:51,280
derivative of the log of the first

1000
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:53,280
derivative.

1001
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:54,880
So it's one over the first derivative

1002
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:57,119
times the derivative of the first

1003
00:57:54,880 --> 00:58:00,160
derivative.

1004
00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:02,000
So we have that the derivative of the

1005
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:04,400
log

1006
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:07,359
of the derivative of h is equal to minus

1007
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:09,440
lambda over 2 y. And we just integrate

1008
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:12,720
both sides to get the solution for h

1009
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:14,880
prime is just a constant times the

1010
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:18,240
exponential

1011
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:23,040
of the integral of this

1012
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:25,119
which is y^2 over 4 lambda minus y^2

1013
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:27,920
over 4 lambda in the exponent. And then

1014
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:33,200
we integrate this again

1015
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:34,960
to get a solution for h of y. And

1016
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:36,559
it turns out that we're basically

1017
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:40,119
integrating

1018
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:40,119
a Gaussian

1019
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:44,720
density function.

1020
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:48,720
This is proportional to a Gaussian

1021
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:51,680
density. So it's anti-derivative is a or

1022
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:54,880
one anti-derivative is actually the

1023
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:58,799
cumulative normal uh standard normal

1024
00:58:54,880 --> 00:59:04,559
valued at y / 2 <unk>2 lambda. So with

1025
00:58:58,799 --> 00:59:06,319
this we can substitute in our value for

1026
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:09,440
y

1027
00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:12,799
back in terms of x and we get this

1028
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:16,720
formula here for what the

1029
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:19,359
uh u function is. Now with all of this

1030
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:22,960
development we sort of have a formula

1031
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:26,960
for what u is over the entire time

1032
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:29,839
domain. But at time zero, it's the

1033
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:31,680
initial condition. And so the initial

1034
00:59:29,839 --> 00:59:37,760
condition is the limit of this f

1035
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:41,280
function as t goes to zero. And so when

1036
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:44,480
uh when x is negative, this goes to

1037
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:47,920
minus infinity.

1038
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:50,079
And so we get zero for the cumulative

1039
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:53,680
distribution function. when x is less

1040
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:55,839
than zero. When x is greater than zero,

1041
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:59,280
this goes to plus infinity. So we get

1042
00:59:55,839 --> 01:00:02,079
one. And

1043
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:06,160
if x equals zero, then it's always equal

1044
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:08,079
to a half. So we end up having this

1045
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:11,760
function

1046
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:13,440
uh which uh corresponds to the initial

1047
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:17,200
conditions.

1048
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:21,680
um and uh

1049
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:24,079
this is the solution uh of the heat

1050
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:30,680
equation when the initial condition is

1051
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:30,680
given by this function. So let's see

1052
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:35,880
let's see if we want um

1053
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:49,920
well let let me just write as a function

1054
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:53,440
of x I guess um

1055
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:56,440
the function at zero

1056
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:56,440
um

1057
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:06,079
and then it's 12

1058
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:11,160
and then it's one here. So this is

1059
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:11,160
the function u of x0 for this case.

1060
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:17,599
Now if we um

1061
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:20,160
consider uh different linear

1062
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:25,040
combinations of

1063
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:27,760
this solution, we can actually consider

1064
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:32,319
taking instead of

1065
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:35,119
u of x0 equaling this, we can consider

1066
01:01:32,319 --> 01:01:37,119
u of x

1067
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:40,720
um

1068
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:42,960
corresponding to f of x - a over <unk>2

1069
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:46,079
2 lambda t.

1070
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:50,559
And so this basic these first two

1071
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:52,319
bullets correspond to shifting this u of

1072
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:57,880
x0

1073
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:57,880
to a values a and b

1074
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:05,319
and then with other one b

1075
01:02:05,839 --> 01:02:09,079
let's see

1076
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:17,440
sorry the uh

1077
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:21,359
so at a we have the same and then at b

1078
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:23,680
we have the same of zero up to b and

1079
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:26,960
then a half at b and then one beyond. So

1080
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:28,799
we basically have sort of two step

1081
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:30,480
functions

1082
01:02:28,799 --> 01:02:33,440
centered

1083
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:36,160
where where the steps are at x= a and at

1084
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:39,920
x= b.

1085
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:41,839
And so if we cons both both of these u

1086
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:45,520
functions will satisfy the heat

1087
01:02:41,839 --> 01:02:48,079
equation. And uh if we consider the

1088
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:50,160
difference of the two functions

1089
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:52,240
that will also satisfy the heat

1090
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:56,160
equation. And so if we look at the

1091
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:58,480
difference in the initial conditions for

1092
01:02:56,160 --> 01:03:02,480
these two

1093
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:07,359
solutions, we basically have the

1094
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:11,200
indicator of being between A and B.

1095
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:14,640
So one function for B you know is one

1096
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:19,920
forever and then the function for A is

1097
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:22,160
uh is one up to uh

1098
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:24,640
or sorry

1099
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:26,880
both functions are equal to one when X

1100
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:30,640
is greater than B in which case we get

1101
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:34,960
zero and otherwise we get uh one when a

1102
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:37,280
is between X and B and a half otherwise.

1103
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:42,079
All right. So, so what we end up having

1104
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:45,839
is uh for any initial conditions

1105
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:48,720
that are representable

1106
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:52,960
as a step function or a sum of step

1107
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:56,720
functions. We can get a solution in this

1108
01:03:52,960 --> 01:04:00,240
way. So for our initial conditions

1109
01:03:56,720 --> 01:04:02,960
you not we can basically

1110
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:08,240
use limits of these step functions to

1111
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:11,760
approximate any uh initial condition.

1112
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:14,079
All right. Well, with um

1113
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:16,640
stochastic differential equations that

1114
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:20,240
we want to solve,

1115
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:22,000
um we consider generalizations

1116
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:26,160
um

1117
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:30,079
of the drift and volatility parameters

1118
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:33,119
of the process. And so at the top here

1119
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:36,079
is or the general uh a general

1120
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:38,799
generalization of simple geometric

1121
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:42,079
brownian motion where the drift and the

1122
01:04:38,799 --> 01:04:47,359
volatilities depend upon time as well as

1123
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:49,200
the level of the process x. And so what

1124
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:54,079
we want to be able to do is understand

1125
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:56,880
when solutions to these uh differential

1126
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:59,280
equations exist. And there are

1127
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:01,760
conditions that

1128
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:05,920
guarantee solutions. One of them is a

1129
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:08,720
lip shit's condition which says that the

1130
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:12,480
change in the mu function

1131
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:14,000
with at a fixed time t

1132
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:17,280
uh

1133
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:20,319
for different values of x and y

1134
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:23,119
plus the change in the volatility for

1135
01:05:20,319 --> 01:05:26,000
the same t with different x's and y's

1136
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:29,680
that those are bounded by some constant

1137
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:32,720
times the difference between x and y.

1138
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:38,000
And if we have

1139
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:40,640
um the uh so so this is a sort of space

1140
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:44,400
time condition. And let's see with the

1141
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:48,640
spatial uh growth condition we also want

1142
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:52,240
the sort of magnitude of the drift term

1143
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:58,079
plus the magnitude of the squared

1144
01:05:52,240 --> 01:06:02,799
volatility term to be bounded uh by 1 +

1145
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:06,079
the square of the x values. So what we

1146
01:06:02,799 --> 01:06:09,440
have here are conditions for the drift

1147
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:11,200
not getting too wild and the volatility

1148
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:14,640
not getting too wild in order for there

1149
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:21,160
to be solutions to this.

1150
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:21,160
And um let's see with uh

1151
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:28,240
a really important theorem that we won't

1152
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:30,559
get into but which are dealt with in

1153
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:35,119
advanced books on stochcastic calculus

1154
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:38,960
deal with the uh existence

1155
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:41,920
and uniqueness of solutions to these uh

1156
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:46,880
stochastic differential equations. And

1157
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:50,160
so if we consider two processes XT and

1158
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:52,960
YT that are both

1159
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:56,799
solutions to the stochastic differential

1160
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:58,720
equation, then subject to the conditions

1161
01:06:56,799 --> 01:07:00,480
that we

1162
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:04,240
indicated,

1163
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:07,599
the two solutions are actually equal to

1164
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:11,039
each other almost everywhere. So we

1165
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:14,880
don't get different limits or different

1166
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:16,880
solutions um to the equations.

1167
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:20,079
So they're essentially unique and

1168
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:21,680
essentially means that with probability

1169
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:25,440
one

1170
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:28,240
the paths are the same.

1171
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:32,240
Now um in solving these stochastic

1172
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:34,000
differential equations um a method for

1173
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:36,079
solving these that turns out to be very

1174
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:39,839
useful is a method called coefficient

1175
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:41,760
matching. And so

1176
01:07:39,839 --> 01:07:44,480
let's just illustrate coefficient

1177
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:46,799
matching for geometric brownie motion.

1178
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:50,559
So here's the equation differential

1179
01:07:46,799 --> 01:07:52,720
equation for um geometric brownie

1180
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:56,480
motion.

1181
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:58,799
And suppose we have a solution

1182
01:07:56,480 --> 01:08:02,079
that's some function of time and the

1183
01:07:58,799 --> 01:08:09,200
underlying brownie in motion.

1184
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:12,799
Let's apply the uh eto's formula

1185
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:16,000
to x of t

1186
01:08:12,799 --> 01:08:21,679
and we get dx of t is equal to this

1187
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:28,560
expression dt plus this expression dbt.

1188
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:33,679
And so um the uh basically this dx of t

1189
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:36,239
is applying the chain rule to f of t and

1190
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:37,839
bt.

1191
01:08:36,239 --> 01:08:41,839
And

1192
01:08:37,839 --> 01:08:44,319
we can then say well let's match mux oft

1193
01:08:41,839 --> 01:08:46,960
with this

1194
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:49,679
red term here

1195
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:54,120
and match sigma x of t the coefficient

1196
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:54,120
of dbt with df dx.

1197
01:08:54,719 --> 01:09:01,600
And if we do that well the first or the

1198
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:04,480
second equation there sigma f equals dfd

1199
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:08,480
dx

1200
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:11,199
gives a solution of

1201
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:13,120
f equaling the exponential sigma x plus

1202
01:09:11,199 --> 01:09:16,920
g of t.

1203
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:16,920
So um

1204
01:09:20,239 --> 01:09:28,239
so this um so this first equation muf

1205
01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:31,359
equals um okay or sorry the second

1206
01:09:28,239 --> 01:09:34,960
equation sigma fdf dx

1207
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:37,839
um is equal to uh

1208
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:40,880
uh

1209
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:40,880
let me just write that

1210
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:51,560
Okay. So we have

1211
01:09:51,679 --> 01:10:02,000
we have sigma f is equal to df by dx.

1212
01:09:56,560 --> 01:10:04,480
And so we get sigma is equal to df by dx

1213
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:10,320
over f.

1214
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:15,360
And so um this is equal to d by dx of

1215
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:19,199
log of f ofx.

1216
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:22,000
So f ofx is going to be the exponential

1217
01:10:19,199 --> 01:10:24,000
of the integral of sigma with respect to

1218
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:27,440
x.

1219
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:30,880
And the g of t function will just be an

1220
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:33,760
arbitrary constant of that

1221
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:37,040
equation. And then if we substitute this

1222
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:38,640
for formula for f into the first

1223
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:45,199
equation,

1224
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:47,840
we get this differential equation for f.

1225
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:52,320
And um

1226
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:55,199
with this differential equation for f,

1227
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:58,560
mufals g prime f plus sigma square over

1228
01:10:55,199 --> 01:11:01,120
2f. Notice that f is a constant factor

1229
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:05,360
in each of those terms. So we can

1230
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:08,320
eliminate that constant factor or term

1231
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:12,000
the same term and we get g prime is

1232
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:14,640
equal to mu minus sigma^ 2 / 2.

1233
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:17,760
So with that we end up getting a

1234
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:20,320
solution for f which is the initial

1235
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:22,960
value x knot time the exponential sigma

1236
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:25,520
x plus this

1237
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:32,080
factor times little t and that factor is

1238
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:35,120
the uh adjusted drift of the uh uh

1239
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:39,280
geometric brownian motion. So we get

1240
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:42,640
that um we basically get our solution

1241
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:45,440
for uh

1242
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:49,520
geometric brownian motion coming out

1243
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:52,000
from that differential equation. Now an

1244
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:55,520
interesting paradox

1245
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:58,800
is that the drift term

1246
01:11:55,520 --> 01:12:02,640
is this factor

1247
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:05,920
and the variance is sigma t. Our

1248
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:08,239
standard deviation is sigma t for the

1249
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:10,480
value of a geometric brownie in motion

1250
01:12:08,239 --> 01:12:13,760
process.

1251
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:17,600
But if our drift parameter is smaller

1252
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:21,640
than sigma squar over two then this mu

1253
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:21,640
star is going to be negative.

1254
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:28,640
And so

1255
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:32,000
if we have a

1256
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:35,679
Brownian motion process, a geometric

1257
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:40,800
brownian motion process where the on the

1258
01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:43,679
log scale the drift is negative, then

1259
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:48,080
this is going on the log scale to go to

1260
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:51,280
minus infinity as t grows large. And so

1261
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:53,360
the probability that

1262
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:55,440
the geometric brownie in motion is

1263
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:59,280
smaller than any constant is going to go

1264
01:12:55,440 --> 01:13:01,360
to one as time grows large. So so when

1265
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:04,880
the

1266
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:07,120
mu terms the drift term is small

1267
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:09,040
relative to sigma squar over two less

1268
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:13,120
than

1269
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:15,760
the likelihood of this process

1270
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:17,920
going to zero

1271
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:20,000
is is

1272
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:24,080
uh occurs with probability approaching

1273
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:27,360
one. But complementing that is that the

1274
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:31,040
mean value of x of t

1275
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:34,800
is growing exponentially

1276
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:37,360
at the rate mu t exponential rate mu t.

1277
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:40,640
So with geometric brownie in motion we

1278
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:43,199
have this process that has a mean level

1279
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:45,920
that's growing arbitrarily large. But

1280
01:13:43,199 --> 01:13:49,199
the process is

1281
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:53,280
are with probability approaching one

1282
01:13:49,199 --> 01:13:57,760
approaching zero for all paths. So, so

1283
01:13:53,280 --> 01:14:01,120
that's an interesting um paradox, but it

1284
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:02,880
um it it it appears sort of consistent

1285
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:05,360
with what actually happens often in

1286
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:08,400
equity markets where you'll have some

1287
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:10,960
stocks that do really really well and

1288
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:14,320
others that haven't done so well and go

1289
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:17,600
close to zero. on average maybe there's

1290
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:20,239
a mean growth rate but uh many of them

1291
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:25,120
have uh ultimate values that that

1292
01:14:20,239 --> 01:14:28,640
approach zero well in the remaining time

1293
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:32,480
um there's an introduction here to the

1294
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:35,600
Orinstein ulenbeck process which

1295
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:38,560
basically is a stochastic differential

1296
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:42,560
equation where instead of a constant

1297
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:44,880
drift term we have a drift rate that

1298
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:47,199
depends on how far away the process is

1299
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:52,800
from the mean level.

1300
01:14:47,199 --> 01:14:56,000
And so um this uh model is one that

1301
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:58,080
arose with sort of physicists studying

1302
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:01,040
this where you look at the average

1303
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:05,199
velocity of molecules in a container

1304
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:08,880
with a certain heat or temperature. And

1305
01:15:05,199 --> 01:15:14,640
so particles should be moving around at

1306
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:16,800
some average velocity. Um and this model

1307
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:21,040
is is one way of trying to characterize

1308
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:23,199
that. Um outside the range of physics,

1309
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:26,239
uh people have used this model in

1310
01:15:23,199 --> 01:15:28,640
finance. Vasich used it as a model for

1311
01:15:26,239 --> 01:15:31,440
interest rate dynamics where there's a

1312
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:34,640
mean level that is expected in the long

1313
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:37,280
run and there's variation about that

1314
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:40,960
when it you when the process is above

1315
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:42,880
the average level it tends to drift down

1316
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:44,400
and when it's below it tends to drift

1317
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:47,040
up.

1318
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:55,520
So, so with this Ornstein ulenbeck

1319
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:59,199
process we can um consider uh a solution

1320
01:15:55,520 --> 01:16:02,000
which is a product process. Now you may

1321
01:15:59,199 --> 01:16:04,640
recall with some differential equation

1322
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:07,520
problems where you want to solve a

1323
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:10,000
differential equation with two variables

1324
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:12,400
and maybe the solution is a product of

1325
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:14,080
one variable times a product of another

1326
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:16,640
var

1327
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:19,600
times the uh a function of the other

1328
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:23,199
variable. So in this case we can think

1329
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:26,719
of a possible solution being given by an

1330
01:16:23,199 --> 01:16:30,320
a of t function times

1331
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:33,040
the integral of the brownian motion

1332
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:37,040
uh process with respect to a little bs b

1333
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:39,760
of s differentiable function. So if we

1334
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:44,000
just tentatively assume this possible

1335
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:48,640
solution, we can apply the chain rule

1336
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:52,880
to get this first equation uh dxt is the

1337
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:56,000
derivative of a times the bracketed term

1338
01:16:52,880 --> 01:17:00,880
then plus a of t times the derivative of

1339
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:04,960
the right hand term with respect to t.

1340
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:06,480
And um we can then use coefficient

1341
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:10,560
matching

1342
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:15,199
as per these expressions. And at the end

1343
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:17,360
of the day we end up getting our Orstein

1344
01:17:15,199 --> 01:17:21,679
ulc process.

1345
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:25,600
Um if we start at x0

1346
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:28,960
it well let's see if we consider the

1347
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:31,440
process with mu equal to zero and

1348
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:34,480
initial value of x knot then it

1349
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:36,239
decreases or increases exponentially to

1350
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:41,440
zero

1351
01:17:36,239 --> 01:17:43,920
and then um the extra term is this

1352
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:47,600
integral of brownie in motion with the

1353
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:49,679
exponential term and What's interesting

1354
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:52,800
about this process is that it has a

1355
01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:56,080
limiting distribution

1356
01:17:52,800 --> 01:18:00,320
that's not like a non-stationary

1357
01:17:56,080 --> 01:18:03,920
random walk of brownie in motion, but

1358
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:06,000
it's centered at the mean level, which

1359
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:08,960
was assumed in this development to be

1360
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:12,159
zero and with some constant variance. So

1361
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:15,199
there's like a an erotic property to

1362
01:18:12,159 --> 01:18:18,800
this process. The long-term distribution

1363
01:18:15,199 --> 01:18:21,440
is simply this fixed distribution with

1364
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:25,440
constant mean and variance.

1365
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:27,840
All right. Um well just to finish up um

1366
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:31,280
we can extend stochcastic differential

1367
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:35,440
equations in one sort of space variable

1368
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:38,000
and time to multi-dimensions.

1369
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:39,600
And so we can think of having m

1370
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,280
dimensional

1371
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:43,199
processes

1372
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:45,840
evolving

1373
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:49,920
for the uh functions.

1374
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:54,480
Uh so XT could be m dimensional and then

1375
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:56,480
we would have a drift rate

1376
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:59,360
corresponding to different components of

1377
01:18:56,480 --> 01:19:02,239
the dimensions mu1 to mumm

1378
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:06,159
different brownie motion terms

1379
01:19:02,239 --> 01:19:12,719
corresponding to m independent brownian

1380
01:19:06,159 --> 01:19:15,840
motions and then a covariance matrix

1381
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:19,440
reflecting the how similar

1382
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:22,159
sort of increments of x are related to

1383
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:24,239
each other um in terms of the

1384
01:19:22,159 --> 01:19:27,760
co-variance terms here in this

1385
01:19:24,239 --> 01:19:30,560
expression. So so we can have multiple

1386
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:34,320
uh multi-dimensional uh stochastic

1387
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:36,960
differential equations. And so um here's

1388
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:40,719
just an illustration of thinking about

1389
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:45,199
mean reverting velocity and position

1390
01:19:40,719 --> 01:19:47,520
uh and how that would be set up. So um

1391
01:19:45,199 --> 01:19:49,440
the theory of stochastic differential

1392
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:53,440
equations you know is very powerful and

1393
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:55,760
it's and exploited a lot in uh in

1394
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:59,600
physics and engineering.

1395
01:19:55,760 --> 01:20:02,480
So um with that um let's see I just want

1396
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:06,320
to highlight some useful references for

1397
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:08,719
stochastic differential equations. Um

1398
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:13,120
there's this really excellent uh

1399
01:20:08,719 --> 01:20:15,360
monograph on uh by Oxendal uh which is

1400
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:18,000
very mathematical

1401
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:21,199
not necessarily motivated by finance but

1402
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:24,080
uh motivated by physics problems as well

1403
01:20:21,199 --> 01:20:26,080
and then the other uh references here

1404
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:30,000
are really good ones in quantitative

1405
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:32,320
finance. So um we have our guest

1406
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:35,120
lecturer John Hall to thank for uh

1407
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:38,400
giving us this book on options, futures

1408
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:38,400
and other derivatives.
