small satellites are the size of a small

kitchen appliance if you only have a

3
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:08,519
couple big satellites you're not going

4
00:00:06,279 --> 00:00:10,639
to be able to see the same spot on the

5
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:12,480
earth for a few days if you're able to

6
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,879
put many satellites in orbit and have a

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,320
constellation those satellites can get

8
00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:21,039
revisits as quickly as an hour these

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,359
days satellites can look down and decide

10
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,760
what I'm seeing right now when I take an

11
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:26,760
image is just clouds so I'm going to

12
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:29,119
either wait until I come around again

13
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,080
and it's not cloudy or send a command

14
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,000
over to a neighboring satellite see if

15
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,760
there are no clouds there there are

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,320
different domains where these

17
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,800
applications are valuable we can make

18
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,800
surface maps at very high Precision you

19
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:46,239
can look for effects of storm systems

flooding wildfires in defense certainly

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,960
people to get a much faster response
