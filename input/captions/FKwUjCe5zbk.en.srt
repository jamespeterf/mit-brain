00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,639
My name is Trisha Denl and I'm with MIT

2
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:11,200
Startup Exchange and I will have the

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,519
honor of introducing today's MIT Startup

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,599
Lightning talks. Today you'll be hearing

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,520
from two startup companies. Both of the

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,520
presenting startups are part of MIT

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,680
Startup Exchange and they're developing

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,600
critical technologies and services to

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,600
improve data center management and

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,439
infrastructure. With this selection of

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,039
startups, we hope to give you a sense of

12
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,439
the technologies that are emerging from

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,239
MIT that are truly advancing data center

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,320
innovation. They're going to show us not

15
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,160
only their technology, but also some use

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,760
cases that they've been working on with

17
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,280
partners and customers. So, I do

18
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,120
encourage all of you who have interest

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,320
or would like more information to follow

20
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,399
up with the presenters today because

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,840
that is what we do here at MIT Startup

22
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:53,520
Exchange. We help startups identify and

23
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,360
experience partnerships and

24
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,399
collaboration and then we bring together

25
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,079
MIT connected startups and ILP corporate

26
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,120
members to foster collaboration and

27
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:05,199
partnerships between them. The startups

28
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,040
that we support have a strong connection

29
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,479
to the institute. This connection can

30
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,880
come through the founding team, through

31
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:13,600
the technology, and in other cases where

32
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,119
they don't have an origin here at MIT,

33
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,520
we will work with them because they've

34
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,759
been vetted and supported by our MIT

35
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,439
peer programs that work with startups in

36
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:25,880
this case like CEL Connect Plus,

37
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,880
Start.no, and the engine.

38
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,439
We have a network of over 800 startups

39
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,600
virtually working in any sector and we

40
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,759
are also geographically agnostic working

41
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,439
with MIT connected startups all over the

42
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:41,520
world. Everything we do is to expose and

43
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,000
to connect startups and industry in a

44
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,079
highly curated way and we also provide

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,720
learning opportunities to both parties.

46
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,640
So that includes launching calls for

47
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,960
startups based on corporate priority

48
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,720
priorities or challenges. Also

49
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,960
facilitating one-on-one meetings or

50
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,079
introductions, hosting virtual demo

51
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,600
days, workshops regarding the learning

52
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,600
opportunities. This is often when we

53
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,439
partner with other MIT peer programs on

54
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,439
campus in order to bring those again in

55
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:11,200
a curated fashion to our members and

56
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:13,840
startups. This here is a very small

57
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,440
example of the successful outcomes that

58
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,360
have come from the connections that have

59
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,520
been made through the ILP and MIT

60
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,360
startup exchange program. It's the

61
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,160
intent with every introduction, every

62
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,239
event, every meeting that these success

63
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,680
cases emerge. So if you have any

64
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,599
questions or would like more information

65
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,760
about MIT Startup Exchange, how we work

66
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:34,080
with ILP members, you're more than

67
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,519
welcome to come up to me or any of our

68
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,040
team. And of course, our program

69
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:41,239
directors are always happy to connect

70
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,239
you with startups through our network.
