1
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:20,440
Okay. So let's so assume that again that

2
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,440
we have a so this here is a sequence

3
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,880
then we can form from a sequence we can

4
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,880
find we can form another sequence. So

5
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:33,880
from

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,880
from a end we can form

7
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,760
another sequence.

8
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:52,120
uh at least if um at least

9
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,120
if a end is bounded from above.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,199
So we can form another sequence and

11
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,040
that's what we we take

12
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:09,680
uh bn

13
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:16,640
is going to be the soup of the set

14
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:21,119
of a starting at n. So this here is is

15
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:23,200
oops this here is the the sequence bn.

16
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,080
Okay.

17
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:30,280
And so right again implicitly here we

18
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,280
are assuming so assume

19
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,640
that uh that there exist

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,400
some c so that for all n

21
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:53,119
uh a n is less than c in other words c

22
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:55,439
are bounded from above right so if we If

23
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:58,479
we if the sequence a n is bounded from

24
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,000
above then this here gives us a real

25
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,320
number

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,640
uh and we see

27
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:16,000
and we see that since if you're looking

28
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:20,560
at uh bn + one this is now soup of a n +

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:24,480
one a n + 2

30
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:30,160
and this here is soup over a smaller

31
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:32,400
set. So this here is less than the soup

32
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,800
where we do it over where we take soup

33
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,319
over a larger set.

34
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,440
Right?

35
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,440
And that here is BN.

36
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:46,720
So we have that if you take any sequence

37
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,959
then you can and let's say that that

38
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,680
sequence is bounded from above then you

39
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:56,080
can find another you can form another

40
00:02:51,680 --> 00:03:00,040
sequence BN and BN here is mono

41
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,040
decreasing right

42
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:07,920
if

43
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,920
if also if the sequence

44
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,040
BN is bound from below

45
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:29,120
then uh then the BN here in the sequence

46
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:33,360
here converge and it converts to the

47
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:36,319
infam right this is this uh with mono

48
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:41,159
convergent sequences it's converging to

49
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:41,159
the infimum of the BI

50
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:47,319
like that.

51
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,319
Okay.

52
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,319
Now, um

53
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:56,560
[Applause]

54
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:59,840
and and likewise, so likewise, although

55
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:03,959
we won't really use this here. So,

56
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,959
likewise, but likewise,

57
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:13,360
Um again if you take if a n is any

58
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:15,599
sequence any sequence

59
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,599
this time I want it to be bounded from

60
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,599
below

61
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,680
then you can find a sequence then you

62
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:31,840
can form from a n you can form a

63
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:34,880
sequence uh cn and cn is just where

64
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:38,040
you're taking the infam one starting at

65
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,040
a end,

66
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:46,000
right? And you see that if you're

67
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:51,000
looking at CN + one, then you take the

68
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
infom over a smaller set.

69
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:03,680
So this is a smaller set and so this

70
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:08,199
here is bigger than where you're taking

71
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,199
the info from a end

72
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:18,800
and that's CN. So the sequence CN is

73
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:22,000
therefore monotone increasing and if it

74
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:25,000
is bounded. So if CN is bounded from

75
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
above

76
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,039
is bounded from above.

77
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:43,680
Then the sequence CN converge to some C.

78
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:45,840
And that sea is just a soup of the of

79
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,240
the seas,

80
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,639
right?

81
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:54,080
And so and we talked a little bit about

82
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:57,360
this earlier, right? And the thing is

83
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:59,600
that but now we will use it in just a

84
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:03,600
second.

85
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:07,919
The thing is so that in the first case

86
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:09,520
here we call B here B is written as a

87
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:16,000
lem

88
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:20,080
soup of of the of the an

89
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,800
and in the second case it's called the

90
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:25,840
lem in

91
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,840
uh of of the a

92
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,840
okay

93
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,840
now

94
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:38,639
so why is this relevant here for us so

95
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,680
what we were looking at last time So

96
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:45,360
last time and I'm only going to use the

97
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:49,039
lem soup. So last time

98
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:52,680
we had a sequence. So a n is a sequence

99
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,680
or was a sequence

100
00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:01,199
and we looked we defined what we call a

101
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,319
power series. And again power series

102
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:06,240
think about that x as being just some

103
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,800
fixed number

104
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,520
and you have the sequence a n x is some

105
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:17,039
fixed number and then you form the

106
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:21,919
sequence a n xn right

107
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:25,039
and so for each x fixed this gives you

108
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:27,440
some number maybe if it converge I mean

109
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:29,360
you can ask for each x you can ask does

110
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,160
this sequence converge or

111
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,639
And this here is called a power series.

112
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,720
So you're suming from zero to whatever

113
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,960
or you're signing from one or whatever

114
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,759
you're starting with up to infinity. So

115
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:48,240
this here is a power series.

116
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:50,720
And so now it for power says the the the

117
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:54,319
question is

118
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:57,039
how serious is the question is what

119
00:07:54,319 --> 00:08:00,000
about for which

120
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:04,120
for which

121
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,120
X does it converge.

122
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:14,080
Okay, so that's what we're interested in

123
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,759
and what we looked at last time.

124
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,680
So just let me remind you because we're

125
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:21,720
going to use that anyway in a minute

126
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,720
last time. So example

127
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,840
from last time

128
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,959
Well, the example we looked at last time

129
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:37,039
was we're looking at xn. I mean, we

130
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:39,839
looked at some other examples too, but

131
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:42,640
this was the one we focused on.

132
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,880
So, this here is a power series. The a n

133
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:49,200
in this case here

134
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:56,080
are one over n factorial, right?

135
00:08:49,200 --> 00:09:00,240
So now uh and we and for each fixed x so

136
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:01,920
for for x fixed

137
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,839
we looked at whether or not this

138
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:08,240
sequence converge and so we defined we

139
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,959
think about this thing here we thought

140
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:14,399
this here we thought about it as just a

141
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:17,200
sequence like this

142
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:21,839
sum of of a sequence so this is as a

143
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:27,519
series like is where the dn here is now

144
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:30,800
x to the n / n factorial right

145
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:33,120
and so in order to determine for which x

146
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:37,880
it converge so just think about x as

147
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,880
being fixed we use the ratio test

148
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:47,760
so we use the ratio test

149
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:52,240
and the ratio test um said that If

150
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:57,120
you're looking at dn + 1 / dn,

151
00:09:52,240 --> 00:10:03,680
this here is well dn is just x to the n

152
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:07,519
+ 1 / n + 1 factorial divided by x to

153
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:09,839
the n / n factorial.

154
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:12,880
And that's the same, right? So when you

155
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:15,440
divide by a fraction, you just switch,

156
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:23,760
right? So this is the same as x to the n

157
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:27,040
+ 1 / n + 1 factorial * n factorial * x

158
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:32,640
to the n. And you just think about this

159
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:35,040
the top here as x n * x * n factorial.

160
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:40,399
And the denominator you think about as n

161
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:44,079
+1 * n factorial * x. You see that this

162
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:50,079
here and this here cancel with those two

163
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:53,120
and so you get x / n +1

164
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:57,120
and this here converts to zero right so

165
00:10:53,120 --> 00:11:00,320
therefore the power series is convergent

166
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,560
for all x

167
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,680
now so that was a particular example of

168
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:11,279
a power series right but so uh and and

169
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:13,519
and it worked uh well with ratio test,

170
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:16,000
but but the root test actually is

171
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:19,360
better. And this was related to a point

172
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,720
somebody raised uh last time. And the

173
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:26,320
point was like you know like for the

174
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:28,240
ratio test it was you know implicitly

175
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,680
somehow in the ratio test was something

176
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:34,320
about that from a some stage on the next

177
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:37,120
element is smaller than the previous one

178
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,120
and you don't really need to have that

179
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,800
uh uh you know I mean you certainly

180
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:45,680
don't need it for a series to converge

181
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:49,279
but but it's not even necessary if you

182
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:51,839
apply the right test right

183
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:55,440
and so

184
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:59,600
so this come this this this bring us to

185
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:05,600
what's called the radius of convergence

186
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:08,959
so so this is a a crucial concept

187
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:12,560
and why it is crucial concept because

188
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:14,959
you see appro what you could imagine so

189
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,120
suppose you just take

190
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:19,760
suppose you just write down a power

191
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,320
shares like this

192
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:25,920
appro

193
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:29,279
maybe like that it's convergent for at

194
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:31,600
when x is equal to 5 it's divergent when

195
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:34,880
x is equal to 10 and maybe it's

196
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:37,120
convergent again if x is equal to 20

197
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,680
right that's not actually going to be

198
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:43,320
the case so there's something called

199
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,320
radius of convergence

200
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,760
and the radius of convergence

201
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:56,320
And the thing is that what you get out

202
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:59,519
of this radius of convergence is that a

203
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:02,320
power series like this is convergent on

204
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,720
some interval and then outside this

205
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,440
interval it's divergent.

206
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:10,560
So it's not like you have some that is

207
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,560
convergent here it's divergent there and

208
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:16,639
then it's like converging again. Right?

209
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:19,200
That's not what's going to happen. Okay,

210
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:22,560
part of this is also we already saw this

211
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:26,320
in the different test that there is at

212
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:29,200
the boundary of this interval it's it's

213
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,959
not it's it's the test is inconclusive.

214
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,000
So you have to check the boundary

215
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:39,200
separately. Okay.

216
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And so so the idea is that you take so

217
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:45,000
you you have a power series like this

218
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:51,760
and you think about again you're

219
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:55,200
thinking about dn as x to the n x again

220
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:57,680
is is thought of being fixed and now you

221
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:00,720
apply the root test. So apply the root

222
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:05,199
test but I'm going to apply it in a in a

223
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,199
better form than what we did last time.

224
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:12,160
Maybe I'll just state first first the

225
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:14,560
better form of the root test. So here's

226
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,880
the sort of

227
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,519
um

228
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,519
here's the the real version of the root

229
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:25,040
test.

230
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:29,480
So suppose you take a series.

231
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,480
Suppose you have some serious here.

232
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:38,760
This is let's call it the end.

233
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,760
Suppose you take a series like this

234
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:46,399
if you're looking at so now you the root

235
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:50,959
test right you took dn you took the

236
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:52,639
absolute value and you took the nth root

237
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:55,519
right

238
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:58,000
when I looked at the root test last time

239
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:01,120
we looked at whether this is convergent

240
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,680
or not right so we said if it was

241
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,680
converging to something, right? But you

242
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,560
could just take you could form this

243
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:10,800
thing here. So you could form from from

244
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:13,519
this here you could form this. This is

245
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:17,079
now a sequence and you could look at lim

246
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,079
soup of this.

247
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:26,160
This these here are all non- negative

248
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:29,839
numbers. Right? So um so uh and this le

249
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:32,399
soup here is now going to be either

250
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:35,440
infinite or it's going to be some real

251
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:38,480
non- negative number right this here is

252
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,399
going to be infinite usually we don't

253
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:45,360
talk about that it's converging if it's

254
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:47,920
infinite or it's it's some number

255
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,160
um let's call it let's call it d I guess

256
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,880
but

257
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:56,480
Okay.

258
00:15:52,880 --> 00:16:03,480
And the thing is that if you're looking

259
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:03,480
at if you set r equal to 1 /d

260
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:10,560
right sorry no if you're setting uh if

261
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:12,480
so so so this is just the root test the

262
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,959
sort of adult version of the root test

263
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:18,240
because this apply to all sequences

264
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:21,360
right for any sequence you have this for

265
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:23,759
any sequence dn if you're looking at

266
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:27,920
this series you can look at this right

267
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:32,480
and it's either infinity or d

268
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:36,279
and then if d here is less than one then

269
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,279
the series is convergent.

270
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:47,480
If d is bigger than one, the series is

271
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,480
divergent.

272
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,480
And if d is equal to one, it's

273
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,480
inconclusion,

274
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:08,160
right? The difference between this and

275
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:11,439
what we talked about last time was that

276
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:14,959
last time we assume that this thing here

277
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:17,120
converge here I'm not assuming it but

278
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:21,039
I'm then I'm looking at the lem soup

279
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:23,520
instead. Right? So this is does give us

280
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:25,760
a number.

281
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:29,440
Okay. And it's just a matter of whether

282
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:31,440
the slim soup is smaller than one

283
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:35,320
and then it's convergent or bigger than

284
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,320
one then it's divergent.

285
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:40,799
Okay. Now I'll come back to to the proof

286
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:43,120
but the proof is really kind of the same

287
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:45,280
as the one we gave. the one we gave

288
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:49,039
really, you know, the if you kind of

289
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:52,720
mimic what we did uh in the special case

290
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:55,360
last time, then the proof would still

291
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:58,000
apply to this case here and give this

292
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:01,760
result.

293
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:05,679
Okay. So now, but let's let's take this

294
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:10,360
this more fancy version of uh the root

295
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:10,360
test. Let's take that for granted.

296
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:15,840
And so

297
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:18,080
so now

298
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:22,880
so now I have

299
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:27,600
a power shares like this. I just for for

300
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:30,400
you know for for clarity I define dn to

301
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:34,320
be just a n

302
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:37,520
time xn and I'm interested in is for

303
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:41,080
what x

304
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,080
for what x

305
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:46,160
does it converge does the power series

306
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,160
convert

307
00:18:53,360 --> 00:19:00,720
Okay. Now,

308
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:03,520
so now you see that so lem soup.

309
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:12,160
So you you were looking at lim soup of

310
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:14,880
the nth root of d n is a n * xn

311
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:17,280
and you take the absolute value of that

312
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,240
right that's that's what you're looking

313
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:23,120
at and you asking is this smaller than

314
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:25,360
one or bigger than one

315
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:28,240
but this thing here

316
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,760
right this is the same as sou right if

317
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,640
you're looking at this thing here let's

318
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,559
do a

319
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,720
side calculation. If you're looking at

320
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:38,880
the nth root

321
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:41,840
of uh a n * xn,

322
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:45,679
this thing here is the same as the nth

323
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:50,320
root of this product here. Absolute

324
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:53,600
value is the same as this times x

325
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:56,000
absolute value to the n.

326
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,400
And when you take the nth root, you may

327
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,440
as well take the nth root of each of

328
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:05,400
those two factors individually.

329
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,400
So this is what you get.

330
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,960
But this thing here, you see this thing

331
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:15,440
here, the end root, this here is

332
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:18,080
whatever it is.

333
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,400
Can't do much about that.

334
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,960
But this thing here, that's just the

335
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,039
norm of x, right? The norm of x has the

336
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,960
property that when you raise it to the n

337
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:29,280
power you're getting this right. So this

338
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:32,240
is the end.

339
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:38,720
Okay. So this means that this thing here

340
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:43,840
is the same as the norm of x limb soup

341
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:46,320
of the nth root of a n.

342
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,840
Right?

343
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,919
Often you do it like this. You don't

344
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:54,640
have to do this. It's usually clear

345
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:59,200
anyway. But it off you write like that.

346
00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:02,640
Okay. So now what you do is so you you

347
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,720
want you asking when is this number here

348
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:08,960
smaller than one when is it bigger than

349
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:11,200
one right? And so you have that you see

350
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,720
now you define something that's called

351
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:17,600
the radius of convergence.

352
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,919
And so this is the following. So the

353
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,000
radius of convergence

354
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,799
is oops

355
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:28,880
radius of convergence is

356
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:30,720
so this is just radius

357
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,640
of convergent.

358
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,640
The radius of convergence is just a

359
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,640
number

360
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:43,760
and that number is radius of convergence

361
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:49,200
and we have to just interpret it a

362
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:54,440
little bit. So it's one over lim super

363
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:54,440
of of the nth root.

364
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,400
This thing here could of course be

365
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:04,320
infinite.

366
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:06,960
If this here is infinite then the radius

367
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:10,400
by definition this here would be zero.

368
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:13,679
Right? Right? Where this here is equal

369
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:18,760
to zero. If

370
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:18,760
there's lean soup uh

371
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:25,919
is infinite and otherwise right it's a

372
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,280
it's always a right otherwise yeah

373
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:32,480
there's one other case you have to

374
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:35,760
define that if uh it's infinite if the

375
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:38,000
lem soup

376
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:40,640
sorry this should be absolute value if

377
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,640
this lem soup

378
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:46,240
is true and otherwise otherwise it's a

379
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,760
you know otherwise there's nothing to

380
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,520
you know it's a well you know that's the

381
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,440
only thing you have to comment right

382
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,679
because otherwise it's it's it's always

383
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,640
a non- negative number but it could be

384
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:58,720
zero or it could be infinity but if it's

385
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,400
any other number then it is just what

386
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,480
you think it should be is one over that

387
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,200
number

388
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:09,919
okay so this gives you this is this here

389
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:12,720
r here is the radius of convergence okay

390
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:17,720
and Now the the thing is that now we

391
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,720
have the following symbol picture.

392
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:26,120
So now we have that. So you have this

393
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,120
power series

394
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,159
again it doesn't matter what you start

395
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,480
with the sum matters what you start with

396
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:39,919
but not the convergence. So you have

397
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:44,039
this power series you are forming a

398
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:44,039
This is the radius of convergence.

399
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:52,720
And then the claim is and again this

400
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:55,520
could be zero it could be infinity but

401
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:58,720
often it's just a a real number non-

402
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:01,760
negative real positive real number and

403
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:07,120
so it say that if you take the interval

404
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:10,799
here around zero in the interval

405
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:15,520
from minus r to r then inside this

406
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:20,360
interval here inside here when x is in

407
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:20,360
here then the Power series

408
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,240
is convergent

409
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,679
and when X is here or here

410
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,760
power series is divergent

411
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:48,320
and then when X's is here or here at

412
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:50,880
those two points then it's and clear and

413
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:54,760
further test is needed.

414
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,760
Further test is needed.

415
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,120
Test are needed.

416
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,840
>> Okay.

417
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,840
>> Yeah.

418
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:21,679
less than one.

419
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,600
>> Yeah. So that's right. So so let's come

420
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:28,000
to the proof. Yeah. So this is what

421
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:31,919
you're talking about. So

422
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:36,159
So this is this is the the radius of

423
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:39,679
convergence, right? And so as you say

424
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:42,159
um all we need to do is right but we

425
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:45,919
know from this from the more fancy

426
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:50,559
version of the ratio test that is in

427
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:53,520
terms of leap soup we know that so so

428
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:56,000
prove here

429
00:25:53,520 --> 00:26:01,960
power series is convergent by the ratio

430
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,960
test by the by the ratio test,

431
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:09,120
not a ratio test. Sorry, the root test

432
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:12,080
by the root test.

433
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:14,320
So again, the version the version the

434
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:16,320
lem soup version,

435
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:19,279
not the one I talked about last time,

436
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:22,080
but this one we just talked about, but

437
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:23,760
the lem soup version of the ratio root

438
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:27,120
test,

439
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:29,840
then the power series is converging. If

440
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:35,000
this thing here, so this means that this

441
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:35,000
thing here. So if this thing here

442
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:40,159
li

443
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:42,000
of a nth

444
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:45,200
root

445
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,120
if this thing here is less than one,

446
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:50,919
it's divergent.

447
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,919
If this thing here

448
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:03,279
is bigger than one and it's inconclusive

449
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:06,440
and it's and it's inconclusive if this

450
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:06,440
thing here

451
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,080
is equal to one here it's inconclusive.

452
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:28,080
But now you see that this here this here

453
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:30,960
just means that the norm of X should be

454
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:33,520
smaller than one over that. Right? So

455
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:36,880
this here is is is

456
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:39,360
the same as saying that the norm of X is

457
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,440
smaller than R the radius of

458
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,600
convergence. Right?

459
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:47,760
This here is saying this is equivalent

460
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:51,120
to saying that the norm of x is bigger

461
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:54,159
than uh than r

462
00:27:51,120 --> 00:28:00,279
right and this here is equivalent to

463
00:27:54,159 --> 00:28:00,279
saying that the norm of x is equal to r.

464
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:09,919
Okay. So so that is the that is the so

465
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:12,880
that's a radius of convergence. So you

466
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:15,600
see so this is like you know a pure this

467
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:18,159
is not at all clear

468
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:20,480
that it couldn't be that a power series

469
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:23,200
couldn't be convergent for like you know

470
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:25,279
some sort of discrete set of of x but

471
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,919
that's not the case right it's it's

472
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:31,520
convergent on some interval it's unclear

473
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:33,760
at the at the end of that interval but

474
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:36,480
it is convergence on an interval and

475
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:39,760
divergent outside that interval now that

476
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:43,440
interval could be just zero

477
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:46,000
Or it could be all of R. Right.

478
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:49,000
But it is also symmetric around zero.

479
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Yeah.

480
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:59,440
>> Right. So it's so it's one over this

481
00:28:55,279 --> 00:29:00,559
here. But remember how R was defined. R

482
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,559
is up there.

483
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:03,559
>> Yeah.

484
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:09,760
Okay.

485
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:14,320
Now

486
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:19,840
um let me just say a word

487
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:22,799
about why does the proof from last time

488
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:25,440
why does it really prove this more you

489
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:27,440
know I mean the sort of argument we gave

490
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:31,200
last time

491
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:33,279
why does it give you this much more sat

492
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:36,640
I mean it's much more satisfying this

493
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:40,080
version of the root test because it

494
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:42,320
apply to any series right the because

495
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,559
otherwise we talk about whether some

496
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:46,799
ratio was convergent but it may not

497
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:49,760
converge right so this is much more

498
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:53,120
satisfying so suppose again you have a

499
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:55,919
series like this

500
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:58,880
and so now you form you're looking at

501
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:01,600
lem soup so this here is again this is

502
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,520
the root test

503
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:06,080
root

504
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:10,520
test

505
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,520
version, let's call it version 2.0,

506
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:18,320
right? And so it take um series like

507
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:22,559
this and it's

508
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:29,880
it's looking at le soup and then the nth

509
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:29,880
root of the absolute value of dn

510
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:39,679
and again it say that if this thing here

511
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:39,679
is e is less than one it's convergent.

512
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:46,520
If it's bigger than one, it's diverging

513
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:51,720
and if it's equal to one, it's

514
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,720
inconclusion.

515
00:30:54,799 --> 00:31:02,399
Okay. Now let's let's try to see why

516
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:05,640
this here why this here is the case. So

517
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:05,640
proof of

518
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,360
of root test

519
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,919
version 2.0.

520
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:25,360
So now may maybe I won't do all of it

521
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:27,279
but let's just say let's just look at

522
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,120
because you see in a minute you see that

523
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:31,760
it's really kind of super similar to

524
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:34,760
last time. So suppose that this limit

525
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,760
suppose

526
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,559
that this limb soup

527
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:46,880
of the nth root here of dn suppos

528
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:50,960
supposed that this thing here

529
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:53,200
is equal to some d which is strictly

530
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:58,600
less than one.

531
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:58,600
Okay. So this means that there exist

532
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,799
uh

533
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:07,559
they exist.

534
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:07,559
So choose if you will choose

535
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,919
uh d

536
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:14,240
bar

537
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:18,240
will

538
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:21,039
uh d less than d bar strictly less than

539
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:25,720
strictly less than one.

540
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:25,720
Right? So I can choose it like this.

541
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:34,039
But now you see that if I choose it like

542
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:34,039
this then there exist

543
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:40,960
that so remember that let's just remind

544
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:43,919
ourselves that

545
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:46,960
how was the lim soup defined

546
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:49,120
the limb soup was defined

547
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:51,840
to be

548
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:55,840
that you take this new sequence so

549
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:58,000
you're taking this sequence here

550
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:00,320
to You're taking

551
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:04,000
these guys here.

552
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:07,200
So you're looking at now these guys here

553
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:11,519
and you are taking a you define a

554
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:14,080
sequence that is like the soup starting

555
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:17,679
at the nth guy

556
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:21,039
and like this here.

557
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:23,600
Sorry this here is n plus one

558
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:27,200
etc. Right.

559
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:29,760
Right. This is the soup of the tail,

560
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:32,240
right? And so this was this was that it

561
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:34,799
was soup on as you're going further out,

562
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:37,360
you're taking soup over a smaller set.

563
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:41,919
So these this sequence going down,

564
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:45,279
right? So now if this limit here is some

565
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:50,679
D which is strictly less than D bar then

566
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:50,679
it means that there exist so there exist

567
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:58,559
capital N. So that if little n is bigger

568
00:33:55,039 --> 00:34:04,000
than capital n then all of these guys

569
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:08,000
here is less than d bar. Right? So this

570
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:12,159
here is so that so if this here then all

571
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:15,280
of these guys here is less or equal to d

572
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:19,440
bar this is if little n if you starting

573
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:22,399
that far out right

574
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:25,040
but so now you see that so you have that

575
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:28,480
when n is bigger than this you have that

576
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:34,720
this so you have that for all these guys

577
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:39,440
here dn the nth root is less then d bar

578
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:42,560
less or equal to d bar.

579
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:45,359
But now you take the nth root the nth

580
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:49,679
power on both sides. So you have that dn

581
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:53,760
absolute value is less than d bar the n

582
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:56,000
power. This here is d is is and n is

583
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,839
this is even actually not negative. So

584
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,720
you don't even need this absolute value

585
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:03,680
sign. So you're having this but this is

586
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:06,800
a number that is strictly less than one.

587
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:10,440
So this here is a geometric series right

588
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,440
geometric series

589
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:23,599
with where where where

590
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:26,320
d bar is less than one. So it's is a

591
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:27,920
convergent geometric series. Right? So

592
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,599
this is you see that it was it's

593
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,359
basically the same proof we did last

594
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:33,920
time but last time we were assuming that

595
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:36,079
some ratio was convert you know or some

596
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,000
we were consuming assuming that this

597
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:40,160
this here converge to something but you

598
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:45,040
don't need it to converge you just need

599
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:46,640
that this soup is is um is is less than

600
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:49,760
one

601
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:53,040
and so likewise if you examine what this

602
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:55,119
case here say then just like last time

603
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:57,280
it's going to say that if this here is

604
00:35:55,119 --> 00:36:00,960
bigger than one then the ordinary

605
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:03,760
element doesn't even go to zero. Okay.

606
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:06,160
So it it fails the most basic test for

607
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:09,200
being convergent. Okay. So and that was

608
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:11,440
just like last time also and and again

609
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,200
the advantage is saying you were the one

610
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,960
that was asking yesterday. Yeah. I mean

611
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,440
like last time this with a ratio test

612
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:20,079
and the root test and and like in the

613
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:22,240
ratio test it's something about that the

614
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:25,599
next element is some you know is going

615
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:27,359
down with some fraction right and here

616
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:30,640
and you very much see that like this

617
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:32,480
here works for all series right and it's

618
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,400
really just because you don't compare

619
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:38,960
the element to the next but you're

620
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:43,040
comparing it to this fixed um

621
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:45,760
series which is a geometric is

622
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:49,760
okay.

623
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:55,359
So that's that's like the

624
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:59,520
uh that's the the the the real version

625
00:36:55,359 --> 00:37:02,160
uh so to speak of the of the boot test.

626
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:05,040
So now let's

627
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:06,640
let's talk a little bit more about power

628
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:09,640
series.

629
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,640
So

630
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:15,680
and I want to talk about so like there's

631
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:17,359
one function that is particular

632
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,440
important

633
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:21,200
and I mean like all of these sort of

634
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:25,119
basic functions are of course important

635
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:26,880
but they are somewhat similar and uh the

636
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:30,599
one I want to talk about is the

637
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,599
exponential function

638
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:40,640
And and there's various way that you

639
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:43,200
could define so what is the exponential

640
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:45,280
function? There's various ways that you

641
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,359
could define the exponential function.

642
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,520
You can define it, you know, like two

643
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:52,079
that comes to mind, but there's others

644
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:54,400
too. One is that you could define it to

645
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:56,880
be a function that's satisfying a

646
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:59,200
certain differential equation and that

647
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,200
would be a good way of defining it.

648
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,960
Another way of defining it which is more

649
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:06,240
relevant to what we're doing here is

650
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:09,599
defining it as a power series.

651
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:13,040
So I'm looking at

652
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:18,480
but at e to the x

653
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:23,200
and um and I'm looking at e to the x. So

654
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:27,040
I define e capital e of x as this power

655
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:29,920
series that we looked at before.

656
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:34,240
Okay.

657
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:36,320
Now I want to prove that this here is

658
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:39,200
really what you should think of this.

659
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:42,720
This here is the exponential function.

660
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:47,960
So so I want to show but what does it

661
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:47,960
mean that it is expon want to show

662
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,640
that

663
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:55,920
this is

664
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:59,839
the exponential function. So what do I

665
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:01,680
mean by I mean of course I could

666
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:04,000
you know I could define any function to

667
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:06,079
be the exponential function but there

668
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,680
are certain properties of the

669
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:15,040
exponential function that you would want

670
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:20,560
right and so um well the first thing I

671
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:24,160
observe is that e of zero

672
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:28,000
is equal to if if all of these if x is

673
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:32,000
zero then all of these are zero except

674
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:35,760
when n is equal to zero and then x to

675
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:39,200
the zero this here is by definition one

676
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:42,880
okay and this here is is zero factorial

677
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:46,680
is by definition one so this here is is

678
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,680
one by definition

679
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:51,680
and we know already by the way that this

680
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:54,560
here we have already seen that the

681
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:57,560
radius of convergence for this power

682
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,560
series

683
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,560
of convergence

684
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,680
is equal to infinity right we have

685
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:12,000
already seen that right so it's a well-

686
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:18,040
definfined function for all x okay now

687
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:18,040
I'm later going to prove so next time

688
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,400
we will show

689
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:31,280
that if you define it like that that

690
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:36,640
that that this function here defined

691
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:39,200
like that has a property that x e to x +

692
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:43,640
y

693
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:43,640
is equal to this product here.

694
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:50,480
Okay.

695
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:53,920
Now uh using this well the first thing I

696
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:55,760
can observe is I haven't really gotten

697
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,520
to the property yet but I'm just at the

698
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:59,839
moment I'm just examining that

699
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:03,599
particular function you know some

700
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:05,599
properties that it has

701
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:08,640
and so the first thing I will observe is

702
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:11,680
that if x here is positive or non-

703
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:13,599
negative right then all of these numbers

704
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,760
are non- negative so you're summing non-

705
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:17,040
negative numbers so the sum is non-

706
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,359
negative

707
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:22,560
So if

708
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:27,119
x is bigger equal to zero then it

709
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:29,359
implies that e of x is big is actually

710
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:32,480
strictly positive

711
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:35,280
right in fact the smallest one is where

712
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:38,160
you x was equal to zero but in that case

713
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:41,839
you got one right

714
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:45,680
now if x here is negative then it's not

715
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:47,200
super clear right if x is negative you

716
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:49,280
know some of these numbers that you'll

717
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:51,680
be summing are positive and some of them

718
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:55,040
are negative. So it's not at all clear

719
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:57,359
what happened to the sum. But if if you

720
00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:00,240
grant me this for the for the moment

721
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:05,359
this relationship here then we would

722
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:11,680
have that e to the x minus e to minus

723
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:13,440
sorry e in x - x. So that's the same as

724
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:17,599
let me just make a little more space

725
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:21,599
here. So e of zero which I already know

726
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:24,880
is one. This here can think about that

727
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:26,800
as x - x

728
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:31,760
or if you will you could think about it

729
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:35,200
as x + - x.

730
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:38,800
And now if you grant me this this thing

731
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:42,319
here that we prove next time then I can

732
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:49,119
write this here as e

733
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:52,480
of x * e of minus x right

734
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:56,880
uh yeah sorry yeah

735
00:42:52,480 --> 00:43:02,480
okay and now if x here is negative then

736
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:02,480
of course minus x is positive

737
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:07,920
So this thing here. So now I know by

738
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:09,440
this thing here that this here is

739
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,680
positive.

740
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:14,000
And so since the product of these two

741
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:16,800
things is one, this here must be

742
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:21,280
strictly positive as well. Right? So

743
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:24,160
this imply that e to the x is also

744
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:26,240
strictly positive.

745
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:28,400
Okay?

746
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,839
So this is just a couple of observation.

747
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,599
Now, of course, I'm using that

748
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:33,280
relationship that I haven't established

749
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:35,119
yet, but I will establish that next

750
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,599
time.

751
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:40,720
The next thing is that I want to define

752
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:45,400
the number E.

753
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:45,400
And so I define this.

754
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:55,920
So E that is 2.7 whatever I don't

755
00:43:50,480 --> 00:44:00,160
remember. Uh but so E we define so

756
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:02,160
little E. So I define it as this

757
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:07,000
function here

758
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:07,000
evaluated in one. Okay.

759
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:14,400
Now I want to define so I have my

760
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:19,680
function capital E but I want to define

761
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:22,920
a second function that is E. So, so want

762
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,920
to define

763
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:29,240
a second function

764
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:37,680
and that is e to the x like this, right?

765
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:41,200
And that should have the kind of

766
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:45,520
properties that you uh that you think it

767
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:49,680
should have. Okay? So but first before I

768
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:54,240
do that let me just think if if you take

769
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:58,079
e to the power m m here

770
00:44:54,240 --> 00:45:03,400
m is let's say that m here

771
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:03,400
uh let's say that m is a is a integer

772
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:09,839
if if um this here this here should just

773
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:14,520
be

774
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:14,520
e * E

775
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,200
M*s

776
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:23,680
right

777
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:27,280
note that this here is this here I can

778
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:30,960
of course write as E

779
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:34,200
this is what E is so I can write it as

780
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,200
this here

781
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:37,960
M times

782
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:46,319
but now I can use this hair that I will

783
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:50,720
prove next time again. So if I take E of

784
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:54,800
1 * E of 1 then that's E of two. And if

785
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:58,079
I take E here three times then it's E of

786
00:45:54,800 --> 00:46:03,520
three. Right? So this thing here is

787
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:05,200
actually the same as capital E of M.

788
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:07,359
Right?

789
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:11,359
So I have that.

790
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:13,760
I also by definition so

791
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:19,119
e to the zero this here I'm setting

792
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:23,839
equal to one but I already have that one

793
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:26,319
was equal to this capital e in in in

794
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:29,520
zero right

795
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:32,319
okay now what about if m here is a

796
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,319
negative integer

797
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:47,280
So suppose that m here is a negative

798
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:50,280
integer. Suppose that m here is

799
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,280
negative.

800
00:46:51,040 --> 00:47:01,200
So sorry what should e to the m here be?

801
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:03,119
This here is just one over e to the

802
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:07,839
minus

803
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:10,800
uh m. Okay, minus m is a positive

804
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:13,800
integer, right? So this so this makes

805
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,800
sense.

806
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:18,560
Now

807
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:20,079
if you're looking at

808
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:23,040
E

809
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:25,920
to the again using this relationship

810
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:27,839
here E the one and in fact the one we

811
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:31,520
just did.

812
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:36,400
So this is on integers

813
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:39,599
um this here is now equal to E of zero

814
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:42,800
which is equal to one.

815
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:45,359
And so this imply and this is by this by

816
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:50,640
that relationship over there. It's E of

817
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:56,160
M * E of minus M. And so you see that

818
00:47:50,640 --> 00:48:00,880
this implies that E of minus M is equal

819
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:04,560
to 1 / E of M by just dividing this on

820
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:07,839
both sides. So you have this and this

821
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:10,400
thing here. But this thing here,

822
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:13,040
sorry, this is not what I wanted. Uh, if

823
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:18,119
I take M negative, I just use the other

824
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:18,119
one. Sorry, e of M

825
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:26,160
is equal to 1 / E of minus M like that,

826
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:29,359
right?

827
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:31,920
M is M was supposed to be negative. So,

828
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:36,000
this means that minus M is a positive

829
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:39,040
integer. And this one here is then this

830
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:42,640
one. I know that this here already agree

831
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:46,960
with uh

832
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:49,920
with um with uh this little function of

833
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:55,119
e. So you see that this thing here is

834
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:58,480
agrees with e to the power m. Right.

835
00:48:55,119 --> 00:49:02,400
Right. Because we we defined it like

836
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:05,040
this. And now just checking that also on

837
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:09,040
the negative integer this function here

838
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:11,040
and this function here agree. Okay. So,

839
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:13,520
so I now have these two different

840
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:15,839
functions. Well, one I haven't really

841
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:17,599
defined yet. I've only defined it now on

842
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:19,920
all integers.

843
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:22,079
But, but so far these two functions

844
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:26,800
agree.

845
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:29,280
Now what I also should have is that I

846
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:32,920
should have so suppose you're looking at

847
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,920
a rational number.

848
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:38,559
So suppose you take a rational number.

849
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:40,720
Remember we usually write a rational

850
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:44,000
number. So suppose that Q here is a

851
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:47,599
rational number. We usually write a

852
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:50,599
rational number as

853
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:50,599
a

854
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:56,880
as an element in set. So it could be

855
00:49:52,960 --> 00:50:00,960
negative, it could be zero and n here is

856
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:03,960
a positive integer. So fraction like

857
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,960
this.

858
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:13,440
Now what should E

859
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:17,200
of Q be? Right?

860
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:19,359
Well, E of Q um this here should be

861
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:22,319
right how you would think about it is

862
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:24,800
that it really should be something

863
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:28,319
it should be something this here should

864
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:31,119
be a number should be a number alpha and

865
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:33,280
this should have the property that is

866
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:35,920
positive

867
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:42,720
and it should have the property so let's

868
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:45,839
just write it so so E of Q this is m /

869
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:49,599
n. It should have the property that if

870
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:53,040
you raise it alpha here suppose you were

871
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:54,720
raising it to the power n then you

872
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:58,800
should get this number that we have

873
00:50:54,720 --> 00:51:02,880
already defined right. So should have it

874
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:05,760
should be positive and when you raise it

875
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:08,880
like this um then it should give you

876
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:10,960
that and just like with square root of

877
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:12,880
two it's just one element with this

878
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:16,160
property

879
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:18,800
okay so that's defined uh what it so so

880
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:20,559
this way you see this way we have now

881
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:24,480
defined

882
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:26,960
this function e on all rational numbers

883
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:29,520
but now we need to check right we need

884
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:33,559
to check that this thing here need to

885
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:33,559
check. So

886
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,839
that that

887
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:42,319
EQ

888
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:44,240
is equal

889
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:47,440
like that. Right? So I need to check

890
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:49,280
that. Okay?

891
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:54,559
So

892
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:57,200
I want to say that that E to the Q is

893
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:59,760
that alpha, right?

894
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:02,079
So this means that

895
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:05,119
I want to show

896
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:06,720
so I need to show two things

897
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:09,200
E

898
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:11,200
to Q is positive. Well, I've already

899
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:14,079
checked that right because you check at

900
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:16,640
at E capital E at anything is positive.

901
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:20,240
So this is okay. The second thing I need

902
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:23,839
to check is that it has the property

903
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:28,480
that if you raise it to the n power then

904
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:31,920
you're getting uh then you're getting e

905
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:36,640
um e to the to the m

906
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:38,720
right now e to the m that's an integer.

907
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:41,839
It could be negative

908
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:45,200
but e to any negative integer whether

909
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:48,079
it's ne positive or or negative we

910
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:50,960
already checked that this is equal to

911
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:53,119
capital e of m.

912
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:56,880
Okay.

913
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:58,640
So now I need to so this here is so now

914
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:02,760
what is this? So what do I need to

915
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:02,760
check? So I need to check

916
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:11,280
that e

917
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:16,640
to the m / n. This thing here raised to

918
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:20,480
the power n is equal to this. But but

919
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:23,599
what is this here? This here is just e

920
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:28,599
to the m / n

921
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:28,599
time multiply itself n times.

922
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:33,720
So this is now n times.

923
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:41,599
But now I can use again this thing that

924
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:44,720
I proved next time that when I do it

925
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:46,880
like here I'm just doing it two times

926
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:49,200
and here I'm just doing it for I'm doing

927
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:53,040
it for different x and y. But if I do it

928
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:57,440
n times with the same x then I'm just

929
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:59,680
adding that x together n times.

930
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:03,839
Right?

931
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:09,599
And so this thing here is the same as e

932
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:14,400
by that rule over there n * m / n but

933
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:16,800
this is just e of m as it should be

934
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:20,079
right. So you see that these two

935
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:23,079
functions here. So the conclusion so far

936
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:23,079
is

937
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:32,240
the conclusion now is that

938
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:38,000
this function here

939
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:41,000
is equal to this function here for all

940
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Q

941
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:48,079
for all rational numbers. Okay.

942
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:50,480
Now what other property should this

943
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:52,559
exponential? So this here you know so

944
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:54,400
far this is kind of the property that

945
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:57,200
you want of the exponential function

946
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:59,599
right but what other property should the

947
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:02,480
exponential function have it should have

948
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:04,880
one other property and that's enough to

949
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:08,240
determine it and that is it should be

950
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:12,160
continuous. So one more property is that

951
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:18,200
this function e to the x when x is

952
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:18,200
defined like this this function

953
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,960
should be continuous

954
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:30,160
and we'll talk a little bit more about

955
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:32,960
continuous function in just a second.

956
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:37,160
Okay. Now, now then I have a theorem

957
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:37,160
that we prove next time

958
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:46,800
one of the next times and and that is

959
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:50,000
that suppose you take two functions.

960
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:52,319
So so we then can appeal to the

961
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:57,920
following theorem.

962
00:55:52,319 --> 00:56:01,559
If f and g are two

963
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:01,559
continuous functions

964
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:14,440
on a

965
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:14,440
that agree

966
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:21,920
on all

967
00:56:19,839 --> 00:56:24,400
of do.

968
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:26,960
So if you have two continuous functions

969
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:28,799
and they if you restrict it to the

970
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:30,799
rational number then the two functions

971
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:32,480
are the same.

972
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:34,720
If they're both continuous then the

973
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:40,559
function has to be the same. So this

974
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:43,040
implies that f is equal to g everywhere

975
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:46,440
not just on the rational function

976
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:46,440
rational numbers.

977
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:56,079
Okay. So we'll prove that either next

978
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:59,280
time or the following time. Let me just

979
00:56:56,079 --> 00:57:01,680
go back and remind you

980
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:03,359
about what it means for a function to be

981
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:05,760
continuous.

982
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:09,640
Uh so

983
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:09,640
so this is the fine

984
00:57:18,319 --> 00:57:21,720
so continuous.

985
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:32,559
So suppose you take a function and the

986
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:36,559
function uh is it doesn't even need to

987
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:38,880
be defined on an interval. Um

988
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:40,480
I but you may as well assume that it's

989
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:43,839
interval but it doesn't need to be

990
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:47,119
defined on the interval.

991
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:50,119
So a function here f is set to be

992
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:50,119
continuous

993
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:56,440
be continuous

994
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:04,319
at x here

995
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:07,319
in the domain where it's defined.

996
00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:07,319
If

997
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:13,280
for all

998
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:16,520
epsilon greater than zero

999
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:16,520
there exist

1000
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:25,920
delta greater than zero such that

1001
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:29,440
if x - x0

1002
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:33,040
is smaller than delta then the images

1003
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:33,040
are epsilon close to each

1004
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:45,520
And so again this delta typically

1005
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:49,920
depends not just on epsilon but also on

1006
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:53,520
x0 right and so the function so this is

1007
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:57,760
so it's continuous at a point x0 if this

1008
00:58:53,520 --> 00:59:01,200
here is the case and the function f here

1009
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:01,200
is set to be continuous

1010
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:11,599
If

1011
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:14,599
it is

1012
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:14,599
continuous

1013
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:19,000
at all points.

1014
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:29,359
Okay.

1015
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:33,200
Now let's just let's let's look at two

1016
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:35,839
simple examples and and and and

1017
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:39,920
then once we have those

1018
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:42,319
uh then together with some algebraic

1019
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:45,839
rules that are similar to the algebraic

1020
00:59:42,319 --> 00:59:49,839
rules that we had for sequences

1021
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:53,680
then we get a huge

1022
00:59:49,839 --> 00:59:55,839
number of examples of you get a large uh

1023
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:57,680
collection of examples of continuous

1024
00:59:55,839 --> 00:59:59,920
functions.

1025
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:02,880
So the first example is like the

1026
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:05,520
simplest of all example

1027
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:08,520
where f here is is the constant

1028
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:08,520
function.

1029
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:19,280
So I'm thinking about f here is to be

1030
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:23,920
defined from r into r and for each x in

1031
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:27,680
r it's equal to the same constant. Okay.

1032
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:29,440
So that's f. I want to show that this f

1033
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:35,040
is that a constant function is

1034
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:38,440
continuous. So given so proof

1035
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:38,440
of continuity.

1036
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:52,319
So given epsilon

1037
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:54,640
given epsilon greater than zero in this

1038
01:00:52,319 --> 01:00:57,359
part says you can pick any delta you

1039
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:58,960
want. I'm just picking

1040
01:00:57,359 --> 01:01:01,520
let

1041
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:04,480
delta be equal to one but you could pick

1042
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:07,280
anything you want. It has to be positive

1043
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:11,920
but you can pick anything you want. Then

1044
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:14,400
you have that if x minus x0

1045
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:17,839
is less than one.

1046
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:22,079
Well then of course f ofx

1047
01:01:17,839 --> 01:01:25,520
minus f of x0 both of these numbers is

1048
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:27,200
c. So the difference so this is c minus

1049
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:30,000
c.

1050
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:33,200
So this is zero. So this is surely less

1051
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:35,680
than epsilon. Right? So they show that

1052
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:37,760
it's the function is continuous at all

1053
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:40,559
point. And you see that you could pick

1054
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:42,960
delta anything you want. And of course

1055
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:45,280
in particular it's it's doesn't even

1056
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:49,760
depend on x0. It doesn't depend on

1057
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:53,359
epsilon and it doesn't depend on x0.

1058
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:55,119
Okay. So the constant functions are for

1059
01:01:53,359 --> 01:02:00,079
continuous.

1060
01:01:55,119 --> 01:02:02,960
What about then next simple the next

1061
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:07,119
simplest function would be the linear

1062
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:09,920
function or just x function x.

1063
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:13,799
So suppose you take

1064
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:13,799
because you're looking at

1065
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:26,640
at the function f on r to r

1066
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:30,040
where f of x is equal to x. So this is

1067
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:30,040
also continuous

1068
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:35,720
also continuous

1069
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:41,160
and the proof of that

1070
01:02:41,359 --> 01:02:44,839
given epsilon

1071
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:50,000
set

1072
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:54,640
delta equal to epsilon

1073
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:58,480
then you see that if x - x0

1074
01:02:54,640 --> 01:03:03,760
is less than epsilon then

1075
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:08,799
uh f ofx minus f of x0 but f of x is

1076
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:12,079
equal to x and f of x0 is equal to x0 so

1077
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:14,799
this thing here is of course less than

1078
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:18,400
epsilon not right

1079
01:03:14,799 --> 01:03:20,799
so this is so so so that's kind of

1080
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:24,640
trivial okay

1081
01:03:20,799 --> 01:03:28,559
now the next thing is that we have uh

1082
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:31,839
the algebraic uh property of continuous

1083
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:34,839
functions. So we have some as a break

1084
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:34,839
property.

1085
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:51,319
properties

1086
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:57,000
of continuous function

1087
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:05,280
and I will prove a couple of these and

1088
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:07,280
but the proofs you see in just a second

1089
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:10,400
that the proof is like I mean the

1090
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:12,160
properties is is is and There's good

1091
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:15,599
reasons for that. They're very similar

1092
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:18,559
to the property we had for for limits of

1093
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:21,440
sequences and the proofs are are very

1094
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:24,079
similar to those proofs. So the first

1095
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:30,119
one is that if

1096
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:30,119
f and g are continuous

1097
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:38,839
then the sum of these two functions is

1098
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:38,839
also continuous.

1099
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:52,359
The next one is that if um

1100
01:04:48,799 --> 01:04:52,359
f is continuous

1101
01:04:55,520 --> 01:05:01,240
and and c is a constant

1102
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:06,240
then c * f is continuous.

1103
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:16,480
The third property is

1104
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:22,039
that again if

1105
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:22,039
uh f comma g are continuous

1106
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:31,119
then the product

1107
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:31,119
then the product f * d is continuous.

1108
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:42,680
The fourth property is that if

1109
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:42,680
f is continuous

1110
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:54,880
and and uh and f is never equal to zero

1111
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:59,119
then

1112
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:59,119
1 / f is continuous.

1113
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:06,799
And the fifth property that's a little

1114
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:08,640
bit different and we didn't have that

1115
01:06:06,799 --> 01:06:11,520
for sequences.

1116
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:16,400
The fifth property is that if you take a

1117
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:18,319
map f of take a function f.

1118
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:20,960
Let's think about it as a function from

1119
01:06:18,319 --> 01:06:26,000
R to R. And then you have another

1120
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:29,280
function G from R to R.

1121
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:32,160
And now you could look at where you take

1122
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:34,400
first. You could look at the

1123
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:38,079
composition. So you could look at the

1124
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:43,520
function H of X which is where you first

1125
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:48,880
apply F of X F to X and then you apply G

1126
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:51,440
to it. Right? So if both f so if this

1127
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:56,599
here

1128
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:56,599
and the function g are continuous

1129
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:04,359
then the composition here is also

1130
01:07:01,359 --> 01:07:04,359
continuous.

1131
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:12,480
When you have a composition of function

1132
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:16,480
you always have to be careful that it

1133
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:19,599
makes sense. So to make sense means that

1134
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:22,880
the function g the one that the second

1135
01:07:19,599 --> 01:07:25,680
function that you apply is that the

1136
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:29,200
image of when you use the first function

1137
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:32,799
you have to make sure that what you get

1138
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:36,640
here is uh at some point where G is

1139
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:40,240
defined. Right? So I just for simplicity

1140
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:42,799
I just uh looked at maps into um

1141
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:44,640
functions into R where G also was

1142
01:07:42,799 --> 01:07:46,000
defined on all of our but of course it

1143
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:47,920
doesn't have to be defined but you just

1144
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:51,839
have to make sure

1145
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:54,160
that G is defined where F and X end up

1146
01:07:51,839 --> 01:07:56,799
right

1147
01:07:54,160 --> 01:08:00,160
okay I'll talk a little bit about you

1148
01:07:56,799 --> 01:08:02,240
know these uh how to prove these but

1149
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:06,960
it's very similar to what we did for

1150
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:09,119
sequences let me just apply apply it.

1151
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:12,440
So let me look at an example where I

1152
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:12,440
apply it.

1153
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:24,560
So suppose you take x2 + one. Suppose

1154
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:28,199
you take this function here. I'll take

1155
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:28,199
look at two examples.

1156
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:35,679
Suppose you take this function here.

1157
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:39,279
I claim that this here is continuous.

1158
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:41,440
I'm not going to go through the proof

1159
01:08:39,279 --> 01:08:44,159
because

1160
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:46,080
because we already actually so if this

1161
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:49,199
here prove at least some of these

1162
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:53,520
properties but once you have that then

1163
01:08:49,199 --> 01:08:57,120
you see that well you have that g of x

1164
01:08:53,520 --> 01:09:00,239
equal to x this here is continuous.

1165
01:08:57,120 --> 01:09:03,040
This is what we proved

1166
01:09:00,239 --> 01:09:04,960
just a little while ago. And if you take

1167
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:07,920
the function that is constant and in

1168
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:11,040
this case constant one, we already

1169
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:13,120
proved that that's continuous. Right?

1170
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:15,279
Now this means that if you take a

1171
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:17,759
continuous function

1172
01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:20,960
by by by whatever root three or

1173
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:24,239
something like that over there uh and

1174
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:29,359
you take the function where it's like

1175
01:09:24,239 --> 01:09:32,000
multiply by itself this function here

1176
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:36,120
right because g is continuous this

1177
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:36,120
function here is also continuous

1178
01:09:39,839 --> 01:09:45,679
and then once you have that you can add

1179
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:48,080
another. So you can look at G ^2

1180
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:50,319
plus H.

1181
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:52,000
This is you now have established this is

1182
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:53,759
continuous. This here is a constant

1183
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:56,159
function. So we already proven that this

1184
01:09:53,759 --> 01:10:00,679
is continuous. So the sum by rule one

1185
01:09:56,159 --> 01:10:00,679
over there this here is continuous.

1186
01:10:06,159 --> 01:10:10,960
Okay.

1187
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:14,239
So this means that so okay. So this show

1188
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:16,719
that this function here this quadratic

1189
01:10:14,239 --> 01:10:19,600
function is continuous. But in fact of

1190
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:24,000
course this argument gives you that any

1191
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:27,040
polomium any polomial is continuous

1192
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:28,640
right so this here proves that any

1193
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:30,719
polomium

1194
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:32,960
right so this the you know like the

1195
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:37,440
similar argument right so if you're

1196
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:39,120
using so if you're using one two and

1197
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:41,040
three

1198
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:45,120
then just starting at the constant

1199
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:49,360
function and the function x you can get

1200
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:51,520
to any polomium and and and using these

1201
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:55,440
operations and so it means that any

1202
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:59,080
polomial is continuous right so so you

1203
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:59,080
have the following theorem

1204
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:04,040
all polomials

1205
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:11,800
are continuous

1206
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:21,280
Okay. And in fact, so this is just using

1207
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:24,320
one, two, and three over here. If you

1208
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:28,480
now also bring in four

1209
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:31,480
then you have then so so this is this is

1210
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:31,480
proof,

1211
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:38,800
right? So it follows it uses the two

1212
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:42,880
examples that we gave and then

1213
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:46,920
in addition to that it follows from

1214
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:46,920
the algebraic rules

1215
01:11:51,199 --> 01:12:00,159
one through uh one through three.

1216
01:11:56,960 --> 01:12:02,560
If you bring in alt four, five is

1217
01:12:00,159 --> 01:12:06,640
something slightly different. But if you

1218
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:11,400
bring in four here, then you you get

1219
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:11,400
that what's called any rational function

1220
01:12:12,239 --> 01:12:19,000
uh any

1221
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:19,000
all rational function

1222
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:30,520
are continuous. So what is a a rational

1223
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:30,520
function?

1224
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:38,040
A rational function is just where you're

1225
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:38,040
taking a polomial

1226
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:41,760
and then you're dividing by another

1227
01:12:40,239 --> 01:12:44,239
polinomial.

1228
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:47,440
Right? So we know that any polomial is

1229
01:12:44,239 --> 01:12:49,920
continuous. If you take another polomium

1230
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:53,760
and let's look at the that other

1231
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:56,640
polinomial away from the roots away from

1232
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:59,840
where it is zero away from it where it's

1233
01:12:56,640 --> 01:13:01,440
zero this is I mean it's of course even

1234
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:04,719
continuous where it's zero but you can't

1235
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:09,199
divide by it right so away from it this

1236
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:13,280
function here is not zero and it's

1237
01:13:09,199 --> 01:13:16,239
continuous this is continuous rule four

1238
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:16,239
so this is proved

1239
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:23,080
Uh the theorem above

1240
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:30,679
plus

1241
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:30,679
rule four,

1242
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:34,679
right? Yeah.

1243
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:39,719
>> Yeah.

1244
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:39,719
>> Yeah.

1245
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:44,719
>> Yeah. In that case, exactly. In that

1246
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:46,880
case, I chose delta to be simply

1247
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:48,080
epsilon. Yeah. Yeah.

1248
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:49,280
>> Anything with that first?

1249
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:51,760
>> That's not a problem, right? But it's

1250
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:54,480
just like if you give me an epsilon,

1251
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:56,800
then I have to pick a a delta. And

1252
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:58,320
typically the delta will depend on

1253
01:13:56,800 --> 01:14:01,280
epsilon.

1254
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:03,120
Typically, it also depends on x. Let me

1255
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:06,320
give you an example of the last. I don't

1256
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:08,560
think I I I might not get to to proving

1257
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:10,080
this, but that's fine. I mean they

1258
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:12,560
actually the proof I'm not even sure I

1259
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:14,640
would go through it but the proof is if

1260
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:18,000
maybe maybe if I have a minutes I will

1261
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:22,320
talk about one of them.

1262
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:25,040
So let me give you an example also where

1263
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:27,600
so typically

1264
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:29,280
typically it's it's highly unusual in

1265
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:31,760
the first example with a constant

1266
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:34,960
function that it doesn't really matter

1267
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:37,760
you could pick delta anything. Okay. Now

1268
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:42,719
suppose you're looking at the function f

1269
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:44,880
ofx = 1 /x. This is a rational function

1270
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:47,600
because it's a polomial. In that case

1271
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:49,840
the polomial in the denominator is the

1272
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:53,199
constant function one and then the

1273
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:54,880
denominator is is is x. If you're

1274
01:14:53,199 --> 01:14:57,520
looking at this function let's just look

1275
01:14:54,880 --> 01:15:01,679
at this function where it's pos strictly

1276
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:05,199
positive. Right? And then you see now

1277
01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:08,400
the graphs looks basically like this.

1278
01:15:05,199 --> 01:15:10,080
So in particular if you go close to zero

1279
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:13,840
it's not defined as zero but if you go

1280
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:18,159
close to zero then the image varies a

1281
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:21,360
lot right. So if you take some fixed

1282
01:15:18,159 --> 01:15:23,920
thing here suppose you take suppose you

1283
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:28,400
take suppose you take you want to prove

1284
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:30,880
that it's continuous at some extreme.

1285
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:34,000
So this means that you have to pick some

1286
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:37,840
delta. So given an epsilon you have to

1287
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:40,640
pick a delta. So that if you are in this

1288
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:43,679
little interval then image lie in that

1289
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:46,880
little interval. But you see that as x0

1290
01:15:43,679 --> 01:15:50,080
becomes very close to zero then in any

1291
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:54,239
small interval the function varies a

1292
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:57,600
lot. So this means that that if if you

1293
01:15:54,239 --> 01:16:00,960
take some fixed epsilon

1294
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:03,679
then you expect that if the x0 was close

1295
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:06,480
to zero then the delta had to be really

1296
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:11,280
really really small right for this to

1297
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:14,000
work right so typically delta depends

1298
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:16,800
not just on epsilon which it's I mean

1299
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:19,040
it's highly unusual it doesn't it also

1300
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:22,480
depends on x and in fact if it doesn't

1301
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:23,920
depend on x or extra then it has a

1302
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:26,400
particular name. We'll get to that

1303
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:29,600
later. It's called uniform continuity.

1304
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:32,480
Uniform continuity have some nice extra

1305
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:35,520
properties

1306
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:38,000
and and and and you will see later on

1307
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:42,480
that there's a good reason why the

1308
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:44,159
domain here was did not include zero. If

1309
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:46,800
somehow this is would have been a

1310
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:49,520
continuous function defined on an

1311
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:51,199
interval that included the end point

1312
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:54,159
then actually it would automatically be

1313
01:16:51,199 --> 01:16:57,600
uniform continuous. So so it was the

1314
01:16:54,159 --> 01:17:02,320
good reason this example here it didn't

1315
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:04,640
include the the the point zero. Okay.

1316
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:08,320
Now let me just so I have like three

1317
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:10,719
minutes left. Let me just talk about

1318
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:14,000
one particular of these like the first

1319
01:17:10,719 --> 01:17:16,800
one and the second one super easy and

1320
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:18,800
the third one is also easy but and it

1321
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:20,640
uses exactly the same trick that we

1322
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:23,120
looked at before. So let me just talk

1323
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:25,520
about that for a minute just because

1324
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:27,760
it's it's it's a little bit more

1325
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:29,840
interesting than one and two is is

1326
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:31,440
barely interesting. So suppose I'm

1327
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:34,440
looking at the product of these two

1328
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:34,440
functions

1329
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:39,760
and you know so remember that you give

1330
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:42,239
me an epsilon I had to find a delta so I

1331
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:44,560
have to find a delta so that this

1332
01:17:42,239 --> 01:17:46,719
difference here

1333
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:50,080
is smaller

1334
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:54,480
I want to find a delta so that if x

1335
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:56,480
minus x0 is smaller if it's smaller than

1336
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:58,400
delta then this difference here is

1337
01:17:56,480 --> 01:18:01,360
smaller than epsilon right that's what

1338
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:04,320
I'm supposed to do

1339
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:08,239
just knowing that f and g are continuous

1340
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:10,640
right and so I do so this just like when

1341
01:18:08,239 --> 01:18:13,760
we had this for sequences

1342
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:16,800
the similar thing for sequences it's too

1343
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:19,120
much it's too complicated if you just

1344
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:22,640
look at like this. So what you do is

1345
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:25,920
that you take f ofx times g of x. You

1346
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:27,920
insert something and so you insert. It

1347
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:31,760
doesn't really matter which way you do

1348
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:34,800
it, but this is like halfway between

1349
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:37,600
this and that where you take one point

1350
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:39,280
to be x0 the other two x. Of course you

1351
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:41,760
didn't have that. So you have to add it

1352
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:43,679
again.

1353
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:46,080
But now the thing is that what you've

1354
01:18:43,679 --> 01:18:49,719
done here is you sort of have split the

1355
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:49,719
difference if you will.

1356
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:56,719
And so now when you want to estimate

1357
01:18:53,360 --> 01:19:02,080
this you estimate this thing here first.

1358
01:18:56,719 --> 01:19:05,199
So this is g of x * f ofx

1359
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:09,199
- f of x0

1360
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:11,440
and you take the absolute value of this

1361
01:19:09,199 --> 01:19:15,800
plus and then this here here you can

1362
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:15,800
factor out f of x0

1363
01:19:18,239 --> 01:19:24,400
uh g of x minus g of x0.

1364
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:26,960
And now you see now you can sort of do

1365
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:29,840
like we did before. This here is now

1366
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:34,239
fixed. So you just you can you can also

1367
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:36,800
take the absolute value sign like that.

1368
01:19:34,239 --> 01:19:38,400
And now this here is like just x here is

1369
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:40,159
fixed. So this is just some fixed

1370
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:43,040
number. So this means that this thing

1371
01:19:40,159 --> 01:19:44,960
here has to be maybe even smaller

1372
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:47,520
depending on what this constant is. But

1373
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:49,840
that's easy to achieve with some delta.

1374
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:52,400
Right? Here it's a little bit more

1375
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:55,760
complicated because this one here is not

1376
01:19:52,400 --> 01:20:00,080
fixed. Right? But you have to then say

1377
01:19:55,760 --> 01:20:02,880
that once you are close to x0 then this

1378
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:05,520
here there's a bound for this. You see

1379
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:07,520
it's sort of like what we did before. So

1380
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:09,360
we are out of time so I just leave it

1381
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:11,440
there.

1382
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:13,440
So next time we'll talk more about this

1383
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:15,600
with exponential function. Yeah. So a

1384
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:18,320
rational function said to be continuous

1385
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:20,000
or do we not call it continuous? No, a

1386
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:24,000
rational function any rational function

1387
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:27,360
is continuous. It's defined

1388
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:29,840
at points where the where the polinomial

1389
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:32,960
in the denominator

1390
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:36,080
away from the roots of the of the

1391
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:37,440
polomial in the denominator.

1392
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:39,550
>> It's continuous. What

1393
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:40,719
>> are they said to be continu

1394
01:20:39,550 --> 01:20:42,560
[Music]

1395
01:20:40,719 --> 01:20:45,120
one what yeah I mean any rational

1396
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:47,840
function is continuous. It's just not

1397
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:51,360
defined at the roots.

1398
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:54,000
Okay. Now for some polomium you could

1399
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:58,560
some rational functions if you were sort

1400
01:20:54,000 --> 01:21:02,320
of silly and you wrote a if you wrote

1401
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:04,480
this thing here right this is a polomial

1402
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:07,360
that's a polomial this one have a root

1403
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:09,520
as zero but really this function here

1404
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:12,400
you would probably think about as being

1405
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:15,920
the constant function one right so it's

1406
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:18,480
still right but it's not a pure it's

1407
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:20,080
it's continuous

1408
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:22,239
away from the root. It doesn't say

1409
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:24,800
whether it's continuous at the root.

1410
01:21:22,239 --> 01:21:27,120
It's just not defined at the root of the

1411
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:30,120
denominator.

1412
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:30,120
>> Yep.

1413
01:21:32,239 --> 01:21:35,920
>> Yeah, that's right. That's right. So

1414
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:37,920
that's right. So if you have a polomial

1415
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:40,560
in the denominator, right, there's

1416
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:43,040
there's like finite many points where

1417
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:45,920
where where you have roots and at those

1418
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:48,480
point it's appro defined. You might be

1419
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:50,640
able to extend it in a continuous way to

1420
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:54,440
those points, but typically it's not

1421
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:54,440
defined in those points.
