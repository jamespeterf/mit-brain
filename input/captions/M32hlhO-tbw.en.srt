Amber I was the slony that uh brought us

22
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,520
out here to Massachusetts uh my parents

23
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,239
are immigrants from Peru I was born and

24
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,360
raised in California and prior to

25
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:53,960
graduate school I spent about five and a

26
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,920
half years in the social sector working

27
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,280
for a Statewide foundation in California

28
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,960
called the Latino Community Foundation

29
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,879
where I manage our Latino giving service

30
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,800
CC Network that's actually where Chris

31
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:05,479
and I met Chris was extremely involved

32
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:11,439
in volunteering with our organization

33
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:13,119
and we met um that way I around in 2020

34
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,200
was when I really got the itch to go

35
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,400
back to graduate school um I was really

36
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,479
looking

37
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:22,680
for an opportunity to go to really I

38
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,439
guess level up my professional toolkit

39
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,560
and provide and build a more data driven

40
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:28,360
approach to the work that I was doing um

41
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,720
and that's what ultimately brought me to

42
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:33,680
MIT for my MBA

43
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,759
and as TR mentioned um I'm actually also

44
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,600
the one that did the Dual degree program

45
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,840
so in my first semester at Sloan I

46
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,799
applied to the Dual degree program and I

47
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,759
did my MPA my masters in public

48
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:45,920
administration at the Harvard Kennedy

49
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:50,600

00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:02,439
folks that are interested um but yeah I

55
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,200

president one of the class presidents of

57
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,159

68
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:38,519

completing those crazy program so we can

77
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,159
talk a little bit about that um and then

78
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:01,480
a little bit about me I'm a product

79
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:03,640
manager at Google um so I was able to

80
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,400
move to the to the Boston office and

81
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,080
navigate the career transitions that

82
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,760
came with the location transfer and

83
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,400
everything else um but yeah looking

84
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,879
forward to the conversation tonight

85
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,560
awesome awesome so it looks like our

86
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,159
other panelists are not in the chat but

87
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:19,400
one thing we do well here at Sloan is

88
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:20,920
Pivot um so we can definitely have more

89
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,080
conversations so I can butt in as a

90
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,080
moderator and be able to kind of share

91
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,879
my experience as somebody on this staff

92
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,959
side that came here with a significant

93
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:30,080
other as well uh having a child within

94
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:32,519
the last year um so I do want to kick us

95
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,840
off with our first question um so uh

96
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:36,480
amber and Chris can you just kind of

97
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,280
talk about that uh thought process of

98
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,799
like ultimately going back to school and

99
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:44,640
what attracted you to Sloan's NBA

100
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:46,760
program yeah so I think for me I touched

101
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,480
on this a little bit in my in my intro

102
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:54,319
um I was hoping to I my background was

103
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:56,560
really in project management um

104
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,120
relationship part uh stakeholder

105
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,159
Partnerships and all of that and and

106
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,840
storytelling and what I kind of was

107
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,040
feeling at the end of my professional

108
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,720
experience with the foundation that I

109
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,079
was at was that I really wanted to bring

110
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:10,519
in um that more data different appro

111
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:13,319
data driven approach to my work and so

112
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:15,360
that's why the MIT Sloan MBA became very

113
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:17,160
attractive to me Char you can correct me

114
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,079
if I'm wrong but I believe our MBA is a

115
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,720
technical MBA um given the course

116
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:22,680
requirements that we have to take and I

117
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,479
think and that for me on one hand was

118
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,880
extremely scary because it was very

119
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,479
different from anything I had ever done

120
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,400
um but on the other hand that's exactly

121
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,520
the challenge that I wanted

122
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,360
uh on on a personal note you know having

123
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:37,479
been born and raised in California I did

124
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:40,759
travel a lot but um had never lived in

125
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:43,639
the east coast and so around the time

126
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:45,560
that I was applying for programs um

127
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:48,120
Chris and I get engaged were more

128
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,360
seriously thinking about our future um

129
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,840
and as we're planning out the next

130
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,960
couple of years in life I'm like this is

131
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,919
probably going to be the only time we

132
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:57,479
can live farther away from where our

133
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:58,840
families are and so that's that was

134
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:00,280
something else that attracted me to this

135
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,840
area and

136
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,360
I was interested in the Dual degree

137
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,960
program with with the Harvard Kennedy

138
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,680
School given my my previous professional

139
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,800
background and so the opportunity to do

140
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,320
that at these two amazing institutions

141
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,280
um for me was really attractive and

142
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,720
during my admit weekend I remember when

143
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,759
I was deciding across different programs

144
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,360
um I asked my M like the person who was

145
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:23,759
my facilitator the student I was like

146
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:25,720
okay so really like culture is important

147
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:29,479
to me like What's the culture like at

148
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,800
Sloan and he said you know well I think

149
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:33,280
that admissions team just does a really

150
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,919
good job of weeding out any and

151
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,639
I was like haha that's so funny um but

152
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:40,160
honestly being here on the campus I

153
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,720
think one of the things that I loved

154
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,120
about being at Sloan is like you have

155
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:47,199
such amazing individuals that have done

156
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,039
ridiculous things in their career um

157
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,039
really impressive things but folks that

158
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,840
you would meet are are genuinely really

159
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:57,440
humble um and everybody we have a saying

160
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:59,960
at Salone sonon is helping sonon and uh

161
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,479
that's something that you feel across

162
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:05,120
like from adamant weekend to your first

163
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:07,199
day on campus uh you genuinely feel

164
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,639
everybody's intent to support one

165
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,160
another uh and that for me is was really

166
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:13,240
important especially going back to

167
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,840
graduate school after being uh working

168
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,160
for so

169
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,639
long thank you for sharing that so Chris

170
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,440
I want to pass it over to you in terms

171
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,319
of like the significant other experience

172
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:24,440
so could you kind of shed some light on

173
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,520
like how does stone ensure that partners

174
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,479
and families from diverse backgrounds uh

175
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,160
feel included and supported as their

176
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:33,960
significant other is going through the

177
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:37,560
program uh I mean I can honestly say

178
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:40,319
like it's it's extremely welcoming um

179
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:43,120
even even more than than just any

180
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,520
expectations uh I think early on uh

181
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,680
after you know even through the whole

182
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:49,000
admit process I think we were in

183
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,919
sessions with other you know couples and

184
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,759
partners that were coming so we got a

185
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:54,400
little bit to know you know in advance

186
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:57,440
what it would be like but while we were

187
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:00,199
on campus um extremely welcoming I had

188
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:04,120
my own kind of partner ID Like official

189
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:06,800
MIT ID I got access to the libraries

190
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:09,680
Partners the gym the the partners can

191
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,759
access all of the clubs which to me felt

192
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,720
like I was getting a mini MBA because

193
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,240
like you know they had like what is the

194
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:18,160
crypto club and MIT doing at this time

195
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,879
you know you want to be on the on the

196
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,800
Forefront of some of the the biggest

197
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:23,000
topics out there and um you know if

198
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,800
you're if you get to go to some of these

199
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,919
talks and some of these meetings that

200
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,479
was huge uh I also joined the inter

201
00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:32,479
mural Sports so I had uh you know join

202
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,759
the hockey team I have like my own Sloan

203
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:38,560
hockey jersey uh really proud of that

204
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:41,639
one um but super super inclusive uh I'm

205
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,520
a bit biased uh from what I like to say

206
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:46,319
is the other liberal arts school that's

207
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,280
that's down the way from MIT um you know

208
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:51,080
and having the the blessing of being of

209
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:53,639
her in both programs uh it's night and

210
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:56,120
day kind of the experience uh MIT

211
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:58,159
extremely open extremely collaborative

212
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:02,159
you the fact that I got access to

213
00:07:58,159 --> 00:08:04,000
anything was uh was a blessing um I

214
00:08:02,159 --> 00:08:06,520
think the other schools out there are

215
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,919
not as welcoming and and and to call out

216
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,960
names Harvard is is really not anywhere

217
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:13,120
near the level of openness that MIT is

218
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,159
so I was I was really uh

219
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,560
grateful thank you for sharing that uh

220
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:18,000
Kristen I have a quick followup that I

221
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,520
saw within the chat that I thought was

222
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,479
pretty relevant um you mentioned

223
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,759
something about uh your job um allowing

224
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:25,199
you to you know transfer locations um

225
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,520
somebody mentioned like they're a little

226
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,840
nervous about that because you so can

227
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,120
you kind of shed some light on like how

228
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,760
you navigated that process of you know

229
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:36,200
requesting that

230
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:38,240
transfer yeah um I I I can't say there's

231
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,440
uh really silver bullets there I think

232
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,320
there were a couple of Perfect Storm

233
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:45,600
items that that made it happen for us um

234
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,839
the fact that this was during covid

235
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,040
World was kind of shut down when she was

236
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:53,120
applying um you know everything went

237
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:55,560
remote you know for a hot second there

238
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,640
um I think that gave me an opening to be

239
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:00,399
able to move uh easily um I will say I

240
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,880
started conversation really early with

241
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:05,079
my manager um you know and I imagine

242
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,399
everyone's going through the application

243
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:09,560
process if everyone could pick M I'm

244
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:10,839
sure they would uh but you know at a

245
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,399
certain time we didn't know where we

246
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:14,800
could end up and so I was talking to my

247
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,079
manager we could end up in Boston we

248
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,279
could end up in you know any of these

249
00:09:16,079 --> 00:09:21,160
cities in the US um I just tried to to

250
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,760
to get it out there early that I was

251
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,079
planning on moving I was planning on

252
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:28,000
kind of following Amber Where She Went

253
00:09:25,079 --> 00:09:30,920
um and so I kept that kind of open

254
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,160
communication um Co helped out a little

255
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:36,000
bit in terms of making things a a bit

256
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:38,200
more fluid um but it did help that we

257
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,320
already had an office here I already had

258
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:42,839
some uh you know some of my cross

259
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,200
functional team stakeholders that were

260
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:47,880
in this office uh and I was able to make

261
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,320
that happen so um early communication

262
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:52,120
was was really big on that um a little

263
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,440
bit of opportunity in terms of what

264
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:56,519
other teams I was working with uh but I

265
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,640
was also prepared to to kind of make a

266
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:00,920
really big job switch within the company

267
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,959
so I was also looking at some roles uh

268
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:05,880
as it came down to to to shorter and

269
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:09,279
shorter uh School lists um to to make it

270
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:11,120
happen so glad Boston made it happen uh

271
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,120
but I I was prepared for a little bit

272
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,959
tougher conversations as well appreciate

273
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,519
that appreciate that so am I want to

274
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,920
pass it back over to you as it pertains

275
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:20,760
like the the curriculum of Sloan and the

276
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,200
curriculum of HKS kind of being able to

277
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,839
balance that but also being a

278
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,720
significant other can you get to talk

279
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,720
about the the core semester and like

280
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,600
that transition period for you as you're

281
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,240
transitioning back into school but

282
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,959
having a a significant other there with

283
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,839
you and like you know navigating that

284
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,279
process and maybe how you leaned on

285
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:39,200
Chris for support during that particular

286
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:40,160
time maybe outside of your cohort yeah

287
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,360
it was

288
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:45,440
rough I think um I really struggled my

289
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,839
first month and and and just learning

290
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,200
how to be a student again uh and again

291
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,600
coming from the social sector the

292
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,760
curriculum for me was completely

293
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:55,320
different because I just hadn't been

294
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:57,560
exposed to a lot of what for some people

295
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,560
were basic terms um it was like learning

296
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:03,120
a new a new language and then learning

297
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:04,360
the curriculum alongside that for me um

298
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,880
and but that's where I'm saying that

299
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,720
salon's helping salon's part was so

300
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,880
critical to my support I was very

301
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,240
transparent with my core team so that

302
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:13,680
group of like seven people that I was

303
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:16,320
paired up with about my initial

304
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,480
insecurities um and also my strengths

305
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,880
and I was like hey y'all this is what

306
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,440
I'm going to be really good at for our

307
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,519
team and this is what I'm definitely

308
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,240
really nervous about and I might

309
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,600
struggle with and I can tell you in in

310
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,120
the classes that I was more nervous

311
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,680
about like my court team members that

312
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,320
like they had professionally done like

313
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,480
statistics and data modeling they were

314
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,680
like oh here just sit next to me and

315
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,680
I'll explain everything to you while

316
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,800
we're while we're in class um or they

317
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,160
would sit after with all of us and they

318
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,320
would explain the model and what how

319
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,360
they built that and why it worked and so

320
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:45,760
that was extremely supportive in terms

321
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,959
of getting me the support that I needed

322
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:51,880
um within within that core that core

323
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:53,720
semester um as a core team we actually

324
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:56,839
we didn't do it super often we did it

325
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:59,240
twice I think where we met um the out of

326
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:01,800
the seven of us I think four had part

327
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,040
partners and three did not and so we

328
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,519
would have like these big dinners where

329
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,240
we would all come together and meet and

330
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:08,800
chat so that our partners felt like they

331
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,720
were a part of that also um and then on

332
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,639
a personal note I think once I did get

333
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,440
into my MBA curriculum and I into my NBA

334
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:18,920
program I knew that I was going to have

335
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,560
a very busy semester um in July before I

336
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:23,399
started I actually booked a trip for

337
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,079
Chris and I in Upstate New York like a

338
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:27,079
surprise a surprise trip I just put it

339
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:29,399
on our calendar like surprise trip it

340
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:32,160
was like the weekend of October 15th um

341
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:33,639
of my first year and I did that because

342
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,160
I said okay at that point I would have

343
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:37,399
been in school for two months and so I

344
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,560
want to make sure that I'm committing

345
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:39,880
like I have no idea what it's going to

346
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,240
be like Chris kept joking like you're

347
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,199
gonna ignore me and you're gonna you're

348
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:46,560
GNA be busy all the time with all your f

349
00:12:43,199 --> 00:12:48,120
with all your new friends um but you

350
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,079
know I think for me it was also

351
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,639
important to try and create that that

352
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:54,079
one-on-one time with with each other to

353
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:56,040
make sure that we were we were involved

354
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:59,279
um but like Chris mentioned earlier I

355
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:01,399
think that the sloy community is so uh

356
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:04,760
um committed to just connect with one

357
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:07,399
another that they were very welcoming to

358
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:09,600
to him for most of the events that we

359
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:11,079
had that's great I know that that

360
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,720
balance is important as you're going

361
00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:14,839
into a program making sure that you have

362
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,240
enough time for your your m home life

363
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:18,320
but also within the school life and kind

364
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,240
of balancing the social life here U one

365
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,680
thing that I share with um uh

366
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,639
prospective students that are you know

367
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,880
thinking about you know going to

368
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,680
business school may have a significant

369
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:28,040
other it's almost like a cheat code

370
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,120
going back to school with a another

371
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,839
person because you can explore together

372
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,519
um so I definitely like that aspect of

373
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,000
You Know Myself coming here with

374
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,880
somebody else and being able to kind of

375
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,040
explore the restaurants in the area or

376
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,480
being able to just kind of go to the

377
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,519
sporting events or being able to kind of

378
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,839
interact with other you know couples in

379
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,440
the area so I think that's pretty great

380
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:45,519
that people are considering it but just

381
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,279
know that there's a community here

382
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,519
that's pretty large for significant

383
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:51,600
others um and kind of tying into that

384
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,600
like the social life um so outside of

385
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,079
the class like you know was that hard to

386
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,920
manage like the partner in family life

387
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,399
with academics and network and I know

388
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,199
you just kind of touched on it you said

389
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:02,639
you know having a surprise trip but were

390
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,560
there other examples that you can

391
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,920
particularly highlight that you know

392
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,440
being the Senate co-president that

393
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,000
probably was you know a lot of time on

394
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,680
your hands to kind of balance that but

395
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,639
also being a a partner like like how was

396
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,519
the social life aspect uh for you and

397
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:18,279
Chris while you were in the

398
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:20,480
program yeah let me start touch I'll

399
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:25,120
touch on the the Salone presidency

400
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:27,440
because that was a lot um so I think um

401
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:30,920
as as one does when you run for office

402
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,639
you have to discuss with your family

403
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:35,600
and so I actually did talk about it with

404
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:38,839
Chris um beforehand more so because I

405
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:42,480
was torn between two possible

406
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:44,800
positions um but I think for me it was

407
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,920
important for me to to chat with Chris

408
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,480
about

409
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,800
like um what this opportunity could mean

410
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,120
for me what it would bring knowing that

411
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,759
it would take time away not just from

412
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:55,360
him but also from the other commitments

413
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:57,959
that I had made for myself during my

414
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,240
graduate degree program um so I think

415
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:02,240
that was that was was really critical I

416
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,360
think also

417
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:07,199
um but it also gave way for for new

418
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,320
opportunities in terms of like just new

419
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,600
involvements new new access to different

420
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,440
to just different

421
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:15,440
opportunities uh different kinds of

422
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:18,240
events and that for me was was equally

423
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:21,720
as important I I always for me like my

424
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,759
SL Sloan president experience was like

425
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:26,079
having a mini internship of like

426
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:29,000
executive Management in a really awesome

427
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:31,720
awesome way um and I got to work really

428
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,120
closely with my with my co-president who

429
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,680
had a very different professional

430
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,040
background than I did and approached

431
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,959
problems very differently than I did

432
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:44,199
which which also was helpful um so yeah

433
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:47,360
anything you want to add yeah I mean I

434
00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:50,720
think honestly the the so experience for

435
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:53,240
me was was purely social I think like in

436
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,639
many ways I I got to join uh a lot of

437
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:57,079
really interesting clubs but it's not

438
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,680
like I could leave work at 1M for a lot

439
00:15:57,079 --> 00:16:00,399
of the interesting conversations because

440
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:03,279
they usually happen like during school

441
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:06,000
hours um that said you know like I

442
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:07,800
joined the Hispanic Business Club um a

443
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,360
lot of that was you know networking

444
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:14,319
social and connecting um I would say the

445
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:17,440
social calendar uh for an MBA program

446
00:16:14,319 --> 00:16:19,720
not only M but definitely MIT it is

447
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,680
packed uh if there are social things you

448
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:24,720
want to do it is constant it is every

449
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:27,360
day you can you can go to as many things

450
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,920
as you want um and so I think from that

451
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,360
perspective for us it was really a pict

452
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:33,040
pick or choose uh you know for her it

453
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,120
was like oh we can go to this talk this

454
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:38,079
talk uh you know this happy hour uh this

455
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:41,680
company's coming in and and you know

456
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:44,680
hosting so and so um you know and so for

457
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:46,279
me personally I I mean we were kind of

458
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:49,040
strong enough I was like if you want to

459
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:50,600
go go ahead and vice versa and vice

460
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,240
versa like Chris went to a lot of things

461
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,800
that I didn't I went to that she didn't

462
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,440
go to I think a big part of it is

463
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,399
literally we did not say yes to

464
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,959
everything yeah so it that that's what I

465
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,800
was going to say was like at a certain

466
00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:03,959
point I was like I'm I'm tapped Out

467
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,640
actually you you can go ahead and go uh

468
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:08,640
this is a little bit easier preit of

469
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:11,319
course um but uh but yeah like I say

470
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,360
that to say like there is a lot going on

471
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:15,760
and um I think like you know the MIT

472
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:18,079
motto is like drinking from a fire hose

473
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,520
there is more than enough coming at you

474
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,959
whether it's academics or you know just

475
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:24,839
the social aspect of it um that you can

476
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,000
pick uh you know you can pick and choose

477
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:28,280
and I think you should probably start

478
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,919
setting boundaries yeah but I was really

479
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:32,679
big like for me coming to Boston I also

480
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:34,559
you know we came together it's not like

481
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:36,679
we came with a built-in friend group or

482
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:38,400
Social Circle yeah um so I do want to

483
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:41,080
turn back to like the core group that

484
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,440
first semester uh it was huge like we

485
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:45,960
had like a you know a small set of

486
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,919
people who she was in every class with

487
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:50,679
uh also had Partners um you know we had

488
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:52,880
those kind of dinners and so we had like

489
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:55,000
a a good little small social group that

490
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,960
expanded um and that kind of became my

491
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,960
social group so even as I was in a new

492
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:02,520
city um you you know I also had kind of

493
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:03,919
events to go to if I wanted to I

494
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:07,039
definitely started saying no more and

495
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:08,440
more but um but yeah there's a lot to it

496
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,880
and I think we just you know we had to

497
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,799
find our balance of what were the things

498
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,799
that we that interested us some yeah

499
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,960
like she said some of those things I

500
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:17,000
went to and she didn't even as a partner

501
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,640
so um like I said really really

502
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
welcoming for um for the partners even

503
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,720
in a way that I did not expect so yeah

504
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,360
and just quickly on the balance I think

505
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,880
the other thing too as a student is so

506
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,559
much of the time like even though you're

507
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,400
socializing a lot of these folks are

508
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,720
also balancing the same school work that

509
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,159
you are and so you all are there to kind

510
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,240
of back each other up and support each

511
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:39,000
other in the in between spaces and

512
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,559
there's a lot of like working on campus

513
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,799
that happens like getting together right

514
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:46,520
after class that provides space to to do

515
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:49,520
that work collaboratively and then also

516
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:51,360
um have more free time later awesome

517
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,760
awesome so I see some questions in the

518
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,960
chat it kind of you know focusing on on

519
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,600
those who are parents and I know we

520
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:00,520
mentioned earlier that you finished the

521
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,960
last was it last semester at HKS um and

522
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:04,440
you had just given birth yeah so I can

523
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,200
walk through that timeline a little bit

524
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:09,559
so I was I was pregnant my last semester

525
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,880
at Sloan so like my key semester as

526
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:13,600
president I was pregnant but I had an

527
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:15,000
announced and I graduated Sloan nobody

528
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:19,520
knew but I was pregnant and my son my

529
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:22,520
son walked with me um I gave birth in

530
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:26,720
November of

531
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:28,280
2023 so that was my La that was my um

532
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,919
ball semester of my last year at the

533
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:33,960
Harvard Kennedy School um so I gave

534
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:35,080
birth about two and a half weeks before

535
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,960
the end of the

536
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:39,880
semester um and then here in the

537
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,520
Cambridge area you don't have CL most

538
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:44,720
people don't have classes on during the

539
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:47,679

uh one of her Court team members uh uh

548
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:14,320
Bruce he uh they they specifically tried

549
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,720
to time their pregnancy around this

550
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,400
period uh and they knew that going into

551
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,000
fall semester they were like into going

552
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,919
into fall semester they already knew

553
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,280
that they were going to try to um you

554
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,000
know try to to to to start getting

555
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:27,919
pregnant so that the baby came during

556
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,360
that time and at that time we were

557
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,039
thinking about it we were like like you

558
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,799
know if your families and you guys are

559
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:35,640
trying to plan out uh plan out the baby

560
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:37,480
timelines like it's always tough when's

561
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,240
the right time you know what are the

562
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:41,039
right factors you know what should we

563
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,360
consider and that was a really big part

564
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,280
for us was like do we wait till after

565
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:46,960
she graduates do we wait till after she

566
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:49,679
graduates plus a year and you has like

567
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,600
cemented herself and work a bit um but I

568
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,039
do think you know we had the we had one

569
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,840
of her Court teammate somebody super

570
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:57,480
close who was like no no no they they

571
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:59,400
had a baby already during that timeline

572
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,400
and so we also got to to see a bit of

573
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,080
their experience and to be honest I

574
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,720
think it gave us a little bit more of a

575
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,960
confidence to be able to do it ourselves

576
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,880
so yeah that that being said in that

577
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,120
case the student was the father and not

578
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,440
the one who actually G like had to go

579
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:17,799
through the child birthing process yeah

580
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:20,679
um I do feel like for me it worked out

581
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:22,720
because um while I don't necessarily

582
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:25,640
think two months I was ready to bounce

583
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,880
back it was a slow enough transition for

584
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:31,000
me that I was able to manage the units

585
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:33,919
that I had left left with having a

586
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,080
newborn at home um we also had our moms

587
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,080
that were supporting us and so all of

588
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,240
that

589
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:42,360
was made all of that possible in a way

590
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,279
that was sustainable for me a lot of

591
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,760
help yeah a lot of help we had a lot of

592
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:47,320
help and then when people offered were

593
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:50,200
like yes thank you

594
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:51,400
please so that was also a big part of it

595
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,679
and when you all were going through that

596
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:55,200
that pregnancy Journey um did you all um

597
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,440
take advantage of any of the resources

598
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,039
that MIT had to offer as it pertains to

599
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,520
maybe like child birth class

600
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:04,240
or just like prep to get

601
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,919
ready I feel like my first trimester was

602
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:10,440
a blur because it was so busy with

603
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:12,880
wrapping up um and so we didn't do any

604
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:14,720
resources at Sloan I also again had not

605
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,600
sh that I was pregnant so I didn't even

606
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:21,159
look to see what resources there were um

607
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,799
but I will say this area is fantastic um

608
00:22:21,159 --> 00:22:25,240
it's a fantastic parent

609
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:27,720
Community um I did use some resources at

610
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:29,320
the Kennedy School which is where I was

611
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,080
like I had already you know I already

612
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:33,840
had the baby and so I used like the

613
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:35,960
nursing rooms um I used some of the

614
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,720
parent support systems that were there

615
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,240
but honestly the best system has

616
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:42,000
actually been it's called the

617
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:45,000
camberville um there a camberville

618
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,559
Facebook group and so there's a

619
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,559
camberville parents and a camberville

620
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:50,760
mom so it's Cambridge Somerville we live

621
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:54,039
in the Somerville area met for like all

622
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:55,840
basically the Boston area um and it's a

623
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:58,120
a group a Facebook group that you can

624
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,679
join based on your child's uh bir

625
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:02,480
there's a they have different birthing

626
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,919
ranges and you can ask any types of

627
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:07,919
questions we're actually about to find

628
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:09,720
our Nanny through that Avenue um I think

629
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,760
you also had a ton of friends who had

630
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,679
babies you had Bruce in them who had

631
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,520
babies oh I did so we as we asked a lot

632
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,640
of questions from current students who

633
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,360
already had children like one of my best

634
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,960
friends Stephanie has came with a

635
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,320
three-year-old and was pregnant her last

636
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,120
semester it wasn't abnormal to have a

637
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,480
baby and I think like that was that was

638
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,720
one of the bigger pieces that MIT

639
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,120
brought was like there were already

640
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,559
families around

641
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,960
there were groups um that organized

642
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:35,400
around parents there were like group

643
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:38,320
chats that organized around parents

644
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:40,000
organized events kids yeah like she has

645
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:43,600
a mom group specifically with other

646
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,760
slones you know a WhatsApp group um and

647
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,600
so I I think a really big part of it was

648
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:51,720
like we we had Community who were in it

649
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:53,320
together um yeah I I think we were too a

650
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:55,440
little too late for the MIT specific

651
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:57,919
resources but the community itself it

652
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:01,080
was there yeah I do want to add about

653
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:02,080
the um the the courses that MIT does

654
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,760
have to offer because I did take

655
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:07,159
advantage of them uh when me and my wife

656
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:09,279
were expecting so MIT does offer like um

657
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:11,600
like classes for new and expecting

658
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:13,400
parents um so we did like a six week

659
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,640
like prep course on like child birth

660
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,760
like the whole process of like

661
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:19,200
understanding what that's like so we had

662
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:20,679
a lot of MIT like students as well as

663
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,679
staff within the room we kind of going

664
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:24,520
through the process together and um that

665
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:26,080
was pretty cool to kind of like relieve

666
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:28,000
some of that anxiety of like okay what's

667
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,600
going to be like within child birth but

668
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,120
also that resource was great and it was

669
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,799
actually free for for us to do that so

670
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:36,480
um I definitely appreciated that and

671
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:38,320
also MIT did have like some virtual

672
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,679
classes to that you can attend if you

673
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,880
didn't want to be in person because of

674
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,559
where where you were within that

675
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,399
particular process so they did have some

676
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:46,200
virtual classes that pertained to like

677
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:48,200
breastfeeding and there was another

678
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,960
class that talks about um like there was

679
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:52,840
like four stages of like a fussy baby um

680
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,799
so I really like that um so that was

681
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:56,600
helpful in terms of like preparing and

682
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:58,840
then like you mentioned like trying to

683
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:01,120
time it um so my my my daughter was

684
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:03,440
actually born in December so right

685
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:05,720
before the beginning of the new year so

686
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,760
we were transitioning to like IP for

687
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,600
students so we didn't have much going on

688
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,279
as pertains to like student programming

689
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,919
so that was kind of Ideal for me to kind

690
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:15,360
of like have a month off and then U my

691
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:16,919
wife was actually able to kind of have

692
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,159
an extended period off with paternity

693
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:21,720
leave so Massachusetts um was you know

694
00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:23,799
phenomenal I really am grateful we chose

695
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,480
to move here because they are very

696
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:27,200
Progressive as it pertains to maternity

697
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:30,399
leave and you know making sure that

698
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,799
there's also a uh paternity for for for

699
00:25:30,399 --> 00:25:35,200
for those who are the non- birthing

700
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:38,640
parents as well um so in that particular

701
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:41,360
process for um I guess transitioning

702
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,960
with the baby um did you all know of any

703
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,840
resources like for on campus housing for

704
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,880
those who are coming in with with

705
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,840
children um or Those Who coming in with

706
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,279
significant other I know MIT does offer

707
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,039
housing but are you all familiar with

708
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:56,159
those particular

709
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:58,799
resources um well CHR was just saying my

710
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:01,159
my core team member Bruce he came with a

711
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:03,480
um one and a half-year-old and then they

712
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:05,679
had their child in January of our first

713
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:08,080
year and they lived in student campus

714
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,240
housing uh which uh so while we didn't

715
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,880
use it ourselves like I know that they

716
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,640
they used that they loved it because it

717
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:17,080
was close to a playground it was close

718
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:18,760
to campus um and that made it really

719
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:20,600
really easy for them but we don't know

720
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:22,760
much more beyond

721
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,240
that there was Community around that

722
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:26,320
also like cuz that's where most of the

723
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,919
families were and so I think that was

724
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,000
you know there was proximity in in the

725
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,799
family that we're we're going through

726
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,200
the similar things yeah but I will say

727
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:35,120
because I this question earlier because

728
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,399
somebody was worried about affordability

729
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,480
coming I think they were coming with two

730
00:26:36,399 --> 00:26:39,440
kids and two dogs um where we live right

731
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,480
now

732
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:44,559
Somerville um I would say there's a lot

733
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:49,360
more space here like we have a small

734
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:53,000
backyard um we have enough space for the

735
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:54,919
three of us um and I think in this area

736
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,039
it gets a little bit more affordable and

737
00:26:54,919 --> 00:26:58,520
a little bit bigger and so our friends

738
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:00,279
that wanted a little bit more space Bas

739
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:02,840
did come out to Somerville it's it's

740
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:05,559
about 20 to 25 minutes door too taking

741
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:08,679
the taking public transit it's even

742
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:10,919
faster if you're bold and ride your bike

743
00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:12,960
like does I'm a scaredy-cat so I don't

744
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:14,520
do that but he loves riding his bike and

745
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,520
he gets there quick

746
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:19,840
faster um and

747
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,120
so yeah there's there's definitely if

748
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,039
you're if you're willing to go a little

749
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:26,440
bit further it get it does get a little

750
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:28,679
bit more affordable out here in this

751
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:31,360
area yeah that contested that so with

752
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:33,279
the um the public transit so being able

753
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,640
to kind of be on that red line will be

754
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:37,720
uh beneficial because that gets you

755
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:39,880
right to MIT slan um so if you're within

756
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:41,919
the the Kindle square area Central area

757
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:43,480
or even close to the Harvard Square um

758
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,880
those are some good locations for people

759
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,720
that have that children or you know

760
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,919
looking to have a shorter commute versus

761
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,640
living in the city which could be a

762
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:52,000
little uh uh challenging uh given the

763
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,080
traffic situation here in the Boston

764
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,240
area so um try to find something within

765
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:59,960
I guess the the respective bubble of MIT

766
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:02,159
Sloan there actually housing resources

767
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:03,679
on our um our website that gives more

768
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,320
students like opportunities to kind of

769
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,159
research where areas are a little bit

770
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:09,320
popular some of Ville is pretty popular

771
00:28:07,159 --> 00:28:11,720
and then there's also some areas um in

772
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:13,519
the um Central Square area that are

773
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:18,039
pretty popular for students as well and

774
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:20,600
as Boston is a uh not a college town but

775
00:28:18,039 --> 00:28:22,279
there are several uh higher in higher

776
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:24,399
education institutions here a lot of

777
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:25,799
students are moving out annually so

778
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,919
there's a lot of spaces that open up for

779
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:29,279
students to be able to kind of fill

780
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:31,360
those particular voids so there's always

781
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:33,039
um something available just depends on

782
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,840
like how close you want to be or how far

783
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:36,840
you want to be in that particular uh

784
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:38,880
time frame um I know we're getting

785
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,760
closer to time but I do want to kind of

786
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:44,080
uh pivot our conversation to more of the

787
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:46,039
application process um so for those

788
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,840
students that are you know applying or

789
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:49,919
considering applying to to graduate

790
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,840
school in general um could you all Just

791
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:53,360
sh kind of share any advice for a

792
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,799
perspective applicant as they're going

793
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,799
through this

794
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:01,480
process uh ask as many people for

795
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:03,360
support um I'm the first one in my

796
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:05,240
friend group to get an MBA I'm a first

797
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:09,399
generation student um no one of my

798
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:12,240
family had gotten an MBA before um and

799
00:29:09,399 --> 00:29:14,080
for um first generation folks that are

800
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,559
from underrepresented backgrounds here

801
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,159
in the United States you might have

802
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:21,159
heard of programs like the Consortium

803
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:23,519
fellowship or um MLT I unfortunately was

804
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:26,320
not a part of either of those as it

805
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:29,480
relates to Sloan um but I know that

806
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:31,360
those can be very helpful I always say

807
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:33,799
Chris was my

808
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:37,559
MLT um because he actually helped

809
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:39,640
project manage my application process um

810
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:41,039
he and I'm it's where he's laughing but

811
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:44,120
it's true like he created the

812
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:45,840
spreadsheet for me um he helped me set

813
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:48,640
out deadlines for like when I needed to

814
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:50,960
submit my application to um one of my

815
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:55,080
former colleagues used to used to work

816
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:58,399
within um Stanford Admissions and so uh

817
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:59,760
she helped he helped me get stuff to all

818
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:03,559
the people that were willing to support

819
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:05,320
me in my process um on time and just do

820
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:07,399
everything on time and make sure that I

821
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:09,480
was getting everything uh out there as

822
00:30:07,399 --> 00:30:11,399
quickly as possible so I think for me

823
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:13,440
the biggest piece of advice is use use

824
00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:15,320
your support system as much as possible

825
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:18,080
ask folks for help I think especially

826
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:20,519
when it comes to your admissions essays

827
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:22,120
it be it can it can really easily start

828
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:23,440
to become really repetitive or you're

829
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:25,240
looking at it and you're like nothing is

830
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,720
wrong or like I don't know what else to

831
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:30,640
fix um so just asking pairs of fresh

832
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:33,840
eyes to look it over to support you I

833
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:36,320
think I think is extremely critical um

834
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,600
because it is this tunnel vision that

835
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:40,840
you kind of start getting into

836
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:43,000
especially as as the deadline start

837
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:45,240
approaching and I do want to add that

838
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,039
for those of you who are applying with

839
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:48,399
your significant other there are

840
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,600
different indicators on our application

841
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:51,519
as well where you can indicate their

842
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,480
name so their name in which round they

843
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:55,480
plan to apply as well um there was a

844
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,960
question in the chat about what what how

845
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,919
what percentage of students are coming

846
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,799
to our program with significant others

847
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:02,679
um that numbers around about 33% of our

848
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:04,360
students within our NBA program the

849
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:05,960
stone fellows program is a little higher

850
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:07,440
because those are student those are

851
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:09,320
individuals who have a little bit more

852
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,000
work years of work experience um and

853
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:12,200
they're you know uh about 15 years in

854
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,960
their career so they're coming in with

855
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:16,279
multiple children um so that number is

856
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,799
slightly higher so we do have a a strong

857
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:19,279
community of those who are applying with

858
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:22,480
their significant other as well as

859
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:23,799
coming in with um a significant other so

860
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,639
in the application like I mentioned you

861
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:27,360
can indicate if your significant other

862
00:31:25,639 --> 00:31:29,480
is applying as well as which round

863
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,440
they're applying we'll do our best to

864
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:33,320
review you both on an individual Merit

865
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,600
but we'll have that you know context of

866
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:36,320
that there's two people applying with

867
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,399
this within this particular household so

868
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,679
just kind of keep that in mind as you're

869
00:31:37,399 --> 00:31:41,880
going through the process um for some

870
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:45,360
odd reason most uh significant others

871
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:47,039
don't apply the same R um so um some may

872
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,440
apply round one and then the other one

873
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:50,799
gets the courage to apply maybe round

874
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:52,320
two or round three um so that does

875
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:54,039
happen so just let us know that on your

876
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,600
particular application so we are aware

877
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:58,440
that there is a significant other that

878
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,559
is applying also if you don't know at

879
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,919
the time that you submit your

880
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:02,559
application as your significant other is

881
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:04,320
applying and you ultimately get that

882
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:05,639
letter of admission you can let us know

883
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,720
at a later point if your significant

884
00:32:05,639 --> 00:32:09,320
other does choose to apply and we can

885
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:12,840
add that that note to your particular

886
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:12,840
record as well
