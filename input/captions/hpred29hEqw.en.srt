Fellows MBA application um and talk a

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,080
little bit about the program. We'll

colleagues who will be answering

19
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,040
questions throughout the webinar and

20
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,120
then we'll save time to answer some

21
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,559
questions live at the end. So again,

22
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,800
thank you all for joining us and we'll

23
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:47,440
get started.

24
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,760
Before we dive into the specifics of the

25
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,760
Sloan Fellows MBA program, I want to

26
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,840
talk a little bit about who we are as a

27
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,760
school. The MIT Sloan School of

28
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,520
Management's mission is to develop

29
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,760
principled, innovative leaders who

30
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,239
improve the world and to generate ideas

31
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,600
that advance management practice. This

32
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,280
mission is really at the heart of

33
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,040
everything that we do within the Sloan

34
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,119
School of Management. And if you think

35
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,640
about the first part of our mission,

36
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,640
developing principled innovative

37
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,799
leaders, that is really done through the

38
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,640
opportunities and experiences that are

39
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,600
available throughout our portfolio of

40
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,520
programs. We have a number of programs

41
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,000
offered for various points in your

42
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,799
career. Um, from early career programs

43
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,479
or traditional 2-year MBA. Um, but we're

44
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,200
here today to talk about our Sloan

45
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:33,520
Fellows MBA. This is a 12-month degree

46
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,079
that culminates in either an MBA or an

47
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,479
MS in management or an MS in management

48
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:41,680
of technology. The students who pursue

49
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:43,680
one of the master's programs um will

50
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,240
complete a thesis during their 12-month

51
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,560
time. For the Sloan Fellows MBA, we look

52
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,320
for a minimum of 10 years of experience,

53
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,360
but folks enter the program with about

54
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,720
14 to 15 years of experience on average.

55
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,280
And we'll talk a little bit about what

56
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,600
the class looks like.

57
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:04,159
Our class that just graduated this past

58
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:07,200
May um was 103 students. 37% of them

59
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,679
identified as women. 77% of the class

60
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,480
was international. Um within the

61
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:15,040
international folks, we had 42 countries

62
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,760
represented. again about 15 years of

63
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,000
experience when folks enter the program

64
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,920
and the class that just graduated about

65
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,520
half of them had a previous advanced

66
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:27,520
degree. You'll note here that um the top

67
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,599
three industries that folks entered the

68
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,000
program from were financial services,

69
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:35,000
technology, government, education, and

70
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
nonprofit.

71
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,280
So, as we think about the Sloan Fellows

72
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,360
program um and thinking about who is the

73
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,280
ideal candidate, a few things kind of

74
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,920
come to mind that we're looking for in

75
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,440
the application and admissions process.

76
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,280
Like I mentioned before, we're looking

77
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,519
for a minimum of 10 years of

78
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,319
postbachelor's degree full-time work

79
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,000
experience. And within that experience,

80
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,319
we're really looking for folks who have

81
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,280
both leadership and general management

82
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:03,040
experience. And so here at Sloan, our

83
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,440
the way we define general management

84
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,360
experience is beyond holding just a

85
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,239
specific title. It's folks that are

86
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,879
leading teams or leading functions have

87
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,720
responsibility for strategy and budget.

88
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,640
And these experiences are really

89
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,200
important for students to have prior to

90
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:22,159
the program to be able to contribute

91
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,159
effectively in the classroom. We're also

92
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,560
looking for candidates who are committed

93
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,800
to the global perspective. If you think

94
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,480
back to just the previous slide, 42

95
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,280
countries were represented in our class

96
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,040
that just graduated. Those experiences

97
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,799
that students bring in based on

98
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,360
geographic context that they've lived

99
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,680
and worked is really important and

100
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,599
helpful to enhance the experience and

101
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,040
learning for everyone in the classroom.

102
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,879
And so we're really looking for folks

103
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,720
who are excited to learn from other

104
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,440
perspectives and have their own

105
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,080
perspective challenged by the viewpoints

106
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,239
and experiences of others.

107
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,159
We're looking for candidates who push

108
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:01,120
the boundaries and challenge the status

109
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:04,080
quo, who advocate for their ideas in

110
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,920
their workplaces and create better

111
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,680
environments um within their

112
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,959
organizations.

113
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,959
The Sloan Fellows MBA program has um

114
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,120
some quantitative rigor to it. And so

115
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,040
we're really looking for folks that have

116
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,720
shown that they're comfortable taking on

117
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,479
that quantitative aspect of the program.

118
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,320
An important component that we're

119
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,320
looking for in the application process

120
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,720
is folks that are able to communicate

121
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,639
effectively um so that they can

122
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,560
contribute to the classroom but also go

123
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,560
on to be leaders in their field after

124
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,000
graduation.

125
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,919
And the last piece that we're looking

126
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,160
for is folks that are committed to

127
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,000
learning and self-improvement. We look

128
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,759
for this throughout the application if

129
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,400
you've continued to do this since your

130
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:49,759
undergraduate degree. And again,

131
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:52,240
thinking back to the previous slide, 47%

132
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,639
of our class that just graduated had a

133
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,040
previous advanced degree. And so folks

134
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,360
that are always looking to continue

135
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,720
learning and growing um is really

136
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:05,240
important and those are the folks that

137
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,240
we want in the Sloan Fellows program.

138
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,840
So I want to talk a little bit about our

139
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:12,320
our evaluation process and the timeline

140
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,160
for that for our Sloan Fellows program.

141
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,320
Um, we have two application deadlines,

142
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,400
which I'll talk about in a few slides.

143
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,880
Um, and we begin reviewing all

144
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,880
applications the day after the deadline.

145
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,400
All applications are reviewed by our

146
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,759
professionally trained admissions

147
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,080
committee. So, we do not have any

148
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,720
students or alumni involved in our

149
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,280
evaluation process. As we're reviewing

150
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,360
applications and again thinking back to

151
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,199
the previous slide, who is the ideal

152
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,320
candidate? We're looking for evidence of

153
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:42,479
all of those pieces in addition to um

154
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,039
past successes, your demonstrated

155
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:47,039
success and leadership skills. So, we'll

156
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,199
look at things like the impact of your

157
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:52,160
work that you've had um within the past

158
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,240
few years. We'll look at your previous

159
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,720
academics, if you provide any test

160
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,120
scores. Those can all demonstrate your

161
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,520
past successes. We'll also look for

162
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,759
evidence of leadership skills. So

163
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,919
finding ways to figure out how well you

164
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,160
work in teams, how do you solve

165
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:10,639
problems, how do you communicate and

166
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,880
adapt to change. So we'll be looking at

167
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,800
all of your application materials and if

168
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,280
invited to interview in an interview,

169
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,880
dig deeper into these questions to learn

170
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,479
a little bit more about your leadership

171
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,199
skills and what that could contribute to

172
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:25,520
the Sloan Fellows program.

173
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,280
And the last piece, um, we're evaluating

174
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,280
candidates for general management

175
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,199
experience. In a bit, we'll go through

176
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,639
every single application component and

177
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,039
talk about the general management

178
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,720
experience question in some more detail,

179
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,440
but that's definitely something we look

180
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,680
for throughout the evaluation process um

181
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:45,160
as it's a key pillar of this loan

182
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,160
fellow's program.

183
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,720
This is a highle overview of the

184
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,400
timeline for round one. So, we hope um

185
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,240
you all are getting started on your

186
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,400
applications now and applying for our

187
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,440
round one deadline, which is on o

188
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,520
Monday, October 20th. Following that,

189
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,240
immediately the next day, we'll begin

190
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,680
reviewing all applications. Um and we'll

191
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,800
take a couple weeks to review

192
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,319
applications. By November 4th, if you

193
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,160
submit your application for the round

194
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,560
one deadline, you'll have an update from

195
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,720
us, at which point you may be invited to

196
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,280
interview or receive another update on

197
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,199
your application. From there, we'll have

198
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,599
a few weeks of interviews starting on

199
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,680
November 10th with final decisions for

200
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:28,720
round one being released on December

201
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,479
12th. Um, we really strongly encourage

202
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,639
international applicants to apply by

203
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,160
this round one deadline to allow ample

204
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,800
time for the various onboarding

205
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,599
processes. And one thing I just want to

206
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,599
note, um, you are welcome to submit your

207
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,599
application on the day of the deadline.

208
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:46,080
We ask that if you are submitting all of

209
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,880
your final materials then um please have

210
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:51,120
some patience with the system. Um it can

211
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:53,039
sometimes slow down with many people

212
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,879
uploading their videos and uploading

213
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:58,680
their different application components

214
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,680
all at the same time.

215
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:05,360
So now we are going to kind of get into

216
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,800
the heart of today's um presentation and

217
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,440
talk about all of the application

218
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,199
components. I'll provide some tips on um

219
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,360
completing each of them and then we'll

220
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,599
get to any questions that you all have.

221
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,080
So the Sloan Fellow's MBA application

222
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:20,160
requires the following application

223
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:23,680
components. You'll provide a cover

224
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:26,240
letter, a resume, a video statement, a

225
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,080
second video question, one letter of

226
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,120
recommendation, two additional

227
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,519
references, an organizational chart,

228
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,919
transcripts, two professional short

229
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,399
answer questions. Test scores are

230
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:40,560
optional and then you'll respond to the

231
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,000
question, the world that shaped you.

232
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,599
Like I said before, we have two

233
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
application deadlines. The first one

234
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,760
being October 20th and then we have a

235
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,800
second application deadline in late

236
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,240
January on January 26th. We invite you

237
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,040
to apply when you feel that your

238
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,560
application is at its strongest.

239
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,240
So now let's talk about each of the

240
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,000
application components in some more

241
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,560
detail.

242
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,560
The first one is the cover letter. The

243
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,040
prompt for this is to submit a cover

244
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,760
letter seeking a place in the MIT Sloan

245
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:13,360
Sloan Fellows MBA program. You have 300

246
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:16,000
words or less to um submit in this cover

247
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,519
letter. A couple things as you are kind

248
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,839
of approaching your cover letter and

249
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,519
deciding what to put in it. Um this is

250
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,440
really the place for you to sell

251
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,399
yourself and talk a little bit about why

252
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,080
MIT Sloan. As you think about all of the

253
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,839
application components, it's really

254
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,240
helpful when you're able to provide

255
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,880
specific examples and details that

256
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,440
really showcase your past successes and

257
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,519
your leadership skills. And so the cover

258
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,080
letter is a great opportunity to provide

259
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,240
either a recent professional or personal

260
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,160
example that further demonstrates why

261
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,399
you're a good match for the Sloan

262
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,200
Fellows community, the Sloan Fellows

263
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,800
program, and the Sloan community. One

264
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,959
thing that's really important within the

265
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,880
cover letter is that you this is not the

266
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,880
place to be focusing on your future

267
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,480
goals. Within the Sloan Fellow's

268
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,399
application, there is a specific

269
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,080
question focused on your future goals.

270
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,120
So, please use that space in the

271
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:09,440
application to detail future goals.

272
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,279
There is limited real estate across all

273
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,040
of our application components. So, it's

274
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,200
really important that you are answering

275
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,959
the prompt or question that's being

276
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,519
posed for that specific application

277
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:22,160
component. Please keep the the future

278
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,880
goals in the future goals question and

279
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:27,360
leave this space to really sell yourself

280
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,440
and talk why talk about why you are a

281
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,920
good fit for the MIT Sloan Sloan Fellows

282
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,920
MBA program.

283
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:39,040
The next application component is your

284
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:41,600
resume. Um there are a few restrictions

285
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:44,399
for um the format of your resume. So,

286
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,279
we're asking for a two-page maximum,

287
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:50,160
Times New Roman font, size 10, um,

288
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:52,240
uploading either a Word or PDF document,

289
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,800
and we ask that you structure this in

290
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,800
reverse chronological order. Um, the

291
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,640
biggest tip for completing your resume

292
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,160
is to make sure you're following those

293
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,160
formatting requirements. There are just

294
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:05,839
a couple of them. Um, so please make

295
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:08,399
sure that you follow those as requested.

296
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,560
The next tip, um, making sure that it's

297
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,079
easy to read and easy to follow. We want

298
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,600
to be able to see your career

299
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:17,760
progression um and easily be able to

300
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:21,040
follow that. And so making sure that you

301
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,800
on your end have um provided a concise

302
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:26,320
story within your resume is really

303
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,920
helpful. The next piece um oftentimes

304
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,560
when you're writing a resume, you might

305
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,959
be including your job responsibilities.

306
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,959
We really want to see quantifiable

307
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:37,200
accomplishments in this resume rather

308
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:39,279
than your job responsibilities. So

309
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,360
really highlighting the successes and

310
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:43,440

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,160
various roles that you've had in your

312
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,480

title, again, resultsoriented bullets

320
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,000
that demonstrate your skill set that you

321
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:09,440

324
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:17,040
information outside of your professional

00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,720
and academic experiences. We really want

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,480

327
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,120
person. And so if you're actively

highlight that. Again, we're looking for

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,839
who you are as a whole person. And so

the professional and academic aspects

337
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,519
are definitely important, but feel free

338
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,519
to use a little space to provide

339
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:52,120
additional detail about what you do

340
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:52,120
outside of your professional work.

341
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,079
The next application component is a

342
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,600
video statement. The prompt for this is

343
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:02,560
for you to introduce yourself to your

344
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,480
future classmates. Um, this is really a

345
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,440
great place for you to share a little

346
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,200
bit about who you are personally. Um, we

347
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,399
encourage you to let your personality

348
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,800
shine. Um, this can help put a little

349
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,160
bit of color onto who you are and how

350
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,639
you might show up in the Sloan

351
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,880
classroom. And we really enjoy watching

352
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:23,360
these videos and getting to know you

353
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,120
more personally. So, feel free to share

354
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,839
whatever information you would like to

355
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,240
to introduce yourselves. Um, I will note

356
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,160
that these videos are not ever shown to

357
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,160
your future classmates, so it is just

358
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,240
for us on the admissions committee. Um,

359
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,800
but we're excited to get to know you

360
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,200
through this video statement. A couple

361
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,360
kind of tips as you're approaching the

362
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,279
video statement. Um, we're asking for

363
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,240
you to provide a 60-second video

364
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:50,320
statement so you have um kind of limited

365
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,560
time to share whatever details you would

366
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,079
like to. We encourage you to use your

367
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,680
best judgment and be aware of your

368
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:58,480
surroundings when you're recording your

369
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:01,760
video. Some folks might um record it

370
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:04,000
outdoors or in a space where they um

371
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,920
might be doing one of their hobbies or

372
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,560
um engaging in one of their personal

373
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,720
interests. Some folks might record it um

374
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:13,120
sitting at their computer. All of those

375
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:16,000
are fine. Um just make sure that we can

376
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,000
see and hear you clearly regardless of

377
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,480
where you're taking your video. And

378
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,639
again um show us your p personality. We

379
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,560
want to get to know the whole you. Um,

380
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:28,600
and so this is a great opportunity to

381
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,600
share a little bit more about that.

382
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:34,800
We have a second video question that

383
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,639
you'll also complete, and this is a

384
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,120
opportunity to respond to a randomly

385
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:41,760
generated open-ended prompt. A couple

386
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,839
things to note with video question two.

387
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,839
As you first open the application,

388
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,839
you'll notice that it's not immediately

389
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,600
available. um you'll have to complete

390
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,600
some components of the application

391
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:55,279
before you're able to view the video

392
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:57,600
question two um tab in the application.

393
00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:00,480
Once you are able to view it, a couple

394
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:03,839
things to note as well. Uh you will have

395
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,000
to test your video and your microphone

396
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,079
and you'll go through that series of

397
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,480
tests and have to click an additional

398
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:12,639
check box saying you're ready to go and

399
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,519
ready to record your answer. Um so

400
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,600
please use the test environment to feel

401
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,920
comfortable with the software where your

402
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,839
question will be prompted um where it

403
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,880
will show the time that you have to

404
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:27,519
record or if it's recording um and

405
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,199
really ensure that your video and

406
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,880
microphone are ready to go for the

407
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,720
recording. So please use the test

408
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,639
environment um so that you are

409
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,399
comfortable before you start recording

410
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,880
because you do only have the one chance

411
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,320
to record this video. Um the video that

412
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,399
is recorded is the one that will be

413
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,040
uploaded into your application. So you

414
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:47,519
do just have the one chance. When you

415
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,920
decide that you're ready to record your

416
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,440
um question, you'll go through the test

417
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,360
environment and click the check box

418
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,440
saying you're ready, at which point your

419
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,759
question will appear. And you'll have 10

420
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,800
seconds to prepare for this question and

421
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:02,959
60 seconds to record your response.

422
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,800
There is no advanced preparation that's

423
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:07,279
needed for these questions. They're all

424
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,839
about your experiences and so there are

425
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:12,320
no right or wrong answers. We're really

426
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:14,160
looking at these videos to assess how

427
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,240
you think on your feet and communicate

428
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,920
authentically. It's a really good

429
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,959
indicator of how you might show up in

430
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,720
the various Sloan classrooms. So really,

431
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:25,120
you can approach it like you would a

432
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,680
conversation or how you might be in the

433
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:30,240
mindset for an interview question. But

434
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:32,560
again, it's all about your experiences.

435
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,959
Um, an example of a question you might

436
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,800
see is to tell us about your proudest

437
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:40,480
accomplishment.

438
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:42,720
So, we hope you have fun um recording

439
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,240
these videos and sharing a little bit

440
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,279
more based on the question that you're

441
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,120
prompted with. Um, but again, there is

442
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:51,040
only the one chance to record this video

443
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:55,079
and the video that is recorded is what

444
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,079
will be in your application.

445
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,920
The next component is your

446
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:04,480
recommendation letter. We require one

447
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:07,039
letter of recommendation letter and just

448
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,480
one letter of recommendation. Um, as

449
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:11,679
you're thinking about who to ask to be

450
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:14,000
your recommener, we um recommend that

451
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,319
you give whoever you're asking at least

452
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,880
6 weeks in advance of the application

453
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,720
deadline so that they have ample time to

454
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,240
really write a robust letter that

455
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,120
answers the questions that we're asking

456
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,039
of them. Ideally, this is coming from a

457
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,720
manager or supervisor who can really

458
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:31,600
speak to the impact of your work and

459
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:34,400
again provide specific detailed examples

460
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:37,360
of your experiences.

461
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,360
One really important thing is that um we

462
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,200
ask that you do not write the letter for

463
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,200
your recommener. This should come from

464
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,679
their authentic voice based on their

465
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,840
experiences with you. And as you think

466
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,840
about who who can be the person to write

467
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,440
your letter of recommendation on the

468
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,840
right hand side of the screen, you'll

469
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,080
see the six questions that we're asking

470
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,240
a recommener to answer. So, we'll just

471
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,240
read through them quickly. We want to

472
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,000
know how long and in what capacity the

473
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,400
recommener has known you as the

474
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,840
applicant. We want to know how the

475
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:10,400
recommener sees the applicant stand out

476
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,000
from others in a similar capacity. We're

477
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,480
looking for a specific example of the

478
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,320
applicant's impact on a person, group,

479
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,240
or organization.

480
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:21,120
We're looking for an example of how the

481
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,840
applicant interacts with other people,

482
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,120
space to tell us anything else that they

483
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,840
think we should know about the

484
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:30,720
applicant, and then detailing a time

485
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,559
that they gave you constructive feedback

486
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,720
and what you did with the constructive

487
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:36,880
feedback. So really think critically

488
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,320
about who can answer these questions and

489
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:43,120
provide in-depth um responses to all of

490
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:46,799
them is really important and helps us in

491
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:48,880
the um admissions process.

492
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:52,000
First loan fellows oftent times you

493
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,760
might be leading um organizations and so

494
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,679
you you might be wondering who to ask to

495
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,080
be a recommener if you don't have any

496
00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:01,679
one that you're reporting to directly.

497
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:04,000
Um, sometimes folks might ask clients or

498
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:06,320
mentors that they work with closely if

499
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,160
they are leading their organizations.

500
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,880
But again, thinking critically about who

501
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:13,440
can provide these examples and details

502
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:16,000
to these questions is who you should ask

503
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,160
to be your recommener. Um, for folks

504
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,640
working in family businesses, please do

505
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:23,960
not have your recommener be a me a

506
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,960
family member.

507
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,640
In addition to the letter of

508
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,280
recommendation, you'll also provide two

509
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:34,240
additional references. And so these are

510
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,919
similar to a recommener um where they

511
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,440
should be able to speak about your

512
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,600
professional experiences and

513
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,679
professional aptitude. The questions

514
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,480
that we would ask a reference are very

515
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:46,000
similar to what we ask a recommener. Um

516
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,320
and one thing to note with the

517
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
additional references is that we may or

518
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,480
may not contact them during the

519
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,880
admissions process. If we are looking to

520
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,679
get additional data and information on

521
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:00,160
your candidacy, we will contact them to

522
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:02,559
schedule a time that works um for both

523
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,720
parties. And so, please make sure that

524
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:06,160
you have notified your references if

525
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,840
they will be included in your

526
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:13,200
application. And um oftent times we get

527
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:15,039
questions from applicants who have a

528
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,360
couple people they might want to write

529
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:19,760
letters of recommendation.

530
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,440
As you approach our application, again,

531
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,360
we just have one letter of

532
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,919
recommendation that is required and

533
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,360
allowed. And so, as you think about who

534
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,360
else can speak to your professional

535
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:32,799
aptitude, pick the person that can

536
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:34,880
really provide those specific examples

537
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:36,640
in a recommendation letter. And then

538
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,640
other folks that might still be able to

539
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,880
speak about your professional aptitude

540
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,880
can be listed as the two additional

541
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,880
references.

542
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,600
The next component of the application is

543
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:52,080
the organizational chart. And for our

544
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,159
Sloan Fellows application, I would say

545
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,559
this is really a great visual

546
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:58,400
representation of the general management

547
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:01,280
experience that's hopefully highlighted

548
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,679
throughout your entire application. We

549
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,679
really use this as a visual to

550
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:08,640
understand your role within your greater

551
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:10,400
organization. really defining where your

552
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,240
sphere of influence is and the

553
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:15,039
relationships that you work with in a

554
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:17,440
day-to-day basis. We want to know who

555
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:20,480
you're working with to influence their

556
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,960
decisions and who you're working um with

557
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:25,760
to kind of develop more professionally

558
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,760
and folks that may be reporting to you

559
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:30,559
as you complete your organizational

560
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,960
chart. Um if you're working for a large

561
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:35,760
organization, you may just include your

562
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,760
function. um some organizations if you

563
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,760
have 20 folks you'll be able to include

564
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:43,679
everyone on your organizational chart.

565
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:45,840
Um but really just using your um best

566
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:48,880
judgment to showcase all of those

567
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:51,360
relationships that you're able to um

568
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:54,000
feel free to uh highlight any indirect

569
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:56,320
reports as well in the organizational

570
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,559
chart. Those are helpful to see. We ask

571
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,320
that you circle yourself in red so that

572
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:03,840
it's very clear where you sit in the

573
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:05,360
organizational chart. And um one key

574
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,360
thing as you're completing the

575
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,520
application, all of the components

576
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,200
should align. So thinking back to the

577
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,919
resume, whatever you list as your

578
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,720
current employment should match what you

579
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,799
upload in the employment section of the

580
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,880
application and that should match what

581
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:23,280
your organizational chart is. It should

582
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:26,320
be from your current organization. Um,

583
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:28,320
so keeping that in mind and a couple

584
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,240
things as well within the organizational

585
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:33,360
chart, you might be able to highlight

586
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:36,159
your recommener or your references. And

587
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:38,880
so finding an easy way um to point that

588
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:41,520
out for us is really helpful. In some

589
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,679
cases, you may be able to highlight the

590
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,679
past roles that you had in your

591
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,919
organization to show your career

592
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,840
progression. That's helpful to see as

593
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:52,159
well. And so again, this is just a

594
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,400
visual representation that um can

595
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:57,440
further highlight those relationships.

596
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,880
Um and we will look at it in conjunction

597
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,120
with all of your other application

598
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,559
materials to kind of see the impact of

599
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,559
your work and where your sphere of

600
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:07,559
influence has been in general

601
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:07,559
management.

602
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,960
The next component we'll talk about are

603
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,559
test scores. For the Sloan Fellow's

604
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,120
application, they are completely

605
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:19,919
optional. Um, if you choose to submit a

606
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:22,799
test score, you can submit a GMAT, focus

607
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:26,320
or 10th edition, GRE scores, executive

608
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:29,280
assessment scores, in-person, and remote

609
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:31,440
options um are all accepted. So, if

610
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,600
you've taken a a test and you would like

611
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,640
to provide the score, you're welcome to.

612
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:39,600
Um, again, it is an optional component.

613
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:42,159
Oftentimes, we get questions about when

614
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:44,000
it's best to provide a test score. I

615
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:46,320
think in looking that at our class

616
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
profile, um, you can find a way to kind

617
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,840
of benchmark yourself and where you fall

618
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,240
in that class profile based on test

619
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:54,159
scores and we encourage if you have a

620
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,720
competitive test score to upload it as

621
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:58,240
an additional data point. Um, but again,

622
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,000
it's up to you in your judgment if you

623
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,799
would like to provide a test score or

624
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,919
not. If a test score is provided, it

625
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:06,919
will be considered in the application.

626
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,200
The next component of the application

627
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:15,520
are your academic records and relevant

628
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,120
coursework section. Um, so we ask that

629
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,679
you provide transcripts from all

630
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:22,159
institutions that you have attended or

631
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,400
are currently attending. If your

632
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:27,039
transcripts are in another language,

633
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:30,559
you'll also provide um a certified

634
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:33,520
translation um in English.

635
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:35,679
There is also space for you to upload

636
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,919
additional non-deree coursework or

637
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:39,840
professional certifications. So, please

638
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:42,159
use that space to show how you've

639
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,640
continued learning um since your

640
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,159
undergraduate degrees.

641
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,679
When we're looking at these application

642
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:50,000
materials, we're really looking for your

643
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:52,080
academic aptitude. So, again, thinking

644
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,600
about how we are evaluating candidates,

645
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,279
we're looking for your demonstrated

646
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:58,320
successes professionally and

647
00:24:55,279 --> 00:25:00,880
academically and your leadership skills.

648
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:03,279
And so these components really help us

649
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:05,440
see your past successes in an academic

650
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:07,520
environment um and really help us

651
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:10,559
understand your mastery of a subject

652
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:13,039
area that you chose to study. We're

653
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:15,120
really looking for your comfort with

654
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:17,200
quantitative work. We don't have any

655
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,279
prerequisite courses required for this

656
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,120
loan fellow's MBA, but there is a

657
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:24,240
section where you'll detail what

658
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:26,640
quantitative if if any um courses you've

659
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,640
previously taken. This is helpful for us

660
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,120
to kind of gauge how you would perform

661
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:34,000
in the Sloan Fellows core classes in

662
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:36,400
addition to the elective offerings. And

663
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,799
again, like I noted, um we really like

664
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,960
to see a sense of intellectual curiosity

665
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:42,880
and that you're committed to continuous

666
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,039
learning. And so if you've taken

667
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,039
additional courses or certifications or

668
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:48,480
training, please use the space to

669
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:52,440
highlight those trainings or

670
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,440
certifications for us.

671
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,840
The next component of the application

672
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,760
are professional questions. So, you have

673
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:02,720
two professional questions that you'll

674
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:04,960
respond to in 200 words or fewer. The

675
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,039
first one is the space where you'll tell

676
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,200
us about your immediate and long-term

677
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:11,760
professional objectives and how the Loan

678
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,840
Fellow's MBA will help you achieve them.

679
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,120
Um, so again, if you think back to what

680
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,600
we were talking about with the cover

681
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:20,960
letter, I said that's not the space for

682
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:22,480
future goals. This specific professional

683
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,440
question is where you'll detail those

684
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:28,000
future goals for us. The second question

685
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,960
is where you'll detail your your general

686
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,559
management experience um and really

687
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,679
defining

688
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:37,440
what those experiences are. Oftent times

689
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,279
it will show up in various places

690
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,840
throughout your application in addition

691
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:45,760
to this area that you explicitly detail

692
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:48,480
your general management experience.

693
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:50,559
These questions um are limited to just

694
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,039
words, 200 words or less. So keep that

695
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:55,039
in mind.

696
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:57,600
And then the last application component

697
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:59,760
is the world that shaped you. We're

698
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,679
really excited to learn more about how

699
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,080
the world that you come from has shaped

700
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:07,360
who you are today. This question, you

701
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:10,000
have 250 words or less to tell us about

702
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,679
that. Um and this is a really great

703
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
opportunity to expand on your

704
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,360
background. So again, I've said this a

705
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,880
few times, but we're really looking

706
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,360
forward to getting to know who you are

707
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,120
as a whole person. Um, and this can

708
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,520
really provide that opportunity to

709
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:26,320
expand upon that. Again, this question

710
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:28,559
is limited to words only, so 250 words

711
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,640
or less. And it's a great opportunity

712
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:34,120
for you to just share more about what

713
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,120
makes you you.

714
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:39,600
So, I have a couple kind of overall

715
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:41,679
admissions tips as you're thinking about

716
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,840
the application and um getting started

717
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:46,480
with it. The first one is to follow

718
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:49,200
directions. Um you'll notice throughout

719
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:52,720
our application there are limited word

720
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:55,120
counts or seconds on your videos or page

721
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:57,919
counts or we're asking for specific

722
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:00,000
formats of materials. Make sure you

723
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:02,159
follow those directions. we've very

724
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,720
intentionally created the application

725
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,480
and so please we're really looking for

726
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,320
you to follow the directions as

727
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,159
intended.

728
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,679
The next thing I want to say is that

729
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:13,840
we're really looking for reasons to

730
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:15,840
admit you. So throughout the application

731
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:18,080
we're really looking for those data

732
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:20,640
points to showcase your demonstrated

733
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:22,480
successes and your leadership skills and

734
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,679
what that would contribute to the Sloan

735
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:28,159
community. So find the ways and use the

736
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:29,840
real estate to really highlight those

737
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:32,880
experiences and what you would bring

738
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:35,039
into the Sloan community. Um, think of

739
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,440
us as your advocate. So really help us

740
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:39,520
gather that data that we need to move

741
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,679
you along in the admissions process.

742
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:43,279
After you submit your application, the

743
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:45,679
first step would be giving us enough

744
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:47,440
data and information that we're excited

745
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:49,840
and want to learn more about your

746
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,919
experiences through an interview. From

747
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:55,279
there, it would be to admissions. are

748
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:57,279
really helping us um help you.

749
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:59,840
We encourage you to be yourselves. We

750
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:01,840
want to get to know who you are. Um so

751
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:04,320
really share your authentic voice

752
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:06,480
throughout the application. Um find the

753
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,559
spaces to share both personal and

754
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,760
professional aspects to your candidacy

755
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:14,240
and who what makes you you. Um and

756
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,880
really really find those opportunities

757
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:19,440
throughout the application. And then the

758
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:22,240
last piece is applying early whenever

759
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,320
your application is fully ready to go.

760
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,000
Um again we encourage international

761
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:29,360
applicants to apply by the round one

762
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:32,320
deadline if you are able to um to allow

763
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:34,960
ample time for the onboarding processes.

764
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,880
But um if your application is ready to

765
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,200
go in round one, we certainly encourage

766
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,919
you to apply for round one. We do have

767
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:44,080
two application deadlines in the event

768
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:47,279
that your application is not ready for

769
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,279
October 20th.

770
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:52,480
So, I know my colleagues have been

771
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:54,880
answering um a lot of questions

772
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,799
virtually for you all. Um but we have

773
00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:00,480
some time to answer some questions live.

774
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:02,960
So, I invite my colleague Ally to join

775
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:05,600
me for any other questions that we have

776
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,840
in the Q&A.

777
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:10,559
Awesome. Thank you, Maddie. Um yeah, we

778
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:12,720
got some great questions in the Q&A. Um,

779
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:14,720
but a couple of things that popped up a

780
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,880
little consistently I think are going to

781
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,399
be great to answer live. Um,

782
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,520
>> could you talk a bit about any

783
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:22,159
recommendations you have for

784
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:24,000
reapplicants? How can they best um,

785
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:26,159
submit their application this year?

786
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,240
>> Yeah, that's a really good question. Um,

787
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:31,440
we have reapplicants every year who are

788
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:33,600
successful in their reapplication. Um,

789
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,360
and a couple tips as you're approaching

790
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:38,320
the application process as a

791
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:40,159
reapplicant. um know that we still have

792
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,399
your previous application and all the

793
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,799
information that you submitted um the

794
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:47,200
year prior and so it's really important

795
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:50,080
for you to provide as much new

796
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:53,039
information and details and examples in

797
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:54,799
your new application as possible. Um

798
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:56,799
we'll look at both your previous

799
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:58,320
application and your current one at the

800
00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:00,880
same time. And so we're really looking

801
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:03,760
for those new details. What has changed

802
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:06,000
in the past year since you applied? Um,

803
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:09,200
finding new examples to highlight on

804
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,200
your resume and really sharing the

805
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:14,000
impact of your work within the past year

806
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,480
is really important for reapplicants.

807
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,480
Reapplicants also have a dedicated

808
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,720
question where you'll highlight or

809
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:23,039
provide a summary of what has changed

810
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,880
since you last applied. And so that's a

811
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:27,520
great opportunity to kind of summarize

812
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,960
everything that has happened and that is

813
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:31,520
shared throughout your application

814
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:34,159
materials for the admissions committee.

815
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:36,640
So again, you should provide all new

816
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:38,480
materials and provide as much new

817
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,640
information as possible throughout the

818
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:43,200
application, new examples and new

819
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,640
details so that we can review that in

820
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,640
conjunction with your previous

821
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,640
application.

822
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:53,120
>> Awesome. Thank you. Um there were a

823
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,399
couple of questions about the org chart.

824
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:57,840
So, I'm wondering if you give some more

825
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:59,919
detail on some scenarios specifically if

826
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,600
someone is maybe um doing some freelance

827
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:03,919
work or is an entrepreneur, what can

828
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,519
they submit? And then also, if someone

829
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:08,240
has an employer that maybe has some

830
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:09,279
confidentiality um guidelines to follow,

831
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,399
what would someone do in those

832
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:13,440
situations?

833
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:16,480
>> Yeah, absolutely. Um I will note briefly

834
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:18,080
that we have a sample org chart on our

835
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:22,000
website. So, feel free to take a look at

836
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:25,440
that. um and that showcases that many of

837
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,440
the names of folks are redacted. We just

838
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:30,240
show titles of many of the folks on the

839
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,919
org chart. Um so provide as much

840
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,399
information as you're able to, but if

841
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:36,720
your organization um does have some

842
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:38,559
confidentiality concerns or um

843
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,799
information cannot be shared more

844
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:42,399
broadly, you are welcome to redact

845
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:46,559
whatever information cannot be shared

846
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:49,519
with us. Um, for folks that may have um

847
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:51,360
be doing freelance work or consultants,

848
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:53,039
um, we're again looking for an

849
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:55,919
organizational chart from your current

850
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:57,600
work. And so you might highlight a

851
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:59,840
current project that you're working on

852
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,360
or an engagement that you're involved

853
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,440
with and highlighting those

854
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:06,159
relationships, even if it's outside of

855
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,519
your organization. Um, if you're working

856
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:09,440
directly with a client, you might

857
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:13,200
highlight their organizational chart and

858
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:15,360
how you relate um to those roles. And so

859
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,279
really um highlighting your current work

860
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:19,519
and what you're doing and showcasing

861
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:21,760
those relationships is what's most

862
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:24,159
important. Um and for some it might look

863
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:26,000
slightly different than others um but

864
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:30,679
that's what we would recommend as you

865
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,679
approach the organizational chart.

866
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:36,960
>> Awesome. Thanks.

867
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:40,720
Um another question we got was about how

868
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:42,720
we look for managerial experience in the

869
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,399
application. Um, does someone have to

870
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,960
have direct reports in order to have

871
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:48,960
that managerial or leadership uh,

872
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,760
experience shown? How do we evaluate

873
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,559
that?

874
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:54,320
>> Yeah, that's a great question. Um, it is

875
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:58,000
not a requirement of the Sloan Fellows

876
00:33:54,320 --> 00:34:00,320
MBA to have direct reports. Many most

877
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,399
times our applicants do have direct

878
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:04,320
reports or indirect reports that they're

879
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:07,120
working with. I think what's most

880
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:10,000
important is what the experiences are

881
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:11,520
that you're having in the leadership. Um

882
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,040
so if you're leading a specific

883
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:17,520
organization or leading specific teams,

884
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:20,240
maybe you're not leading um individuals

885
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:22,480
in a direct way, but you have um

886
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:25,839
responsibility for strategy or budget of

887
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:28,000
a function um or of an organization.

888
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:29,359
Those are that's the experience that

889
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,440
we're looking for, that general

890
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:33,200
management experience where you have

891
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,520
kind of large scale impact on an

892
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:37,119
organization or a function. And often

893
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,800
times that means that you have direct

894
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:41,359
reports, but sometimes you don't. And

895
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:43,599
that is perfectly fine. Um, in your

896
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:45,599
organizational chart and the employment

897
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:47,919
section, you'll be able to detail how

898
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:49,599
many direct reports that you have. Um,

899
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:51,359
so if you have any, highlighting them

900
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:53,760
for us. If not, that's perfectly fine.

901
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:55,599
And we'll really use the organizational

902
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,920
chart to see those relationships that

903
00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:01,200
you have. Um, whether you have direct

904
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:03,359
reports or not.

905
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:07,040
>> Makes sense. Thanks.

906
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:09,359
Um along similar lines, how do we look

907
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:11,119
for um the words used before were quant

908
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:13,599
comfortable? What exactly does that mean

909
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:15,680
and how would one demonstrate that if

910
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:16,960
not including GMAT or GRE scores? What

911
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,040
are some other ways they would be able

912
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,440
to um show that on their application?

913
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,960
>> Yeah, that's a great question. Um if you

914
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,599
look on our website, we have a few

915
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,920
different relevant courses that we're we

916
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:29,680
ask you to detail in the application.

917
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,240
Things like if you've taken a calculus

918
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,839
course or a statistics course. And so

919
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,920
this is one of the ways that we can kind

920
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:37,760
of determine your level of comfort with

921
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:40,000
quantitative work if you've previously

922
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,240
done any and how you performed in those

923
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,320
classes. Oftentimes students might not

924
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:46,160
have taken any of those classes or it's

925
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,920
been many years since they were in those

926
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:50,000
classes. And so there are variety of

927
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:53,119
other ways that you can demonstrate your

928
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,359
comfort with quant work um outside of

929
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:56,960
the relevant coursework section. One of

930
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:59,520
the ways is if you've taken any

931
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:01,280
additional certifications, um done any

932
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:03,200
professional trainings or non-deree

933
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,920
coursework, there's space in the

934
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:08,000
application to detail any of those. Um

935
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:10,000
sometimes we might have students who

936
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,320
maybe complete MBA math as they're

937
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,960
preparing for an application just to

938
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:17,119
refresh themselves on those topics.

939
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:20,160
You're welcome to provide details of

940
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:23,200
courses like MBA math in that um section

941
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:25,839
of the application. Outside of that, um

942
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:28,000
the work that you're doing um may also

943
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:30,160
be quantitate. You may have aspects of

944
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,079
your work that are quantitative. And so

945
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:34,000
if you highlight those on your resume,

946
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:35,920
that's helpful for us to see. We're

947
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,640
really just looking for evidence that

00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:40,400
you're prepared to be successful in the

949
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:43,040
classroom. And that can show up in a

950
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:45,839
variety of places. The previous um

951
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:48,480
academics that you've done, any

952
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:50,960
non-deree coursework, your professional

953
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:53,359
work that you've done. And so if you

954
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:55,760
don't have specific courses, um just

955
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:57,839

00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,920
within our application, we have a

999
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,599
funding page where you'll read a little

1000
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,200
bit about what opportunities are

1001
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:48,560
available and what resources are

1002
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:50,560
available. Um, for the Sloan Fellows

1003
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,720
application, you'll indicate if you are

1004
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:54,640
or not interested in being considered

1005
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,480
for a fellowship. All of the fellowships

1006
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:58,400
that are awarded for Sloan Fellows are

1007
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,079
merit-based, and it's based off of

1008
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,480
everything that's included in your

1009
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:05,040
application. So, you just check a check

1010
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:06,640
box within the application. Um, but I

1011
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,000
will say all admitted applicants are

1012
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:10,720
automatically considered for the

1013
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,560
merit-based fellowships. And then if

1014
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,800
you're interested in considering other

1015
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,960
opportunities, um, please use the

1016
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:19,520
resources that are linked within our

1017
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:22,079
application to, um, websites like the

1018
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:25,880
Sloan student funding website, um, to

1019
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:25,880
explore other opportunities.

1020
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:32,800
Um, I know we are nearing the end of our

1021
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:34,960
time here. Um, I think we covered just

1022
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:37,119
about everything that I'm seeing in the

1023
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,720
Q&A function. Of course, if we missed

1024
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:40,400
your question, we have the email up

1027
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,000
Q&A.

00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:48,160
