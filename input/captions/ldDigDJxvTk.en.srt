1
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:11,880
It's great honor for me to introduce

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:15,519
professor Shiva Shanka for our next

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:17,600
talk. Uh P Shiva's research investigates

4
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:20,560
the role of cell mechanics and nuclear

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,680
mechanics uh in chromatin organization

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:27,039
and transcription regulations. His lab's

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:29,720
research identified novel approach to

8
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:32,800
induce cellular rejuvenation and

9
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:35,280
reprogramming. In recent several years,

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,760
uh his lab developed a chromatin

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,600
fingerprint based approach for the

12
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:46,079
disease diagnostic and the uh drug

13
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:48,480
discovery. Shiva received his uh PhD

14
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,680
from Rockefeller University and after

15
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:55,600
that he become faculty in National

16
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,520
Center of Biological Science and in 2011

17
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:01,120
he joined National University of

18
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:06,960
Singapore and co-direct mechano biology

19
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:10,400
institute. In 20 uh 21 he joined ETS

20
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,000
Zurich and lead a laboratory of

21
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,400
multiscale

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,680
uh biology uh there. Let's welcome our

23
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:24,520
next speaker professor

24
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:26,840
[Applause]

25
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:29,920
Shiva. Great. I

26
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:32,479
hope so. Let me thank the organizers for

27
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,400
having me here. Also, it's always a

28
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,840
pleasure to have your former PhD student

29
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,600
introduce you. Luchen was a former PhD

30
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,200
student. Good. With that, uh since it's

31
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,200
a very broad audience, what I'm going to

32
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,799
do is

33
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,799
um give you a flavor for the kind of

34
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:50,640
questions we ask uh and how we approach

35
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:52,640
them and most of the work that I we do

36
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,119
is in joint collaboration with Caroline

37
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,720
Wooler's lab

38
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:58,399
here. So, it's wonderful morning

39
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,119
session. So I don't have to go introduce

40
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:04,439
too much uh many things that many of you

41
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:08,800
have already talked about.

42
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:10,720
Uh nevertheless um so as all of us know

43
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,120
I don't have to belabor this we have

44
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:17,599
about uh 36 trillions of cells in our

45
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:20,400
body is the same DNA. So it has to pack

46
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:23,360
in different tissues in a tissue

47
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,879
specific manner. Uh also as all of you

48
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,920
know different tissues have different

49
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:30,480
stiffness. bone tissues are very stiff

50
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,720
whereas uh brain tissues are very soft.

51
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,560
So one is to try and understand genome

52
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,560
regulation in the context of the

53
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,560
stiffness. So what I'm going to do in

54
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,959
the first half of the talk is to give

55
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,239
you some basic principles that we have

56
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,920
discovered of how cells

57
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:49,599
operate. We'll then go forward and how

58
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:52,640
we can embrace uh AI to learn about cell

59
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:55,200
states and cell state transitions.

60
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:59,720
One other thing that we discovered we

61
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:03,040
and others of course uh identified was

62
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,040
um that

63
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:09,360
chromosomes while you pack the DNA into

64
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:12,400
the nucleus the interfaces between

65
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:15,599
chromosomes have been have been not uh

66
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,840
well appreciated right the intermingling

67
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,760
regions between the chromosomes which

68
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,280
can have trans interaction seems to have

69
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:25,519
a bearing on how transcriptional control

70
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,159
come about in a cell type specific

71
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:31,080
manner or tissue type specific manner.

72
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:33,519
Once you think of uh chromosome

73
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,440
interfaces, mechanics becomes important

74
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,080
because it's like a box in which you

75
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,799
pack chromosomes. If I change the nature

76
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,599
of the box in terms of the mechanics,

77
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,280
then you have altered genome regulation

78
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,760
which is what I'll show you in the first

79
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,159
part of the talk.

80
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,480
So over the years we and others have

81
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:55,920
laid out some of the principles that how

82
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:58,640
cells send signals from the

83
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,879
extracellular environment because cells

84
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,720
sense both chemical as well as

85
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:07,040
mechanical signals and these cells then

86
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:09,519
integrate into different parts of the

87
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,519
genome when you activate specific

88
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,760
transcription factors. So these

89
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,160
transcription factors then bring about

90
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,639
groups of genes which are collocicalized

91
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,560
for

92
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:22,560
co-regulation. And so this kind of an

93
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,560
idea already suggests that there are

94
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,280
really two spaces that we need to worry

95
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,919
about. The first space is really an

96
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,000
architectural space which you can probe

97
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,960
by imaging. Jennifer talked about quite

98
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,440
a bit of the imaging modalities.

99
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:40,080
And of course this physical space

100
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,160
intimately linked with the biochemical

101
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,800
space. The biochemical space of cells

102
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,919
are highly

103
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,639
multi-dimensional. Lots of biochemical

104
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,800
networks. One wants to understand causal

105
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,199
relationship between this physical and

106
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,000
biochemical

107
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:58,320
space. If such a thing exists, we should

108
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,120
be able to test it in very simple

109
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,919
models. Right? So one of the things that

110
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,440
we tried out early on was take a cell.

111
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:08,240
These are general principles. You can

112
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,880
work with any cells of your choice. Take

113
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,280
a cell, change its mechanics or change

114
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:16,240
its geometry. As you see here, there are

115
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,400
many methods in cell biology where you

116
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,280
can have micropatent surfaces where you

117
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,199
can change the shape of a cell. So when

118
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,000
you change the shape is the same cell,

119
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,840
right? When you change the shape of the

120
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,400
cell and take its transcriptto, the

121
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:33,840
transcriptto is very different, right?

122
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:37,199
All I've done is taken a cell change it

123
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,039
shape right and the DNA is packed but

124
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,840
what it produces is very different

125
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:45,560
proteins. Somehow the cells adapt to

126
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:49,880
what they see, trigger biochemical

127
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:53,479
circuitry in the signaling pathways and

128
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:55,759
trigger remodeling of the chromosome

129
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:57,479
interfaces because I'm changing the

130
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,240
shape of the cell and the shape of the

131
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:02,800
nucleus and I produce different

132
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,800
proteins. Right? This is very generic of

133
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,919
all cell types that you work with.

134
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,240
Right? The second important principle is

135
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,800
if you now stimulate these cells with

136
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,600
some signals, it could be mechanical, it

137
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,120
could be chemical signals, the cell

138
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:22,080
state, the cell mechanical state

139
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:24,680
dictates what the output is. Right? So

140
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:29,360
here is an example that I take the same

141
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:31,280
cells put them in a tissue organoid or

142
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,360
an engineered tissue or look at the same

143
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,759
cells in tissues.

144
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,960
What you find is that every cell has its

145
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:41,440
own local state you know in in in in in

146
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,240
culture or in tissues and now when you

147
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,440
stimulate these cells every cell has its

148
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,039
own program. So that's why

149
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:52,319
fingerprinting every cell's transcriptto

150
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:54,319
in a tissue is so important to

151
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,039
understand the biology of how cells

152
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:59,360
work, how cells transition to different

153
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:01,880
states, how cells transition to disease

154
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:05,520
states. Right? in the same

155
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:07,680
cells, same signals, either mechanical

156
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,919
or chemical or both, but they turn on

157
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,599
very different

158
00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:13,919
um expression patterns, protein

159
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:16,319
production. So, what this led us to

160
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:19,039
believe is that there must be cell

161
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:21,199
autonomous properties that cells could

162
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:23,120
actually switch states here. They're not

163
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,720
still switching their states. Maybe

164
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,560
cells could actually switch the cell

165
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:31,680
states. And so we came up with a very

166
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:34,960
simple hypothesis. If a cell has to

167
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,880
maintain a memory because all of us as

168
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,440
we know we don't have billions of cell

169
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,280
types. We have about few hundreds or few

170
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,720
thousands of cell types depending on who

171
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:47,280
you talk to. Now cells have to maintain

172
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,800
memory right when the cells maintain

173
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,319
memory they maintain memory through

174
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,919
their transcriptional program because

175
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,319
they produce the same proteins after

176
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,240
division.

177
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:59,759
But they also have to maintain this

178
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,599
mechanical geometric memory, right? And

179
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,440
that's critical. As I said, the physical

180
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:05,360
space and the biochemical space are

181
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,840
intimately linked. So they really need

182
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,560
to remember their mechanical constraint

183
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,639
as well. So when you look at cells in

184
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,039
culture or in tissues when they divide,

185
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,240
they remember the mechanical memory, but

186
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,759
then they also remember the

187
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,479
transcription memory because they're

188
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,960
interlin, right? So we came with a

189
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:26,240
simple hypothesis that let's break one

190
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:29,000
of this memory element maybe break the

191
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,120
mechanical memory of a cell as they

192
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,399
divide maybe then they should really

193
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:37,760
forget their transcriptional memory. So

194
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:40,640
we impose this confinement so that cells

195
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,719
cannot stick outside and when the cell

196
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:45,440
divides one cell was sitting in a good

197
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:48,399
real estate a piece and now the cell

198
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,720
divides two cells four cells then there

199
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,560
is no space to sit whereas if the cells

200
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,440
divide in a tissue or a culture they

201
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:58,720
remember both the memories and here as

202
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,959
they divide they start piling up on

203
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,839
themsel because a mechanical state is

204
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,519
changing. One cell was having a tight

205
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,680
geometric constraint. When the cell

206
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,000
divided, two cells, four cells, they're

207
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,800
losing their geometrical constraints,

208
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,040
right? And we wondered that this

209
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,760
property could induce alterations in

210
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,360
chromatin ST signaling transcriptional

211
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,600
programs. And we had a lot of luck with

212
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,600
this simple

213
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:25,360
idea. The starting from one cell. This

214
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,399
is again true for it's a it's a very

215
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,959
generic property of

216
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:33,600
cells that imposing geometric

217
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:35,360
constraints and dividing them. What

218
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,279
these cells ended up doing is you

219
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:41,040
started with some cell type. This is a

220
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:43,120
messen camel fiber. As they divided they

221
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,040
switch their cell state from a messen

222
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,839
camel to epithelium. They continue to

223
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:50,160
divide and then they become stemlike.

224
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,519
All I've done is there is no exogenous

225
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:56,080
factors. I've taken a

226
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:58,720
cell. I've worked around the phase space

227
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,920
for cells with a simple hypothesis that

228
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:05,600
if you break the mechanical symmetry or

229
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:08,080
geometric symmetry, these cells end up a

230
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:11,279
system-like state. Right? This with very

231
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:14,880
high efficiency. That means that this is

232
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:16,720
a very default natural cell state

233
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,200
transition that our cells have in our

234
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,360
tissues. Of course, they have to

235
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,360
maintain homeostasis because you don't

236
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,279
want to become have diseases all the

237
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,440
time. If cells fit their states, we're

238
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:31,160
all unstable, right? Cells have to have

239
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:33,519
some stable solutions. But loss of this

240
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:36,720
mechanogenomic homeostasis then can

241
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,240
actually induce partial reprogramming.

242
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,040
Now, we have shown that we can actually

243
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,440
take eight cells, take them into more

244
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,519
younger cells by rejuvenation. And I'm

245
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,640
not going to talk about that. But this

246
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,399
idea suggests that this could be a

247
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:52,160
precursor for generating a disease state

248
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,720
because diseases start from single

249
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:57,920
cells, right? So how do we understand

250
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,320
then at a cellular level? How do

251
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:03,200
diseases start? And our claim is that

252
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:06,399
maybe this kind of a mechanochemical

253
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:09,079
constraint the cells have in our tissues

254
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:11,680
with alterations in the mechanogenomic

255
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:14,399
homeostasis could have this propensity

256
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,079
for a cell state switch. Right? So we're

257
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,640
now searching for such cell state

258
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:20,040
switches in real tissues. I'll talk

259
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,480
about one

260
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:25,040
example and as you know these are early

261
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,920
drawings from kahal almost 100 years ago

262
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,399
where he noticed simple microscopes that

263
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,800
cells do switch in the in the micro

264
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,800
environment without any exogenous

265
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,880
factors that means that the micro

266
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,959
environment has adequate information for

267
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,519
cell state transitions.

268
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:44,000
So it's been long appreciated that in

269
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,240
diseases like aging related diseases

270
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,959
like cancer or

271
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,120
neurodeeneration you don't switch

272
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:51,839
overnight. Cell state transitions happen

273
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,440
over a long period of timing. So this is

274
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,160
for example in different types of

275
00:11:53,440 --> 00:12:00,160
cancers as a function of aging different

276
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:03,800
years that it takes for a single cell in

277
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:08,320
a stromal environment in a tissue

278
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:11,200
switches its state and start uh you know

279
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,920
abnormal loss of homeostasis leads to

280
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,000
growth of a disease right over a long

281
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,920
period of

282
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,560
time. So this is what we want to try and

283
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,800
understand. So one of the things uh that

284
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:27,519
we the main thing that our group does is

285
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:30,399
to use the lens of how the DNA is packed

286
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:33,920
in each of these cells and see how

287
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:37,200
alterations in this genome uh could lead

288
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:40,240
to these cell state transitions. So as I

289
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,920
said as we age as cells age in our

290
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,160
tissues there are very subtle

291
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:47,040
alterations in the in the chromatin

292
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:50,399
state how genes genomes are packed and

293
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:53,680
so we are very keen on reverting it back

294
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:55,120
or use this changes as biomarkers for

295
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,760
health and disease what I'm going to

296
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:00,480
talk today more is a little more of our

297
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:03,680
efforts to think about the way DNA is

298
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:06,800
packed as a exquisite biomarker for

299
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:10,560
cell's health or disease Right. So

300
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:13,120
towards that um to go with Caroline's

301
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:15,360
group uh over the years I'm not going to

302
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,320
go into all the details. Over the years

303
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:22,000
we've developed a number of uh uh

304
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:24,240
machine learning models to learn how DNA

305
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,079
is packed, how the hierarchical nature

306
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:32,399
of folding is set up in living cells. uh

307
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:35,360
by staining various markers of DNA, DNA

308
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,839
associated proteins, modifications in

309
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,560
the histone that pack the DNA and

310
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:42,959
various other uh you know uh regulatory

311
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:45,839
molecules that are within the within the

312
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:48,480
nucleus. Through this uh set of learning

313
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,800
and u either supervised or unsupervised

314
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:54,279
learning methods we have developed what

315
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:58,000
are called chromatin fingerprints for

316
00:13:54,279 --> 00:14:00,800
cells state cell's health or disease and

317
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,440
these fingerprints are large it's like

318
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:07,279
taking a cell looking at how the DNA is

319
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,959
packed in the same uh you know idea as

320
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:11,360
taking your cell and taking a single

321
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:13,120
cell transcriptto a single cell

322
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,760
transcriptto will give you a whole bunch

323
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,279
of gene gene expression changes uh that

324
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:20,880
h that that are associated with the

325
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:22,560
cell. Likewise, what we have is a

326
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,639
highdimensional information of how the

327
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,880
DNA is packed because as I said, these

328
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:29,839
two spaces are intimately linked with

329
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:32,720
each other. Right? And so through this

330
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:35,079
uh we can now look at cell states very

331
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:38,959
easily now, right? So one

332
00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:42,320
example that we tried early on was take

333
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:44,240
cells of different cancer states. uh

334
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,680
these are cell lines derived from

335
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:49,440
various stages of breast tumor

336
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:51,680
progression and look at the how the DNA

337
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,480
is packed in these images and what you

338
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:57,600
already see is that you have distinct

339
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,440
states of chromatin in these cell types

340
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,360
right you can actually see that there

341
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,120
are very distinct types of each dot is a

342
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,720
nuclei is a high dimensional information

343
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:09,360
of the DNA packing and now you construct

344
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:12,240
um a low dimensional map of how the

345
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:14,320
chromatin structure is set up And now

346
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:17,760
through a number of methods that I'm not

347
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:20,720
going to go into the details um because

348
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,000
diseases don't happen overnight or cell

349
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,680
state transitions don't happen

350
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,120
overnight. They happen over a long

351
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:30,079
period of time. It's so hard to record

352
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,800
image the cell states transition real

353
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:35,040
time in a tissue context for a disease

354
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,839
progression. So we have developed

355
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:40,000
methods where if we

356
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:43,040
had pieces of information during the

357
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,360
progression of a disease uh what we can

358
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:50,240
then construct is transport models uh

359
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:52,320
reduce take these uh information into a

360
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,800
latent space and transport the

361
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,360
distributions of how chromatin state is

362
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,759
set up in one cell state and how they

363
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,680
change over time. And if you did that,

364
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,680
you can then develop the envelope of how

365
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,959
the chromatin state transitions uh

366
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:09,839
change uh in a disease context. So these

367
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:12,399
kind of things can be very useful when

368
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:15,000
you really look at um uh you know

369
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:19,199
complex diseases. Here is an example

370
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:21,399
of breast tumor progression. This is a

371
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,600
uh ductal carcinoma that becomes

372
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:26,880
invasive car carcinoma. is the human

373
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:30,240
breast tissues tissue microarrays and we

374
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:32,880
emate the entire tissue microarray of

375
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:36,240
different stages of the disease and

376
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,000
fingerprint every nuclei for its state

377
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,680
of

378
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,680
chromatin. So we developed a scoring

379
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:45,120
system that we can then annotate a score

380
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:47,600
for this nuclei whether health or

381
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:51,279
disease state and the degree of disease

382
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:54,240
state. So using such a scoring system as

383
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:56,720
the disease sets in what you can see is

384
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,480
the cell state transition that happen

385
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,360
through the lens of how the chromatin is

386
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:04,400
changing in this context right from a

387
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,480
ductal carcinoma to invasive carcinoma.

388
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,760
So you get highdimensional readout of

389
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:12,160
the chromatin packing

390
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:14,319
states and how these packing states can

391
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:17,679
teach us about the biology of cell state

392
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:21,480
transitions. now right and using such uh

393
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:24,400
such methods um uh in collaboration with

394
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:26,559
um Caroline's lab and in particular

395
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:30,320
Shini she'll talk about some of this I

396
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:32,480
think in her talk what we developed is a

397
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,880
way of taking all the cell state that

398
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,720
exists in these tissues and cluster them

399
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,600
cluster them from healthy to disease

400
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:43,280
states and what you see is that uh this

401
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:45,440
kind of a clustering method can annotate

402
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,919
fraction of cells cells that are in the

403
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,960
healthy state, how the fractions of

404
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:53,200
these cells change from the health state

405
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,360
to the disease state as the disease

406
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,840
progresses. And one of the surprising

407
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,880
thing to me at

408
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:03,120
least that came out of this effort was

409
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:05,520
that if you fingerprinted the chromatin

410
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,559
states of the cells in different disease

411
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:10,400
states, different stages of the breast

412
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:12,960
tumor, you start seeing that even in the

413
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,880
healthy tissue, there are residual cells

414
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,760
which have the chromatin fingerprints of

415
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,760
a disease state, right? Although they're

416
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,520
not diseased state, they're annotated by

417
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,240
a pathologist as normal, but there are

418
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:26,480
residual cells. And it seems then that

419
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,559
as the disease progresses, your spatial

420
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,559
temporal

421
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:33,760
reorganization of these fraction of

422
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:36,480
cells that make this ducts into very

423
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:39,960
highly metastatic um duct. So this

424
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:42,880
allows us to trace uh cell state

425
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:44,799
transitions through the process of how

426
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,400
uh breast tumor progression happens. In

427
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:48,720
fact, there's a big unmet medical

428
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,760
challenge even today around the world

429
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,919
that we cannot predict which tumor

430
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,360
becomes aggressive and which tumor

431
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:58,480
doesn't become aggressive. There's a

432
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:00,840
over treatment as soon as a as a as a

433
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:03,520
individual is detected of ductal

434
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:07,360
carcinoma only 30% of them go on to

435
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:09,200
become invasive ductal carcinoma but we

436
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,120
cannot predict which one will become

437
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,200
invasive and which one will not become

438
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,679
invasive. So there's an ongoing project

439
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,760
in the lab to try and figure that out.

440
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:21,039
Now can we really figure out through the

441
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:25,559
lens of chromatin states which states

442
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:28,799
are aggressive and which states are um

443
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:31,760
non-aggressive. So with this uh what it

444
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:34,840
suggests is that if imaging modality can

445
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:37,679
give us so much about the

446
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:40,160
biochemistry there must be really good

447
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:42,240
ways to translate information from one

448
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:45,120
domain of the data to the other domain

449
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,679
of the data. Again here I'm not going to

450
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,760
go into all the details. We wondered

451
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,520
about this because I think these are

452
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,960
some of the work done in Caroline's

453
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,039
group was actually initiated this

454
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:58,000
multi-dommain data translation methods

455
00:19:55,039 --> 00:20:00,960
in the field early on and what you see

456
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,799
is a picture of cells and the nuclear

457
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:07,679
and the DNA because the DNA is folded in

458
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:09,960
a very hierarchical m manner. This

459
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:12,559
should be able to tell us maybe to

460
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,480
predict what could be the transcriptto

461
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:16,160
of this

462
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:19,039
cell or what could be the genomic

463
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:22,160
architecture of this cell that are very

464
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:25,679
hard to measure. Right? These types of

465
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:28,159
uh you know data inensive measurements

466
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,919
in terms of omix technologies are pretty

467
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:33,200
expensive if you want to do it on a

468
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:35,840
whole body scale, whole tissue scale.

469
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:38,480
But what is a cheap data modality is in

470
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,400
imaging is a cheap data modality. I mean

471
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,640
depending on who you talk to. If you

472
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,480
talk to Jennifer she uses very high-end

473
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,640
machines that might be expense little

474
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:50,080
expensive but still it's much cheaper

475
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:52,159
than taking OMIX data of of cells. So

476
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,720
through this number of um you know

477
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:57,600
iterations what we are now shown is by

478
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,760
taking pictures single cell pictures and

479
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,640
learning how the single cell sequencing

480
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:06,120
could be in those cells even with

481
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:08,799
unpaired data we can now start uh

482
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:12,240
annotating what could be the

483
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:14,960
transcriptto of cells from an imaging

484
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:17,280
data modality. uh also these are

485
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:20,080
challenging uh multi-dommain data

486
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:22,960
translation because imaging pixels

487
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:25,520
whereas sequencing is numbers. So there

488
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:29,280
are many methods now that allow you to

489
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:30,919
go from this space to to various spaces.

490
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,440
So now in recent

491
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:36,559
work we have also shown that not only

492
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:39,039
you can go to transcryto or the taxic or

493
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:42,000
the high sea of that cell from an image

494
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:43,760
but we can also go to more biochemical

495
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,200
circuitry of the cell because ultimately

496
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,880
you want to understand the regulatory

497
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:50,400
mod uh so we can convert that into gene

498
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,039
regulatory network that's going to come

499
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,200
out or shiny will talk about how you can

500
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:57,039
predict protein localization from

501
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,039
imaging space where do the proteins go

502
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:01,360
and sit and so on and so forth.

503
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:04,799
And this is a very powerful enterprise

504
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:07,679
now around the world that because a cell

505
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:09,600
is complex has many many different

506
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,240
dimensions of how the data is

507
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,760
represented in a cell and you want to if

508
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,240
you want to understand the cell you need

509
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,240
to be able to annotate most of these

510
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,799
different data domains but it's hard to

511
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,120
acquire all the data domains of a single

512
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:25,720
cell. So these kind of translation

513
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:28,880
methods, data integration methods would

514
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:31,840
be valuable particularly if you can take

515
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,919
a simple picture. So we got excited

516
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,120
about this because if there is so much

517
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:39,120
information in a

518
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:41,520
picture, we should be able to enable

519
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,280
early diagnostics because it's so hard

520
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,440
to know where the diseases start in the

521
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:48,159
body. But maybe if we come up with a

522
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,400
simple hypothesis, we might be able to

523
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:54,400
succeed in early diagnostics. So that's

524
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:56,559
what we did. uh is based on an idea that

525
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:00,000
as all of you know any diseases that

526
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:01,400
start in the body secrete signals

527
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,440
whether it's tumor whether there's

528
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:05,360
neurodeeneration whether it's metabolic

529
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,760
disorders they all secrete signals to

530
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:10,000
the local environment and these signals

531
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:13,520
which are chemical signals end up in the

532
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,840
blood uh eventually and our blood cells

533
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:18,280
the immune system is the most sensitive

534
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:21,600
system in a body to detect any subtle

535
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:24,400
changes in the secret signals in the

536
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:27,600
body. So our hypothesis was that let's

537
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:30,320
image the blood cell chromatin state the

538
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:33,720
peripheral blood cell white blood cell

539
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:38,159
chromatin state and ask could that be a

540
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:40,799
detector of the physiology right so if

541
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:43,120
we can actually demonstrate this

542
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:44,960
hypothesis what that tells you is that

543
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,280
not only tells you about immune function

544
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:51,120
we can annotate that but also tells you

545
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:53,280
about early diagnostic meth approaches.

546
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:56,720
So here is an example of taking from a

547
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:59,760
tumor healthy donors and a tumor

548
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:02,000
patients. Um I think this was head and

549
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:04,559
neck cancer. We take the peripheral

550
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,760
blood cells collect the blood from the

551
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:09,120
body. It's very easy to

552
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:11,919
collect take pictures of the of the

553
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:13,919
blood cell chromatin state right and

554
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:17,559
through these we could already show that

555
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:20,240
with very high precision very high

556
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:23,520
sensitivity we can actually distinguish

557
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:26,720
between cancer p cohort and healthy

558
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:30,000
cohort right so that means that because

559
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:32,400
the immune cells are so sensitive uh we

560
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,679
could actually detect very early on

561
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,640
signals that are starting from the

562
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:38,960
disease right So this has led into two

563
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,480
successful finishing trials now clinical

564
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,840
trials in Switzerland where we can

565
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:46,240
actually now

566
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:48,679
ask can we then use this not only for

567
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,600
early diagnostics but efficacy of

568
00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:53,679
treatments because there's hardly any

569
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:56,559
good method in the world today once

570
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:59,120
you're treated for a disease about the

571
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:02,520
relapse because the imaging method that

572
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:05,240
we have has a resolution of 1 million 1

573
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:08,080
millm when you take different imaging

574
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:10,919
modalities. But as you know diseases

575
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:13,679
start from cells. If you delete the

576
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:16,640
disease, you want to ask how much have

577
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:18,880
you deleted. So this is an effort to

578
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,440
look at proton therapy for advanced

579
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:24,480
tumors. This is a finish the trial is

580
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:27,600
finished. Uh uh and actually we're now

581
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,279
putting out the data on the paper

582
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,360
together with Caroline and her student

583
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:33,760
Hannah.

584
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:37,200
And what this trial suggested to us is

585
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:38,880
that uh as the it's a very systematic

586
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,880
trial. You collect the blood before

587
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:43,600
therapy, during therapy, after therapy

588
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:46,720
and post therapy to see how the immune

589
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:49,360
cell chromatin state is changing. Is it

590
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:52,080
coming towards the healthy cohort or is

591
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,880
staying as the disease cohort, right? So

592
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,320
we can actually now with this method

593
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:59,520
annotate every patient level

594
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:03,440
trajectories um of how the disease

595
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:05,679
progression and disease um therapeutic

596
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,400
efficacy can be annotated. Likewise we

597
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,960
have another trial that got finished.

598
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:14,159
Can we detect metabolic disorders using

599
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:16,640
this um chromatin states of blood cells

600
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:19,520
because metabolic disorders are a big

601
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:22,320
disorder in the field and is it possible

602
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:25,039
to use cost effective methods as this

603
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:28,960
simple images to give you uh insights on

604
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:30,320
metabolic disorders. Again um one of a

605
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,840
colleague who did this is in the

606
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:35,960
audience somewhere uh in the lab. So

607
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:39,039
this has motivated us to

608
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:41,200
ask move towards a large public health

609
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:44,960
project where we would seek all of your

610
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:46,799
help uh both in terms of uh funding but

611
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,120
also participation in the public health

612
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:52,240
project. What we're now trying to do is

613
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:55,600
can we then fingerprint blood cell

614
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:58,400
chromatin states of individuals. Uh if

615
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:00,559
we have a map of that of healthy

616
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,640
individuals then that's a reference map

617
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:04,559
that we can create. So this is what I'll

618
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:07,200
end with that we have started this

619
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:10,080
project in in partnership with the Swiss

620
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:12,000
Red Cross because how do you define who

621
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,559
is healthy and who is not healthy

622
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,480
because every clinician will not agree

623
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:18,080
to their own interpretation. So what we

624
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,960
decided to do was to partner with Swiss

625
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:23,120
Red Cross where they have a series of

626
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:26,400
checklist to make sure that a person who

627
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:29,520
donates blood is healthy with some some

628
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:31,440
boundary conditions and this blood is uh

629
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:34,640
implanted in the other individuals. So

630
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:37,200
we we're having that checklist as uh a a

631
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:40,880
measure of healthy individuals. And so

632
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:45,200
we are now uh you know taking uh blood

633
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:47,760
from a large uh cohort of Swiss citizens

634
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:51,440
across different age groups and male and

635
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:55,200
female. The idea is to create like a

636
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:57,760
like a chromatin imaging atlas of blood

637
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,919
cells, peripheral white blood cells

638
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:03,440
which is so informative of the

639
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:06,679
physiology in the body as a map that

640
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:09,600
will give us uh ability to do early

641
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:13,039
diagnostics because then any outlier of

642
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:15,760
the chromatin state outside this would

643
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:17,600
be an annotation for a disease. So we

644
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:20,799
are now large clinical trials starting

645
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:24,000
with uh uh you know with a one of the

646
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:27,279
biggest hospitals in Switzerland uh to

647
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,360
really fingerprint uh patients who come

648
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:30,960
for early diagnostics through PET

649
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,960
scanning

650
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,279
uh to collect the blood before the PET

651
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:37,279
scan and look at the blood chromatin

652
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:40,120
state and fingerprint and we have all

653
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:42,559
the metadata of the patients um to

654
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:45,360
fingerprint how their chromatin states

655
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:48,720
or blood cells look like um in the

656
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:51,200
context of various diseases and use a

657
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,360
healthy chromatin state as a reference

658
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,080
map, right? Because you need a good

659
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:58,240
reference benchmark to say and the

660
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,080
hetrogenity within because every one of

661
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,880
us is very different. Even though we are

662
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:04,880
healthy, you may look at the blood from

663
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,159
each one of you. The chromatin state is

664
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,080
very different depending on what you've

665
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:10,720
eaten, what is your metabolic activity,

666
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:13,640
whether you have small small cough,

667
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:16,880
cold, so on so forth. So we need to map

668
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:18,799
that envelope of the hetrogenity which

669
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,799
is a fingerprint which is an atlas that

670
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:24,000
we need to create and this is a large

671
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:27,919
project um and then we're also taking it

672
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:32,320
towards uh you know precision or simple

673
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:34,480
uh optical methods that are that can be

674
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,200
uh that these blood cell chromatin

675
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,480
states could be visualized on a small

676
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:40,799
microchip that's connected to a very

677
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,080
highly sensitive camera that microscope

678
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:44,080
that we have built.

679
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,640
and we're now prototyping the second

680
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:48,320
version that can connect to a simple

681
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,440
mobile phone so that then we can

682
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:53,039
actually take it to scale up the process

683
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,600
because then we can actually fingerprint

684
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:58,240
a lot more volunteers around the around

685
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:01,600
the globe. So right now this is a

686
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:03,600
Swissbased program and we'll sign we'll

687
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,440
eventually make it into a larger scale

688
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:08,799
program and we are of course writing to

689
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,440
a lot lot of foundations to fund this.

690
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:13,679
uh with that let me

691
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:17,840
end. So what I took you through today is

692
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:20,039
very simple ideas of a cell that sits in

693
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:22,960
a tissue micro

694
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:24,440
environment senses both mechanical and

695
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,799
physical

696
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:28,480
signals mechanical and biochemical

697
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:32,399
signals. We're used to thinking of

698
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:34,880
biochemistry more, but it's important to

699
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:37,679
realize that mechanochemistry is what

700
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:41,120
cells see in our tissues, right? And

701
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:45,200
that in that signals integrate to cells

702
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:47,120
and that with a loss of homeostasis, you

703
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:50,720
can induce a cell state transition. So

704
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:53,279
what I showed you today is how general

705
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:56,240
principles exist in our cells to

706
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:58,679
integrate mechano chemistry, transduce

707
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:02,000
them through canonical signaling

708
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:04,159
pathways, remodel the way chromatin

709
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,360
structure is set up in these cells

710
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:10,080
depending on the micro environmental

711
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:12,799
cues and that gave you outputs

712
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:15,279
differential outputs for the same cell,

713
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:17,440
same signals but very different outputs

714
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:19,919
because of the mechanics,

715
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,720
And based on this uh what I showed you

716
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:24,159
also is that we can

717
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,799
induce cell state transition because

718
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:28,399
that could be the precursor for

719
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:29,720
understanding cells how they switch into

720
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:32,159
diseases in

721
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:35,279
tissues. And that's that's what we're

722
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:37,679
now looking at with lots of these um

723
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:39,760
tissue based analysis that we're doing.

724
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:42,840
And on the other side, what I showed you

725
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:45,880
is the way that our genomes are

726
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:48,640
packed and its intimate link with

727
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:51,600
biochemistry, complex multi-dimensional

728
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:53,840
biochemical networks. The images of

729
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:56,519
chromatin gives you a fingerprint for

730
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:59,360
that cell state. And that fingerprint is

731
00:31:56,519 --> 00:32:01,519
very, you know, resourceful, valuable

732
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:04,960
because then we can say the health of

733
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:06,720
the cell or disease in any complex uh

734
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,320
environment, right? whether it's

735
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,919
neurodeenerative

736
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:13,600
uh tissues, early developmental

737
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:15,840
programs, differentation programs or

738
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:18,000
disease disease programs, we can then

739
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:20,640
fingerprint cell state transitions with

740
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,840
that. So with that, let me end. I think

741
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:26,240
my time is up. Um let me thank a

742
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:28,559
wonderful set of colleagues uh who come

743
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,720
from very different areas. computer

744
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:33,440
science, cell biology, molecular biology

745
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:36,080
and engineering and physics and a number

746
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:38,880
of scientists that uh that are part of

747
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:40,640
this program and this work that we do is

748
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,039
uh in close collaboration with

749
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:45,120
Caroline's lab here with the broad a

750
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:47,840
number of very talented colleagues in

751
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:50,559
our lab contribute to our ongoing

752
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:52,640
programs as we move forward and I think

753
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:55,919
Shini one of the very talented

754
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:58,000
colleagues of us she will present in

755
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:59,770
this session I think yeah Okay, with

756
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:06,660
that, thank you so

757
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:06,660
[Applause]

758
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:12,960
much. So, I find the idea of actually

759
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:15,039
trying to predict things from blood very

760
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,919
powerful because it's very non-invasive

761
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:20,559
and and and it's sort of grail and I can

762
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:22,080
see how metabolic diseases have a very

763
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:24,880
strong signature because the high

764
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:27,600
metabolic state highly impacts chromatin

765
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:30,640
regulation. But a lot of diseases result

766
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:33,600
in like this massive inflammatory signal

767
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:35,760
that sometimes is, you know, at least I

768
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:38,880
I play with gene expression and single

769
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:40,559
cell expression. It's hard to sort of

770
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,720
dissect the different inflammatory

771
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:46,240
diseases, the inflammation signal is

772
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:48,960
just so overwhelming. So I'm wondering

773
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:51,279
if you begin to see differences or how

774
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:54,559
you would like dissect the different

775
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:56,480
like onslaught of causes of uh

776
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:58,240
inflammatory signals in in your

777
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,320
approach. No, that's a great question.

778
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:03,840
you know, so one of the things that we

779
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:07,679
we wanted to first identify is can we

780
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:10,960
distinguish between um a cancer versus

781
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:12,960
non-cancer another disease right so the

782
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:16,240
reason I say it is that you know uh you

783
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:19,520
get a disease specific secret in the

784
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:22,240
blood right and so the chromatin states

785
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:24,240
alter depending on the signals right so

786
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:26,639
if it is a cancer signal the chromatin

787
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:28,800
state remodel in one particular way

788
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:31,119
versus if it's the neurodeenerative

789
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,119
signal that we're now looking for uh

790
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:35,280
chromatin reorganized in a completely

791
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:38,440
different way in a metabolic disorder.

792
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:41,480
Of course, the output is single cell

793
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:45,679
transparing in immune

794
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:48,800
cells. the the idea that images of

795
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:51,119
chromatin has a powerful fingerprint in

796
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,639
the way that chromatin can alter because

797
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:55,280
you can't alter chromatin in many

798
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:58,000
different ways because you know we only

799
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,680
have a finite type of cell states in the

800
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,240
body. So there only allowed

801
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,839
configuration that chromatin can switch.

802
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:06,640
This what we are now testing that's why

803
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:08,960
this um large scale project is to

804
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,839
fingerprint what are the alert states of

805
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,880
chromatin that it can go

806
00:35:10,839 --> 00:35:16,320
to how can we distinguish between just

807
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:19,599
inflammation inflammatory response

808
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:22,160
versus disease specific responses right

809
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:25,760
and this is an ongoing program any ideas

810
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:28,400
happy to uh get from you but what we can

811
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:31,040
already distinguish is that given that

812
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,640
different secret gives you different

813
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:35,839
chromatin states

814
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:39,040
And it's easy for us to scale up. We can

815
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:40,960
then good get very good stat statistical

816
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:43,040
insights on the chromatin state allowed

817
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:47,200
chromatin states in different context.

818
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:48,440
Right? Whether how early we can detect I

819
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:51,839
don't know at the

820
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:54,160
moment right these are late stage

821
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:57,119
detection that we have shown but we are

822
00:35:54,160 --> 00:36:00,400
hopeful that we should if we get this uh

823
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:02,000
you know healthy donor atlas as a

824
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,480
reference map we should be able to

825
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,760
detect outliers much more easily because

826
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:09,760
a healthy donor atlas will tell us about

827
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:12,160
the variability that can exist in the

828
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:14,880
chromatin state of blood cells depending

829
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:17,599
on all the individuals even 10,000 we

830
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,839
are now trying to do for 10,000 um uh

831
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:22,640
donors I don't think that's enough we

832
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:24,040
need to scale that up more uh so we're

833
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:27,680
in the process

834
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:30,880
of yeah one quick question

835
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:33,480
u just very practical you know there

836
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:36,000
might be others uh

837
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:38,240
competitive you know about marker you

838
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,599
know for the early detection of the

839
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:43,760
breast cancer and I just cross the path

840
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:47,680
from the you

841
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:51,160
clinical research book and my quick

842
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:54,079
question is that did you find the

843
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:57,320
positive predictive value of your

844
00:36:54,079 --> 00:37:01,040
studies and how does it compare to other

845
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:04,079
biomarker whether I should pick your you

846
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:06,320
know uh chromatin structure as a

847
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:08,480
initiate for public health or some other

848
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,960
yeah yeah that's a that's a fair enough

849
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:13,200
question you know the the space is too

850
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,200
large right because early diagnosis is a

851
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,920
big field in the it's billions of

852
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,599
dollars because so important there are

853
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:23,119
very competing technology the most

854
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:26,160
mature technology is this ctna you know

855
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:28,400
disease cells secrete DNA pieces into

856
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:30,839
the blood and the modifications of the

857
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:34,240
DNA pieces in the blood is a powerful

858
00:37:30,839 --> 00:37:36,800
biioarker for disease right there other

859
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:39,839
competing technology exoomes disease

860
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:41,839
cells release small vesicles and

861
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:44,079
proteins inside them there's a lot of

862
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:47,040
mass spec proteomic approaches for

863
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:49,200
detecting exosomes in the in the blood

864
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,960
and circulating disease cells,

865
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,839
circulating tumor cells, circulating

866
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:56,000
disease cells. The other technology is

867
00:37:52,839 --> 00:37:58,320
that what we are suggesting is a

868
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,040
completely orthogonal approach because

869
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:03,200
by the biology of the immune system how

870
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:05,359
sensitive they are we think that the

871
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:08,240
chromatin alterations could be yet

872
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:09,839
another modality and a cheap modality

873
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:12,800
because in the field if you want to

874
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:14,560
detect early I can't take a sequencing

875
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,720
machine or a mass spectrometry machine

876
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:19,359
but I can take my mobile phone if we if

877
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:21,040
we succeed. So now the benchmarking is

878
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:23,920
what we are doing with that class that

879
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:25,599
we are doing. Give us a year or two and

880
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,760
I'll tell you how it competes with other

881
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:29,599
technologies. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah.

882
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,760
Thank you. Thank you Shiva for this

883
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:33,100
wonderful talk. I will hand over to

884
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:36,280
Dora.
