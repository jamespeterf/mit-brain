1
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:10,400
Uh we'll talk about two stories today.

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,320
Uh one in context to cancer diagnostics

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,799
and thinking about how do we enhance and

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,840
improve our ability to detect residual

5
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:20,880
disease, improve therapy selection and

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,720
perhaps even enable early detection uh

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,240
to really supercharge and power the

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,560
bloodbased diagnostics that are now

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,920
emerging in the commercial sector. Uh

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,359
and the second story I'll talk about

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,720
biommanufacturing. And this has been in

12
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,719
the news again over the last few weeks.

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,239
And uh as Natalie mentioned, the

14
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,840
initiative for new manufacturing is

15
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,840
thinking a lot about different

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,280
strategies for how we enable uh

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,719
manufacturing across the United States.

18
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,719
And biology will be an important

19
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:46,559
component of this, something that's been

20
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:48,320
uh heavily uh talked about recently in

21
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,160
Washington as well as other parts of the

22
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,480
country as a tool that could help

23
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,160
empower the bio economy. And so talk a

24
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,840
little bit about a different a different

25
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,199
approach to thinking about production of

26
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:02,960
small uh materials uh in in

27
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:04,640
manufacturing uh that way. Uh I I'll

28
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,760
start up front by just saying uh a lot

29
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,000
of the work that you'll see here has

30
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,920
been funded either through uh research

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,760
awards at the Koch Institute, through

32
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,320
some of our programs like the Frontiers

33
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,640
program or through the Gates Foundation

34
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,960
and DARPA. Um so just get that out of

35
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,640
the way up front.

36
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,960
All right. So let's talk about cancer

37
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,520
diagnostics today. You know, diagnostics

38
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,400
using liquid biopsies is really poised

39
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,880
to transform how we think about care for

40
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,880
patients in cancer. Uh there's been

41
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,520
several ideas in thinking about how do

42
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,240
we detect analytes that we can acquire

43
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,479
from uh blood or from urine or from

44
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,799
other specimens uh that could stand in

45
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:46,079
as a proxy to the types of tissue

46
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:49,920
biopsies that we take uh in uh in kind

47
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:52,240
of standard surgical resections.

48
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,399
And as we think about blood-based

49
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,240
diagnostics, historically, you know,

50
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,680
people have focused on circulating tumor

51
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,520
cells. These are small cells that

52
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,360
dislodge from the tumor and move around,

53
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,240
often thought to be part of how

54
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,079
metastasis occurs. But really over the

55
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,360
last 10 years and you know we've done

56
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,200
work in that space thinking about

57
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,720
sequencing of those to identify cancer

58
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,040
genomes. But really over the last 10

59
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,040
years self-free DNA has become an

60
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,440
analyte that's critically important for

61
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:21,440
being able to identify single nucleotide

62
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:24,000
variations uh insert variations uh and

63
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,800
and and other defects that emerge from

64
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,520
the cancer as a way to detect it for

65
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,360
cancer screening potentially uh for

66
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,280
detecting recurrence. So after you've

67
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,959
had treatment, do I still have cancer is

68
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,360
an important question for patients to be

69
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,800
able to answer. And then ultimately also

70
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,319
how do we pick the right treatment? How

71
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,920
do we know which treatment you're likely

72
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,519
to respond to? Uh really amazing uh and

73
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,840
uh new kinds of inhibitors that have

74
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,160
emerged for kinases and other classes

75
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,160
including some we just heard about. How

76
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,000
do you know if you're right to receive

77
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,800
that treatment? Some of these uh can be

78
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,160
detected from genomic analyses. So it's

79
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,920
with this backdrop and promise that

80
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,599
there's now a you know multi-billion

81
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,720
dollar let's put on the order of $500

82
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:06,560
billion uh market for these types of

83
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:10,400
tests led by companies like Grail and

84
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,080
Exact uh and the Tariff.

85
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,720
When we think about what this looks like

86
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,280
from a patients vantage point there

87
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,840
might be uh materials that are in the

88
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,400
blood that could be used for this type

89
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,560
of monitoring that are present at some

90
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,360
threshold that's easy to detect. If I

91
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,519
have cancer and things are uh in

92
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,959
circulation, you know, that level is

93
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,560
pretty high. But when we start to and we

94
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,799
can see a lot of these on imaging scans,

95
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,280
right? So we do an MRI or a CAT scan,

96
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,599
you can often see these nodules. Maybe

97
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:45,040
you do surgical resection, chemotherapy,

98
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:46,799
adivant therapy, and then those go away

99
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,239
in the imaging scan. But we don't know,

100
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,000
this is sort of the inverse of the

101
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,120
iceberg problem or maybe it's the right

102
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,280
side of the iceberg problem. what the

103
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,959
state of the disease is in that window

104
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,560
where we can't detect it by imaging

105
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,560
scans. And the promise of liquid

106
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,560
biopsies has been to create that noise

107
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,000
floor that's below what you could detect

108
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,439
so that you could see through that

109
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,920
trough to determine if you need

110
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:10,640
additional treatment or to monitor the

111
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,640
state of disease.

112
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,560
The challenge in the field, however, has

113
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,440
been that the sensitivity of these

114
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,280
methods, while they're very good at

115
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,120
capturing information, has been quite

116
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,720
poor. And these are a number of clinical

117
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,440
studies that just kind of highlight this

118
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,600
in different settings uh in early

119
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,280
screening detection and recurrence uh

120
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,280
therapy selection across a couple of

121
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,720
different cancer types. These are not

122
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,919
very good sensitivities. In fact, these

123
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,600
are worse than throwing a dart

124
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:39,440
sometimes, right? Or 50/50 coin flip. Uh

125
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,080
this is really kind of poor sensitivity.

126
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,840
And the reason for this, right, is that

127
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,160
at some level the amount of analyte

128
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,240
that's present is quite low.

129
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,600
And so what a lot of emphasis has been

130
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,759
on over the last uh you know five years

131
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,840
or so has been in thinking about how do

132
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:59,040
we enhance our ability to improve

133
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:01,040
detection from that blood sample. So you

134
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,040
go to the doctor, you take a blood draw,

135
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,120
they isolate the plasma, it goes in a

136
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,960
kit and it gets shipped off somewhere.

137
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,800
And we detect these by next generation

138
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,120
sequencing which as a chemist these are

139
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,440
effectively just molecule counters that

140
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,000
allow you to detect those variations in

141
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,000
the genome that you ascribe back to uh

142
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,840
the traits that you're looking for

143
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,440
mutations that tell you which treatment

144
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,120
to select. And so this is all done uh

145
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,800
using next generation sequencing. So a

146
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,199
lot of effort has been spent in trying

147
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:32,000
to enhance our molecular biology

148
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:34,160
techniques and our sequencing techniques

149
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,080
to be able to improve the sensitivity in

150
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,840
that range.

151
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,000
In fact, one of my former students leads

152
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,759
the Gersonner Center for blood uh for

153
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,080
for cancer diagnostics at the Broad

154
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,160
Institute. uh and he and his team have

155
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,479
actually advanced several of these ideas

156
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,120
uh for enhancing the ability to where

157
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:53,440
they can now measure at the noise floor

158
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,240
of sematic variations within the natural

159
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:59,120
human genome. So this is as low

160
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,960
biologically as you can go

161
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,600
that the technical noise now is

162
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,600
basically zero.

163
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,319
But the problem is is that we are not

164
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:11,199
sampling very much of the total amount

165
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:13,039
of material that's available. So if I

166
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,960
think about what's upstream of that,

167
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:18,160
there's an additional filtration that's

168
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:21,120
occurring. The tumor cells release

169
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,360
cell-free DNA. Some of that has to

170
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,120
traffic into the blood. In the blood, it

171
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,960
may be degraded by a variety of

172
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,919
different mechanisms. Nucleuses that

173
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,400
chew up that cellulfree DNA. Uptake by

174
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,560
macrofasages or cuffer cells in the in

175
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,800
the liver. Uh excretion through the

176
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,319
kidney. All of these are mechanisms for

177
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,560
clearance such that by the time I

178
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,240
actually take that blood draw, I'm

179
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,319
measuring just a fraction of what I

180
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,800
could have seen originally.

181
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,479
And so the challenge is for enhancing

182
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,560
the sensitivity of these, it's not on

183
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,240
the back side. We've effectively solved

184
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,080
that problem where as good as we can do

185
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,240
biologically and molecular biology of

186
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,000
reading out that information. But this

187
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,400
front-end problem of how could we

188
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,160
collect more becomes a real challenge.

189
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,599
You say, well, okay, great. I can go in

190
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,240
and do a surgical resection and get the

191
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:08,160
tumor directly. Yes, in a in a primary

192
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,840
care setting that in in a first in a

193
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,840
first instance that would be usually

194
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,599
what's done. Uh some kind of surgical

195
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,919
resection, but in the context of

196
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,520
metastasis or minimal residual disease

197
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:20,240
settings, you're not going to perform

198
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,000
surgeries to find out that information.

199
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,280
We could hook somebody up to a diialysis

200
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,639
machine, but if you're already sick in

201
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,000
cancer, it's unlikely that you're going

202
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,919
to want to sit there for several hours

203
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,199
to collect all of that material through

204
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:32,160
there. So, we need a different way to

205
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:34,319
think about this problem.

206
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,400
Well, we teach uh chemical engineering

207
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,720
to undergraduates and one of the basic

208
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,360
principles that we teach about is mass

209
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,520
balance equations.

210
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,680
The body is a steady state reactor

211
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:49,120
effectively, right? We eat materials and

212
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:53,360
well, we excrete materials. Tumors are

213
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:55,120
dying and we could take out a blood draw

214
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,800
as an output. The materials are being

215
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,160
degraded at the other side. So from a

216
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,840
steady state balance right we can write

217
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,080
a kinetics of some amount of material is

218
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,080
being generated by the tumor some amount

219
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,319
is being degraded by the liver and by

220
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,639
nucleus activity and so at any given

221
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,879
time in the blood I have a steadystate

222
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,479
concentration of that cell-free DNA of

223
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,080
which a small fraction of that is

224
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:17,120
related to the tumor right a lot of

225
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,039
that's from normal cells and so when we

226
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,400
take a blood draw and you kind of see

227
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,879
here in the cartoon we're

228
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,479
substoastically sampling the molecules

229
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,479
that are in the bloodstream at any given

230
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,319
time.

231
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:32,080
So that means that in that tube of

232
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:34,560
blood, there's a nonzero chance that I

233
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,880
actually never pulled a molecule from

234
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:39,360
the tumor. So I can't measure what I

235
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,800
didn't collect.

236
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,320
But the good news is in chemical

237
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,080
engineering, we also teach how you think

238
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,760
about steady state reactors and how you

239
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,320
balance this. And the best way to do

240
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:51,120
that is to alter the kinetics of in this

241
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:54,080
case generation or degradation of the

242
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,760
material. If I'm a if I'm in an early

243
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,959
detection setting or minimal residual

244
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,120
disease, I don't really know how to

245
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,240
generate more tumor DNA. So I have to

246
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,519
focus on the other side of the problem

247
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,360
of blocking degradation. And so this is

248
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:09,040
really the concept that we thought about

249
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:12,600
in the lab. uh could we provide an agent

250
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,600
that would temporarily

251
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,760
inhibit the degradation of the cell-free

252
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,680
DNA long enough that we could enhance

253
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,959
that concentration in the blood such

254
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,760
that when we take the blood draw the

255
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:25,600
tumor DNA is present so this was the

256
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,519
thought concept right could could we do

257
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:31,519
this could we add an agent that somehow

258
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:33,680
would enhance the I'll call it contrast

259
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,560
of tumor DNA that's present in in the

260
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,560
blood sample that we

261
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,279
So this was a a joint effort uh with one

262
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:44,160
of my colleagues in the uh Koch

263
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:46,320
Institute Sangetta Betia and her team uh

264
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:49,600
my former student Victor Adelinson and

265
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,360
then uh three uh students one from or or

266
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:55,360
scientists from each lab uh Carmen

267
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:58,360
Martin uh Shervin Treezy uh and and

268
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,360
Jeang.

269
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,080
We did this experiment. This is one of

270
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,080
those experiments. This is this is that

271
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,519
fun moment as a PI when you you know you

272
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,959
draw it up on paper and we go yeah look

273
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,080
let's let's let's let's block

274
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,080
degradation. We went and found an

275
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:13,279
antibbody that had anti- doublestranded

276
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:16,240
DNA uh activity. We said okay if we

277
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:18,000
administer it to a mouse could we boost

278
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,440
the amount of cell-free DNA? And you're

279
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,279
sort of expecting when you do this

280
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,959
experiment like and I don't know Jessica

281
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,240
you've done this you're kind of like

282
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,920
hoping that maybe there's a little

283
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,680
difference and you like yeah we should

284
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,000
try it again we should totally do it.

285
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,000
when they came back with this result it

286
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,360
was like okay like there's something

287
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,200
fundamentally going on here that we

288
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,040
should take a look at and this is you

289
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,120
know two orders of magnitude nearly in

290
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,200
additional self-free DNA uh that we were

291
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,000
able to recover in the self-free DNA of

292
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,880
these these animals uh and so if then

293
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,920
you look at the question of the the

294
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:52,399
tumor derived DNA we see a similar boost

295
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,480
in this case it's 19fold uh as a

296
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,720
function concentration you can see there

297
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,200
that we get back of additional DNA so

298
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,519
just By adding an antibbody, injecting

299
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,000
it into the animal uh and then an hour

300
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:06,240
later withdrawing the blood sample, we

301
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,120
get a 19fold increase in this

302
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,519
sensitivity or in this recovery that

303
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,760
translates into sensitivity here where

304
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,480
you can see now looking at tumor derived

305
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,959
marks on the DNA, we're able to enhance

306
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,279
that sensitivity by uh you know more

307
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,560
than fivefold.

308
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:26,920
So we've been able to take something

309
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,920
that was invisible and make it visible.

310
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,800
If I think about this in a clinical

311
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,200
setting, we already have a paradigm for

312
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:36,959
how to think about this translationally.

313
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:39,120
Today, if you go in for an MRI uh scan,

314
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,800
a lot of times about an hour before you

315
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,200
get the imaging done, you'll get a

316
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:46,720
contrast ad contrast agent administered

317
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,399
by IV. And then you go and you do the uh

318
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,959
the scan. And in this case, right, you

319
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,480
can see that uh the the the mass is is

320
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:55,200
highlighted there with the contrast

321
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,279
agent. These blood-based agents that

322
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,320
I've just described offer a similar kind

323
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:02,240
of paradigm. Imagine now, right, you

324
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,079
have minimal residual disease, you've

325
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,320
had your cancer treatment, you're trying

326
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:09,120
to determine am I cancer-free? This is

327
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,440
really important for patients to know.

328
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,680
and you go an hour before you take your

329
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,600
blood test and you get an agent

330
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,600
administered and then you come back an

331
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,160
hour later and give your blood draw to

332
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,000
see if it's there or not. So this is the

333
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:25,360
concept and we spun out a company called

334
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,839
Amplifier uh that uh has uh gotten off

335
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,399
to a fast start. They are over here in

336
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:33,200
Kendall Square at the Bear Collabs. Uh

337
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:36,560
you see the team here. Uh Annie uh

338
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,639
Murphy, former foundation medicine uh

339
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,120
and Eric Wong uh who's worked with

340
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,040
several blood biopsy companies are uh

341
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,040
helping to to move this along. We are

342
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,639
now advancing the lead agents and you

343
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,240
know excitingly some recent data. I

344
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,320
asked them what what I could share and

345
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,839
they said you know this this is really

346
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,680
nice because we often talk about data

347
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,440
reproducibility and and challenges of

348
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,680
these things. uh you know sometimes

349
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,839
these effects you might imagine uh might

350
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,760
not be as real as you expect. Here

351
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,839
they've perfectly replicated the models

352
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,079
that we had uh published in the science

353
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,760
paper previously. Uh they're in the

354
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,839
process of advancing candidates for

355
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:13,040
first in human trials uh sometime in the

356
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:16,079
next year year and a half. Uh so what's

357
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:18,639
really cool about this is that the uh

358
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:20,399
effect size is so large that that first

359
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,480
clinical trial is going to give us some

360
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:25,279
insights into how this actually works in

361
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,839
humans. So as we think about efficacy

362
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:30,560
that that uh statistical difference is

363
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,000
so large that if that holds in humans uh

364
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,320
should translate nicely and so we're

365
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,079
looking at how we then use this uh in

366
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,399
partnership with other diagnostic

367
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:40,320
companies as a front end. We've done and

368
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,320
demonstrated this for cell-free DNA but

369
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,320
the principle applies to many other

370
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,600
analytes as well and could be used for

371
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,760
proteinbased diagnostics and

372
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,000
neurogenerative disease or in other

373
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,560
kinds of autoimmunity infectious disease

374
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,160
potentially. Uh so really excited about

375
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:58,480
where this this could head.

376
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:01,360
I'll transition here

377
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,760
uh to talk about a a different a

378
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,920
different uh technology and and and

379
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,519
principle. And this really has to do

380
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,360
with how do we think about bringing

381
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,560
medicines to patients. So what I've

382
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,399
talked about in the first story is

383
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,399
really about how we think about building

384
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:17,839
agents that can have an influence in in

385
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:19,360
the in in improving cancer diagnostics.

386
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,279
But it doesn't matter how good that

387
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,040
material is or how good any other cancer

388
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:24,399
treatment might be if we can't actually

389
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,839
make it and get it to the patient where

390
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:30,000
they need it. Um this is increasingly

391
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,160
important in this current moment where

392
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,560
geopolitical concerns and other kind

393
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:37,199
external factors are really driving a

394
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:40,880
strong uh sense of nationalization

395
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:42,720
and a a sort of walling off of economies

396
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,800
in various regions. And so the ability

397
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,279
to access things globally, we see this

398
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,680
in the current uh climate with tariffs

399
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,120
are blocking certain free trade. It may

400
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,519
become increasingly important to figure

401
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,240
out ways in which we can make materials

402
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:58,079
in distributed fashion. And so how would

403
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,279
you make medicines as complex as a

404
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:03,199
monoconal antibbody in a setting, you

405
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:05,519
know, like the ones that are shown here,

406
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:07,760
uh either in humanitarian aspects or in

407
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:10,399
thinking about uh rapid response in

408
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,320
emergent situations. uh these are these

409
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,000
are conditions that that uh we don't

410
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,399
have a current solution for how to make

411
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,519
things on on demand.

412
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:21,600
Um a little over 10 years ago, DARPA,

413
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:25,040
the advanced project research agency

414
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,800
here in the US, uh uh we had a chance to

415
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,120
work on a program with them where they

416
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,600
they they asked us, you know, could you

417
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:34,240
make a technology that would help us

418
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,839
manufacture biioharmaceuticals

419
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,279
like the antibbody agent that I just

420
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:41,120
showed you or the ones we heard about in

421
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:45,199
the last talk on demand in 24 hours in a

422
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:48,000
backpack in the field?

423
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:50,079
like all right gauntlet thrown this is a

424
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,079
big challenge because this is the

425
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:54,320
problem today's biio manufacturing looks

426
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:56,480
like this

427
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,560
it's a large plant there's lots of

428
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,160
people inside there's lots of manual

429
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,720
things you can see all the valves the

430
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,800
stainless steel the facility that's

431
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,920
shown there probably costs you know

432
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:11,199
roughly 200 million to2 billion dollars

433
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:12,639
to build and operate it's highly complex

434
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,240
people have to know exactly what they're

435
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:18,000
doing there's a lot of protocols to

436
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,279
follow. It's expensive. The capital is

437
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,440
expensive. The operating costs are

438
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:23,600
expensive. The sustainability cost is

439
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,040
expensive. These antibbody processes are

440
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,680
some of the like least sustainable

441
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:30,240
manufacturing processes on the planet um

442
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:33,120
by several metrics uh including water

443
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,720
use. So, how in the world could you

444
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,639
possibly take something like this and

445
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,480
start to make a backpack that makes

446
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,199
medicine somewhere? That was the

447
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,040
challenge that we were faced with. Um

448
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,800
and what that kind of looks like from a

449
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,800
business perspective or or from a a

450
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,440
value chain perspective is really this.

451
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,800
Today when we manufacture we manufacture

452
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,199
something like the drug substance the

453
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,600
active ingredient uh in a facility

454
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:57,360
somewhere might be centralized uh which

455
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,120
creates a risk. You know if something

456
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,959
happens at that plant you know we we

457
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,120
might be short in supply. This happens

458
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,799
every year for vaccines. Every year

459
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,559
vaccine targets are not met because

460
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:08,319
there's a shortage in certain childhood

461
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,679
vaccines that are that are required

462
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,520
because they're made in centralized

463
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,120
facilities.

464
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,240
We have to package that up and ship it

465
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,520
around the world. You know, we're

466
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,280
shipping a lot of water around the world

467
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,799
all the time. This is in a lot of

468
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,160
industries, but especially true in this

469
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,439
industry. We freeze it down and we ship

470
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,559
it around. So, not only are we shipping

471
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,799
water, but we're shipping it really

472
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:28,240
cold.

473
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:29,600
I spent my sbatical in 2015 at Biogen

474
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,120
and the executive vice president walk by

475
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,960
my desk every day and be like, "Chris,

476
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,440
you're a smart MIT professor. How do I

477
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,559
stop shipping water around the world?" I

478
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,600
don't know. I'm not sure we have the

479
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,679
answer, but we should keep thinking

480
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,360
about this question. What we need to do

481
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,880
is shorten that distance between

482
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,240
manufacturing and patients. And so

483
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,080
that's really at the heart of the

484
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,400
question that we were asked. If you

485
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,480
think about this, this kind of offers an

486
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,880
opportunity to think about microactories

487
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,400
for biology or for biio manufacturing

488
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,720
here where we're shortening that

489
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,320
distance for some medicines like cell

490
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,840
therapies. We know that this is really

491
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,039
important because the cells come out of

492
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,880
the patient, they have to be transformed

493
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,640
and put back in the patient. But there's

494
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,320
really no fundamental reason why we

495
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,160
can't do this for other types of

496
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,679
medicines as well. And what does this

497
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,320
open up? Not only does it shorten that

498
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:14,000
value chain for the producer, but it

499
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,760
also offers the opportunity to think

500
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,280
about more precision medicines, more

501
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,280
medicines that are tailored for rare

502
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,760
diseases. As we're in this current era

503
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:24,400
where AI is generating leads for new

504
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:26,400
proteins all the time, and we're

505
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:30,160
discovering the basis of disease through

506
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:32,080
genomic studies at a rapid pace. Almost

507
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,640
every disease is becoming a rare

508
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,919
disease. And as we do so, we need to

509
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,760
think a little differently about how we

510
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,280
supply. It might not be one large

511
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,440
factory that makes everything for the

512
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:44,160
world's supply, but actually we have a

513
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,880
high volume high mix low volume demand

514
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:49,919
in manufacturing. So while this program

515
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,200
was really focused on um the war fighter

516
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,960
and trying to understand how do we

517
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,679
provide capabilities for for the US

518
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:58,960
military, uh there's really interesting

519
00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:01,919
uh implications today for thinking about

520
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:06,240
this in the context of uh of precision

521
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:07,840
medicine and uh distributed production.

522
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,320
So, we had an opportunity to work on

523
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,919
this. It took us about five years. Um,

524
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,000
we had to unlearn everything that we

525
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,160
knew, right? If you're building

526
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,160
something to go in a backpack, you can't

527
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,000
take everything with you. So, the idea

528
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,200
of doing a fed batch reaction that takes

529
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
several days and then doing your

530
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:26,080
downstream chromatography one step at a

531
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,760
time. You just can't do that. You have

532
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:31,039
to make everything smaller and tighter

533
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,720
and faster. Uh so you can see here the I

534
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,559
I affectionately call it the chewing gum

535
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,559
and duct tape prototype that we built uh

536
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:38,000
in the lab. You can see some standard

537
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,919
parts kind of off the shelf. Most of

538
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,840
those we actually ripped out the guts,

539
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:44,400
rebuilt them, put in new software. Very

540
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:46,160
MIT. In fact, my favorite is the uh TFF

541
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,360
there. The little screen on there, the

542
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,280
software, the company wouldn't let us

543
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,799
actually get into it. So we actually

544
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,559
built a little macro that clicked a

545
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:54,400
button all the time for us. I think it

546
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,160
still does that actually, but um you

547
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,840
know, rewired this entire thing. But you

548
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,960
can see, you know, really small modular

549
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,280
footprint. didn't quite fit in a

550
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,880
backpack but fits on a desk here. Um so

551
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,400
we built several of these and several

552
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,000
innovations in the manufacturing

553
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,320
processes themselves that kind of went

554
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,960
into this. Uh we developed the first in

555
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:13,440
vessel perfusion strategy for microbial

556
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,200
systems uh to be able to allow for a

557
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,039
much smaller footprint operating in

558
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,039
continuous. We actually showed that you

559
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:21,039
could use freeze-dried yeast as an

560
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:23,520
inoculum. So instead of having to do N

561
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:26,320
minus one reactor tanks, instead of

562
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,400
having to uh keep that that cell cold in

563
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,000
the cold chain, we could just use

564
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,320
freeze-dried yeast much like baker's

565
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,080
yeast that you use to cook with, you

566
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,240
could inject those in directly. The

567
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,960
cells would start producing and then on

568
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,640
the downstream side today, most uh

569
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,880
processes on the downstream side, you

570
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,159
you develop one step of purification.

571
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,280
You get to a certain point, then you

572
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,120
develop the next one and then you

573
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,640
develop the next one. uh with Steve

574
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,840
Kramer at Wensler Poly Techchnical

575
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,440
Institute, we actually developed some

576
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,760
new strategies to look at that as a

577
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,039
single unit operation so that we can

578
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,280
operate in a flowthrough mode that

579
00:20:55,039 --> 00:21:00,000
allows for all of the clearance to occur

580
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:02,480
through the set of uh resins that are uh

581
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,159
selected there and then finally a

582
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,679
formulation step to be able to put it in

583
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,679
something to be injection ready. And so

584
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,760
with this system once you start it's

585
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,840
fully automated, hands-free and you can

586
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,520
walk away and it produces cyclical

587
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,159
batches of material coming out on the

588
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,360
back end uh over several days. is I

589
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,159
think the longest we ran it in the lab

590
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,440
was about uh 2 weeks, 3 weeks. Uh the

591
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,880
students at some point said, "Can we

592
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:26,760
just stop feeding it media? It seems

593
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,760
like it's just going to keep going."

594
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,720
Um we made several different products

595
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,760
with it. We made human growth hormone uh

596
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:36,640
interferon uh alpha 2b and then this is

597
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:38,480
GCSF. GCSF is used for cancer treatments

598
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,120
for patients that have low white blood

599
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,880
cell counts. Uh it's also used uh in

600
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,559
radiation treatment. So for medical

601
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,360
countermeasure, it's also very useful

602
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:49,760
and is in the US uh stockpile for

603
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,600
national security. We showed here that

604
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,200
the materials that we made in that

605
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:56,720
prototype that I showed you in a lab,

606
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:59,039
right? Not GMP, not GMP, but those

607
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,360
materials that we made were of the same

608
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:03,679
quality and purity as what Amgen makes

609
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:06,080
as their product, Nupagen. In fact, in

610
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:08,000
uh rat studies down in the bottom there,

611
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,440
uh we showed that uh over repeat dose

612
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,039
toxicology studies that it was

613
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:14,080
equivalent to their material and had the

614
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:16,320
same PK and PD properties. So suggesting

615
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,799
that you know in fairly austere

616
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:21,039
conditions you can make uh very high

617
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:23,120
quality materials.

618
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,799
Uh so DARPA came to us and they said

619
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,799
well this is really fantastic. We love

620
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:29,840
this. Can you make us a GMP version of

621
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:32,559
that system? And we said, "Yeah, that's

622
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:34,400
where the boundary at MIT kind of lies."

623
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,919
You know, GMP takes a lot of

624
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,480
documentation, as you know, quality

625
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:40,240
management. Uh, so we spun out a company

626
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,320
uh that that started to think about this

627
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:46,240
as well. I guess one other point here to

628
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:49,280
make uh is that the platform itself is

629
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,039
platformed. So that same system with

630
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,120
some different conditions of buffers and

631
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:55,919
such can make a range of different

632
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:58,720
molecules proteins all of which that

633
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:01,280
today would require separate facilities.

634
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,720
So one facility many products which is

635
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,080
really important for the use application

636
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,080
here and some of the papers there

637
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,320
highlight the nuances of some of the

638
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,240
learnings in the the the downstream

639
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,080
chromatography in fact to the point

640
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,600
where now we can actually use sequence

641
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,320
information and things like the single

642
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,840
domain antibbody to predict the process

643
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,679
condition. So very early machine

644
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,200
learning kind of ideas of how could we

645
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:24,679
use sequence information to actually

646
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,679
predict process.

647
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,000
Uh so we did spin out a company called

648
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,840
Sunflower and Sunflower has been

649
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,360
advancing this concept at a much uh

650
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:34,080
slightly larger scale. This is a system

651
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:36,640
they call the Dalia unit. Uh the Dalia

652
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,159
is a full endto-end drug substance

653
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,320
production system. You can see sort of

654
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,840
the footprint there. Uh you can't see

655
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,760
the woman standing in the back there in

656
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,840
the in the with the slide here, but uh

657
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:48,640
it would sit like roughly these two

658
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:51,280
tables here on the floor. Uh so very

659
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,720
small footprint um fully automated. So

660
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,919
once you set it up, you can walk away

661
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,159
from it. And then because it's

662
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:58,080
continuous uh and operating under these

663
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:00,640
principles, it's very uh efficient and

664
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:02,080
sustainable in its operations. Uh this

665
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,960
is a picture of what it actually kind of

666
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,799
looks like. Uh so it's uh you can see

667
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,280
they've replicated all of these same

668
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:11,760
protocols and and processes that we ran

669
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:13,279
here. They've also developed a monoconal

670
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,360
antibbody process for those that are

671
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:17,279
kind of afficionados. You know monoconal

672
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,039
antibodies today are a platform process

673
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:21,440
in bioprocessing.

674
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:23,520
They use protein a columns as a common

675
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,120
step to remove the impurities and and to

676
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,720
concentrate it. Uh they've actually

677
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:29,679
shown that they can get rid of that

678
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,960
expensive step and use uh just the same

679
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,960
steps that we've involved in the other

680
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,799
ones. So you can make a very wide range

681
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,120
in the apothecary of different types of

682
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:38,960
products with similar outputs and

683
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,480
materials. Uh they had a chance to run

684
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,480
this actually during uh during the

685
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,039
pandemic. They they used it to produce

686
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,600
that same GCSF that we manufactured at

687
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:50,000
MIT as well as a COVID uh vaccine

688
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,000
subunit in a warehouse. You can see it

689
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,559
there in the background uh in

690
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,360
California. All of it passed all of the

691
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:59,120
USP bioden tests, all of the the quality

692
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,840
attributes that would be sufficient and

693
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,200
necessary to use for clinical purpose.

694
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,600
They didn't use it for that. They didn't

695
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,200
do it under GMP, but the quality metrics

696
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,480
were sufficient. So, because it was

697
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,720
functionally closed and the way it's

698
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,559
automated, you can do it in very very

699
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,480
austere environments. I don't think the

700
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:16,720
regulators are fully ready for this yet,

701
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,880
but uh the ability to manufacture high

702
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:21,520
quality drug substance anywhere uh is is

703
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,880
within reach. um that chewing gum and

704
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,240
duct tape prototype. I thought I'd throw

705
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,840
this one in there, too. This is their

706
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,000
first commercial product. This is the

707
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:30,320
Daisy Pedal. It's just the Profusion

708
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,240
bioreactor, but you can see the design

709
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,679
is now very simple. In fact, it's so

710
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,360
easy that like anybody can do it. We've

711
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,440
had executives that have never been in a

712
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,360
lab come in and start these systems. If

713
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,000
you've ever used a bioreactor, that's a

714
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,520
big accomplishment. Um, also thinking a

715
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,919
lot about user interface. You can see

716
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:48,400
the the the the software that they've

717
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:50,720
built uh is very simple and intuitive to

718
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,159
read out. it's not complex. So they're

719
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,520
uh their their thought here is that this

720
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:55,840
is something that anybody should be able

721
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,520
to access uh these types of production

722
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,960
systems.

723
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,480
When you think about the capacity, the

724
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,159
Dalia unit that I showed you when we

725
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:05,600
scale it up to this this table is about

726
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:07,440
the size or capacity of a pilot plant.

727
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,120
Um, but what that really means is that

728
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,720
one of those units could make enough

729
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:13,840
vaccine doses for all the state of

730
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:17,279
California for SARS KV2 for example

731
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:19,120
or a a cancer drug like Tristamab for

732
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:21,360
countries like uh Colombia and if you

733
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:24,000
scale it up to a few units you could

734
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:26,320
offer a whole country uh capabilities

735
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,840
and coverage in that. So this idea that

736
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,960
we could now distribute production to

737
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,880
parts of the world that don't have it

738
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,200
today, if we overlap a map of where the

739
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,600
cancer or where the co vaccines were

740
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:38,080
deployed and where they were

741
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,679
manufactured, they're almost identical.

742
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,600
And so what it really says is proximity

743
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:43,360
to manufacturing is really important. In

744
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,960
fact, we see in countries that do not

745
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,640
have drug substance manufacturing that

746
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,960
the cost of drugs in those countries is

747
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:52,000
higher. So as we think about

748
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,600
democratization of of medicines uh the

749
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,240
ability to distribute manufacturing is

750
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:58,159
going to be increasingly important and

751
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,400
what you lose in scale you make up for

752
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:02,000
in automation and this I think is a

753
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:05,600
really key learning that the cost

754
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:08,400
modeling to build out you know scale out

755
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:10,640
versus scale up and scale up that's the

756
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,400
the diagonal line as I get larger in

757
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:15,760
volume per year I reduce the cost per

758
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:17,840
gram but actually this uh fixed unit

759
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:20,159
scaling allows for very efficient

760
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:22,080
scaling of cost uh all the way up until

761
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:24,240
you get to those very high volumes. So

762
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:26,880
in intermediate ranges again appropriate

763
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:29,919
for phase uh for early phase development

764
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:32,240
or for uh rare diseases and and and

765
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:35,039
certain indications. Uh this is a really

766
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,640
uh costefficient way to think about uh

767
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:37,840
production.

768
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,440
I'll finish out with just a couple of

769
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,039
thoughts. So we've built these uh

770
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,799
companies based on some of the research

771
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:44,880
we've we had developed here at MIT and

772
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:47,120
spun them out. It's been a super fun

773
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,200
process to get uh students involved in

774
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,880
those uh those those projects as they

775
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,440
leave or or research scientists have

776
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,640
been part of the lab uh kind of uh as

777
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,399
part of that founding team in the

778
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,240
technology transfer. Carmen Martin who I

779
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:59,760
mentioned earlier went to Amplifier. Uh

780
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,760
several folks from my lab went to to

781
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,039
Sunflower. And what we've been doing

782
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,720
since then is really thinking about

783
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:07,840
particularly on this context of

784
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:10,559
production, how do we go faster, better,

785
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:13,360
and how do we do more? So if we have a

786
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:15,120
system that could manufacture anything

787
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:17,679
if the cells produce it, we need to work

788
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,360
on what the cells can produce. And so to

789
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:21,279
that end, we formed the alternative host

790
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:23,679
consortia with uh several bioarm

791
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:26,320
companies uh and continue to operate it

792
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:28,000
with with the the groups that are here

793
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:31,200
um to really think about how do we

794
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,039
engineer the host itself uh and to be

795
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,480
more productive and to be faster? How do

796
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,919
we make a wider range of quality

797
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,000
attributes on the products? How do we

798
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:39,360
think about things like like oillation?

799
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,120
And then one direction that we've been

800
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:43,919
thinking a lot about uh in this

801
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:46,640
consortia as well has been what's the

802
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:48,720
role of computation in it uh today and

803
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:51,200
this I I took from the National Security

804
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:55,120
Commission's report on emerging

805
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:57,520
biotechnology. Uh there's this idea that

806
00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:00,559
we can generate knowledge through AI and

807
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:02,480
computing and biological information.

808
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:04,399
We're seeing the beginnings of this

809
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,840
right with AI generated proteins and

810
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,960
alpha fold and some of the things that

811
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,960
are happening there. What we're still

812
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,039
not very good at is scaling up all of

813
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:14,000
that knowledge from the bench into

814
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:16,640
production. Uh but as we think about the

815
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,360
ability to read out biology and to build

816
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,960
biology, can we use computation to help

817
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,159
inform strategies for doing these

818
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,559
things? And if we're thinking about

819
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:26,159
distributed models, the ability to go

820
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:28,240
from plate to reactor is a really

821
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,919
critical step because we may not need to

822
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,240
go to 100,000 liters for some of these

823
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:34,720
things. We can simply scale out. And so

824
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:37,279
could we go from sequence to production

825
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,559
in a very very short time frame. Uh one

826
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:40,399
of the things that the consorcia has

827
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:42,559
started to think about is how do we

828
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:44,480
build the tools to do this? I mentioned

829
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:45,840
uh sequence to process predictions. This

830
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,080
is something that we had done a few

831
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,919
years ago in the context of nanobodies.

832
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,679
Uh more recently we've developed

833
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:54,000
autoenccoder models to be able to do

834
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:56,080
codon optimization in our organism of

835
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,159
choice here that uh consistently

836
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:00,559
outperform the the the commercial

837
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:02,799
benchmarks. Uh it's interesting the

838
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:05,520
models are learning features of the

839
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:07,039
biology that you would sort of I don't

840
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,799
know it took biologists a long time to

841
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:10,960
learn things like cy regulatory elements

842
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:12,960
and aspects of how it organizes genes in

843
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,799
the genome in the codons that it's using

844
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,880
it's learning that language through the

845
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:19,279
training and is replicating that in the

846
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,559
types of proteins that it optimizes. Uh

847
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:22,000
so I think we think a lot of times that

848
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:23,520
these are just black boxes but actually

849
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,720
when you kind of peek inside to see what

850
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,720
it's understanding it's quite

851
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,840
interesting. Um and then something else

852
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,360
that we're doing that's I think really

853
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,039
important for bop process is thinking

854
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:33,039
about active learning or reinforcement

855
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:35,919
learning strategies to optimize process

856
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:37,840
development. Um today most people in

857
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:39,600
boprocessing use statistical design of

858
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,520
experiments. These sort of assume

859
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,200
quadratic or linear relationships and

860
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,279
you typically test certain endpoints and

861
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:48,240
kind of make these response surfaces.

862
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:50,320
But we know biology is not really linear

863
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,559
and so how do we kind of map that out in

864
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,840
a more efficient way? uh these active

865
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,440
learning strategies using things like

866
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:57,120
Gaussian process models and basing

867
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:59,679
optimizers is a really efficient way to

868
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,600
do this. We're using this uh in the lab

869
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:03,279
for biorocessing. We've actually also

870
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,600
started to use this as a strategy to

871
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:07,360
think about uh optimizing doses of

872
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,520
imunotherapies. So I think it's a a

873
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:11,919
general strategy that is we think about

874
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:14,559
the kind of data we need to use for the

875
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:15,840
right AI tools. This isn't simply

876
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:17,440
scraping the literature for everything

877
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,200
in biology. We don't have all that

878
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,559
fundamental knowledge. So how do we

879
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,120
generate it? the most efficient way to

880
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:26,159
generate is through uh using it as a

881
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:27,600
tool to help guide the experiments.

882
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,440
I'll stop here and I'll just kind of

883
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,120
make this last point uh thinking about

884
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:35,559
these things is you know we often talk

885
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:35,559
about the

886
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:42,080
eras of industrial revolutions and you

887
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:43,440
know Steve Jobs said uh that he thought

888
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:46,960
that the most important technology of

889
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:49,200
the 21st century would be biotechnology.

890
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:51,440
Presently, if you've read the news, we

891
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,519
all think it's AI,

892
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,600
but actually AI is the opportunity to

893
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:57,120
unlock the biology. There's this idea of

894
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,559
abundance economics that's sometimes

895
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,320
thrown around politically, but the

896
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:01,600
original concept of abundance economics

897
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,679
is that you take things that are very

898
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,440
inexpensive and you spend those

899
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:08,000
resources to do things that are

900
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,519
expensive or hard. And so if we think

901
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,360
about like the industrial revolution,

902
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:13,440
the ability to make things by physical

903
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:16,480
means that led to the ability to make

904
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:18,000
things like uh chips, semiconductors,

905
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,600
the lasers, a little bit of physics

906
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,440
thrown in there too, but the ability to

907
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,960
make things led to be able to make

908
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,600
hardware

909
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,760
chips, computers. With computers, we can

910
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:30,559
now do computation. And we're doing AI,

911
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:32,399
we're doing ML. Like these are great,

912
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:34,799
but actually AI and ML are getting

913
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:36,399
cheaper and cheaper. Now we can spend

914
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:38,399
that resource to ask us how to unlock

915
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:39,840
biology and this is I think really where

916
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,960
the opportunity lies and all the things

917
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,039
that we've talked about here and kind of

918
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,559
what the next stage looks like in the

919
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:46,559
initiative for new manufacturing. We're

920
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:48,320
thinking a lot about this interface how

921
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:50,480
do we relate these two things AI and

922
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:53,360
automation with outcomes particularly in

923
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,440
biio manufacturing uh and other sectors.

924
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,880
Uh so I'll stop here happy to take any

925
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,080
questions if there are any. Uh but

926
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,480
thanks for your time and attention and

927
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:03,480
thanks for your patience with the AV

928
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,480
setup.

929
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,440
We'll start questioning from here.

930
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:15,279
>> Hi. Um, I was just wondering how in like

931
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,760
the backpack you guys are dealing with

932
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:19,760
wholesale protein detection. Is that I

933
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:21,679
know you touched on like regulatory and

934
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:24,159
like process control, but

935
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:26,399
>> yeah. Yeah, awesome question. Um, so, so

936
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:28,960
two things. Um, we didn't build into the

937
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:30,480
system, uh, the quality release

938
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,000
analytics. There's ways to sort of

939
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,080
automate that and we've kind of mapped

940
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,519
out that actually for for drug substance

941
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,360
release you could probably get away with

942
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:39,760
five

943
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:41,519
I'll call it pieces of kit to be able to

944
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,840
measure attributes that are relevant to

945
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:46,480
to to the molecule and those can all be

946
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:48,080
automated. So we didn't do that as part

947
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,120
of the the work here but you know I

948
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,519
think there's solutions for thinking

949
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,880
about that. That's the technical answer.

950
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:54,720
The other answer the more innovative

951
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,480
answer is to think about how do you not

952
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,960
have host cell proteins in the first

953
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,559
place. So one of the advantages of the

954
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,399
system that we chose here, so we we

955
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:03,919
chose not to use mamalian cells. We use

956
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:05,519
microbial cells. We use yeast in

957
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:06,799
particular. And mamalian cells as you

958
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,399
may know, right, are very hard to kind

959
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:10,960
of keep alive. They also make a lot of

960
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:13,440
host cell proteins. So for your protein,

961
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:16,079
there's 2,000 other HCPs in there. And

962
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:18,079
so if you ever look at a CHO process,

963
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:19,200
the impur, like we talk about the titers

964
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:22,240
of the product, but actually the

965
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:24,879
impurity profile is quite large as well.

966
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:26,800
For yeast, they're like 70 to 80% clean

967
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:28,879
coming out of the bioreactor. And so

968
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,480
you're really just doing polishing. On

969
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:32,159
top of that, we've out now mapped out

970
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,520
through the whole genome non-essential

971
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,359
genes. And so you can go in and start

972
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,040
knocking out serrone genes that are bad

973
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:38,480
actors. And so you can kind of clean it

974
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,399
up to a point where like maybe there

975
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,320
aren't so many or maybe we just have one

976
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:43,839
or two steps to be able to clear it.

977
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,440
Ultimately, you know, when you think

978
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:47,200
about distributed manufacturing, the

979
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,440
other opportunity is to collect data to

980
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,960
show over time the relationship between

981
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,320
process conditions and quality

982
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,839
attributes. And so as we think about

983
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,159
things like real-time release with the

984
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:57,599
right data sets at scale, you can start

985
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,359
to really think about how you truly

986
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:03,359
enable that in ways that we can't today.

987
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:07,480
So thanks for the question.

988
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:07,480
>> Any other questions for Chris?

989
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,560
>> Very interesting cases here. Uh for our

990
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:16,720
question about uh the the yeast you use

991
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:19,520
uh based on the case study, many of them

992
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:21,680
are are ye. So I uh want to understand

993
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,599
if you want to focus on that or did you

994
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:26,960
want to expand your application to

995
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:29,599
mleium sales like cho or hexonfree?

996
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,440
>> Yeah. So we're really interested in uh

997
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:34,320
thinking about how do we reduce the cost

998
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:36,320
of manufacturing and the biggest lever

999
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,960
and part of the learning that I actually

1000
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,640
was able to to to to take away from my

1001
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,079
time at Biogen where they asked me this

1002
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:45,599
question. They said we want to go 10x

1003
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:47,760
higher in yield and 10x lower in cost.

1004
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:49,119
The best lever for this is the biology.

1005
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:53,119
And if you look today, there's no

1006
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:54,960
proteins uh you know at the global scale

1007
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:58,640
that are produced in mamalian cells

1008
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:00,079
after you get past sort of insulin,

1009
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,599
right? So insulin is probably the

1010
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:03,200
biggest protein that we make at super

1011
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:04,640
large scale that's not in a mamalian

1012
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,079
cell. Everything else like monoconal

1013
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,520
antibodies is made in a mamleian cell.

1014
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:10,079
So we're really focused on how do we use

1015
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:13,359
alternative hosts and we're not wedded

1016
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:15,040
to yeast per se. uh fungi, bacteria may

1017
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:16,560
also provide certain advantages for

1018
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,480
certain kinds of proteins, but we need

1019
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:20,960
to learn how to intensify processes

1020
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:23,920
through the biology that mamalian cells

1021
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:25,359
can't offer.

1022
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,920
>> Yeah, that makes sense. And I can see

1023
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:30,240
there's uh quite quite some different

1024
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,400
strategy we can use to intensify that

1025
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:34,079
even with the mamium process.

1026
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,280
>> The other secret of so we talked about

1027
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:36,800
the host cell protein, but the other

1028
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,240
secret of microbial systems is they go

1029
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:42,480
faster. So we actually had a student

1030
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:45,200
that did a a internship at Amgen and

1031
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:48,560
showed that on a cost basis you could

1032
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:53,200
meet CHO cost targets in a fed batch

1033
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:54,160
process using yeast at half the tighters

1034
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:57,119
because you're going through the

1035
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:59,520
facility that much faster. So we need to

1036
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:01,680
remember time as an important integral

1037
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:04,720
in our estimates of productivity not

1038
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:06,320
just tighter.

1039
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:09,320
I think we have time for one more

1040
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,320
question.

1041
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:14,720
Otherwise, thank you Chris for

1042
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:14,720
>> Thank you.
