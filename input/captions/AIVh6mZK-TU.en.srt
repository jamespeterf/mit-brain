um K I'm very happy to be the last

34
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,080
speaker of today I heard that's an honor

35
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:33,959
to be the last speaker and I'm very

36
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,519
happy to be doing that uh so today I'm

37
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:38,640
going to tell you about innovating

38
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:41,680
materials and chemistry for the green uh

39
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,440
transition I'm going to start uh this by

40
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:48,560
telling you a story uh the story starts

41
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:51,440
in West Africa Mali so in Mali in West

42
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,280
Africa in the 1980s the locals were

43
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,920
looking for underground water it turns

44
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:59,440
out at that side there was a rock that

45
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:02,120
has been reacting with the with water

46
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:05,200
for God knows how long converting the

47
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:07,920
water to hydrogen and this guy who has

48
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,640
been who are digging the the well he was

49
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,720
smoking while he was digging not knowing

50
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:16,159
that there's hydrogen underneath his

51
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:18,400
feet and there was a boom an explosion

52
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:22,519
that took his life of course this is a

53
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,760
very sad story but this incident where

54
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:27,120
where later on people went back to this

55
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:30,120
site to identify that indeed there has

56
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,280
been hydrogen production from this inent

57
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,439
we learn two things at least I take two

58
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,159
takeaways from this incident the first

59
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:39,840
one is the Earth can be source of

60
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:42,920
hydrogen and the second one is the Earth

61
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,400
can be a factory to make clean

62
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:47,000
fuels so as you know there are several

63
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,560
ways in which we have been producing

64
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,360
hydrogen the most convictional one is

65
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:55,000
the black hydrogen where we are

66
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,599
converting methane to CO2 and hydrogen

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,319
this has been the method of making

68
00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:01,599
hydrogen for the last 100 and more years

69
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:04,480
and in the last few decades there has

70
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:07,280
been emerging ways of replacing this

71
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,959
carbon intensive method one by putting

72
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,799
back the CO2 into the sub surface

73
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:15,480
another one by doing what's called Green

74
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:18,280
hydrogen where you are using wind or

75
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:20,880
solar energy to break water into

76
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:23,199
hydrogen but the UN emerging you know

77
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,639
form of hydrogen production is called

78
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:29,120
geological hydrogen and this is what

79
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:31,440
discovered in Mali so uh if you compare

80
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,919
the CO2 emission and the cost of this

81
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,600
form of hydrogens you can see that the

82
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,759
gray hydrogen which is the incumbent

83
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,639
method for making hydrogen is very high

84
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:43,240
in CO2 emission but very low cost

85
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:45,160
however the GRE hydrogen has a lower CO2

86
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:48,280
emission is very very expensive we're

87
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:50,880
comparing a $7 per kilogram of hydrogen

88
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:53,440
with a $2 per kilam of hydrogen so we

89
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,680
have a huge challenge to bring this cost

90
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:59,240
to be competitive with the incumbent

91
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:02,440
method however the geoh hydrogen is

92
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:04,680
bothos low in coast and low in also CO2

93
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:09,680
emission that's why it's a very you know

94
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:13,160
a promising Pathways to making hydrogen

95
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:16,000
and if you look into how this is

96
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:18,800
produced it TS out that this rocks must

97
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,080
contain iron the iron in The Rock has is

98
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,600
a one that interact with the water where

99
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:25,520
the iron is oxidized while the water is

100
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,639
reduced to from hydrogen so basically

101
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:32,240
you are forming a rest rest while you

102
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:34,160
are converting H2O to H2 and if you do

103
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,039
back of the envelope calculation to

104
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,880
quantify how much of iron you have in

105
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:41,000
the subsurface that is accessible to you

106
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,400
know the surface of the Earth you found

107
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,039
out that there is in a hydrogen that

108
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:48,400
will supply all our energy needs whether

109
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:50,840
it's Transportation industry or

110
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:54,120
residential for the next

111
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:56,080
250,000 years of course you know being

112
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:59,160
able to extract this will be challenging

113
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,639
by itself but the promise is there and

114
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,840
there are two ways in which we can

115
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,479
obtain this hydrogen the first one is

116
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:07,639
was what we call the passive one this is

117
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:09,440
similar to doing oil and gas exploration

118
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:13,800
where you explore where you have

119
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:15,919
hydrogen you go there and exploit it and

120
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,759
this way you can produce up to 20

121
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,400
million of hydrogen per year the other

122
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:22,240
one which I will discuss more in a few

123
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,000
seconds is called stimulation where you

124
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,280
don't depend on the Earth but rather you

125
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,319
stimulate this

126
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,520
reaction as a result this from hydrogen

127
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,560
is called the new Green because of the

128
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,960
low Co emission and also the the low

129
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,720
cost of its

130
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,720
nature so the passive hydrogen the one

131
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:42,240
where you explore and you know extract

132
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:45,240
from the subsurface it's it's now almost

133
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,520
an emerging and a m maturing sector

134
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,720
where we have a lot of startups all over

135
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,319
Europe us and Australia trying to

136
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,400
extract this hydrogen and next time you

137
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,759
are on a plane if you are looking down

138
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,440
in the Jung underneath the plane if

139
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:00,440
there's a jungle and if there is like a

140
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,840
circle in the jungle that might be a

141
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,759
region where we have hydrogen because

142
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,280
that area is not favorable for the

143
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,360
growth of

144
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,960
trees but what is interesting for me and

145
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,160
what my lab works on is called

146
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:16,199
stimulation in this case what the

147
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:18,960
technology will involve the following so

148
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:21,120
you'll have two bore holes where in the

149
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,199
first bore hole you inject water and

150
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,000
catalyst so in the passive one you

151
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,919
depend on the earth to do everything for

152
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,280
you but in this case you only look for

153
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,800
where the rock is and once you know

154
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,639
where it it is you with with the first B

155
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:37,160
hole you inject a water a catalyst or a

156
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:40,160
pH that will stimulate the

157
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:42,199
reaction produce the hydrogen and you

158
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,800
can collect the hydrogen with the

159
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:46,199
X2 that's what we call the stimulated

160
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,520
hydrogen

161
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:50,960
production so this system though hasn't

162
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,440
been explored for a long time we know

163
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,520
about the passive one but this the

164
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:57,639
stimulation is a very New Concept and

165
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,960
the reaction by itself is very very slow

166
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:02,039
in rate and very low in yield it's a

167
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:05,599
geological reaction that takes

168
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:07,520
geological time scales so what you want

169
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,680
want to do is to find ways in which we

170
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,680
can optimize the reaction parameters to

171
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,240
increase the yield and the rate to be

172
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,280
economically feasible so in my lab we

173
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,080
approach this challenge in three

174
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,400
different ways at different LS scale in

175
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,599
the atomic lenss scale we're trying to

176
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,919
understand what is happening at the rock

177
00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:28,039
water interface knowing the mechanism

178
00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:30,479
will allow you to control the reaction

179
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:32,680
kinetics and thermodynamics we also want

180
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,440
to know what happen to the rock it turns

181
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,200
out that the rock expanding volume

182
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,440
during this reaction leading to some

183
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,360
cracking what we call chem mechanics

184
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,440
chemically induced mechanics so we're

185
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:44,720
trying to apply some Advanced x-ray

186
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,880
techniques to understand the phase

187
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,279
transition and the mechanics of this

188
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,720
rock uh reacting with the water and

189
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:53,360
finally we have a customade reactors

190
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:56,160
which are a very high in temperature and

191
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,600
a very high pressure that simulate the

192
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,399
subsurface heat pressure allowing us to

193
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,040
manipulate physical and chemical

194
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:07,600
parameters to optimize this reaction

195
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:09,880
yield and reaction rate so in the lab we

196
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,760
you know collected rocks from different

197
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:14,040
parts of the US from California from

198
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,440
Oregon uh from Minnesota and so on and

199
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,880
so forth and within our reactors that

200
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,040
simulate the subsurface heat and

201
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,680
pressure we try to see how can we

202
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:25,000
increase the reaction kinetics and as

203
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:27,120
you can see in the black curve is what

204
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,880
happens when we just have The Rock in

205
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,440
the water with no optimization and the

206
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,640
y- axis is the amount of hydrogen you

207
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,200
are producing per time you can see that

208
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:37,399
in the black case where you don't have

209
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,440
any optimization you can't wait for

210
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:42,600
hours days even years and there's no

211
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:45,079
almost hydrogen production again this is

212
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:47,880
a geological reaction taking geological

213
00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:49,920
time scale however if you optimize this

214
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:52,120
reaction by adding some Catalyst you can

215
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:56,200
see you can enhance the reaction rate by

216
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:58,320
almost 300 times if not more and this

217
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:00,399
production rate and production yield is

218
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,680
economically feasible if it scale up

219
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,680
toward this

220
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,600
production so this is very interesting

221
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,399
one and we have the record rate right

222
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,120
now for this production of hydrogen from

223
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:12,720
the Rocks but we went on and expanded

224
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:14,560
this concept where we asked okay in the

225
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,160
previous case we trying to convert water

226
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,880
to hydrogen but now can I generalize

227
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:23,200
generalize this reaction and take any

228
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:26,839
molecule X and convert it to Y where Y

229
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:29,399
is a economically valuable chemical to

230
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:32,040
begin with we look into ammonia for for

231
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:34,120
two reasons the first one is hydrogen as

232
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,959
a very small molecule as you know and

233
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,800
even if you make it in the subsurface it

234
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:41,360
might be very challenging to be able to

235
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:42,760
collect it store it and transport it and

236
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,800
it's very very also expensive to

237
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,880
transport and there's no infrastructure

238
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:50,519
to be able to transport hyrogen except

239
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:52,839
you are near o refinary sites the second

240
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:54,240
problem we're trying to see is you know

241
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:58,079
ammonia by

242
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:00,079
itself as a very important chemical and

243
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:02,440
so the goal therefore is can we actually

244
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:05,639
tune this reaction mechanism by which

245
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:08,600
now we want to make ammonia from water

246
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:11,000
and a nitrogen source that can be N2

247
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,320
from Air it can be also

248
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,720
nitrate and like I was saying ammonia is

249
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:18,320
the most produced chemical in the world

250
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,440
it's also the highest CO2 emitter even

251
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,240
though we know amonia to be very

252
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,160
essential for fertilizers now there are

253
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:26,240
emerging ways in which we are trying to

254
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,760
use ammonia to run turbines and engines

255
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,320
for application in industry and

256
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,600
transportation so this growth is

257
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,600
actually expected to be two by two times

258
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,040
or three times more production in the

259
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,519
next couple of

260
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:41,440
decades and the incumbent way to make

261
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:43,639
ammonia as you know SCH Hab and if you

262
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,920
look at this reaction what we have is we

263
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:48,200
have N2 plus

264
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:51,600
hydrogen at a very high heat and high

265
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:55,360
pressure to make ammonia surprisingly

266
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:57,720
the 80% of the CO2 production from Hab

267
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,920
bush is not coming from burning fossil

268
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:02,320
fuels to actually power the

269
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,959
reaction rather is coming from the

270
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:07,279
hydrogen we are using which is produced

271
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:10,040
by STEM reforming which also by itself

272
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:11,760
is a carbon intesting process so now if

273
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:14,240
I actually find a way in which I can

274
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,600
supply hydrogen to this reaction by

275
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,920
using geoh hydrogen that has a low

276
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:21,519
emission then I might be able to solve

277
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:25,480
this 80% dependency of the CO2 coming

278
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,600
from the hydrogen in addition if you dig

279
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:29,880
in the

280
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:32,560
subsurface the Earth is also hot it also

281
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:34,760
have high pressure and this is a profile

282
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,959
showing you how the pressure and

283
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:41,000
temperature is changing as you dig into

284
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:43,440
the subsurface so maybe maybe the Earth

285
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,560
can also provide this required heat and

286
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,839
pressure not only I can have a geoh

287
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:51,720
hydrogen as a clean form of hydrogen but

288
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:53,240
maybe I can also use Earth as a factory

289
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,320
to supply The energy needed for this

290
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:58,720
reaction and that was the high moment

291
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:01,120
for me about a year and a half ago so we

292
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,880
went on file pent and then we to the lab

293
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,639
to see if it actually works so the idea

294
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:09,240
is the following so again you have a two

295
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:12,120
ble system and the first B holes you

296
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:15,040
will inject a water and an nitrogen

297
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:17,000
Source along with a catalyst or a pH or

298
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:21,040
atives that will increase the reaction

299
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,279
kinetics and yield once you inject it

300
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,279
you will have reaction with the Rog

301
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,720
where you from the ammonia and in the

302
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:29,120
second wh you collect ammonia and once

303
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,399
you do that you have a separation system

304
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,360
system that will provide the ammonia

305
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:36,920
ready for transportation for a place for

306
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:39,199
use for a place in demand and as you

307
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:42,000
know ammonia is easier to lufy it's

308
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:45,079
easier to transport and the us only we

309
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,680
have about 5,000 miles of ammonia

310
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:49,720
transporting pipelines and almost

311
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,480
nonexistence for hydrogen unless you go

312
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:55,240
to Gul of Mexico or Gul of America

313
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,759
depending on how you call it and um and

314
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:01,199
also uh we have about 10,000

315
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:03,759
terminals in the the US to transport

316
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:05,639
also import ammonia in the future we

317
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:09,079
might also export to other world from

318
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:11,040
the US so it's a very mature technology

319
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:13,600
we also have a community market to

320
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,839
exchange ammonia but almost n existance

321
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,320
for also for hydrogen and this is why we

322
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:20,839
believe that ammonia is a NM solution

323
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,279
compared to hydrogen for for the because

324
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:26,399
of this maturity in all

325
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:28,720
sectors so this is the result so again

326
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:31,519
we have the Rocks we injected the water

327
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:34,279
Plus source of nitrogen and we see a

328
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:36,360
clear NMR nuclear magnetic resonance

329
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:38,839
Spectra showing that we are indeed

330
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,560
forming ammonia from The Rock and I

331
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:42,959
collaborated with people who are expert

332
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:46,000
in oil and gas who actually know how to

333
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:49,000
D operate and in fact this the scale up

334
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,800
requires basically existing mature oil

335
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,360
and gas techniques and we calculated

336
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,120
what would be the cost of producing

337
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,440
ammonia from this method if you take

338
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:00,240
into account the cost of the drilling

339
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,880
the operation CeX Opex but also the cost

340
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,000
of water Catalyst and source of nitrogen

341
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:08,199
we found out that the cost of production

342
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,880
of ammonia is actually comparable with

343
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:12,440
Hab Bush as you see on this table so

344
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,120
what you see in the first one is Hab

345
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:16,560
Bush about 4400 per ton that is before

346
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,839
the Ukraine Russia War but right now

347
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:22,800
it's about $700 per T per ton and our

348
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:26,079
estimation is is is is is is competitive

349
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:28,360
if not cheaper to am H bush process in

350
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:30,440
addition the biggest win we have is that

351
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:32,120
there's almost no CO2 emission except

352
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,880
the CO2 you'll be emitting when you are

353
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,959
Drilling and also when you are

354
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:39,000
separating the fluid as you col after

355
00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:41,199
you collect it so this work is now

356
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,959
published in June just two days ago in

357
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,600
fact you are the this is the first time

358
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,120
you know sharing the work so I'm very

359
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,160
happy to to be here to share the work

360
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:50,880
with you after the work is published so

361
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:53,040
you can go to the Jew um uh jeel Jewel

362
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,440
journal to look at the paper and also we

363
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:58,440
have a lot of uh you know uh press

364
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:01,399
coverage um and uh that you can learn

365
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:03,440
learn about about this technology so now

366
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:05,680
we have demon this idea in the lab the

367
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,399
next step is to see if you can actually

368
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,759
commercialize it and scale it and to see

369
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:12,199
if actually works so for this I

370
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:14,240
co-founded a company called Addis energy

371
00:16:12,199 --> 00:16:16,680
joined by you know seasoned oil and gas

372
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,839
expert Michael and Charlie and also my

373
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,680
colleague atmin Chang who who is a seral

374
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:23,000
entrepreneur so we have you know you

375
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,560
know we have raised capital from arpa

376
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,560
from the venture capitalist we have a

377
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,600
lab space in the Boston area and the

378
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,279
next year we're trying to acquire land

379
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,880
and then do the first um pilot scale for

380
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:35,319
this

381
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,639
technology so now I told you so far I

382
00:16:35,319 --> 00:16:39,399
have been telling you about hydrogen and

383
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,759
ammonia and these are chemicals and

384
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:43,279
which they allow you to store energy for

385
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:46,040
a long long time and therefore they are

386
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:47,639
called you know long dur energy storage

387
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,720
what I'm going to do in the the last you

388
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:53,480
know few minutes of today is are the

389
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:55,519
technologies that are valuable for Mid

390
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,839
and shortterm energy storage compared to

391
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:01,000
the chemicals and this is namely

392
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:03,440
batteries so in my group along with you

393
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,880
know creating new ways of making

394
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,799
chemicals we also looking into making

395
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:10,600
new

396
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:14,039
batteries um that can be useful for Mid

397
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:16,839
to shortterm uh duration particularly

398
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:19,160
we're trying to work on high capacity

399
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:21,679
high high energy density sodium ion

400
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:23,839
batteries made from abundant materials

401
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,600
the question is why sodium batteries

402
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,919
right because right now we have a very

403
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:30,559
much technology L batteries that we are

404
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:33,160
enjoying the benefit of off here here

405
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:36,320
are the different reasons why S battery

406
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:39,600
the first one is the the material cost

407
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:41,679
is very very cheap so the cost of

408
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,799
materials for sodium battery is about

409
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:48,919
$40 per kilowatt hour however it's about

410
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:52,760
$100 per Kow hour F batteries in

411
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:56,559
addition you can use sodium manganes and

412
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:59,440
iron as compared to lithium Nik Cobalt

413
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:02,799
which are critical minerals which we

414
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:05,280
have significant supply chain constraint

415
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:08,120
so we can solve this problems of supply

416
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,960
chain but also making this environmental

417
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:12,840
sustainable elements than the lithium

418
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:15,440
cobal and the N by using sodium manganes

419
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:17,799
and IR for a given lithium mine there's

420
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,240
about thousand times more sodium so

421
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:22,480
sodium is very very abund for example we

422
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,919
can use aloni versus copper as current

423
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,760
collector and another benefit of the

424
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:28,919
cost and also

425
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:32,039
sustainability you can operate them in

426
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:33,520
extreme cold condition much better than

427
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:36,679
batteries so if you want to drive your

428
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:38,320
car in Siberia or or Canada it's easier

429
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:41,440
to do that in with sodium than the

430
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:43,280
lithium batteries and finally fast

431
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,480
charging is much easier to do with

432
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:48,120
sodium than the lithium

433
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:50,400
batteries so the goal is to actually mat

434
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:53,120
the technology toward this having

435
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,840
competitive battery that with lith

436
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:59,400
batteries which are cheaper in cost but

437
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:03,000
also made from abundant materials

438
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:04,760
and here is you know on the top um left

439
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,200
you are seeing the cost of lithium and

440
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:08,360
sodium as you can see the lithium cost

441
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,760
is growing

442
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:12,240
exponentially to look at the sodium cost

443
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,960
you have to squint your ice because very

444
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,960
very very small on the left side on the

445
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,240
right side you can see that right now

446
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:22,760
our phones and cars are filled with Nik

447
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:25,960
and Cobalt however Nik and Cobalt are

448
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:28,919
less abundant more expensive compared to

449
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:33,640
manganes and iron which are the opposite

450
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:36,880
and finally unlike other in upcoming uh

451
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:39,159
battery technologies St batteries

452
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,640
actually can be scaled up by using

453
00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:43,960
lithium battery scal technology so

454
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:46,480
there's no reinvention of the wheel

455
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:49,159
toward the scale up the the current

456
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:52,000
scale up process can be adapted for

457
00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:56,080
sodium ion batteries unlike other ones

458
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,039
which require innovation of new scale

459
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:01,600
Technologies however if you look at the

460
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:03,320
cost of a given S battery most of the

461
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,440
cost is coming from the cathode so as

462
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,720
you know in the battery you have the

463
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,799
cathode you have the anode and you have

464
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,240
electrolyte are the three parts of the

465
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:14,080
the bodyy material the most expensive

466
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:16,799
one is a cathode therefore innovations

467
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:19,280
that will make S battery to be

468
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:21,480
competitive should come from development

469
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,120
of C materials they are the most

470
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,000
expensive one and the most challenging

471
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,919
one to

472
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,520
address and so far there are three class

473
00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:31,960
of materials we have been studying in

474
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:35,240
the field toward this you know making a

475
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:36,679
cut material this include layer oxide

476
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:40,440
very similar to what we have been using

477
00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:43,120
lium batteries Persian blue analog and

478
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:45,360
poly anons here you can compare the

479
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:48,200
energy density both the volume and the

480
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:50,840
gr gram based energy density of the

481
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:52,960
three class of materials you can see

482
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:55,799
that the layered oxides have the highest

483
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,880
energy density compared to pan blue or

484
00:20:55,799 --> 00:21:00,400
polyon and therefore if you want to

485
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:03,000
develop battery to be competitive with

486
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:05,799
the batteries we have to you know

487
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,240
develop one based on lexide in my

488
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:11,840
opinion compared to the PBA or the poly

489
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:14,840
anal if you look at the current you know

490
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,960
landscape for sodum B commercialization

491
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,480
like I was saying you know this is a

492
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,480
very upcoming technology we don't have

493
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,720
any I guess maybe there's one giga

494
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:26,360
Factory in in megaw Factory in China but

495
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:28,919
there's almost no mass production of s b

496
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:31,080
yet but there are several startups in in

497
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:32,480
Europe in the US and also in Asia trying

498
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:35,279
to develop C

499
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,960
batteries however what is lacking right

500
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:40,240
now in my opinion is the following the

501
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:43,600
first one is uh the first one is most of

502
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:46,559
them are made from polyan and PBA not Le

503
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:50,760
oxide so we want to have Technology

504
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:53,000
based on L oxide and those with L oxide

505
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:56,279
have significant amount of nickel in

506
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:59,279
them so we want to develop L oxides that

507
00:21:56,279 --> 00:22:01,200
are free in in Nick and Cobalt

508
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:03,240
and mature in terms of energy density

509
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,559
and cycleability to be able to compete

510
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,559
with the batteries that's what's missing

511
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:10,679
missing in the current large scape of

512
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:12,400
upcoming s b commercialization and

513
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:14,360
that's why my group's trying to tackle

514
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,240
this this problem by developing Le

515
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:21,000
oxides that are based on manganes and

516
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:24,320
iron so now that being said what is the

517
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:27,559
challenge the challenge in doing this is

518
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:30,080
the following normally sodium is heavier

519
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:32,400
compared to lithium so the energ density

520
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:35,720
is lower in sodium than the lithium in

521
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:38,200
batteries to compensate for that one you

522
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:40,960
should be able to charge your system to

523
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:43,360
high voltage that way you can get more

524
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:46,240
energy from the Sol batteries to be

525
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:49,000
compe competitive with the in batteries

526
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:52,520
so the idea therefore is pushing the the

527
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,480
charging voltage more than what we do

528
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:56,799
currently but there's a problem with

529
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,559
that so currently what we do is we

530
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:01,080
charge the our batteries to a low

531
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:03,400
voltage quote unquote and as a result we

532
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:05,000
have a very reversible kind of cycling

533
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:07,240
doing charging and

534
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,520
discharging but if you want to push this

535
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:11,600
and Achieve high energy density that

536
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,679
means you increase the voltage that

537
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,720
could give you high energy density

538
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:18,320
however the problem is you will lose

539
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,600
Incycle ability when you do that so

540
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,640
pushing the system to a very high

541
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,600
voltage will induce disorder in the

542
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:27,159
material giving rise to loss in voltage

543
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,799
and loss in capacity so that's the

544
00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:30,760
problem we're trying to solve if we

545
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:34,520
solve this problem then we could achieve

546
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:37,480
H density system that are reversible

547
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:40,520
into thousands of cycles that can comp

548
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:42,679
compete with batteries so my group is

549
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:44,400
trying to solve this problem I would say

550
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:47,720
this is the billion dollar problem in

551
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:49,799
this industry so the first approach

552
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:53,039
we're trying to do is we're trying to

553
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:55,080
design three different type of methods

554
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:58,240
to make new materials that can overcome

555
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:58,240
this challenge

556
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:03,600
the first design principle is to be able

557
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:06,600
to control or manipulate the structure

558
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:09,279
namely we trying to engineer the defects

559
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:11,120
in the material that way we kind of

560
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,919
prevent a disorder in the M disorder in

561
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:15,080
the material when when you are charging

562
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:16,520
and discharging so by introducing

563
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:19,640
defects in the material like for example

564
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:21,200
in this case we have showed that we can

565
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:25,200
actually achieve a very high capacity

566
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:27,320
and energy but with a very small loss in

567
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:30,720
voltage if you remember in the previous

568
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:33,840
plots we have very high voltage normally

569
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:36,000
about one volt but using our design

570
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:40,159
principle we narrow down this one VT

571
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:43,320
loss in loss in voltage to only a 40 Mt

572
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:45,159
loss in voltage and here is comparing

573
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:47,720
the loss in

574
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:50,600
voltage with different materials and our

575
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:54,000
material shows the lowest voltage loss

576
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:56,159
upon cycling compared to other existing

577
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,960
sodium and lithium oxide

578
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:01,240
systems so therefore the first principle

579
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,919
is to engineer the defect in structure

580
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:05,720
to penalize the disorder and stabilize

581
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,799
the material upon

582
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:11,000
cycling the second design principle is

583
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:14,360
the chemistry our predict table is reach

584
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,399
in Elemental type uh compositional

585
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:18,600
diversity as there is huge space of

586
00:25:16,399 --> 00:25:21,720
materials we can explore so we're trying

587
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:24,799
to understand how each element affect

588
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:27,600
the material chemistry and its property

589
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:29,440
by manipulating the compositional space

590
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:32,760
we trying to find compositions that

591
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:35,279
allows us also to narrow that loss in

592
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:37,799
voltage for example in this case we have

593
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:41,520
show that by doping a small amount of

594
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:45,520
dopant into a given material we can

595
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:48,240
lower the voltage loss and we can lower

596
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,960
the material Disorder so the second

597
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,919
design principle therefore is to

598
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,720
manipulate the chemical composition

599
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:55,919
space while the first one's the

600
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:58,000
structural uh

601
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:00,600
engineering and here you can see one

602
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,799
example example of you exploting the

603
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:06,520
compostion space to avoid this loss in

604
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:09,240
voltage and finally the third design

605
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:11,720
principles to combine both to create new

606
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:14,039
structures new materials which have

607
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:15,840
defects in them that control but also

608
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:18,960
with elements that can optimize the

609
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:21,320
material stability by doing this we

610
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:24,520
generated over dozens of new

611
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:27,080
compositions which uh compositions that

612
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:29,240
have also the lowest hisis in the

613
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:31,159
literature and here's example of a

614
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:34,240
structure that stabilized what you see

615
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:36,720
as a black dots are the TM image of the

616
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,120
defects in the material we control by

617
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,159
manipulating our heat and pressure

618
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:44,960
during sentences allowing us to prevent

619
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:48,760
disorder and achieving a very low loss

620
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:50,440
in capacity and voltage to recycling and

621
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:52,320
all these three design principles which

622
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:55,080
are published across several papers

623
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:57,559
showed that even though we have this

624
00:26:55,080 --> 00:27:00,720
biggest problem of his loss of capacity

625
00:26:57,559 --> 00:27:02,399
and voltage upon cycling to high voltage

626
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,520
which is caused by the

627
00:27:02,399 --> 00:27:07,840
disorder by applying our design

628
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:10,440
principle we were able to solve this

629
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:14,200
issue and we are creating new structures

630
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:17,000
new materials that allows us to achieve

631
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:20,279
this so with that I would like to

632
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,440
conclude and uh thank you know the lab

633
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:25,559
members who who are you know doing the

634
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:28,720
real work uh particularly you founda uh

635
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:31,159
who led the GE ammonia work and Hugh SMI

636
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:34,000
and Shan who led the sodium battery work

637
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:36,039
and also our funding sources and uh

638
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,600
National facilities which we have been

639
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:41,559
using to understand the mechanism behind

640
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:44,039
this uh uh principles in in in both

641
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:46,519
ammonia and batteries thank you so much

642
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:48,330
for your uh for for your attention I'll

643
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:54,599
be happy to answer your

644
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:54,599
[Applause]

645
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:02,600
question yeah

646
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:04,559
so yes okay sure so the question is

647
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:07,480
what's your anticipated time frame for

648
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:10,640
Designing new principles for

649
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:12,440
developing uh manganes and iron reach

650
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,960
systems so this is what we are doing

651
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:17,720
right now the three example that I gave

652
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:21,240
you are actually you know examples of uh

653
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:24,600
design principles to make manganes Rich

654
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:27,720
iron rich systems in fact in most of the

655
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:29,120
examples we have no nickel and no Cobalt

656
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:31,799
in this in the structure so we are

657
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:35,200
already making a progress um but of

658
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:35,200
course there's more to come before

659
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:43,120
commercialization the second question is

660
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:46,559
is it good idea to build infrastructure

661
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:50,120
for hydrogen in areas where Ultra mic Ro

662
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:52,640
is visible on the surface or is better

663
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:54,840
to extract orange hydrogen by drilling

664
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,760
deep near conception sites very good

665
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:58,640
question so alic rocks are the Rocks we

666
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,880
are using

667
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:04,519
and the word Ultra mfic means high in

668
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:06,399
iron and high in magnesium maic um and

669
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:10,200
they are so these are the Rocks we are

670
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:11,760
targeting um I wouldn't the first part

671
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:14,240
of the question is about building you

672
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,159
know infrastructures near the sides

673
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,919
where we see this rocks on the surface

674
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:21,519
and I would say no because those rocks

675
00:29:18,919 --> 00:29:23,600
on the surface are already oxidized are

676
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:26,519
already rested even though they contain

677
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:28,880
iron the iron is not in the pl two state

678
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:31,279
so PL to Valance state so oxidized to

679
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,240
plus three or plus4 so if you you know

680
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:35,200
pour water on it there's no more

681
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:37,000
arresting that will happen so I would I

682
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,240
would say that won't be economically

683
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,840
feasible because of the fact that it's

684
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:44,440
already oxidized the second question the

685
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:47,399
second part of the question is uh exact

686
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:50,679
origin exact the hydrogen near

687
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:53,080
conception site so that question has two

688
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:54,360
parts so because because there are two

689
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:57,039
ways of orange hydrogen there's a

690
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:59,840
passive one and stimulated one the

691
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:02,200
passive one you don't have

692
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:05,120
aay on where it

693
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:08,279
exist so even let's say your conception

694
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:10,519
s is in too but the passive one can be

695
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:12,559
on Osaka right so you don't have a say

696
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:14,279
where the natural hydrogen exists so

697
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:16,080
from that point of view if it happens it

698
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:18,200
would be amazing if you are lucky to

699
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,640
find that one but what we found so far

700
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:23,640
is that this industri startups are

701
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:25,039
finding hydrogen in a remot place from

702
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:27,679
where there's a

703
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:28,960
conception nature governs that one but

704
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:31,799
if you the

705
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:34,320
stimulation now you have more control on

706
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:36,720
the chemical reaction in kinetics and

707
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:39,840
then it makes sense yes to build you

708
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:44,519
know those facilities near uh conception

709
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:47,159
sites so yes for stimulation no maybe

710
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:49,159
not for the the passive one because you

711
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:51,399
don't have control over over over

712
00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:53,880
weights produced or weight

713
00:30:51,399 --> 00:30:57,279
available good

714
00:30:53,880 --> 00:31:00,200
question the other question is um sodium

715
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:03,440
batteries t to have less in density uh

716
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:07,760
do you have ideas on how to

717
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:10,720
use uh ins say Bel from linking them

718
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:13,039
together linking them together let me

719
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:15,039
try to answer this question in the way I

720
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:16,720
understand them so the First on yes it

721
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:19,519
has lost energy density because the

722
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:22,679
sodium is heavier and that's why I said

723
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:24,840
earlier that to compensate for high

724
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:26,519
heavy mass of the sodium you have to

725
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:30,519
charge to high

726
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:32,960
voltage that way you can get more energy

727
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:34,880
and the density become also scaled up so

728
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,880
that's what that's the bottom leg which

729
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:40,480
we trying to address so therefore if we

730
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:43,679
achieve if we achieve what we a aim at

731
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:46,200
in which we are charged to high voltage

732
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:47,799
and have energy density maybe in that

733
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:50,200
case the energ density can be comparable

734
00:31:47,799 --> 00:31:52,919
to batteries but if

735
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:54,760
not there are some metods in which

736
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:58,159
people are proposing to use them in

737
00:31:54,760 --> 00:32:00,480
hybrid form so for example catl the big

738
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:02,679
Chinese company that makes a battery

739
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:05,720
they are proposing to use sodium battery

740
00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:06,960
and together in one car so maybe that's

741
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:11,559
what you were saying in terms of linking

742
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:13,200
them uh together so yes and those are

743
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:16,240
actually because they are linking them

744
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:18,960
in C case because they they are using

745
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:21,200
what's called Persian blue analog

746
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:23,480
material so if you are using Persian

747
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:25,720
blue analog material nominally you have

748
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:28,480
a very low energ density but if you have

749
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:32,600
L oxide then you don't have to hybridize

750
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:34,039
them with batteries so yes in the case

751
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:38,320
of PB and

752
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:41,960
polyon and I would say for oxide I I I I

753
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:44,639
argue that we should aim for making

754
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:49,760
independent battery that can actually

755
00:32:44,639 --> 00:32:49,760
deliver high density by charging to high

756
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:55,760
voltage do you think it's feasible to

757
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:59,840
construct a small scale production site

758
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:59,840
to generate hydrogen in a safer way

759
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:10,159
um I believe so

760
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:12,159
um so for example you know in a steam

761
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:13,440
reforming right now in Steam reforming

762
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:17,600
we are doing that we are producing

763
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:20,919
hydrogen a safe way um by converting me

764
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:25,519
to hydrogen so in the case of uh orange

765
00:33:20,919 --> 00:33:25,519
hydrogen or white hydrogen

766
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:31,360
um I believe so but you know this is a

767
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,080
new technology right and we will face

768
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:35,519
new challenges as we kind of explore

769
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:38,200
them and develop them

770
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:40,240
so uh there might be some challenges but

771
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,519
I believe it be possible because if you

772
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:46,039
look at

773
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:48,760
history H in h in bch in the early uh 20

774
00:33:46,039 --> 00:33:51,960
20th century when they came up with this

775
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:53,360
ammonia synthesis from N2 and hydrogen

776
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,919
there was no metall

777
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:58,320
energy there was no high temperature

778
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:01,399
vasels there was no pipeline

779
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:03,880
no welding technology at that time so

780
00:34:01,399 --> 00:34:05,679
going from the idea to now having Hab

781
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:08,399
bush plant was almost

782
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:12,119
impossible but then they develop all new

783
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:15,079
technologies for Metallurgy welding high

784
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:18,200
pressure reactors separation system all

785
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:21,280
of those things so I I believe that we

786
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:23,280
might face similar challenges but we can

787
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:25,399
learn from existing technologist to

788
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:28,440
adapt them into this into this new

789
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:31,320
technology and two areas are geothermal

790
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:33,560
heating and mean extraction which are

791
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:35,320
already doing subsurface operations so

792
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:37,599
we're trying to learn from them to do

793
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:40,440
this in a safer way in the decade in the

794
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:40,440
years and decades to

795
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:48,839
come good question so the question is

796
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:51,760
would it be possible to use MLA uh

797
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:54,800
approach by Professor C to discover new

798
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:57,280
compostion structures definitely um you

799
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,240
know this is a rich compos space and

800
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,640
something talk about in my group is

801
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:04,000
actually we have auton I met with some

802
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:06,320
of you today and yesterday we develop

803
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,640
High to put methods in the lab which are

804
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:11,599
robotic systems that can make new

805
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:13,560
materials and test them for S batteries

806
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:15,480
and these are also powered by some AI

807
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:18,320
machine learning algorithms that explore

808
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:20,079
their face of space and you know suggest

809
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,440
new composion to try so definitely

810
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:23,200
that's true and we are trying to also do

811
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:27,680
the same in our in our group which I

812
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:27,680
didn't show today because of time

813
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,839
very good thank you very much thanks so

814
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,079
much thank you
