1
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:10,000
Now we will continue with the different

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,639
startups. We have five startups under

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,320
the same dynamic.

4
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:18,880
10 minutes for each representative

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,039
of the startups that have been created

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:24,240
under MIT. Let's start with the first

7
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:26,720
one. Welcome

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:31,400
to the scenario. Brendan Smith,

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,400
representative of Citration.

10
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,039
We have 15 full-time team members and

11
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,280
growing all the time, hiring more great

12
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,879
people uh to bring on the team. What we

13
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,800
think about primarily at citration as

14
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,480
you can see here in our title is

15
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,400
developing a new process for what we

16
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,640
call the ultraefficient extraction and

17
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,400
recovery of copper and other precious

18
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,560
metals and minerals largely in the

19
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,799
mining sector. looking at primary mining

20
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,640
streams like leeches but also from

21
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,640
mining waste streams like tailings and

22
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,360
acid mine drainage. So we'll talk a bit

23
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,799
more about this in the next 10 minutes.

24
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,640
And so really importantly the reason why

25
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,880
we're doing this at citration is we feel

26
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,360
so so strongly that the global energy

27
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,200
transition is going to require a

28
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,680
critical minerals and a critical mineral

29
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,040
metals revolution. And what do we mean

30
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,119
by revolution? That can mean a lot of

31
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,880
different things. to citration. It means

32
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,720
we need to develop and implement new and

33
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,200
innovative solutions. What we think of

34
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,320
as full value mining and that may have

35
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,240
different definitions for different

36
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,920
people. When we think about full value

37
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,600
mining, we mean getting the the full

38
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,119
value not just out of the primary ore

39
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,720
that we're digging out of the ground,

40
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,240
but also extracting and recovering the

41
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,840
full value from the waste streams, the

42
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,079
tailings, the acid mine drainage as

43
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,240
well, while at the same time recycling

44
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,079
chemicals and recycling water back into

45
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,680
the mining process. So we don't have to

46
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,079
just throw that out into the waste and

47
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,560
desalinate more water or pipe more water

48
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,920
from the ocean for example. And so

49
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,599
copper is a great example of this. I

50
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,760
think actually the most important global

51
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,360
example with recent news and it's great

52
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,440
to be here in the heart of the you know

53
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,920
the copper producing nation of the world

54
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,239
in Chile. What we see as as I think all

55
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,599
of you today know is a steadily

56
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,760
increasing demand for copper through

57
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,440
2050 and beyond. And copper is special

58
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,360
because it's one of the most diversified

59
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,520
commodity metals in that it's needed for

60
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,280
not only the grid, the grid technology

61
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,800
and expansion, but also energy

62
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,560
generation and storage of course,

63
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,319
construction, and a whole plethora of

64
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,400
other different industrial applications

65
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,160
with which you're all very familiar. But

66
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,760
in the face of this almost inevitably

67
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,040
growing demand, I think we all agree

68
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,800
that it's going to happen and it is

69
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,239
happening today. We have several

70
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,760
challenges and and what we think of as

71
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,000
headwinds that we have to push through

72
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,920
to be able to meet this demand of

73
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,360
course. And so we have as we all know

74
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,160
declining or quality that was mentioned

75
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,760
this morning by Anagasta CEO. Uh we know

76
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,840
that over the last 40 years we've seen

77
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,000
about a 50% decline in copper or grades

78
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,680
which is a pretty staggering decline and

79
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,920
one that's not going to slow down and

80
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,200
reverse course as far as we know. We

81
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,879
also know that we're losing a lot of

82
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,040
value into the waist stream as I

83
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,400
mentioned before. So chiefly not really

84
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,159
with copper, but a whole plethora of

85
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,360
other critical minerals and metals that

86
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,959
are also essential for the energy

87
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,800
transition are largely flowing into the

88
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,080
waste and maybe dilute concentrations

89
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,200
that can't be economically or

90
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,800
sustainably recovered so far today. And

91
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,159
finally is the negative impact. And so

92
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,000
we all know that mining has an impact.

93
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,519
It's a very necessary impact uh to be

94
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,440
able to achieve this progress that we

95
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,040
need to achieve. But really importantly,

96
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,480
as we try to get more resources out of

97
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,400
the exact same amount of rocks that

98
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,440
we're already mining today, but needing

99
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,360
to be more productive and more

100
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,959
efficient, we need to mitigate that

101
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,120
waste production of solid and liquid

102
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,959
waste and tailings, uh, consumption of

103
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,640
energy and water in that process as

104
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,080
well. And so I think some of these

105
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,840
headwinds are actually driving the

106
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,519
opposite trend in what's predicted in

107
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,879
mining production of copper, which is

108
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,799
going the other way in a negative

109
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,080
direction for all those reasons I just

110
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,640
mentioned. And so we're we're seeing

111
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,120
projections of a shortfall of 40 to 50%

112
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,480
already by 2040. And so what are some of

113
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,319
the key pieces that could actually help

114
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,720
to close this gap as we really need to

115
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,560
do. When we look at the the market and

116
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,879
the industry and the sector today, what

117
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,080
we see is an incredibly complex process.

118
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,560
And in a lot of cases, we're using

119
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,000
hydromeergical and parameergical

120
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,919
uh processes or methods that were

121
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,440
developed in the 20th century up to 100

122
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,280
years ago. And of course we have

123
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,040
incremental innovation throughout that

124
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,800
hundred years or century but not

125
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,320
necessarily a lot of new technologies or

126
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,479
approaches because it's very difficult

127
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,960
to do. And so these things are complex,

128
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,639
10 or 15 steps to get one, you know,

129
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,320
critical metal target, for example.

130
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,080
They're high cost, takes a lot of

131
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,520
resources, energy, water, and chemical

132
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,919
coming into the process and going out

133
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,199
into the waste, not being reused. And of

134
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,479
course, then harmful to the local and

135
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,080
global environment. And as I mentioned

136
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,240
before, leaving a lot of those more

137
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,000
dilute longtail resources that are very

138
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,120
high value and very critical for our

139
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,639
future in the waist stream unreovered.

140
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,240
And so finally, this is where citration

141
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,080
comes in. We're working to enable a

142
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,000
paradigm shift in the mining sector and

143
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,680
other adjacent sectors and metals and

144
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,680
minerals by deploying a fully

145
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,919
electrified solution with no chemical

146
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,759
usage to extract these minerals,

147
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,600
concentrate them and recycle other

148
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,680
resources in the process in a very

149
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,840
streamlined way. At the core of this

150
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,680
system is two chief technical pillars

151
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,680
that Citration has developed, scaled up,

152
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,440
deployed and patented. The first is a

153
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,320
siliconbased filtration membrane. So

154
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,000
many of you are familiar with

155
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,000
filtration. The difference with our

156
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,759
membrane is it's uniquely durable. And

157
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,960
so we can utilize this with streams

158
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:29,120
directly of pH0, pH1, very high TDS,

159
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,120
very high solids loading, and pull out

160
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,520
clean water or clean acid for recycling

161
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,600
in the process. At the same time, we can

162
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,720
also up concentrate by say a factor of

163
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,560
10 to 15 times those dilute highly

164
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,960
valuable things like rare earth elements

165
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,680
or precious metals in that tailings

166
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,880
water for example. The second piece of

167
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,960
technology we've developed and are

168
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,880
deploying today, it's a siliconbased

169
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,560
electro extraction module. You can tell

170
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,919
we really like silicon at citration.

171
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,600
It's actually in our name. You probably

172
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,960
noticed. Um, and it's a silicon based

173
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,639
electro extraction module. It gives us

174
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,560
the same durability as the filtration

175
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,160
membrane, but the application here is

176
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,440
very different. It's very much similar

177
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,280
to electroinning that you're probably

178
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,120
all quite familiar with where we're

179
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,639
pulling out things like copper, cobalt,

180
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,960
nickel, and other precious metals like

181
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,880
gold and silver in a single step with no

182
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,120
chemical directly from those complex and

183
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,720
challenging streams.

184
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,240
And so when we talk to our global mining

185
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,919
partners including Antifagasta who we're

186
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,600
very thrilled to be working with today

187
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,520
about the advantages here we see several

188
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,960
really key important advantages. So the

189
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,720
chemical free nature of what we're doing

190
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,520
extremely important in terms of the

191
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,039
operating cost the sustainability we can

192
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,280
as I mentioned get to that really long

193
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,800
tale of dilute profitable byproducts

194
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,360
that typically aren't really leveraged

195
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,280
in most assets and we can do this while

196
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,880
really importantly reusing water and

197
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,120
acids that are going into the process in

198
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,360
terms of lxivians. At the same time,

199
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,039
it's a very modular, low capex, low opex

200
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,120
system. And so we can scale up or down

201
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,880
with on-site process requirements of a

202
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,319
specific asset. And then really

203
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,520
importantly, the durability speaks to

204
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,479
this a little bit, but we're highly

205
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,800
adaptable to very diverse. So you can

206
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,240
think about biolleaching or the um the

207
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,479
chloride leech that we've been talking

208
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,680
about at these uh at these sessions. And

209
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,039
we're compatible with all those things

210
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,240
in the exact same way we would deal with

211
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:09,680
a sulfuric acid leech, for example.

212
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,759
So a few examples for you with more

213
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,680
specificity and um in a quantitative

214
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,840
way. I mentioned we're dealing primarily

215
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,520
with PLS or primary leech and also

216
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,440
wastewater like tailings or acid mine

217
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,120
drainage. And from either of these feed

218
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,039
streams in that single step with no

219
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,479
chemicals, we're able to pull out 49's

220
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,400
purity copper which is extremely

221
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,319
important of course as a standard for

222
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,080
the industry. We can do this with a very

223
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,680
flexible form factor either with high

224
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,680
purity copper powder which you see here

225
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,000
on the slide in that single step. We can

226
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,199
also do a a highly dense cathodic copper

227
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,520
sheet like you would find in a standard

228
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,039
electing process for example. Really

229
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,120
importantly energy consumption has to

230
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:45,039
stay low that drives the operating cost

231
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,039
and so we can achieve well below 3 kwatt

232
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,800
hours per kilogram of copper which is

233
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:51,280
approaching on par with commercial

234
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,720
electroinning today. The yield can also

235
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,319
be very high. So we can achieve upwards

236
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:58,400
of 97% even approaching 99 or 99.9%

237
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,840
depending on the application. As I

238
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,919
mentioned, high compatibility with

239
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:06,000
diverse including chlorides and of

240
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:07,199
course sulfuric acid as well.

241
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,280
And so we're not just stopping at

242
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,720
copper. Uh it is our number one focus of

243
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,319
course unsurprisingly to all those in

244
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,479
the room. But with the exact same

245
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,000
hardware, the exact same process, we can

246
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,160
actually pull out diverse critical

247
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
metals and minerals um from very harsh

248
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,479
conditions. So think about hydrochloric

249
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
acid streams of pH negative1. We can

250
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,080
directly pull out gold that looks like

251
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,360
this from a stream like that. also

252
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,280
addressing platinum group metals,

253
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,199
platinum, platium, uh precious metals

254
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,800
like silver. I mentioned the base metals

255
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,279
and other really critical minerals like

256
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,719
lithium, manganese, and aridium to name

257
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,240
a few others that we're doing uh with

258
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,599
partners today. So, I want to really

259
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,360
emphasize that we're not just a

260
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,200
streamlined copper producer with high

261
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,200
efficiency, but also really importantly

262
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,519
unlocking this multi- metallic value of

263
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,399
an asset both in the primary process and

264
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,600
the the uh waist stream as well.

265
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,880
So, where we are today, we're still

266
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,360
relatively early, but we're scaling up

267
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,440
quickly. We took our uh demonstration or

268
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,720
a picture of this to a to Sentinel

269
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,480
yesterday and I think some people found

270
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,080
it kind of funny because it's so small.

271
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,680
Uh but we are really importantly looking

272
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,120
to scale up very quickly with partners

273
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,440
around the world. So today we're

274
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,600
deploying a thousand liter per day a

275
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,120
10,000 liter per day system on the site

276
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,560
with Riotinto in the United States

277
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,720
primarily to pull out copper from a

278
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,480
waist stream being acid mine drainage.

279
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,680
So that's being deployed this summer and

280
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,519
we're looking to bring something similar

281
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,959
very soon to Chile as well. But

282
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,720
importantly the scaleup potential is

283
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:25,040
very high. So we expect to do a 10x

284
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,040
scale up uh to 100,000 liters per day by

285
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,040
the second half of 2026 and then going

286
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,480
up much more much more quickly from

287
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,240
there. And so one of these great

288
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,000
partners today is of course Antifagasta.

289
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,000
We are down here to discuss you know

290
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,519
potential next steps with with you as

291
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,360
well and we're looking at different

292
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,600
applications in raphnate pls and

293
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,959
possibly on the way side. Then Riointo I

294
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,880
mentioned we're pulling out copper from

295
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,519
that acid mine drainage stream today on

296
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,200
a site in the United States. So I just

297
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,560
want to close by saying we're extremely

298
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,839
excited about Chile. We're really

299
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,200
appreciative of event Fagasta inviting

300
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,320
us down here. We're very excited for the

301
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,920
next steps and to continue working

302
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,080
together and scaling up the technology

303
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,680
and process. The reason we're so excited

304
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,279
about Chile is not just because it's the

305
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,040
copper capital of the world in in terms

306
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,279
of proven reserves, of course, which it

307
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,959
is. It's more about the attitude of of

308
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,000
doing this doing the scale up while also

309
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,440
generating all the clean energy

310
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,880
production that you're generating and

311
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,279
these state-of-the-art water management

312
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,880
systems that we feel overlap completely

313
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,240
with Citration's mission. So, not only

314
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,920
are we also trying to be very energy

315
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,920
efficient, very much streamline the

316
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,279
copper extraction process, but we're

317
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,880
also looking at reusing the water and

318
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,480
chemical on site to really advance the

319
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,760
sustainability aspect of what we're

320
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,600
doing and what our mining partners are

321
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,680
doing. So, that I'll finish up. Looks

322
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,959
like right on time. I would love to

323
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,160
contact all of you in the future if you

324
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,600
have interest in learning more. You can

325
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,360
find my uh email down at the bottom of

326
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:39,560
the slide there. And I really appreciate

327
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,560
your time and attention. Thank you.
