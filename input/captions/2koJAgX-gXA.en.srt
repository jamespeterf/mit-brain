1
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:07,759
I've been very fortunate to spend um

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:11,360
most of my career in two institutions

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:14,320
Berkeley and MIT that are very um I'd

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:17,520
say porous and collaborative towards um

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,680
towards industry I think in um uh at

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,119
Berkeley uh I directed something called

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,439
the Berkeley Center for New Media which

8
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,880
is a small uh interdisiplinary campus

9
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:28,080
center but we worked a lot with

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,920
different um um uh organizations in the

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,040
Bay Area technological and otherwise is

12
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:35,120
and um right before I left um Berkeley I

13
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,840
was uh uh the recipient of the

14
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,440
Craigslist chair in new media and we

15
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,200
collaborated with them around um

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,800
technology and questions and uh

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,520
questions of of media and they funded

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,000
this chair. So I think um uh you know as

19
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,160
I came to MIT uh it was particularly

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,199
interesting to me to see how well

21
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:56,000
integrated kind of uh MIT's innovation

22
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:59,440
engine was with the larger um uh

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,840
innovation engine of uh uh uh of not

24
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,600
only Cambridge but the the world at

25
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:07,119
large. So yeah, some of our most

26
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,880
interesting collaborations um uh have uh

27
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,000
being with partners around the future of

28
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,760
building the future of concrete

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,600
construction uh in the department is

30
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,799
very important. Uh just this last

31
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,720
semester I started a a kind of um a

32
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,320
research program uh here in the

33
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,960
department. I've I've kind of uh uh

34
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,479
worked to better integrate uh or even

35
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,320
better integrate the kind of work and

36
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,920
design and research that we do in the

37
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,600
department. Um and so we just started a

38
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,119
three-year cycle of um uh research about

39
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,880
uh the architecture of extreme

40
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,799
environments, not only outer space but

41
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,720
increasingly extreme environments here

42
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,479
on Earth, but that's involved a lot of

43
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,600
interesting industry collaborations as

44
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:48,799
well. And so I don't think um uh you

45
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:51,840
know one of the great parts about an

46
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,680
institution like MIT is you you have an

47
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,799
incredible world of ideas but you're

48
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,640
always asking how can these be in

49
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,719
service to the world in service to

50
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,079
society uh and not necessarily

51
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,520
instantly. That's you know it doesn't

52
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,320
work if you're always looking for the

53
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,560
kind of instant fix. Um because uh just

54
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,959
like in nature, things need to be

55
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,720
useless before they're useful uh and

56
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,480
evolved to become really important. The

57
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,520
space architecture studio is a

58
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,440
collaboration between ERA Astro and um

59
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,040
uh and the media labs space exploration

60
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:27,280
program. And so um uh but we have other

61
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:30,160
um uh another you know another huge um

62
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,360
uh part of what uh project in the

63
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,080
department in the last couple of years

64
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,440
has been um a series of climate research

65
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,040
studios um funded by a donation from um

66
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,319
uh Allan and Terry Spoon but also

67
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,959
involving partnerships with um in uh

68
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:47,599
recently the uh masonry industry and

69
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,319
local unions in um uh in Brooklyn here

70
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:53,200
in uh uh Massachusetts and New England

71
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:56,959
to really think about how we can um uh

72
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,640
reuse and remake buildings using um a

73
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,319
more circular approach to materials. And

74
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,720
so these are just some of the examples

75
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,599
of the kind of uh direct impact we have

76
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,879
with our design work here. So the you

77
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,000
know the architecture department one of

78
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,800
the most interesting things about

79
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,480
architecture a bit um you know my own

80
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,400
career encapsulates part of it but our

81
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,959
department is everything from historians

82
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,720
to engineers to practicing architects

83
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:22,640
and uh we we work with collaborators all

84
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,519
across the university from

85
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:29,200
nanotechnology to arastro to material

86
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:32,400
science. um uh this department is the um

87
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,680
is both the oldest um uh professional

88
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,560
department of architecture in North

89
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,239
America but also probably um the most

90
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,680
out there in terms of the extent to

91
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,680
which we're pushing the limits of

92
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,319
research and design and building. So

93
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:47,599
that's why it's an exciting place to be.

94
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:50,239
One of the um beyond my you know work in

95
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:54,159
the university and the research work uh

96
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:56,720
a big part of um my uh creative life is

97
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:59,840
uh my practice modem with my partner

98
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:03,599
Katherine Maul and you know that work

99
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:06,319
which can range from proposals for

100
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,000
massive urban sites to very specific uh

101
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:11,360
installations in galleries

102
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,840
collaborations with artists is really um

103
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,959
uh looks at questions of place um and

104
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,120
really looks at how we can create

105
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:23,360
singular objects and experiences which

106
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:25,919
both convey and at their best even

107
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,479
catalyze change in um uh the

108
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,479
intersection between a very local place

109
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,479
and an experience of a single body and

110
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:36,199
the largest possible systems that that

111
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,199
place is connected to.
