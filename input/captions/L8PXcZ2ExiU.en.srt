1
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,560
today we're going to uh continue we're

2
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,119
going to talk about a new notion a

3
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:21,320
really really interesting notion in my

4
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,560
opinion uh called probabilistically

5
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,920
checkable proofs I'll explain what it is

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,640
so we'll we're going to Define this

7
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:30,519
notion and we're going to construct it

8
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:33,200
uh from the GK protocol so you'll kind

9
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:35,559
of see not only the definition but

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,840
you'll be able after this class the hope

11
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:39,680
is that you'll be able to construct a

12
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,760
PCP if you need to construct proof

13
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,879
you'll be able to do that so that's

14
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,960
going to be the first part of today's

15
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:47,280
lecture and the second part of today's

16
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,239
lecture is actually going to be the

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,440
first time we actually use cryptography

18
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:54,719
so so far this class has not been at all

19
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,280
about cryptography it was everything was

20
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,920
information it was actually complexity

21
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,600
Theory uh but today is going to be the

22
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,000
first time we're going to move

23
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,600
into uh

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,439
cryptography and uh as we'll talk we'll

25
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,159
see that doing this information

26
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:14,200
theoretic proofs where you say okay no

27
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:16,119
Pro can create a give you a false proof

28
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:19,799
that is limiting okay we can do

29
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:21,960
everything we want using that uh a this

30
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,640
notion and therefore we're going to go

31
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:27,400
into a new notion of soundness which is

32
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,200
what we call arguments or computational

33
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:33,439
soundness and we're going to relax the

34
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:36,759
prover and say an all Power Pro an all

35
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:39,320
powerful approver may be able to cheat

36
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:42,439
but the guarantee we give hey Tony is

37
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:44,040
that a computationally bounded PR cannot

38
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:46,360
cheat okay that's going to be the

39
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,920
guarantee we get and we'll see once we

40
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:50,680
relax the soundness requirement to a

41
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,680
requirement that's only computational

42
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:55,520
sound then we'll be able to get a lot

43
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,280
more and kind of uh you know the life

44
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,240
will kind of open for us and we're going

45
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,920
to have a lot a lot of new uh kind of

46
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,840
constructions and things that we were

47
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,280
unable to do information

48
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,080
theoretically so this is uh the plan for

49
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:11,080
today questions before we start I

50
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,400
haven't seen you guys in a

51
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,000
while so it's good to see you a lot of

52
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,720
things changed since the last time I've

53
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,080
seen you I'm probably going to be a bit

54
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:23,519
distracted today so I'm sorry

55
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:26,519
okay okay let's start so what are no

56
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:30,080
questions okay so let's start with pcps

57
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:32,760
what are probity checkable proofs

58
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,000
so these are the idea of probability

59
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,560
checkable proofs is to take a proof like

60
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,959
a classical proof think of NP in NP we

61
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:43,400
have a instance X and A Witness this

62
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,440
witness is like a proof for X being in

63
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:48,800
the

64
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,560
language to verify this proof you need

65
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,080
to read the entire thing and do some

66
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,800
computation like this verification

67
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:58,080
circuit you know a that checks that X

68
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,680
and W is in the relation there's a

69
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,720
circuit that checks this

70
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:05,200
okay what is the idea of a probability

71
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,599
checkable proof the idea here what we

72
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:12,120
want is to take this proof and convert

73
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:13,519
it into a new proof it may be larger

74
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,840
actually than the original proof so

75
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:19,120
maybe you know the original proof was of

76
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,799
size M let's say the instance of size n

77
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:25,720
this may be of size much bigger still we

78
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:28,959
want it to be polinomial in n&

79
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:31,120
M but now so we just made it bigger so

80
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,439
what's what's good about it so what's

81
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,280
nice about this proof is the IDE is you

82
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:38,640
don't actually have to read all of it to

83
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,239
check it and that's weird so the idea

84
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:44,519
here yeah the proof may be a little

85
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:46,239
longer polom longer but you only need to

86
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:48,400
read a few

87
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,519
locations to and to check that it's

88
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:55,799
valid so to verify often pcps are

89
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:59,159
denoted by pi uh to verify PCP proof

90
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:00,799
given X all the verifier needs to do is

91
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:03,239
query doesn't actually need to read

92
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,640
these things he queries a few locations

93
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:07,760
a few bits checks a few bits of the

94
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:10,040
proof and then applies a verification

95
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,560
circuit that depends only on these

96
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:16,160
bits okay and importantly the bits he

97
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,320
chooses are random the the prover

98
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,519
doesn't know otherwise he will it's like

99
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,000
shrinking if he knew the prover knew oh

100
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:25,960
the refer is going to only check in bit

101
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,800
17 22 and 25 then he would just give you

102
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,360
it's like you'll have a succinct witness

103
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,199
and of course we can't take arbitrary

104
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,919
Witnesses and just make them 16 if you

105
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,759
don't believe that's possible yeah so

106
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:38,840
it's a PTP then only used for as m is

107
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:42,520
much greater than M okay so the question

108
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:44,919
was is a PCP used if m is much greater

109
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:48,240
than n and the answer is no actually we

110
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:51,840
can think of it we can even use it where

111
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:54,720
M the length of w is n to the Epsilon

112
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,280
okay even less than n to the EPS even n

113
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,360
to the little o of n now you this will

114
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,680
still be polinomial in N so actually you

115
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,440
you took the proof and make it actually

116
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,880
more than polom larger because it's

117
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:10,120
polinomial an n and M and if the proof

118
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:12,320
here is smaller is n to the little of

119
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:14,639
one then this is polyn it's actually

120
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,320
more than polinomial bigger but so

121
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,160
you're saying what did we gain we took

122
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,199
us a short proof made it so much bigger

123
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,400
what did we gain and what we gained is

124
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:25,000
the Hope is that you can query this the

125
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:27,160
verif can query this in very very few

126
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,520
locations read only very very few bits

127
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:33,600
of this proof okay okay verifier also

128
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:35,639
have to Rex that yeah the verifier all

129
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,120
of so yes good so the question that's a

130
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:39,840
good question so the question was does

131
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,960
the verifier have to read all of X and

132
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,520
because I said he only needs to read a

133
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,919
few location the proof does he need to

134
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,560
read all of X and a prior of course he

135
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:48,240
needs to read all of X because even if

136
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,639
there's one bit in X that he doesn't

137
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,759
read you know what if that bit is it's

138
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:54,280
actually what the state what the

139
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:55,440
sentence is what the statement is you

140
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,160
know the Prov need to know what am I

141
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,639
reading what am I what are you proving

142
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:01,680
to me but there are extensions called

143
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:03,840
called PCP of proximity which I'm not

144
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,280
going to get into in this class where

145
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:09,400
actually the verify the verifier also

146
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,080
doesn't read all of X but the guarantee

147
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:14,520
is not that X is in the language it's

148
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:16,479
the guarantee is that kind of it's a the

149
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,720
Oracle that is given to the verifier

150
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,720
there is something close to it that's in

151
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,039
the linguage so it there is a notion of

152
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,479
extension of this notion of the PCP

153
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:27,479
where the verifier doesn't even need to

154
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:30,160
read all of X the guarantees there are

155
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:31,720
not very easy to state but it's a very

156
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,120
useful notion actually it's used a lot

157
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:37,160
it's called prob uh pcps of

158
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:39,360
proximity okay

159
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,840
so okay so that's what we're going to do

160
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,120
today okay and let me just mention

161
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,039
before even we start the formal thing

162
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,599
let me just say this is really an

163
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:51,280
amazing line of work today we know how

164
00:06:47,599 --> 00:06:54,280
to take any witness convert it to a

165
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:58,919
probity checkable one that the verifier

166
00:06:54,280 --> 00:07:00,520
only reads three bits three three bits

167
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:03,879
of this

168
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:08,240
uh proof and is convinced with cut and

169
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:09,319
probability 78 is the the parameter but

170
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,039
and then if you want more of course you

171
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:15,039
repeat but even with just three bits you

172
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:16,919
get uh some soundness that's really

173
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,520
amazing so we're not going to see the

174
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:20,599
three bit proof but we're going to see a

175
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:22,400
poly Logan proof so what we're going to

176
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:24,400
show what what the construction we're

177
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,160
going to see today is how to go from a

178
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,840
witness to a probability checkable one

179
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,039
that the verifier only needs to read

180
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:34,759
polylog

181
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:36,960
n of this of these uh bits and verify

182
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:38,680
and to go to the constant there's an

183
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,680
additional tricks of recursion and so on

184
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,240
that one needs to do to get there but

185
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:46,520
we're not going to cover that

186
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:49,800
part okay ready to roll

187
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,800
sleeves okay

188
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,800
let's okay so let me just Define the

189
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,720
complexity class people often think of

190
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,720
it as a complexity class even though for

191
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,479
us because this is more of a proof

192
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,199
system cryptography I know class we

193
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,720
always want efficiency we want we don't

194
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:07,080
care just about complexity we want to

195
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,360
say that actually you can take any

196
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:11,360
witness and efficiently convert it it's

197
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,879
not just about existence we want to

198
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,319
actually use these things and let me

199
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:16,840
just jump ahead and say that these

200
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:18,680
things are used it's not just a

201
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,000
theoretical uh you know even though

202
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,240
everything we've seen so far in the

203
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,159
class is like very just beautiful

204
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:30,039
mathematically it seems a very um a you

205
00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:33,919
know uh a

206
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:35,839
kind of low like a very uh away from

207
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,360
very far from practice you know and but

208
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,680
actually it's not all these things that

209
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,719
I've shown you so far that you've seen

210
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:46,120
so far are things that actually are used

211
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:47,800
and uh so and and the PCP as well uh all

212
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,440
this Machinery are things that too so we

213
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,560
actually do care about efficiency but

214
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:55,720
let me first kind of Define it as a

215
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:59,920
complexity class so we defined the

216
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:02,120
complex the complexity class PCP C for

217
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:05,079
for completeness parameter s for

218
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:08,680
soundness parameter R for Randomness

219
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:12,320
parameter and Q for query parameter so

220
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:16,760
this is a class this is the

221
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,760
class of all

222
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,720
languages

223
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,800
L A that

224
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:33,680
have a probabilistically able proof but

225
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:37,160
I'll explain exactly what I mean uh okay

226
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:39,120
so actually let me say a okay these are

227
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:41,360
all the let me write it

228
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:46,320
formally for which these are all the

229
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,320
languages L such that there

230
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:53,160
exists uh PPT a probabilistic polinomial

231
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,720
Time

232
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:59,600
verifier

233
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:02,440
a actually it's a a PPT Oracle machine

234
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,880
because it takes the PCP is an oracle

235
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:09,040
Oracle

236
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:13,279
machine v such

237
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,279
that okay so the

238
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:19,480
completeness here's the condition the

239
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:25,560
completeness says that for every X in

240
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:30,880
the language there exists a PCP Pi such

241
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:33,920
that the probability that V the verifier

242
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:37,360
given Oracle access to this PCP pi and

243
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:40,360
input the instance so for every instance

244
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,639
there exists a PCP so that the verifier

245
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,440
will accept it will output one with

246
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:46,920
probability at least C that's the

247
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,000
completeness parameter for us the PCP

248
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:51,079
will see we'll have complet this

249
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,959
parameter one okay so we'll see so we

250
00:10:51,079 --> 00:10:57,839
want to say that a class that a language

251
00:10:52,959 --> 00:11:00,720
L has such a PCP if there's a verifier V

252
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,560
efficient verifier it takes Oracle axis

253
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,560
so if x is in the language there exists

254
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:08,760
in PCP so I to verify with Oracle axis

255
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:11,160
of this PCP given this input outputs one

256
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:13,160
with probity C yes maybe I'm jumping a

257
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:15,040
bit but what does the Oracle look like

258
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,320
like what are the inputs okay good good

259
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,720
good so this okay oh good no you're not

260
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:21,959
jumping so good good question so this Pi

261
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:25,480
you should think of it as a

262
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:29,959
string it has bits B1 maybe I call it Pi

263
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:34,760
1 Pi 2 up to Pi I don't know

264
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:37,279
n and uh the verifier can ask give me

265
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:39,560
like Pi 1 give me pi 2 give me pi 3 so

266
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,959
he just has Oracle queries he can query

267
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:43,079
this string okay that's what Oracle it's

268
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:44,680
not really don't think of it as a

269
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:46,680
function he has Oracle access to the

270
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:48,200
string and he can just ask for specific

271
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,920
bits from the string great question

272
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:55,399
thank

273
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:55,399
you okay uh good and the sound is

274
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:03,680
guarantee says that that for every X

275
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,839
that's not in the

276
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,760
language any any guesses by the way what

277
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:11,800
would you okay so you need to define a

278
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:15,880
PCP here how would you define

279
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,880
sonus yeah for

280
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:27,199
all

281
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:29,760
wonderful exactly you want to say that

282
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:32,920
for every Pi star this know how we do

283
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,880
note bad things Prime will do too uh for

284
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:37,519
every bad now there's a cheating Pro he

285
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,720
tries to fool the verifier he cannot so

286
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,120
for no matter what he tries to give him

287
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:45,360
the verifier will reject him with

288
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:46,399
probability or a will accept probability

289
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,240
smaller than

290
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,519
S that's the soundness guarantee okay

291
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,120
and ideally we want to push the

292
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:57,360
completeness to one the soundness to

293
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:59,880
zero great and then the a the

294
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:03,720
complexity uh is now we want to say in

295
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,720
terms of complexity now we'll go to

296
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:11,360
the the V

297
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,360
uses our bits of

298
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,839
Randomness and Q Oracle

299
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:25,440
calls and moreover we'll see this is

300
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,040
important for us this is often in the

301
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:31,120
definition though not always but often

302
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,120
this is part of the Q

303
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:39,040
nonadaptive what do I mean by

304
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:42,959
nonadaptive what I mean is the way V

305
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:46,000
Works he gets input X he gets input X he

306
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:49,480
then chooses kind of

307
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,480
i1 up to

308
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:56,240
IQ locations in the PCP okay so here's

309
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:59,880
the v v he doesn't even look at the

310
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:03,199
Oracle yet he has an input X

311
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:05,720
he first computes Q

312
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:10,079
locations he then goes to the Oracle

313
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:13,240
asks these Q locations and then so V1

314
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:16,560
just just these locations and then V2 so

315
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:19,680
you can think of v as being like V1 and

316
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,720
V2 V1 doesn't look at his Oracle he just

317
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,720
looks as an

318
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:27,519
input and using Randomness chooses Q

319
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:30,680
locations and then

320
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:37,199
V2 kind of uh just given

321
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:43,120
X i1 up to IQ and Pi i1 up to Pi

322
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:45,320
IQ decides if to like uh accept or

323
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,399
reject okay so this is the how you

324
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,959
should think of the of the verifier the

325
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:52,120
verifier has access to the proof Pi but

326
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:55,279
what he does he does he because a more

327
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:58,199
General verifier will have X decide on

328
00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:00,720
location first location 3 i1 look at Pi

329
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:04,079
1 then hm interesting okay in that case

330
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,920
I want to see location I2 h i get Pi I2

331
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,600
interesting given Pi I2 I want to see

332
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,360
location that would be an Adaptive

333
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,880
verifier okay but often in the PCP

334
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:14,240
literature when we Define PCP we require

335
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,480
the verifier to be

336
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,560
non-adaptive and this non- adaptivity is

337
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,040
kind of uh is it's a property that we

338
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,959
like for applications and we'll see that

339
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,920
today uh why an example for why when

340
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:27,959
we'll construct succinct arguments we'll

341
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,079
use the fact that it's non adaptive but

342
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:31,959
let me just say most PCP all pcps I know

343
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:34,880
are nonadaptive maybe there other was

344
00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:36,920
that your question yeah so I don't I

345
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,279
there may exist I'm not you know I'm not

346
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:42,079
uh I didn't do a full literature search

347
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,839
but the pcps that are you know the most

348
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,319
common ones that we talk about are all

349
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,880
non-adaptive yeah did V get to know what

350
00:15:46,319 --> 00:15:52,279
capital N is yeah yeah yeah yeah so V

351
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:55,120
yes V knows yeah so V good very good

352
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:57,279
question let me repeat for the uh video

353
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:00,560
uh so the question was does v know what

354
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:04,720
n what capital N is so the answer is yes

355
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:06,959
and the V knows uh V knows the language

356
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,199
so he knows what small n is well he got

357
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:13,600
small n he knows small n the language

358
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:15,680
has like is there's M so he V get small

359
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,360
n so he knows what an N is the language

360
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,839
is associated with the witness size M of

361
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:23,560
n so he knows that because he knows n so

362
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:27,319
he knows the witness size and the PCP

363
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:30,120
itself is associated with n which

364
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:32,199
is you know you can think of it this way

365
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:35,600
so so the answer is yes these are kind

366
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:37,399
of fixed these uh M and N are fixed

367
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,000
parameters that are defined by the PCP

368
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:44,199
and the prover knows them the verifier

369
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,240
the pro they yeah yes we gain

370
00:16:44,199 --> 00:16:48,480
orose yes good good good so the question

371
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:51,560
is do we lose something and the answer

372
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,519
is we do uh okay so what do we lose and

373
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:56,000
what do we gain is your question what we

374
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:58,240
lose is for application so we you when

375
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,920
we'll go to in the second part of

376
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,399
today's class we're going to construct

377
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,959
succinct arguments and we're going to

378
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:06,959
construct them from pcps and you'll see

379
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:09,240
that if our PCP is adaptive this becomes

380
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,120
the problem so we do gain now you're

381
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,520
saying what do we Lo and so we do lose

382
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,959
sorry we do lose if we make it adapted

383
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:16,319
now you're saying but maybe we gain

384
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:18,600
something maybe we construct pcps that

385
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:23,039
are much better if you make them

386
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:25,439
adaptive and I I don't think so but I'm

387
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:27,199
not sure maybe maybe one can actually

388
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,559
argue that you don't gain anything but I

389
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,960
haven't thought about it um but it's not

390
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:35,400
something that making it nonadaptive

391
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:40,160
that for all we know is not a price it's

392
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:40,160
just our pcps happen to be that way

393
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,600
yeah good good good very very good

394
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:49,360
question so uh I think I I think maybe I

395
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,080
misunderstood but maybe your question

396
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,080
was is it clear that these have to

397
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,360
depend on X can they even not depend on

398
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:59,799
X and the answer is yes actually in the

399
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:03,000
pcps will see they don't depend on x

400
00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:06,640
okay the pcps we know actually these

401
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:10,880
they only depend on you know n and the

402
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:12,880
instance size or or again it's but they

403
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,640
don't actually depend on the instance

404
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,200
and the PCP I'll construct today you'll

405
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,320
see that so we'll get back to that that

406
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:21,320
really really great questions

407
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:23,720
yeah does that

408
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:25,480
think knows what indes you're going

409
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:27,240
Advance you could construct a of course

410
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,520
of course great wow guys you're really

411
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:33,480
Lifting me up this is great thank you uh

412
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:35,280
yeah 100% so you're what you're saying

413
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,679
is of course if the ver if the prover

414
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:40,480
knew the locations you're quering he

415
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,520
will cheat the thing is these locations

416
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,280
are random the prover doesn't know what

417
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:46,679
they are they just don't depend on X

418
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,000
okay okay but they they come from a

419
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:50,159
distribution it's very important if

420
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,559
these were deterministic there's no way

421
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:53,880
if you can do a PCP where these are

422
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:56,200
deterministic it's like you took NP and

423
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,919
you just made it end time much smaller

424
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:02,159
like we don't believe that that can

425
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:04,480
happen in so no it the there's no way we

426
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:07,440
believe you can construct pcps for which

427
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:09,600
the qu the query distribution is

428
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,480
deterministic it's like just fixed this

429
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,720
has to come from a distribution but the

430
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,440
question is does this distribution

431
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,720
depend on X or does it only depend on

432
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,200
the parameter n and then and what we'll

433
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,120
see it actually only depends on N it

434
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,360
doesn't depend on X so that's what we'll

435
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,360
see a in a

436
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:30,720
minute great question guys any any more

437
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,720
questions before we

438
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:43,919
yeah so okay good so actually V1 you can

439
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:44,640
think of usually V1 is randomized and V2

440
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,679
is

441
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:50,240
deterministic uh so you can think of it

442
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:50,240
that way that V1 is randomized V2 is

443
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:57,760
deterministic okay

444
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:59,280
uh great so now let me tell you what we

445
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,720
know and what we're going to construct

446
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:04,240
so here's what we're going to prove

447
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,440
today um here is a theorem that we're

448
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,240
going to

449
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:12,320
prove that

450
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:14,200
PCP with a let's say completeness one

451
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,880
I'll put S as half we can get smaller

452
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:18,120
any con and smaller but I'll just put

453
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:21,039
half because by repetition uh it doesn't

454
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:22,440
really matter you can get a PCP where

455
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:25,760
the query

456
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:31,520
complexity is so okay we can get a PCP

457
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:34,760
with poly log n query complexity and

458
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,760
poly a

459
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:41,360
login H sorry poly log and Randomness

460
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:42,440
complexity and query complexity for all

461
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,840
of

462
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:48,400
NP that's what we're going to see today

463
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:51,480
so we're going to see how for any NP

464
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,480
language we can construct a PCP where

465
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:56,520
the verifier the amount of Randomness he

466
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:58,960
uses is polog and bits of Randomness and

467
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:02,880
polog and queries and then we get

468
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,880
completeness one and sound as half

469
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,280
yeaha

470
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:17,760
usually right right right yeah yeah yeah

471
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:20,640
so you're right so often uh okay you're

472
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,240
right the way I wrote it here uh so okay

473
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,360
why do people care about Randomness

474
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,720
complexity one can say who cares about

475
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:28,600
the random complexity and usually the

476
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,960
way the way I Define PCP and this is

477
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,480
that's why I said it's a complexity

478
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:35,000
Theory this is how it's

479
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:37,559
defined if if the verifier has only log

480
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,559
and bits or order lend bits of of

481
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:44,400
Randomness then it means that the PCP is

482
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:46,440
only polyn size because look go over all

483
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,559
the PO and all the log and bit random

484
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:52,360
there's only n of them so that's as much

485
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:53,880
as you can uh kind of query so uh so

486
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:57,520
that means the PCV is aized and that's

487
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:59,240
all we care about okay for me I'm going

488
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,440
to care about so actually for me I'm

489
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,360
going to add a a requirement actually I

490
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,760
didn't write it here because it's

491
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:08,120
usually not defined but I can add a

492
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:10,240
requirement that says this a I'll okay

493
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:12,279
I'll add it here in tiny this is a a

494
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,679
requirement that we add in in

495
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:17,279
cryptography often what I'm writing now

496
00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:19,200
is not added in the in in the

497
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:21,960
definitions but let me write another

498
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,200
cryptography another that given for

499
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:31,039
every

500
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:31,039
X in or X for for every X in l and

501
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:37,880
witness if it has a

502
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:40,480
witness W okay so suppose this is a

503
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:42,480
language in N time I don't know NP or n

504
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,320
time T so it has some witness I want it

505
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,080
to be the case that given X and W you

506
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:50,720
can

507
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:54,520
efficiently compute Pi so not only there

508
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:57,080
exists Pi of of poly and size you can

509
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:59,440
actually efficiently compute it and

510
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:00,760
because I require efficient Computing I

511
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,320
actually don't care anymore so much

512
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:06,080
about the randomness the amount the

513
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:07,600
number of Randomness uh bits but yeah

514
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,880
that's a very good point Thank you guys

515
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:12,960
thank you for the question this is

516
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:14,960
great H okay so that's what I'm going to

517
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:19,000
prove even though let me just mention

518
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:23,240
what is known is you can make this order

519
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,240
login and you can make this

520
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:28,840
three okay so it's really remarkable if

521
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:31,120
you think about it wow you can take any

522
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:34,159
proof so you know how I don't know take

523
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:36,480
a foras last the take the hardest proof

524
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:39,520
that we know in mathematics you know one

525
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:42,120
can write them in a pro propos checkable

526
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,720
way they you can just take three bits

527
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:46,520
and verify and if you're not happy with

528
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:48,320
probability half repeat it as many times

529
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,799
as you want you want prob you want to be

530
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,360
sure that he can cheat with probability

531
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:55,279
only one over two to the 500 repeat it

532
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:57,880
500 times and each one it's like a very

533
00:23:55,279 --> 00:24:00,440
simple check it depends on three bits so

534
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,440
it's really

535
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:04,760
remarkable no never

536
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:11,600
mindo I guess it doesn't matter

537
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:14,240
to all oh you're saying it's too big

538
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:16,760
because for theory for practice Yeah but

539
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:19,600
we're still in theory land yeah in

540
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:21,960
practice these pcps you want them to be

541
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,360
like linear that's the ideal the Quasi

542
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,200
linear even if they're quadratic people

543
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,640
don't like them you really want linear

544
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:30,200
quasi linear pcps for for practice but

545
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:32,919
for here PA is fantastic we're you know

546
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:37,159
we're not we're not the let us stand the

547
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:39,520
cloud a little bit okay so uh so okay so

548
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:43,760
let's uh let's construct

549
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:45,960
this ready okay so okay so we have the

550
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:49,480
three but we're going to construct for

551
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:52,559
the polog polog and what actually here's

552
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:54,600
what you what's amazing you actually

553
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:57,520
already know how to construct the PCP

554
00:24:54,600 --> 00:25:00,320
you just don't know that you know and

555
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:04,039
how do you construct the PCP it's really

556
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:06,760
only the GK protocol that's it so you

557
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:08,320
can unfold gkr and I'm going to show you

558
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:11,720
exactly how to make it a

559
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:13,480
PCP okay so to do that but before and

560
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:16,679
I'll recall the GK in a second on that

561
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:18,360
board but to do that let's first let's

562
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:22,600
first so I want to say any any language

563
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:22,600
has a PCP let's con let's

564
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:28,679
focus on on three set

565
00:25:30,399 --> 00:25:34,440
okay so thre set is an NP complete

566
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,880
language let's just construct a PTP for

567
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:39,480
three set and what's nice about three

568
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,039
set is that I mean any NP language you

569
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:44,279
can convert to three set so it's nice

570
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:46,279
any NP language is that you have a

571
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:50,399
circuit a verification

572
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:53,640
circuit so a circuit verifying so you

573
00:25:50,399 --> 00:25:56,640
can think of it uh given W verifying

574
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:59,640
that it's a valid witness of very small

575
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,640
depth okay poly and depth and this is

576
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:04,279
important because if you remember the GK

577
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,520
protocol which we're going to use to

578
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:08,679
construct this

579
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:10,799
PCP kind of the number the communication

580
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:12,720
complexity grows with the depth so we

581
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:15,679
want the depth of the circuit to be

582
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,880
small but any NP language you can

583
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:19,600
convert into a three set and thre set

584
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,640
has actually it's like the depth of

585
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:24,320
three set is like actually only two but

586
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:26,520
like you need to do you know uh little

587
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,840
ores and then one big end but if

588
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:30,120
remember gkr we wanted fan in two

589
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:33,120
so once you have F in two it's like

590
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:36,760
order log okay so this is depth you can

591
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:39,480
think of it as being uh a like log in or

592
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:41,760
I'm okay with poogan it doesn't

593
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:44,880
matter the point is it's

594
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:47,559
small and uh the reason why I write also

595
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:51,799
polog is because uh it's actually log

596
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:53,919
however uh this circuit is also any kind

597
00:26:51,799 --> 00:26:56,960
of the circuit is and this I'm not going

598
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:58,960
to get into but it's log space uniform

599
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,640
and now you can consider the circuit

600
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,440
change it a little bit the way Rachel

601
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,880
taught you two weeks ago if you don't

602
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:06,840
remember it's not it's okay you can take

603
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:08,440
it as a black box uh you can assume that

604
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:10,720
The Circuit by kind of looking at a

605
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:16,640
universal version of it you can assume

606
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:20,399
that it has like the gates add I and

607
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,399
multi are efficiently

608
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:27,559
computable and that's what we'll need so

609
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,919
we can so if if you don't remember uh

610
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:30,919
things from weeks ago it's okay I'll

611
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:33,200
remind you what add I in multi in a

612
00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:38,000
second but you take any three set you

613
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:39,960
can convert it uh or convert to 3 CNF so

614
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:44,480
now given a witness you just check that

615
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:47,720
it verifies hi hello hey wow all my kids

616
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,720
come coming

617
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:01,480
in okay so uh

618
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:05,240
a you just uh we talking about how to

619
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:10,279
construct pcps from gkr right

620
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:11,919
now so what we're proving is that we're

621
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:13,760
going to show how you can take any NP

622
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:16,880
language in particular we're focusing on

623
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:20,440
three sat and we're going to show how

624
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:23,960
you can convert three sat into a PCP

625
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:25,840
where the query complexity is poly Logan

626
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:29,480
so converting to PCP the verifier needs

627
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:30,919
to query only poly Logan uh locations we

628
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:33,120
know you can do go all the way down to

629
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:35,000
three but we're not uh today we're going

630
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,440
to so polog this is the randomness

631
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,200
complexity this is the query complexity

632
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,360
we're focusing on completeness one sound

633
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:45,559
is half okay so we're going to now

634
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:48,080
construct the PCP and uh before we conr

635
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:50,039
the P the PCP essentially uses gkr so

636
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,919
let me first on this board remind you

637
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:53,240
quickly what gkr looks like because

638
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:56,600
we're going to use it to constuct the

639
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:58,880
PCP okay you're cameraman it's okay to

640
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:01,640
move okay okay

641
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:04,559
um good so let's let's just recall the

642
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:07,279
gkr how does it work we have a

643
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:10,840
circuit there's an input W we're going

644
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:13,200
to think of w here as the the satisfying

645
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:14,919
assignment okay remember in the DK we

646
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,799
assume the verifier has W in his hand

647
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:18,840
the W the input in his hand here he

648
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:20,960
doesn't W is going to be the witness for

649
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:24,159
the satisfying assignment but that's

650
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:27,399
okay now here's what so I'm I'm GNA

651
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:30,039
construct the PCP proof okay I have my

652
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:32,279
witness my satisfying

653
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:35,320
assignment I'm going to construct a

654
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:37,799
protic I'm going to convert W into a PCP

655
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:41,039
into a protic checkable proof okay

656
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:44,600
here's how I do it I look at the kind

657
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:45,919
the circuit that checks that uh W

658
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,880
actually you can if you want to think of

659
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:49,519
it's completely new form you can think

660
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:54,480
of having X and W so X and W and it

661
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:58,519
checks that uh kind of fe uh sorry that

662
00:29:54,480 --> 00:30:03,519
or okay X which is Fe and it checks that

663
00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:07,840
F of w is one okay this is a log space

664
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:12,200
uniform uh circuit and uh okay now what

665
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:14,679
do I do so here's me I know W every we

666
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:16,559
both know the three set

667
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:19,799
formula what I

668
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:23,000
do I and and we assume that this circuit

669
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:25,120
is kind of has addition Gates and

670
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,679
multiplication

671
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:31,440
Gates what I do for every

672
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:32,960
layer I compute the values of the layer

673
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:36,159
okay so I compute for every layer

674
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:38,039
remember I have VI the I assume every

675
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:39,760
layer let's say has size let's say the

676
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:42,320
same size without L of generality we

677
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,770
said size s we called it s so each layer

678
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,440
has s

679
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:49,799
[Music]

680
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:51,640
wires and uh and we ass and we write we

681
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:54,120
compute all these wires for every layer

682
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:58,080
I we think of this wire as go as going

683
00:30:54,120 --> 00:31:02,279
from H to M to 01 so H is some set and

684
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:05,159
we assume that H to the m is s okay so

685
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:09,919
we just encode these s wires in a kind

686
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:12,519
of cube uh uh M dimensional cube of size

687
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:13,360
H and we just write all the values of

688
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:16,080
the

689
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:19,440
wires okay and then what we do we look

690
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:23,600
at the extension V Tilda which is

691
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:26,159
extends to a field F to the m to F and

692
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:29,000
this is kind of the low degree extension

693
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:32,960
so we take any F that can contains the

694
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:35,200
set H and we extend VI via the low

695
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,880
degree extension so these are things we

696
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:40,120
covered okay now now is the first time

697
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:42,840
you remember when I when we taught gkr I

698
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:45,080
told you okay why I do why not do 0o one

699
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:46,840
to the m you know 0o to the log in it's

700
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:49,440
much natural to think of binary

701
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:51,880
representation of s as opposed to this H

702
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,600
to the m which is what H and I told you

703
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:56,399
how often we like parameters we like to

704
00:31:53,600 --> 00:32:03,039
think of H as

705
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:05,440
login ah sorry log n and M is log n over

706
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:05,440
log log

707
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:14,320
n uh and if you'll see H to the m is

708
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:15,580
just becomes n because uh you can think

709
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,679
of a so H to the

710
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:19,799
[Music]

711
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:22,720
m is log n to the N but log n is just

712
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:22,720
like two log log

713
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:28,600
n to the n and the log log n cancels out

714
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:33,320
so you have two to the

715
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:36,120
again so you have uh oh I did everything

716
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:43,440
everything is s sorry

717
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:43,440
s the N here is s s s

718
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:51,600
s so you have S now remember I told I

719
00:32:49,399 --> 00:32:53,880
told you oh we'll need the set of

720
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:56,200
parameters as opposed to say 01 it's

721
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:58,960
natural to think of H as 01 and M is log

722
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:01,120
n that's much more natural uh we used as

723
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,120
computer science to think in binary now

724
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:05,639
we're thinking of like log ass it's like

725
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:08,120
really how how annoying can you be and

726
00:33:05,639 --> 00:33:12,320
the reason is it's for this now now we

727
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:14,519
need it why now we take F that is going

728
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,519
to

729
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:22,519
be it's going to be extension of size

730
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:22,519
poly

731
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:27,039
logus okay we'll see the poly will need

732
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:29,200
to be big enough we'll talk about in a

733
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:31,120
second but the field we don't we don't

734
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,240
want more than poly log s and the reason

735
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:38,080
is we want

736
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:41,320
F to the m to be

737
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:45,480
polys okay so we know we know that H to

738
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:49,480
the m is s if if uh f is only poly

739
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:49,480
bigger then we have this is poly

740
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:55,960
s okay and that's important for us okay

741
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:57,960
note if H was just 01 so the size of H

742
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:00,360
was two

743
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:02,720
we couldn't keep F poly and to we

744
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:04,919
couldn't keep F constant you'll see F

745
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:08,359
will need to grow with m m f so for

746
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:12,440
soundness m f will need to be

747
00:34:08,359 --> 00:34:15,040
bigger than M *

748
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:18,960
H actually there's also D that will come

749
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:21,839
in it's significantly bigger so if we

750
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:24,200
take H to be two we'll need to take F to

751
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:26,440
be at least log n and then we'll have F

752
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:28,240
to them is log to the power of log n

753
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:31,200
that's more that's super

754
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:35,200
poly and I want after them to be

755
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:37,399
poly okay so we do this so now I so what

756
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:41,000
is the PCP the

757
00:34:37,399 --> 00:34:43,079
PCP so actually I'll write there the PCP

758
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,919
but uh now let's let's just finish

759
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:47,240
recalling the GK so what does the

760
00:34:44,919 --> 00:34:49,839
verifier do in the GK the pro do in the

761
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:54,000
GK he computes all these low degree

762
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:57,160
extensions and then the GK consists of D

763
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,079
phases going from the output layer to

764
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:02,040
the input layer layer where in each

765
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:04,240
phase we run two Su check protocols in

766
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:06,960
parallel where the verifier uses the

767
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:10,480
same Randomness and what what the

768
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:13,280
subject protocol does is it it reduces

769
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:16,320
from checking two values here to

770
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:18,680
reducing checking two values in the

771
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,680
layer below and we kind of go kind of

772
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:22,040
from checking uh until we get to the

773
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,680
input and then input the verifier can

774
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:25,240
check on his own that's the

775
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:28,119
idea

776
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:30,119
okay okay now let's just Rec in a

777
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:33,480
subject protocol here each subject

778
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:35,119
protocol if you uh remember maybe you

779
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:37,200
don't it's not the details are not so

780
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:41,119
important right now but it's kind of you

781
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:44,560
go from VI inex tension which is let's

782
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:47,720
say VI Tilda of some

783
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:50,000
Z and you write it as this is kind of

784
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:54,280
sum

785
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,920
of uh points in the in h to the m

786
00:35:54,280 --> 00:36:01,800
because that's the definition of

787
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:04,079
extension times some k p uh Z this is

788
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,640
the function that checks equality again

789
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:08,319
it's not important but what's important

790
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:12,880
to me to show is that and then you do

791
00:36:08,319 --> 00:36:18,119
sum over P W1 W2 in h of

792
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:21,599
M and you convert VI to either kind of

793
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:25,599
uh a if if if this is a plus gate you

794
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:27,119
convert it to uh like um the plus of the

795
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:29,160
of the wires below with multiplication

796
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:30,839
you check the multiplication so in other

797
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:33,800
words what this

798
00:36:30,839 --> 00:36:36,720
is what this is or I should say what

799
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:39,480
this is let me just open this what is VI

800
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:43,119
P it's if it's an

801
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:43,119
ad if it's an

802
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:52,079
ad P W1 W2 so if Point p is this just

803
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:56,520
the addition of the two wires below then

804
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:58,520
you replace p with W1 with v

805
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:03,920
ius1

806
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:03,920
W1 plus VI -1

807
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:16,000
W2 and plus if it was not an adgate if

808
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,000
it's a

809
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:26,599
mgate then you replace it with the

810
00:37:20,359 --> 00:37:29,839
multiplication of vi- 1 W1 Time vi- 1 W2

811
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:33,160
so just uh right the idea was and all

812
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:35,000
this is times

813
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:37,200
uh this

814
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:42,079
Kai k

815
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:44,839
p z but again how do we go from layer I

816
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:47,040
toay to one layer below we take that

817
00:37:44,839 --> 00:37:48,760
element in the extension we think of it

818
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:51,319
as a sum that's the definition of lree

819
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:54,480
extension it's sum of the elements in

820
00:37:51,319 --> 00:37:57,800
the circuit itself with some with some

821
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:59,839
function uh with some weight and now

822
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:02,599
look at the at the value what what is

823
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:05,720
the value of this gate well if it's an

824
00:38:02,599 --> 00:38:07,920
and if it's an add gate it's the sum of

825
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:09,560
the two children and if it's a mgate it

826
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:13,040
should be the multiplication of the two

827
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:15,640
children and so add I just outputs one

828
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:18,359
of these if you know W1 W2 are the

829
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:21,200
children of P zero otherwise similarly

830
00:38:18,359 --> 00:38:23,000
malt and but we do everything in the

831
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,720
extension uh we look at everything in

832
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,119
the extension because we want to think

833
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:29,359
of it as a polinomial and once we think

834
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:30,680
once we these are all pols then this is

835
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:32,839
just a sum

836
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:35,079
check okay and we saw a sum check how to

837
00:38:32,839 --> 00:38:37,880
do it efficiently so now the point is G

838
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:41,079
consists of only these two D Su checks

839
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:41,079
so now let me go to my

840
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:59,440
PCP a is this so here's uh our PCP

841
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:07,400
essentially my PCP is just gkr but

842
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:10,960
opened up completely completely

843
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:15,760
unraveled so okay so here's my PCP I

844
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:18,040
have my X in W here's what I do I'm

845
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:23,359
going to

846
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:26,599
compute all the V1 V VI Tilda the

847
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:30,400
extension of the values of each of all

848
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:33,440
the gate in each wire for every

849
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:35,280
Z for every Z and F to the

850
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,200
m it's

851
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,240
important this is going to be all this

852
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:41,040
is going to be part of the PCP so if F

853
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:42,079
to m is more than polinomial my PCP is

854
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,280
super

855
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:47,280
polinomial okay so after to them has to

856
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:50,280
be polinomial this is a ready sized

857
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,280
polinomial

858
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:59,319
yeah again sorry we have

859
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:07,200
the oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

860
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:09,800
okay good good good yes so for gkr we

861
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:13,119
had a restriction that the

862
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:15,760
circuit to do gkr we said gkr is like is

863
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:17,280
proving that uh bounded depth circuit

864
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:21,000
and put x equals y and we had a

865
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:24,240
restriction that the circuit has to be B

866
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:26,760
bounded uh space uniform or in other

867
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:29,440
words we needed to ensure that add I and

868
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:32,920
mul this ex extended Andi and extended

869
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:36,359
multi are computed computer

870
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:38,280
efficiently threat has that property

871
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:41,000
okay I again I did go into the details

872
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:42,800
but uh the threet is it's a very unifor

873
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,760
you know given a FNX it's very uniform

874
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:47,440
to check it's a very it is a loog space

875
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:51,040
uniform and then we can convert it as

876
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:55,000
Rachel uh did two weeks ago uh to kind

877
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:58,359
of one that has uh by increasing the the

878
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:02,160
depth by poly factors uh so keeping it

879
00:40:58,359 --> 00:41:04,920
poly log you can make at I at till and

880
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:07,720
multi be efficiently computable so yeah

881
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:10,720
great that's a very good question uh so

882
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:14,280
yes good so this is going to be part of

883
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:17,440
the uh PCP but that's not all uh by the

884
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:20,640
way we should also give uh this we give

885
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:25,000
this for every I from the input layer

886
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:25,000
zero one up to D this is

887
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:30,040
output and this is the input layer

888
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:32,319
we have to give him the input layer

889
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:33,960
because the poor verifi verifier doesn't

890
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:36,000
have W so he doesn't have actually the

891
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:37,839
input before he and do you care he had

892
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,240
the input here he doesn't have the input

893
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:43,760
but we're going to give him the Lo

894
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:45,480
extension of this W okay good now but

895
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:47,599
okay so I'm the verifier what do I do I

896
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:50,400
need to verify the sum checks who do I

897
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:53,000
interact with Su checks I'll put all the

898
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:56,440
possible answers in the Oracle so now we

899
00:41:53,000 --> 00:42:01,640
do two DM checks okay so okay so for

900
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:01,640
every pass possible for okay for every

901
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,920
ey and for every

902
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:10,520
[Applause]

903
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:12,280
Z in the GTR protocol we may need to do

904
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:14,560
a sum check because in the sum Che

905
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:16,359
protocol what is in the GK what does it

906
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:19,119
how does it look like the ver the

907
00:42:16,359 --> 00:42:20,520
verifier first decides okay prove the

908
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:23,599
output layer is correct let's say the

909
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:25,319
output the Z is fixed fine then he

910
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:27,839
chooses Randomness Randomness Randomness

911
00:42:25,319 --> 00:42:32,720
in a some check it reduces is the

912
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:35,640
checking Z D minus one in a random

913
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:36,880
Z the the Z is determined by the random

914
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:39,400
coins of the

915
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:42,240
verifier so which Z do I put and I want

916
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:44,280
to show something for every possible Z

917
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:48,599
so for every possible I for every

918
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:50,680
possible Z I'm going to put in the PCP a

919
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:52,880
sum check a sum check so I'm going to

920
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:56,040
give a a su check I'm going to add kind

921
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,040
of all the possible

922
00:42:56,119 --> 00:43:00,920
transcript for some check corresponding

923
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:04,480
to

924
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:11,400
VI which VI

925
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:13,440
Z or maybe to v i equals VI till the Z

926
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:14,240
so for every I and Z I'm going to give a

927
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,800
some

928
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:20,240
check with respect

929
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:23,000
to Randomness R from the from the

930
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:26,200
verifier so for every I for every Z and

931
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,880
for any Randomness R of the verifier now

932
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:30,920
what is how much Randomness that the

933
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:35,000
verifier use in a sum check protocol so

934
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:39,920
remember the sum check is sum over H to

935
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:43,760
the 3M kind of variables okay sum over p

936
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:48,200
p W1 W2 all of them in h to the m so the

937
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:50,599
r is going to be for every R in F to the

938
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:53,680
3M because in the subject protocol what

939
00:43:50,599 --> 00:43:55,760
you do is every single H you every

940
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:57,400
single kind of uh you have three M

941
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:00,280
variables every one you give a random

942
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:03,599
field element to kind of reduce get rid

943
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:07,599
of one of the sums so the verifier will

944
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:10,599
use will choose kind of R1 up to

945
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:13,800
r3m so 3M field

946
00:44:10,599 --> 00:44:16,119
elements so for every Poss for for every

947
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:18,040
hour I'm going to actually give you the

948
00:44:16,119 --> 00:44:20,599
transcript so now I know I'm going to

949
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,599
give you the entire

950
00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:26,640
transcript okay but here's the thing I

951
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,160
so I'm gonna have a su check for for all

952
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:30,960
of them and now the verifier okay but we

953
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:32,839
need to be careful we don't just give

954
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:36,760
for every R subject if I knew R I would

955
00:44:32,839 --> 00:44:39,680
cheat so what I what what I mean here is

956
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:44,319
for every Su check for every Z

957
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:47,040
VI for every our so so uh for every

958
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:50,240
R1 I'm going to give all the outputs for

959
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:52,800
R1 like all the kind of answers of the

960
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:55,520
Su check for R1 then for each one of

961
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:57,640
them for every R2 I have all the

962
00:44:55,520 --> 00:45:00,119
possible answers so no competition you

963
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:04,000
can't have two different element you

964
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:08,200
can't have one value if you had R1 R2

965
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:10,440
but later different RS or R1 R2 it for

966
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:13,400
every for every possible partial

967
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:18,040
transcript you give a value that's what

968
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:20,720
the PCP has in it okay so for every so

969
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:23,680
yeah I should say yeah so for every eye

970
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:25,280
for every Z and for every maybe I should

971
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:29,359
write it

972
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:32,440
as R1 up to

973
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:36,960
r3m I have a

974
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:40,440
transcript all the part I I should have

975
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:43,440
all all

976
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:43,440
partial

977
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:55,280
transcripts of sum

978
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:58,040
check with with respect to VI IAL v

979
00:45:55,280 --> 00:46:02,839
z and

980
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:02,839
Randomness no R1 up to RJ for every

981
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:14,960
J okay between uh I don't know

982
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,960
one and 3

983
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:22,520
m okay so for every for every for every

984
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:26,359
I for every R1 I will say what would be

985
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:29,079
my answer so now I have F to the m

986
00:46:26,359 --> 00:46:31,480
answers for every one of these answers

987
00:46:29,079 --> 00:46:34,040
for every R2 I'm going to tell you what

988
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:37,440
is the answer for

989
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:39,880
every sorry I I said I said it wrong for

990
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:42,640
every R1 I would give all the answer I

991
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:45,079
have F each one each one is one field so

992
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:47,480
for every R1 I'll tell you the answer

993
00:46:45,079 --> 00:46:50,240
that's F options because there are F

994
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:53,160
options for R1 and then out of these f

995
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:55,480
for each of these FS for every R2 I'm

996
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:58,400
going to give you what the prover will

997
00:46:55,480 --> 00:47:00,440
send that F that's f squ and then for

998
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:03,400
each of these I'm going to give you R3

999
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:08,760
so really what this PCP for every VI for

1000
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:11,960
every such VI or for every kind of v i

1001
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:14,079
z for every possible R1 I'm going to

1002
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:15,800
give you this is over R1 I'm going to

1003
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:18,480
give you the possible answers in the sum

1004
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:19,800
check protocol like if the pro in the Su

1005
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:22,480
if the verer in the sum check protocol

1006
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:23,800
the first Randomness was this R1 this R1

1007
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:27,000
this R1 I'm going to write all of these

1008
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:30,280
in the PCP and then for each R1 and

1009
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:33,760
every possible R2 I'm going to write my

1010
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:35,880
answers and then for each R1 R2 for

1011
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:37,839
every possible R3 I'm going to write my

1012
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:40,680
answers it seems like an exponential

1013
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:43,280
tree and it is an exponential tree but

1014
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:45,800
that the depth is so small so this is a

1015
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:49,280
huge tree but this tree is only of size

1016
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:53,000
F to the m or to the 3M

1017
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:55,079
sorry which is polinomial it's it's uh s

1018
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,720
to the 3 and you're right that you know

1019
00:47:55,079 --> 00:47:57,520
this is not good enough for practice but

1020
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,480
uh

1021
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:01,760
then there's a lot of optimizations on

1022
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:03,760
the gkr that make it quasi linear and

1023
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:06,359
today even linear so you can actually

1024
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:09,400
optimize this to get uh you know uh

1025
00:48:06,359 --> 00:48:11,760
linear time but uh but or uh but or

1026
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:13,720
quasi linear as a PCP but but for now we

1027
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,760
don't care about these a polinomial is

1028
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:18,319
good enough for

1029
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:20,480
us okay so for every I and for every Z

1030
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:23,800
we give this

1031
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,800
tree that's the

1032
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:28,720
PTP that's it

1033
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,920
okay so again

1034
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:41,559
yeah good good good good good fantastic

1035
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:44,400
you're like wait that's a problem do we

1036
00:48:41,559 --> 00:48:48,000
if I require F to be small do we even

1037
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:52,040
get soundness that's a great question so

1038
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:54,680
the answer is barely but yes so let's

1039
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:58,000
see what's the okay what is the

1040
00:48:54,680 --> 00:49:00,559
soundness that we get for to be sound

1041
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,480
each Su check so the the okay so let's

1042
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:05,319
talk about

1043
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:05,319
soundness maybe I'll put it

1044
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:11,640
here let's talk about soundness here for

1045
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:13,640
a second because you rais a very but you

1046
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:15,119
know what actually before we talk about

1047
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:16,720
soundness I I'll jump to soundness you

1048
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:18,799
have a very good point I'll we'll talk

1049
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:21,160
about soundness but just to make sure

1050
00:49:18,799 --> 00:49:25,319
the construction is clear okay so let me

1051
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:28,079
just reiterate one last time I'm a PCP

1052
00:49:25,319 --> 00:49:30,079
prover I want to convince you guys that

1053
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:34,680
I have a satisfying assignment to a

1054
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:37,079
threat formula I have my w what I do I

1055
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:40,280
construct low deegree extension of my w

1056
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:42,440
my witness but also I have this entire

1057
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:43,839
circuit that verifies this witness and

1058
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:46,520
I'm going to construct a low degree

1059
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:48,559
extension of each and every layer in

1060
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:49,599
this circuit now the way I wrote it

1061
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:51,720
actually I will construct a low degree

1062
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:53,680
extension of X and W that's kind of if I

1063
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:55,960
think of the input as X and W I need the

1064
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:58,040
constru L degree extension of both but

1065
00:49:55,960 --> 00:50:00,000
you the verifying Knows X so if I

1066
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:02,000
construct a low degree extension of w he

1067
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:06,200
himself can construct a low extension of

1068
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:08,480
X and W together so in the PCP because I

1069
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:11,599
don't want to in the PCP I don't want to

1070
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:13,200
put X in there the verifier has X and if

1071
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:14,520
I have the freedom to put X in there and

1072
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:18,160
you don't read it then I can put the

1073
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:20,760
wrong X so I'm just going to put

1074
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:23,119
v0 is just going to

1075
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:25,319
be of the witness I'm going to think of

1076
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:27,720
X as fixed so I'm just going to

1077
00:50:25,319 --> 00:50:28,680
construct the loading extension of W and

1078
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:31,599
then I'm going to construct the low

1079
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:33,599
degree extension of each and every layer

1080
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:36,480
of the of the

1081
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:38,960
circuit and I'm going to go for every

1082
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:40,920
layer and for every Z I'm going to

1083
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:44,559
construct all the

1084
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:47,079
possible Pro messages in the Su protocol

1085
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:50,880
now because the randomness the options

1086
00:50:47,079 --> 00:50:53,200
for the for the uh the number of

1087
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:55,960
possible random bits for the from the

1088
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:57,440
verifier is only F to the 3M because

1089
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:58,799
there's 3M

1090
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:01,960
uh

1091
00:50:58,799 --> 00:51:03,160
a variables and F is the field so it's

1092
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:06,400
only F to the

1093
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:08,880
3M then this tree is only going to be of

1094
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:11,760
size after the 3M so it's not too

1095
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:15,559
bad and I put all of them I put all the

1096
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:18,079
possible Su checks in there so sorry

1097
00:51:15,559 --> 00:51:20,839
it's F to the 3M for every I have this

1098
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:23,559
size for every I and for every Z okay so

1099
00:51:20,839 --> 00:51:26,960
for every I I is only D this is small

1100
00:51:23,559 --> 00:51:28,079
and Z is another F to them I pay fine so

1101
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:32,319
after to the

1102
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:33,680
4M okay so for every Z and for every I I

1103
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:36,400
have the sum

1104
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:38,520
check now what the what is so that's

1105
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:40,040
that's the PCP but now what's what does

1106
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:42,359
the verifier do what does v I need to

1107
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:46,160
Define I told you how to construct this

1108
00:51:42,359 --> 00:51:49,079
Pi efficiently and it's uh but what does

1109
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:52,000
v do so what does what V

1110
00:51:49,079 --> 00:51:54,839
does he says I'm going to pretend that

1111
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,880
I'm I'm interacting with the gkr prover

1112
00:51:54,839 --> 00:51:58,680
so he says look what is out he's going

1113
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:00,839
to read the output

1114
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:02,520
VD and he's going to expect a one if he

1115
00:52:00,839 --> 00:52:03,799
sees a zero so that's one query I'm

1116
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:07,960
going to read the output is it's one

1117
00:52:03,799 --> 00:52:10,520
good I'm happy okay now he's going to go

1118
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:13,079
from verifying D to verifying D minus

1119
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:14,480
one D minus 2 D minus 3 now he he wants

1120
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:16,599
to talk to aover he said okay here's my

1121
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:19,319
Randomness my first message in the sum

1122
00:52:16,599 --> 00:52:21,200
check give me back something okay he

1123
00:52:19,319 --> 00:52:24,400
this is the approver the Prov is fixed

1124
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:28,839
in the PCP okay so he gets back an

1125
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:35,200
answer good now here these at the end

1126
00:52:28,839 --> 00:52:37,640
this defines V IUS one Z this this

1127
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:40,000
should be all kind of uh elements in V

1128
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:42,520
minus one Z now actually here what you

1129
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:45,760
have here is at the end of the gkr

1130
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:47,119
protocol you're left with two two two V

1131
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:49,720
two v's right so if you verify here

1132
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:52,799
you'll have like at the end you'll have

1133
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:54,680
like V I don't know zero and v z z0 and

1134
00:52:52,799 --> 00:52:55,960
Z1 you know you'll verify you need to

1135
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:58,960
verify two points because we did two

1136
00:52:55,960 --> 00:53:01,280
something called ways so fine he sees

1137
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:03,680
these two he checks there's these he

1138
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:06,440
checks that they're equal this is only

1139
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:08,960
one okay so we're giving him all the low

1140
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:11,599
degree extension of VI minus one he

1141
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:13,559
checks oh yeah this is corresponds this

1142
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:15,280
corresponds this is just to ensure that

1143
00:53:13,559 --> 00:53:18,280
he doesn't put different ones in

1144
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:21,040
different you know here he may uh you

1145
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:23,160
know and in this Branch he may put the

1146
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:25,079
value of z0 to be something and in this

1147
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:27,319
Branch you may put the value of z0 to be

1148
00:53:25,079 --> 00:53:29,280
something else that's

1149
00:53:27,319 --> 00:53:31,440
that's not not good for us so we just

1150
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:33,680
check because he put aside all the low

1151
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:36,319
degree extensions so we check that it's

1152
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:37,119
equal to what he gave us and we continue

1153
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:41,400
with

1154
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:41,400
that okay

1155
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:53,799
um one second actually I'm not sure

1156
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:56,559
maybe what I said is incorrect I'm not

1157
00:53:53,799 --> 00:53:58,599
actually sure that this is a problem

1158
00:53:56,559 --> 00:54:01,079
even if he gives us different let me

1159
00:53:58,599 --> 00:54:04,079
think about it for a

1160
00:54:01,079 --> 00:54:04,079
second

1161
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:13,839
a yeah actually I'm not even sure that

1162
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:18,559
we need we can just put the Su checks

1163
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:22,559
even if he gives us even if he gives

1164
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:22,559
us a

1165
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:32,760
no okay yeah I want to say even if he

1166
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:35,760
gives us in this branch and this Branch

1167
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:37,119
different things uh why do we care it's

1168
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:39,240
like we run the sum check the sum check

1169
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:41,240
is sound but we we do care a little bit

1170
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:44,119
because then in the next

1171
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:47,480
round

1172
00:54:44,119 --> 00:54:49,559
which let me think you know what I'm not

1173
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:52,920
actually

1174
00:54:49,559 --> 00:54:52,920
what lay

1175
00:54:54,920 --> 00:55:00,240
theand exactly you you let all the verif

1176
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:03,000
so yeah so I don't think actually you

1177
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:06,839
need to give these specific you can just

1178
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:08,040
give give for every VI Tilda you give

1179
00:55:06,839 --> 00:55:11,400
but it's the same because you give for

1180
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:13,359
every VI Tilda so actually I think these

1181
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:15,960
two are the same so I okay what I I

1182
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:19,359
guess what I said is uh you know these

1183
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:20,599
can be maybe V uh VI minus one of z0

1184
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:21,480
appears here and it appears here and

1185
00:55:20,599 --> 00:55:24,039
they're

1186
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:25,960
different are we worried we're not

1187
00:55:24,039 --> 00:55:27,319
really worried because it's like you

1188
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:29,200
think of it it interacts with the prover

1189
00:55:27,319 --> 00:55:30,880
the prover the cheating prover may give

1190
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:33,240
him different Z here and different Z

1191
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:35,240
here but later the point is later you'll

1192
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:37,240
have in VI minus one you'll just

1193
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:39,520
continue so actually you just need to

1194
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:40,720
give but but but really I think the two

1195
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:43,039
are equivalent so it doesn't really

1196
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:44,720
matter a okay so this is the pp and

1197
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:46,839
that's how you verify and at the end at

1198
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:48,760
the end of the end of the gkr the

1199
00:55:46,839 --> 00:55:50,319
verifier needs to read the input he

1200
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:52,480
needs to check the input and some load

1201
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:56,799
in some locations he doesn't have the

1202
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:59,720
input but he does because we gave him

1203
00:55:56,799 --> 00:56:01,960
the low degree extension of w so once he

1204
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:05,319
has the low degree extension of w he can

1205
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:07,319
compute anything uh he so the verifier

1206
00:56:05,319 --> 00:56:11,119
needs to

1207
00:56:07,319 --> 00:56:13,319
compute a low degree extension of X in W

1208
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:17,200
but any point in the low degree

1209
00:56:13,319 --> 00:56:19,680
extension of X and W is a point in the

1210
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:21,880
low degree EXT is a sum of points in the

1211
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:25,039
low degree extension of X and point in

1212
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:28,119
the Lo extension of w so every every

1213
00:56:25,039 --> 00:56:31,880
point in the low degree extension of X

1214
00:56:28,119 --> 00:56:33,680
and W you can write as a weighted sum of

1215
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:35,160
a point in the lowre low degree

1216
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:38,000
extension of X and a point in the Lo

1217
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:39,920
extension of w so you know once he needs

1218
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,799
to read the point in the Lo extension of

1219
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:46,119
w he has it here so that's all that's

1220
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:48,440
all the verifier does so he really he's

1221
00:56:46,119 --> 00:56:49,960
it's interesting this PCP he as if he's

1222
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:52,160
talking to the prover but the prover is

1223
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:55,240
sitting in the sky in the

1224
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:57,599
PCP the pro strategy just kind of opened

1225
00:56:55,240 --> 00:57:01,160
up in in the

1226
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:03,039
Oracle okay okay great so now any

1227
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:06,039
questions before we talk about

1228
00:57:03,039 --> 00:57:06,039
soundness

1229
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:16,520
yeah so right so uh okay good good good

1230
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:18,599
good good question the verify great

1231
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:20,960
question the verifier needs to check

1232
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:24,200
also that all these things are actually

1233
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:27,680
low deegree extension okay so what if I

1234
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:29,480
I I said here oh put um you put VI Tilda

1235
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:31,200
Z how do I know that you actually put a

1236
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:34,359
low degree extension maybe you put a

1237
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:36,960
very high degree polinomial there maybe

1238
00:57:34,359 --> 00:57:38,520
you just put an arbitrary truth table of

1239
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:40,680
size after

1240
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:43,400
them that would be

1241
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:44,960
problematic so you're totally right the

1242
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:47,359
verifier so let let me write what the

1243
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:50,520
verifier does uh maybe before the sound

1244
00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:50,520
is yeah

1245
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:58,119
so let me actually write it okay so the

1246
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:58,119
verifier

1247
00:58:00,119 --> 00:58:07,799
okay he

1248
00:58:02,039 --> 00:58:07,799
runs first thing he does he runs V of

1249
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:12,480
gkr with its

1250
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:21,319
Oracle okay so he runs the just the gkr

1251
00:58:18,599 --> 00:58:24,119
but he thinks of kind of the Oracle part

1252
00:58:21,319 --> 00:58:26,359
as kind of the the prover he's talking

1253
00:58:24,119 --> 00:58:29,920
with and the other thing he needs needs

1254
00:58:26,359 --> 00:58:29,920
to do is he needs to

1255
00:58:30,839 --> 00:58:37,680
check that for every

1256
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:43,880
I VI

1257
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:43,880
Tilda is of low degree is

1258
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:03,160
doesn't

1259
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:28,039
um yeah what you're saying is that if

1260
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:28,039
you're right so what you're saying is a

1261
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:38,319
okay what you're saying is if he comp If

1262
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:38,319
he if he gave VI Tilda that was high

1263
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:45,000
degree then you're saying that GK would

1264
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:46,480
fail you you would be rejected by the GK

1265
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:52,319
should

1266
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:52,319
bewi it should be rejected by the GK a

1267
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:04,200
I think you may be right but actually

1268
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:09,520
I'm not 100% sure now

1269
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:09,520
uh yeah that

1270
01:00:10,119 --> 01:00:14,760
ISE yeah so here's here's the concern

1271
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:16,440
here's the concern the concern is we

1272
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:19,520
want to make sure that the

1273
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:22,520
verifier is uh

1274
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:27,599
behaving like that we want to okay we

1275
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:27,599
want to make sure that this VI Tilda

1276
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:32,960
is of low

1277
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:32,960
degree

1278
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:41,359
why sorry one second

1279
01:00:46,319 --> 01:00:51,480
um yeah actually I I

1280
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:02,480
I don't think we need to check that via

1281
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:04,359
is a low degree because I I agree that

1282
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:06,200
we need to check that VI is a low degree

1283
01:01:04,359 --> 01:01:08,400
but I think gkr checks that the vi till

1284
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:11,079
there's a low degree so I actually don't

1285
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:15,520
want to recheck it so all I want to do

1286
01:01:11,079 --> 01:01:17,599
here I think GK test tests it for you so

1287
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:20,680
we're convinced that the gkr is sound

1288
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:23,400
let's not recall why it sound but let's

1289
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:25,920
remember we we learned that it sound so

1290
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:27,520
GK is good now what are we doing I

1291
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:30,799
essentially what we're saying is

1292
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:32,960
verifier I'm giving you all the possible

1293
01:01:30,799 --> 01:01:34,720
answers of I'm what is the prover the

1294
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:36,440
prover is a tree you can think what is a

1295
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:39,280
cheating prover a cheating prover for

1296
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:41,319
every possible you know for every

1297
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:42,599
possible question he gives you an answer

1298
01:01:41,319 --> 01:01:45,839
for every question he gives you an

1299
01:01:42,599 --> 01:01:47,599
answer that's what it does so now you're

1300
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:50,240
saying look I'm going to give you the

1301
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:54,160
tree now in general this tree is really

1302
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:58,160
really big and even in gkr if you give

1303
01:01:54,160 --> 01:02:02,440
the entire if you just open like GK has

1304
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:05,880
D rounds D rounds of su Che if you just

1305
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:07,520
open the S Che it will be terrible

1306
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:10,960
however

1307
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:13,480
a gkr has this property that it's kind

1308
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:17,039
of memory lless what do I mean by memory

1309
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:19,799
list you can compute the first Su check

1310
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:21,760
then you don't care what happened before

1311
01:02:19,799 --> 01:02:24,400
all you care is what is VI minus one

1312
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:27,440
that you cut and you check

1313
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:29,559
those so now I'm saying so you know

1314
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:32,359
actually for let's think about this

1315
01:02:29,559 --> 01:02:35,640
first of all we can say open gkr to a

1316
01:02:32,359 --> 01:02:37,240
huge tree okay any pro this is true in

1317
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:39,359
in general if you had any interactive

1318
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:41,079
proof you can think of a pro write all

1319
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:43,480
the possible answers like think of its

1320
01:02:41,079 --> 01:02:45,440
kind of H strategy as a huge huge tree

1321
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:46,599
right the tree now of course you get

1322
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:48,839
sound this you interact with the

1323
01:02:46,599 --> 01:02:51,680
approver what's the difference okay you

1324
01:02:48,839 --> 01:02:53,720
can do that with G but of course if you

1325
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:56,440
do this huge tree it's going to be

1326
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:58,640
gigantic because GK consists of d kind

1327
01:02:56,440 --> 01:03:02,240
of um

1328
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:04,599
a uh subprotocols each one is a su check

1329
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:07,039
so now if you think of like a D Cab then

1330
01:03:04,599 --> 01:03:10,400
you'll be too big but I'm saying we

1331
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:12,640
don't need to because gkr has a property

1332
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:14,920
that actually it consist of this

1333
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:17,160
subprotocol and then all you need to

1334
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:19,640
remember you don't need to remember

1335
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:22,920
which branch you're on here all you need

1336
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:24,279
to remember is what are the values here

1337
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:26,760
that's all you need to

1338
01:03:24,279 --> 01:03:28,799
remember so there's no point in

1339
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:31,359
repeating it's like you're repeating the

1340
01:03:28,799 --> 01:03:34,319
tree for no reason so all you need

1341
01:03:31,359 --> 01:03:36,200
there's a way to open kind of this Pro

1342
01:03:34,319 --> 01:03:38,920
in a more efficient

1343
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:40,920
way so by not giving the entire tree and

1344
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:44,039
giving kind of a more efficient kind of

1345
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:47,079
opening where all the vi Z all the vi

1346
01:03:44,039 --> 01:03:48,680
IUS one Z I'm going to say okay forget

1347
01:03:47,079 --> 01:03:51,359
about it let's just go from VI minus one

1348
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:54,680
Z and continue why do you need to repeat

1349
01:03:51,359 --> 01:03:56,640
this kind of tree a 100 times it's it's

1350
01:03:54,680 --> 01:04:00,480
but it's you can go go from here to kind

1351
01:03:56,640 --> 01:04:00,480
of simulating an entire GK

1352
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:04,720
approver yeah if I understand correctly

1353
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:08,160
you're saying like actually the tree of

1354
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:09,520
gkr is such that most of the parts cof

1355
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:11,000
right and so you don't need to repeat

1356
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:13,240
the copies you can just look it up

1357
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:16,240
exactly exactly

1358
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:16,240
exactly

1359
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:21,000
exactly actually in some sense we're

1360
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:22,640
restricting the prover here more than

1361
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:25,920
he's restricted in

1362
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:28,839
gkr exactly because in gkr he can be you

1363
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:31,119
know what I'm going to remember the RS

1364
01:04:28,839 --> 01:04:33,079
if he's cheating and based on the RS I'm

1365
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:34,760
going to give you a different strategy

1366
01:04:33,079 --> 01:04:36,799
whatever here we're not even letting him

1367
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:38,119
do that we're telling look you tell me

1368
01:04:36,799 --> 01:04:40,880
what you are here from here now you

1369
01:04:38,119 --> 01:04:43,200
forget Ours from VI minus one what's

1370
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:44,559
your strategy and now you forget from

1371
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:48,000
here what is your

1372
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:50,599
strategy so we're really just doing gkr

1373
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:53,920
now you're right at the vi minus one do

1374
01:04:50,599 --> 01:04:56,039
till they do need to be of low degree

1375
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:58,279
but do the Gare test this for you so you

1376
01:04:56,039 --> 01:05:00,599
don't need to do it on your

1377
01:04:58,279 --> 01:05:02,039
own but you're right it's confusing a

1378
01:05:00,599 --> 01:05:03,520
little bit because if you if any if

1379
01:05:02,039 --> 01:05:04,880
anyone is familiar with the PCP

1380
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:07,799
literature there's always a low deegree

1381
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:09,440
test in it so it's kind of interesting

1382
01:05:07,799 --> 01:05:10,599
this this kind of is hidden with within

1383
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:13,839
the Gare

1384
01:05:10,599 --> 01:05:17,119
protocol this kind of transformation not

1385
01:05:13,839 --> 01:05:21,000
only as as there is efficient way to

1386
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:22,319
change the into a sequence that the know

1387
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:25,799
where

1388
01:05:22,319 --> 01:05:28,559
to exactly exactly so yeah this this

1389
01:05:25,799 --> 01:05:30,960
proof holds it's not specific to gkr

1390
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:33,559
it's kind of you can take any sixing

1391
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:35,720
protocol and and interactive protocol

1392
01:05:33,559 --> 01:05:39,680
and lay it open however let me just

1393
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:43,400
mention we have very few actually kind

1394
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:45,119
of two examples of suing protocols so it

1395
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:46,920
sound like you can take any of your

1396
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:50,520
choice yeah any but we don't have much

1397
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:52,680
choice so uh you know a coming up with

1398
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:55,279
these succinct interactive proofs is a

1399
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:57,039
super interesting question I'll I'll

1400
01:05:55,279 --> 01:05:59,559
talk a little bit more about this after

1401
01:05:57,039 --> 01:06:03,200
we do the analysis of the

1402
01:05:59,559 --> 01:06:07,520
PCB okay so great

1403
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:09,240
uh any questions before we move to

1404
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:11,720
soundness okay so let's talk about

1405
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:14,520
soundness and the question that was

1406
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:16,559
raised which was a great question is

1407
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:18,440
Wait f needs to be big to get soundness

1408
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:20,880
so let's really understand what the size

1409
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:23,279
of f needs to be so to get soundness we

1410
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:25,400
do 2D Su check

1411
01:06:23,279 --> 01:06:27,079
protocols each Su check protocol needs

1412
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:28,359
to be pretty sound because it's enough

1413
01:06:27,079 --> 01:06:29,960
that you cheat on one of them and we're

1414
01:06:28,359 --> 01:06:33,200
dead right

1415
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:35,400
so now each Su Che protocol this is this

1416
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:37,559
is just

1417
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:41,440
recall that

1418
01:06:37,559 --> 01:06:45,039
each Su check

1419
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:45,039
protocol has sound

1420
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:54,680
is which is

1421
01:06:48,839 --> 01:06:57,920
H over F times M the number of variables

1422
01:06:54,680 --> 01:07:00,559
but for us it's 3M because we have 3M

1423
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:03,880
variables okay this is just the the each

1424
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:05,440
subject protocol now for us so you can

1425
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:08,240
cheat but with this

1426
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:10,720
probability now for us we have 2D D is

1427
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:14,200
poly Logan like the depth of the circuit

1428
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:14,200
so for us our sound

1429
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:23,520
is is I'm just doing a union bound so to

1430
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:26,000
cheat there exist needs to be at least

1431
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:29,760
kind of uh one subject protoc for which

1432
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:33,799
you cheated on so you get by Union bound

1433
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:36,359
so we have 2D sum checks and then

1434
01:07:33,799 --> 01:07:36,359
therefore the

1435
01:07:36,799 --> 01:07:45,520
soundness is 2D * 3 m h divided by

1436
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:51,240
F so now if we want sound this half

1437
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,960
let's say which is what we want after

1438
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:56,839
that you can repeat to increase the

1439
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:58,839
soundness all we need is that F so if we

1440
01:07:56,839 --> 01:08:03,880
want this to be smaller than

1441
01:07:58,839 --> 01:08:06,319
half then we need F to be bigger than uh

1442
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:10,000
12 D

1443
01:08:06,319 --> 01:08:12,920
MH but that's good this is log N I don't

1444
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:14,640
know if you guys can see H log s sorry

1445
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:18,480
this is smaller than log

1446
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:21,199
s this is some poly log s okay so just

1447
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:23,000
make it bigger than all of them it's

1448
01:08:21,199 --> 01:08:25,600
still

1449
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:29,480
polylog and polylog S is good enough

1450
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:29,480
because then after them is

1451
01:08:40,719 --> 01:08:44,719
polys okay so this was sound

1452
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:54,159
is oh oh good why do we need you're

1453
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:56,799
saying why can't it be bigger because

1454
01:08:54,159 --> 01:08:59,319
good because we want our PCP to be of so

1455
01:08:56,799 --> 01:09:01,120
the question is just to recap why do we

1456
01:08:59,319 --> 01:09:03,080
need why do we insist that f is not

1457
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:05,640
bigger why does it have to be poom

1458
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:08,719
related to F and the reason is we want

1459
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:12,080
the PCP to beide polys we want the ver

1460
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:13,640
we want the PCP a to be not we want it

1461
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:17,279
to be efficient we want to efficiently

1462
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:20,640
convert a witness to a PCP and the PCP

1463
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:22,679
grows with f to the m much more it's

1464
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:28,000
like f to the 3M and it needs to be

1465
01:09:22,679 --> 01:09:32,000
repeated and F to the m is poly so okay

1466
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:35,400
it's if this is bigger than poly if f is

1467
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:38,400
more than poly H then F to the m will be

1468
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:40,239
more than poly H to the m so that's why

1469
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:42,960
we want we want it to be it's for the

1470
01:09:40,239 --> 01:09:47,040
sake of efficiency for the for the PCP

1471
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:50,000
to be small or palomi related to the

1472
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:52,040
Circuit um so here you saying that the

1473
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:54,040
randomness complexity is poly now

1474
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:56,360
normally you'd be like okay the pro size

1475
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:59,880
is just two to the random but You' like

1476
01:09:56,360 --> 01:10:02,400
more right you found a way to make than

1477
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:04,159
it would be okay good good good so now

1478
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:06,280
let's go to the we didn't do the

1479
01:10:04,159 --> 01:10:07,440
complexity yet but yeah you're a bit a

1480
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:09,880
bit ahead of me but you're you're

1481
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:11,880
totally right so now so so far we talked

1482
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:13,719
about soundness completeness is one

1483
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:15,760
because the G is complete has

1484
01:10:13,719 --> 01:10:17,600
completeness one so we the Su check has

1485
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:19,360
completeness one so we're good we talked

1486
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:22,320
about Su checks any question about

1487
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:22,320
soundness any question about the

1488
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:28,480
soundness okay uh let's talk about the

1489
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:31,080
complexity the so uh the randomness

1490
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:33,800
complexity in the communic in the query

1491
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:38,280
complexity so how much query and

1492
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:42,920
Randomness do we need so the randomness

1493
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:46,199
complexity is well there's 2D a so let's

1494
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:46,199
put here

1495
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:57,719
Randomness so there's 2D sum check so

1496
01:10:54,640 --> 01:11:00,679
the verifier kind of he interacts with

1497
01:10:57,719 --> 01:11:04,400
his Oracle on 2D sum checks so for each

1498
01:11:00,679 --> 01:11:06,600
2D sum checks he needs to toss coins now

1499
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:11,080
how much coins does he toss well he

1500
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:14,480
needs to generate our random in F to the

1501
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:19,560
3M that's a su each Su check you need so

1502
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:22,560
it's F to the it's like 3M log F bits of

1503
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:26,320
Randomness now this is really poly log F

1504
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:31,600
it's it's it's uh it's like poly s it's

1505
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:37,280
not log s okay this is really poly not

1506
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:39,920
not poly log s not just logs so one can

1507
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:41,520
be wait we need to be careful because uh

1508
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:43,760
are we sure we're getting an efficient

1509
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:46,239
PCP here it's a lot of Randomness are we

1510
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:48,360
sure there's no blow up in PCP and the

1511
01:11:46,239 --> 01:11:52,520
reason there's no blow up the reason we

1512
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:56,080
have large Randomness yet the the PCP is

1513
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:59,360
small is exactly because GK has this

1514
01:11:56,080 --> 01:12:00,880
property of forgetting this uh the fact

1515
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:03,760
we actually don't need to open the

1516
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:06,800
entire tree because of that we use kind

1517
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:09,520
of an additional property if the point

1518
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:11,800
is if you know nothing about the

1519
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:13,280
PCP then of course as I said if it's

1520
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:15,920
order log as bits of Randomness it's

1521
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:17,520
always the size PS but the fact that

1522
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:20,040
there more bits of Randomness does not

1523
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:21,600
necessarily Force our PCP to be bigger

1524
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:24,360
we're just not going to open it like

1525
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:26,600
trivially like oh if if we did open it

1526
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:28,080
trivially then we would look at all the

1527
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:30,000
around it would be a huge tree like the

1528
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:32,400
depth but because we do it kind of we

1529
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:35,199
pack it efficiently we're able to get a

1530
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:37,120
small PCP even though we have a lot of

1531
01:12:35,199 --> 01:12:40,239
Randomness is it because you're saying

1532
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:42,880
each tree is size poly and po exactly

1533
01:12:40,239 --> 01:12:46,000
each tree is size poly and they're poly

1534
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:47,520
trees and we're not like there's a more

1535
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:50,639
kind of straightforward way to do it is

1536
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:53,600
for each tree a pen a p like in no we're

1537
01:12:50,639 --> 01:12:57,600
we're kind of doing them in chunks uh

1538
01:12:53,600 --> 01:13:00,520
and so we get the the

1539
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:03,440
efficiency okay uh let's go let's go for

1540
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:03,440
the uh query

1541
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:09,239
complexity okay I'll just put it

1542
01:13:09,639 --> 01:13:16,080
here so let's see so for again what's

1543
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:20,040
the query he does gkr so he does

1544
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:22,600
2D sum checks for each sum check he

1545
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:26,360
needs to read kind of what's what what

1546
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:29,800
the answer is each answer so there's

1547
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:32,679
three M rounds that he needs to read in

1548
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:36,120
each answer he gets kind of a univariate

1549
01:13:32,679 --> 01:13:37,600
polinomial of small degree so he that

1550
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:39,280
each answer is not just one field

1551
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:41,560
element it's actually a few field

1552
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:45,320
elements

1553
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:45,320
um a

1554
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:57,040
so it's so he gets log F

1555
01:13:52,719 --> 01:13:57,040
elements times a

1556
01:13:59,239 --> 01:14:04,320
um the degree which will be in each Su

1557
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:08,080
check like poly

1558
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:10,480
H and most and this again goes back to

1559
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:13,080
the gold what's exactly the degree of

1560
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:15,719
the a multi it's polinomial so I'm not

1561
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:18,560
it's polinomial in h it's poly log H I

1562
01:14:15,719 --> 01:14:23,679
don't want this is kind of the

1563
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:26,679
degree of uh each of the Su check

1564
01:14:23,679 --> 01:14:26,679
polinomial

1565
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:31,560
and the degrees affected by the ADI and

1566
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:32,400
multi which we assumed are the degree is

1567
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:37,080
like

1568
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:40,000
poly uh but it's still again polylog so

1569
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:43,520
this gives so okay so before we take a

1570
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:47,480
break H let

1571
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:50,239
me where where where are we now uh so

1572
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:52,679
you know we studied the we started

1573
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:55,199
actually this this class by looking at

1574
01:14:52,679 --> 01:14:57,280
some check so I started this class by

1575
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:58,880
telling you look some Che is a miracle

1576
01:14:57,280 --> 01:15:01,920
like giving some Che it gives you

1577
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:04,600
everything everything and I hope that

1578
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:07,920
now you see why so we surve some Che and

1579
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:10,880
we looked at some like who cares okay

1580
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:13,840
this it seemed like why would we need to

1581
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:16,320
some over so many very multivariate

1582
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:18,159
polinomial where does that come up I

1583
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:21,199
don't know it was like okay why am I

1584
01:15:18,159 --> 01:15:23,679
learning this but you know so now where

1585
01:15:21,199 --> 01:15:25,560
what did we do with it we start with

1586
01:15:23,679 --> 01:15:28,080
with Su we saw

1587
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:32,040
oh just by doing something

1588
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:34,679
repeatedly you can verify any low depth

1589
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:36,880
computation that's pretty amazing and

1590
01:15:34,679 --> 01:15:39,880
then we saw that actually you can

1591
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:41,880
recover the IP equals P space theorem

1592
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:44,880
that GK actually gives his IP equals P

1593
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:46,960
space theorem and now we see gkr

1594
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:50,360
actually gives you

1595
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:54,080
PCP and what is GK is just Su

1596
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:56,360
checks okay so just these Su checks you

1597
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:59,120
kind of unroll them unravel them and you

1598
01:15:56,360 --> 01:16:01,440
get a PCP with polog and

1599
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:04,199
queries and not and it's like efficient

1600
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:06,639
you can take your input effic your

1601
01:16:04,199 --> 01:16:10,320
witness and efficiently generate this

1602
01:16:06,639 --> 01:16:13,960
PCP and in a very

1603
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:15,800
a like a straightforward way in a sense

1604
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:17,960
you do your computation you have your

1605
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:20,800
witness you do the computation you do

1606
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:24,040
all the lree extensions and you convince

1607
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:26,920
round by round you just lay it out

1608
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:26,920
that's it and you have a

1609
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:32,760
PCP okay any any questions about

1610
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:38,520
yeah that relies on just the fact that

1611
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:40,760
it consists of these kind of like

1612
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:44,159
independent subs or also the fact that

1613
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:46,280
some itself that each is just random

1614
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:49,239
good good good so the question is again

1615
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:51,639
let's understand why do we get this PCP

1616
01:16:49,239 --> 01:16:54,400
that's efficient okay why do we get only

1617
01:16:51,639 --> 01:16:57,000
poly siiz PCP and the reason we get is

1618
01:16:54,400 --> 01:17:00,120
to both twofolds you you said both

1619
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:02,760
reasons reason number one that when we

1620
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:05,040
do each sum check after that we can

1621
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:07,679
forget about this Randomness and for

1622
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:12,360
each VI consider so we really need to

1623
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:15,719
write down only kind of D times F to the

1624
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:18,239
m sub checks okay that's D the depth of

1625
01:17:15,719 --> 01:17:20,320
the circuit time F to the M Subs that's

1626
01:17:18,239 --> 01:17:22,400
number one but number two why is the sum

1627
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:23,320
check can we write out all the sum check

1628
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:26,199
I mean the sum check is also an

1629
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:28,960
interactive protocol can we actually

1630
01:17:26,199 --> 01:17:31,880
open it up and write the entire thing

1631
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:35,639
and the answer is well yeah but at a

1632
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:38,520
exponential cost and but an exponential

1633
01:17:35,639 --> 01:17:40,480
cost in M the number of variables but

1634
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:43,560
here the number of variables is

1635
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:44,920
log that's important we if M was polog

1636
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:50,120
we would have been

1637
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:53,679
doomed but M or I mean okay uh it's not

1638
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:55,679
just log it's it's we set the parameter

1639
01:17:53,679 --> 01:17:57,440
so that it's okay that's what we needed

1640
01:17:55,679 --> 01:17:59,560
that's exactly so why can we open up

1641
01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:04,120
this entire sum check it's because we

1642
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:06,560
set F to be poly H and H to the m is s

1643
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:08,800
so we we set it up so that you know

1644
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:15,440
opening the sum check

1645
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:17,520
requires F to the m kind of answers uh F

1646
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:19,159
to the m answers each one is kind of a

1647
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:21,520
low degree polinomial but that's that's

1648
01:18:19,159 --> 01:18:23,440
fine but F to the m of them or F to the

1649
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:25,760
3M here because we have the number of

1650
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:27,159
variables is 3M

1651
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:29,639
uh and we just need to make sure that

1652
01:18:27,159 --> 01:18:31,400
after the 3M is polinomial and to ensure

1653
01:18:29,639 --> 01:18:34,239
that we did do some parameter

1654
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:36,760
engineering that's why we didn't go the

1655
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:39,159
natural route of taking H to be two and

1656
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:41,239
M to be log s that would be natural but

1657
01:18:39,159 --> 01:18:43,679
then we would not get so we actually did

1658
01:18:41,239 --> 01:18:45,920
need to do some kind of Engineering in

1659
01:18:43,679 --> 01:18:49,719
parameters uh like an annoying fiddling

1660
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:51,360
of parameters uh you know this uh this

1661
01:18:49,719 --> 01:18:53,679
setting of parameters that you see over

1662
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:55,080
and over in any PCP construction this is

1663
01:18:53,679 --> 01:18:57,520
you know we're not the first so we're

1664
01:18:55,080 --> 01:18:59,159
actually the last if anything to come to

1665
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:03,920
use this this was used in the '90s in

1666
01:18:59,159 --> 01:19:05,679
the early PCP constructions and um and

1667
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:08,320
it's when you look at it first like oh

1668
01:19:05,679 --> 01:19:09,360
really like log n over log log n are you

1669
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:11,520
kidding me like couldn't you find

1670
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:14,440
something nicer but this is this is why

1671
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:18,040
because we want these parameters to be

1672
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:21,760
poly yeah so since you're essentially

1673
01:19:18,040 --> 01:19:24,159
asking for this for this to be like a

1674
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:26,880
nonadaptive can you just like use the

1675
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:29,679
same for and get

1676
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:32,840
the so sorry so you're saying sorry your

1677
01:19:29,679 --> 01:19:35,600
question is you're saying you are you

1678
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:37,639
talking about the non the fact that this

1679
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:40,440
verifier is nonadaptive or or that

1680
01:19:37,639 --> 01:19:43,199
theover is nonadaptive right the prover

1681
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:45,840
in the yes M like it's not adaptive in

1682
01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:48,520
the previous in the previous uh Su

1683
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:51,120
checks previous Su checks yeah so then

1684
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:52,639
what can you use the same Randomness for

1685
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:55,159
each round like what would happen if you

1686
01:19:52,639 --> 01:19:56,920
theand no okay okay okay that's a good

1687
01:19:55,159 --> 01:19:59,960
question so you're asking you're saying

1688
01:19:56,920 --> 01:20:02,159
look we're doing the sum check D times

1689
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:04,920
can't we use the same Randomness and the

1690
01:20:02,159 --> 01:20:06,239
answer is we cannot why because you

1691
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:09,280
should think if you use the same

1692
01:20:06,239 --> 01:20:14,320
Randomness for different rounds then you

1693
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:16,679
should think of I'm aover I'm like oh I

1694
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:18,239
I'm you're going to use the same

1695
01:20:16,679 --> 01:20:20,280
Randomness for all your rounds I know

1696
01:20:18,239 --> 01:20:21,040
that because you're telling me already

1697
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:23,800
that you're going to use the same

1698
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:25,520
Randomness so now in the first round I'm

1699
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:28,440
I'm going to behave honestly just learn

1700
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:30,040
your Randomness give you so I'm sorry

1701
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:31,800
I'm not going to be I'm going to cheat

1702
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:33,679
in the first round okay so of course I'm

1703
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:36,040
going to I'm the output is one even

1704
01:20:33,679 --> 01:20:39,000
though it's zero I'm going to manage to

1705
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:42,040
convince you in the first kind of in the

1706
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:43,840
first Su check I do yeah because I'm

1707
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:46,719
just going to lie consistently with

1708
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:49,239
myself arrive to VI to the next layer

1709
01:20:46,719 --> 01:20:51,400
and the wrong still inconsistent but now

1710
01:20:49,239 --> 01:20:54,520
I know the randomness that cuz you're

1711
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:58,560
going to reuse you see here the point is

1712
01:20:54,520 --> 01:21:02,080
that the following the verifier here

1713
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:06,239
should behave like a like an honest

1714
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:09,120
verifier in the gkr if the verifier here

1715
01:21:06,239 --> 01:21:10,040
you cannot if when you use this verifier

1716
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:13,120
he

1717
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:14,960
essentially behaves like a GK verifier

1718
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:17,440
so now you're telling you're saying look

1719
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:20,960
why doesn't he use the same Randomness

1720
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:23,159
for the different uh subprotocols

1721
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:26,120
because if he didn't gkr then he would

1722
01:21:23,159 --> 01:21:28,120
fail then you the a cheating prover can

1723
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:30,040
can take advantage of him is isn't there

1724
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:31,639
the difference here that this is

1725
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:35,639
nonadaptive like it doesn't remember the

1726
01:21:31,639 --> 01:21:35,639
randomness all it depends on

1727
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:41,920
is right so you can't just be like oh

1728
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:43,840
this is the random oh I see you're

1729
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:45,159
saying I see I see okay okay now I

1730
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:50,600
understand your question you're saying

1731
01:21:45,159 --> 01:21:51,960
this guy this uh prover is stuck okay

1732
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:53,679
okay sorry now I'm I understand what

1733
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:56,320
you're saying you're saying look you're

1734
01:21:53,679 --> 01:21:57,000
tying the hand of the prover the prover

1735
01:21:56,320 --> 01:22:00,840
in

1736
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:02,639
gkr he has power he sees your Randomness

1737
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:04,360
and based on that he can continue the

1738
01:22:02,639 --> 01:22:06,440
honest Pro of course won't do that but

1739
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:07,719
the cheating prover May here you're

1740
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:10,000
saying I'm not going to let the prover

1741
01:22:07,719 --> 01:22:13,679
do that to me I'm G to force him to

1742
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:15,520
forget because I force him to forget can

1743
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:17,080
I think of using the same Randomness

1744
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:19,639
that's a good question

1745
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:20,719
actually a great very good question I it

1746
01:22:19,639 --> 01:22:24,520
took me time to understand what you're

1747
01:22:20,719 --> 01:22:24,520
asking a

1748
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:31,520
can you use the same it's great qu great

1749
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:34,520
point verif just said to break that well

1750
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:36,800
no because what okay so I'm so okay so

1751
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:38,440
we are pointed the F said you know what

1752
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:40,920
use the same Randomness in all the

1753
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:43,280
subprotocols now in the gkr it's a big

1754
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:45,159
problem because the prover he knows what

1755
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:49,639
you saw and he'll use that like he know

1756
01:22:45,159 --> 01:22:53,520
the but in in the PCP the

1757
01:22:49,639 --> 01:22:56,320
PCP gkr prover his hands are tied yeah

1758
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:57,679
but the fact like if the Prov knows that

1759
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:59,600
you're going to do this then he might be

1760
01:22:57,679 --> 01:23:01,480
able to engineer all of his responses in

1761
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:03,360
a way that like takes advantage of the

1762
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:05,159
correlation of right like by exactly

1763
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:07,360
using the same verifier you said like

1764
01:23:05,159 --> 01:23:09,880
you pretend you have that verifier that

1765
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:12,760
cheats you use the same Randomness now

1766
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:15,760
this tree follows that verifier

1767
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:15,760
strategy

1768
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:23,000
shouldn't yeah I mean it is it could be

1769
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:25,520
some but like there's this correlation

1770
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:27,199
between the randomness the would know

1771
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:28,679
about it in advance right so even though

1772
01:23:27,199 --> 01:23:30,199
he can't remember the random he can

1773
01:23:28,679 --> 01:23:31,360
engineer the strategy to take advantage

1774
01:23:30,199 --> 01:23:35,000
of the fact the

1775
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:37,040
Rand okay let me say the following um to

1776
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:39,239
close this discussion a the discussion

1777
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:41,040
is super interesting the question you

1778
01:23:39,239 --> 01:23:43,880
raised is super

1779
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:45,520
interesting you know we have one pet in

1780
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:48,920
this

1781
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:53,960
class you gave me a great uh idea for a

1782
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:55,280
question a a by the way um before we

1783
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:58,760
break I just want to make a quick

1784
01:23:55,280 --> 01:24:01,159
announcement so I wrote in the in the

1785
01:23:58,760 --> 01:24:02,440
website that the pet will come later in

1786
01:24:01,159 --> 01:24:04,800
during this class because I thought it

1787
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:07,600
would be good to cover more

1788
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:09,960
material but uh I know that I wrote it

1789
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:14,560
pretty close like to the break and maybe

1790
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:18,560
that's so okay so maybe I'll I'll put it

1791
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:19,679
out earlier give you two weeks and just

1792
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:21,159
because I don't want to sit with it too

1793
01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:22,760
long it's just annoying but if you feel

1794
01:24:21,159 --> 01:24:25,040
like the time is doesn't work and you

1795
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:26,159
want an extension just let me know

1796
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:28,320
I don't really

1797
01:24:26,159 --> 01:24:29,880
care I just want you to think about it

1798
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:32,280
and have fun with the you know with the

1799
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:35,320
material yeah the way we all do sound is

1800
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:36,920
are we using un bound like yeah exactly

1801
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:39,440
we're doing a union bound yeah yes

1802
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:42,719
exactly because the in the soundness we

1803
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:46,239
say the following we say that

1804
01:24:42,719 --> 01:24:48,719
uh uh in the so essentially we're we're

1805
01:24:46,239 --> 01:24:51,280
talking with a prover and GK prover and

1806
01:24:48,719 --> 01:24:54,080
we're saying for the GK even like a tied

1807
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:57,400
GK Pro as you as you mentioned even it's

1808
01:24:54,080 --> 01:25:00,639
a gar prover with tied hands so for this

1809
01:24:57,400 --> 01:25:02,480
for this prover to cheat he need so the

1810
01:25:00,639 --> 01:25:04,320
output is false that's kind of he

1811
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:06,840
cheated so somewhere he needs to cheat

1812
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:09,040
in one of the gkrs one of the one of the

1813
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:12,000
sum checks he needs to go from false to

1814
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:14,040
True somewhere because at the end you're

1815
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:16,320
verifying you verifying that you know he

1816
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:18,239
put here a witness so he put in the sky

1817
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:20,000
a witness that witness is false because

1818
01:25:18,239 --> 01:25:22,119
there's no satisfying assignment so he

1819
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:24,840
put something that's actually

1820
01:25:22,119 --> 01:25:26,440
false oh one second there is something

1821
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:28,080
okay sorry now I remember there is

1822
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:32,159
something there is a low deegree test to

1823
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:34,639
do we'll get back to that sorry uh we'll

1824
01:25:32,159 --> 01:25:38,639
get back to the low degree test but uh

1825
01:25:34,639 --> 01:25:41,159
there so you're talking with a um a

1826
01:25:38,639 --> 01:25:43,639
you're talking with a GK prover and this

1827
01:25:41,159 --> 01:25:45,800
prover the only way he can convince you

1828
01:25:43,639 --> 01:25:47,480
is to go from like a false statement to

1829
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:50,159
a true statement because at the end you

1830
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:53,000
ver you and to do that you need to break

1831
01:25:50,159 --> 01:25:55,119
one of the sum checks so to break one of

1832
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:57,320
the Su checks you have two Su checks and

1833
01:25:55,119 --> 01:26:00,400
now I'm using a union bound to say that

1834
01:25:57,320 --> 01:26:02,800
the probability that you kind of manag

1835
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:04,360
to break one of them is two to the D

1836
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:05,719
times the probability that you manage to

1837
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:08,960
break one of

1838
01:26:05,719 --> 01:26:11,360
them okay but then back to discussion

1839
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:13,360
where like like sharing Randomness so

1840
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:16,960
does un help

1841
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:18,440
here you you're saying oh you're because

1842
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:22,360
of

1843
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:25,199
theend okay so this is is this related

1844
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:28,360
to this qu okay okay actually I don't

1845
01:26:25,199 --> 01:26:30,560
think so because Union Bound in general

1846
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:33,119
it it can be correlated a union Bound in

1847
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:34,440
general says that the probability that

1848
01:26:33,119 --> 01:26:36,639
this or this I don't care how they're

1849
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:38,280
correlated it's smaller or equal the

1850
01:26:36,639 --> 01:26:41,920
probability of this plus the probability

1851
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:43,920
of this so the correlation here the

1852
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:47,719
union bound is

1853
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:50,280
very uh easily used in any situation you

1854
01:26:47,719 --> 01:26:52,639
know just at the probability that you

1855
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:54,000
have an event you CH you cheated on test

1856
01:26:52,639 --> 01:26:56,040
one you cheated on test two you cheated

1857
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:58,080
on test three I don't care how they're

1858
01:26:56,040 --> 01:27:00,920
correlated the probability that you Che

1859
01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:03,920
on one of them is small or equal

1860
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:06,639
then yeah but actually before we break

1861
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:08,639
sorry there is a some there is a low

1862
01:27:06,639 --> 01:27:10,159
degree extension

1863
01:27:08,639 --> 01:27:12,199
what

1864
01:27:10,159 --> 01:27:16,639
exactly you can just

1865
01:27:12,199 --> 01:27:21,040
use good okay okay okay

1866
01:27:16,639 --> 01:27:22,560
sorry good uh I love you guys uh so uh

1867
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:26,119
yeah

1868
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:26,119
V uh okay

1869
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:32,600
check v0 Tilda is low

1870
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:41,719
degree because in

1871
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:44,560
gkr the verifier has the W the the input

1872
01:27:41,719 --> 01:27:46,080
which is the witness he computes the Lo

1873
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:49,520
extension by

1874
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:54,400
himself here the poer is giving it to

1875
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:54,400
him what if you didn't give a low degree

1876
01:27:55,280 --> 01:28:01,920
so we do need one low degree test in the

1877
01:27:58,080 --> 01:28:05,400
input other than that it's GK black box

1878
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:08,360
but we do need this and by the way note

1879
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:11,679
that we're using the gkr the gkr has

1880
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:12,920
actually um properties and now I want to

1881
01:28:11,679 --> 01:28:14,920
go back to the succinctness because

1882
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:17,239
actually you're saying can't you do it

1883
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:20,560
with any succinct protocol and the

1884
01:28:17,239 --> 01:28:23,040
answer is maybe but there's also this

1885
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:25,679
point which is problematic that in gkr

1886
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:28,280
it's nice because you just check one

1887
01:28:25,679 --> 01:28:31,560
point in the low degree

1888
01:28:28,280 --> 01:28:32,960
extension and we can verify that you do

1889
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:34,719
the low degree

1890
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:36,159
extension there there's a low deegree

1891
01:28:34,719 --> 01:28:38,520
test that I didn't talk to you about but

1892
01:28:36,159 --> 01:28:42,880
we'll mention that after the break so

1893
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:45,360
there's a uh gkr you can verify the

1894
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:47,679
verifier to verify all he needs to do is

1895
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:49,520
take his input and compute only one

1896
01:28:47,679 --> 01:28:51,520
point two points in the low degree

1897
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:54,880
extension of that

1898
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:57,159
input this is actually used here

1899
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:58,960
because now the ver the prover the

1900
01:28:57,159 --> 01:29:02,199
verifier doesn't have the input the

1901
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:05,320
witness the prover has it he's going to

1902
01:29:02,199 --> 01:29:07,000
put it in the in the sky and now you

1903
01:29:05,320 --> 01:29:10,880
can't read the entire input that's a

1904
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:15,679
witness but you can read like you know

1905
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:19,480
what the what what the kind of succinct

1906
01:29:15,679 --> 01:29:21,840
protocol tells you to read you know and

1907
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:24,840
so this this part is is important in the

1908
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:24,840
G

1909
01:29:27,119 --> 01:29:33,119
okay a questions before we break okay so

1910
01:29:31,639 --> 01:29:34,760
after the we'll take a five minutes

1911
01:29:33,119 --> 01:29:38,280
break and then we'll talk quickly about

1912
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:39,960
the low degree test wrap up the

1913
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:43,840
information Theory and go to

1914
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:43,840
cryptography okay
