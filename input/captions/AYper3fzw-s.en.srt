1
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:18,480
And um our next speaker is Eric Bosworth

2
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,560
from Eversource Energy and he has

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,560
collaborated with Eversource in the

4
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,279
Framingham site acquiring temperature

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,400
data down the bore holes.

6
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,240
>> Awesome.

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,840
>> What's your time?

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:34,480
>> Hi, I'm good. I I am the uh privileged

9
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:37,120
individual that gets to run anchor here

10
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,280
before lunch. So, thanks for bearing

11
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,520
with me. Um, for those of you that I

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,800
don't know, my name is Eric Bosworth. I

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,200
work in the clean technologies

14
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,600
department at Eversource. And for better

15
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,559
or worse, I have had the privilege of

16
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,199
overseeing the Framingham project from

17
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,440
before site selection. So, I joined on

18
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,199
to the team to kind of oversee it as we

19
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,719
were figuring out where and how we were

20
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,120
going to do this. and all the way

21
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,280
through today uh when we are up in

22
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,600
operation with customers using the

23
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,760
system. So folks have talked about the

24
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,080
project a lot over the last day and a

25
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,720
half here. I I don't need to go over

26
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,960
Framingham necessarily. What I'm hoping

27
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,439
to do is bring the perspective of we've

28
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,000
had a lot of insight into what's the big

29
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:22,320
picture? What's the policy direction we

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,080
need to go into? How do we design a

31
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,400
system like this? How do we operate a

32
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,000
system like this? I'm going to bring you

33
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,759
the perspective of what happens when you

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,680
get out there and start tearing up

35
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,079
pavement and actually putting it in

36
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,520
because uh nothing really prepares you

37
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,200
for that until you're into it. And

38
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,040
there's certainly some some lessons

39
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,040
learned and scars along the way that you

40
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,040
pick up.

41
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,360
Here's a basic breakdown of kind of the

42
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,119
three main work streams that go into

43
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,759
actually building a shared thermal

44
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:52,000
network in a community. You've got the

45
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,000
ground exchanger. Brock was just talking

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,920
about drilling. Uh we've talked about

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,399
thermal conductivity testing and kind of

48
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,680
how the ground exchanger works. It's

49
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,520
pretty straightforward, but that's your

50
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,439
energy source. You're putting holes into

51
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,880
the ground. You're pulling heat out in

52
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,719
the winter. You're putting heat in in

53
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,800
the summer. That's what's fueling your

54
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,319
network. But the other pieces are just

55
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,160
important. You have the distribution

56
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,599
loop, the pipes in the street, the

57
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,599
service lines that you're pulling into

58
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,440
the homes. How do you move the energy

59
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,760
through the neighborhood? And then

60
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,560
finally, the building conversions. Um

61
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,680
certainly not third in importance here.

62
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,280
What are you doing to the building

63
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,280
envelope and how are you interfacing

64
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,360
with that thermal network? How are you

65
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,680
keeping your customers warm in the

66
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,239
winter, cool in the summer? And what

67
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,400
equipment is involved there? So, sort of

68
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,959
stepping through each of those, I I like

69
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,280
to start with main installation pipes in

70
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,920
the street because as a utility, this is

71
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,000
our bread and butter. Um, we put in

72
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,360
hundreds and hundreds of miles of this

73
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,800
HDPE pipe every year. We know this. We

74
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,560
know how to open the street. We know how

75
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,280
to fuse pipe. We know how to get it into

76
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,879
the ground. We know how to test it. Um

77
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,640
to the points that Mark brought up, you

78
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,400
know, making sure that the fusions are

79
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,280
good and the pressure testing is

80
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,760
appropriate and documented. Uh this part

81
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:10,239
of the project was, I will say, the

82
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:12,400
smoothest part from a timeline, a cost,

83
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,200
an execution standpoint. Our crews know

84
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,879
how to do this. We actually took crews

85
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,720
that had been putting gas pipe in the

86
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,319
year before, did a little bit of

87
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,080
retraining on them, showed them how to

88
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,319
stencil geothermal on the side of the

89
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,920
pipe, and they were off to the races.

90
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,640
They got out there and they installed

91
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:32,000
all of this mile of pipe plus all 38

92
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,239
services in about 2 to 3 months. It was

93
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,959
great. It was exactly as we planned it.

94
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,280
Um, similarly, the service lines, just

95
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,720
like a water service or a gas service or

96
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,120
anything else that you would pull to a

97
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,879
home, we dug a trench. There's two lines

98
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,360
in this case instead of one. So, we have

99
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,519
a send and a receive line, but for the

100
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,159
most part, it's all the same materials.

101
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,360
It's HDPE pipe that we're fusing. We're

102
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,360
pulling it into the home. We're putting

103
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,920
it into a pair of shut off valves on the

104
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,480
inside of the basement. And it feels

105
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,080
just like utility work. Even from the

106
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,480
outside, if you watched a crew doing

107
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,760
this trenching, um, repaving in the

108
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,280
street, you'd have no idea that they

109
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,840
were putting geothermal in. It just

110
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,159
looks like everyday utility work. So,

111
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,400
these two work streams. Great.

112
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:17,519
Fantastic. We understand them. We do

113
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:20,479
them all the time. They were easy.

114
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,320
Borefield drilling, not necessarily a

115
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:24,400
utility's forte. I think this is one of

116
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,800
the first times that a at least a gas

117
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,199
utility in the nation has drilled bore

118
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,360
holes. Um, and there were some lessons

119
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,880
learned. You know, Brock talked a lot

120
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,120
about this, so I'm not going to harp too

121
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,520
much on drilling specifically, but

122
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,840
there's questions about site layout and

123
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,759
what formation are you drilling in? How

124
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,240
quickly can you drill? How do you manage

125
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,320
your water and your cutings? We were

126
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,560
learning. We brought in experts. They

127
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,199
did a great job. They designed great

128
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,120
ground exchangers. They executed well.

129
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,120
Uh, but for us as the utility, you know,

130
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,120
it was more a learning opportunity than

131
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,040
anything. We certainly weren't out there

132
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,880
directing the drillers on how to run

133
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,600
their operation. We were letting the

134
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,199
experts do what they do best. And then

135
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,880
in the future, you know, we look at

136
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,560
Framingham, we potentially have an

137
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,479
expansion coming up here in the next

138
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,400
year or two, and we've learned some

139
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,960
lessons from the first time around that

140
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,960
we will apply the next time we go out to

141
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,479
drill a bore field. And hopefully we can

142
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,199
do it quicker, we can do it more

143
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:23,120
cost-effectively the second time around.

144
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,120
Um just to talk a little bit to the

145
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,520
pictures here there. There's a lot going

146
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,199
on, but um we did take advantage of some

147
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,720
of those nice deviated drilling

148
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,639
techniques on our project that you can

149
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,880
see here on the left and then on the

150
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,639
right that's what the manifold looks

151
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,240
like when you come out of a bore hole.

152
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,759
So once you've got all those holes in

153
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,320
the ground, you got to tie them together

154
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,160
with pipes. So you pull all of the

155
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,080
inlets and outlets together into a

156
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,759
single vault. You have a nice long

157
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,919
header for each of them. And that way

158
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,919
you can control the individual borehole

159
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,919
runs. You can turn them on and off with

160
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:55,600
valves if you want to. You can pressure

161
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:58,080
test them. You can make sure that the

162
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,479
system is on and running appropriately

163
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,160
uh before you cover it back up because

164
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,000
again, Mark mentioned this multiple

165
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,440
times, but you really, really want to

166
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,280
make sure that there are no issues or

167
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,440
leaks before you back fill these

168
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,360
systems.

169
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,440
The pump house, kind of similar to the

170
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:17,120
distribution loop, but this is the only

171
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:19,280
above ground structure on our system. We

172
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,960
chose to do it as a pre-fabricated

173
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,720
building. So, we came in and we laid a

174
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,240
foundation. We had as much of the

175
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,000
mechanical work and piping and

176
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,240
electrical done as we possibly could

177
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,919
beforehand and then dropped the building

178
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,440
down on top of the foundation

179
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,360
afterwards.

180
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,039
And really, all it does is it's got the

181
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,560
central pumps, it's got our control

182
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,080
system, and it's got a little bit of

183
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,319
backup in the sense that we have a

184
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,479
central boiler in there just in case we

185
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,960
need to add some heat to the system. It

186
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,800
was designed to not need it, but you

187
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,639
know, as a utility, the very first time

188
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,560
out, we want to make absolutely sure

189
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,800
that there are no problems with the

190
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,800
operation of the system. That comes back

191
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,600
to customer perception and could affect

192
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,360
adoption long term. So, you know, for

193
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,800
our project, it also now serves as a

194
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,400
very nice area where when we come out

195
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,919
and have tours, we can kind of talk

196
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,240
through some of the equipment involved

197
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:08,240
and how the system works. Uh, it's

198
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,880
really paid dividends to end up going

199
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,880
above ground in this case. We won't

200
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,560
necessarily always do that. You know,

201
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,560
looking to future iterations, we may

202
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,240
vault pumps. We may bury things if we

203
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,400
don't have the space to do it. Uh but at

204
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,840
least in Framingham, the pump house was

205
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:26,720
a critical part of the loop. Finally,

206
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:29,360
getting into building conversions. This

207
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,759
this has by far been and was the most

208
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,560
challenging part of getting a system

209
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,560
online and running. Having the loop in

210
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,919
the street, having it on and running, we

211
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,759
kind of knew what we were getting into.

212
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:42,000
It wasn't necessarily all skill sets

213
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,639
that we were familiar with, but we sort

214
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,599
of knew what to expect. Um, building

215
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,280
conversions are every single one. You

216
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,199
have no idea what you're getting into

217
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:54,160
when you get into that building. We

218
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:57,120
found mold, we found asbestous, we found

219
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,639
knob and tube wiring. You name it, we

220
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,720
found it in one of these homes or

221
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,400
buildings. And that may be somewhat

222
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,199
unique to the building stock here in the

223
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,440
Northeast. Uh, but it's a reality of

224
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,599
large retrofit projects. you're going to

225
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,240
have to tackle these types of problems.

226
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:14,879
So, from an execution standpoint, we

227
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,639
really tried to individualize it for all

228
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,560
of our customers, get into their home,

229
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,560
explain exactly what we needed to do,

230
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,440
how we were going to do it. We ran

231
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,919
ducting. We did about 15 to 20 main

232
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,240
panel upgrades in this neighborhood. So,

233
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:30,400
it wasn't just how do I put a heat pump

234
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,240
in. That's generally pretty

235
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,839
straightforward. You get the unit in,

236
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,680
you may need some ducting. You may need

237
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,560
to adjust the existing ducting in the

238
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,560
room, but the rest of the building is

239
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,240
important, too. Are we air sealing? Are

240
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,720
we weatherizing? Are we upgrading

241
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,440
electrical systems? So, the whole

242
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,600
picture ends up playing into what the

243
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,519
building conversions look like. And we

244
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,360
demonstrated virtually every type of

245
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:56,560
conversion as well on this project that

246
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,240
you can have. The good news is there's

247
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,640
equipment out there to tackle almost all

248
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,279
of it. Most of the residential homes

249
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,800
were using forced air systems. So we

250
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,560
came in, we put a heat pump in, we

251
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,640
distributed it with ducting and air

252
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,399
systems. The commercial buildings, we

253
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,480
had rooftop units that we could actually

254
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,399
just lift their old unit off and drop

255
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,720
their new unit on top of the roof and

256
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,640
reuse all of the existing distribution

257
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,640
system in the building. And then we had

258
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,800
some more niche applications, um, things

259
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,959
like console units that look almost like

260
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,120
one of those hotel air conditioners that

261
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,360
sit under the window. We put those into

262
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,920
a number of the uh the subsidized

263
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,760
housing apartments on this loop as well.

264
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,000
And just to emphasize that it's not

265
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,519
necessarily will it work, it's how do I

266
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,680
make it work with every single one of

267
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,920
these.

268
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,959
Finally, overall project management. I

269
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,279
talked a little bit about this on

270
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:48,000
building conversions, but um you know,

271
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:50,160
making sure that we were having a very

272
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,240
detailed and customer focused approach

273
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:55,200
through the entire project was important

274
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,360
too. As a utility, generally we stay in

275
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,720
the streets. We're putting pipes. We're

276
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,040
pulling them. There's a demarcation

277
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,279
point and everything downstream is is

278
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,120
usually the customer's responsibility.

279
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,279
Not in the case of this project. The

280
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,160
scope of our pilot approved by the

281
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:12,720
department was including all of the

282
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,320
building side equipment and work. So, we

283
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,079
had to manage that part of the project

284
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,519
as well. We were meeting with the

285
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,360
customers in the field. We were

286
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,760
explaining things. We were having them

287
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,200
look at exactly what was going in, where

288
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,959
it was going in. We were getting

289
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,200
feedback on things like, "I'd like the

290
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:29,200
ducting over here versus over there. Can

291
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,519
you box it in with drywall? Can you

292
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,760
paint it after the fact?" All of these

293
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:36,640
little details that make project

294
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,399
management very challenging, but it's

295
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,240
extremely important because at the end

296
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,079
of the day, I want these customers to

297
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,839
have a good experience. I want them to

298
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,360
like their new systems and I want them

299
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,279
to tell all of their neighbors about how

300
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,680
great it was as well because that's how

301
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:52,079
we grow the system and get adoption to

302
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,760
continue.

303
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,680
Sort of summing up the construction side

304
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,760
of things, you know, timeline and

305
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,600
parallel work streams. If I were to go

306
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,680
do this project again, there are a lot

307
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,640
of levers I could pull here for having

308
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:07,120
simultaneous jobs go on so that my

309
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,800
overall timeline could be shrunk. I

310
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,200
think in the second iteration, I could

311
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,440
probably trim about 25 to 30% of our

312
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,240
schedule off if I was going into it

313
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,600
knowing what I know now. Um, there are

314
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,320
always the traditional utility

315
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,320
challenges. You know, we ran into buried

316
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,160
infrastructure that wasn't on any map,

317
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,600
wasn't on any diagram, and you're

318
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,320
digging along and all of a sudden you

319
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,839
see a wooden conduit in the street. So,

320
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,839
you got to navigate around it. You have

321
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,839
to make some on the-job decisions, some

322
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:37,120
on the-ly, you know, changes to your

323
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,480
system. Those were manageable. There

324
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,880
were some geothermal specific

325
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,880
challenges. You know, the drilling went

326
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,880
well, but there was a learning curve

327
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,200
there. The geology, what type of

328
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,279
drilling we were using. We tried air

329
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,279
hammer, we did mud rotary. We kind of

330
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,920
traded off to decide what was exactly

331
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:56,000
the best way to drill in this specific

332
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,760
neighborhood. And then on the HVAC side

333
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,440
of things, you know, to this day, I'm

334
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,000
still helping customers dial their

335
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,600
systems in. So it's not necessarily as

336
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,680
soon as everything is installed, you

337
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,880
walk away and it runs perfectly. There

338
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,639
is definitely a period of adjustment and

339
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,440
improvement and optimization that you

340
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,639
can make. Um site access and scheduling.

341
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,360
This was actually something that ended

342
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,440
up affecting us quite a lot in terms of

343
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,920
overall project schedule, but the

344
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,839
reality is you're installing these in a

345
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,320
community. It's people's yards. It's

346
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:28,480
people's homes. It's school property.

347
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,000
And so when you're first planning the

348
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,600
project, you're not necessarily thinking

349
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,920
about, ooh, maybe they're not going to

350
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,839
let me drill or have access to the

351
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,360
school property in the fall as

352
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,519
everything is ramping up and students

353
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,360
are all coming back. Individual

354
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,720
customers, they go on vacation. They

355
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,720
have their own lives. They have their

356
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,279
work schedules. So, you have to really

357
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,120
work around all of the individual pieces

358
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,720
to get everything to come together.

359
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,399
Otherwise, you find yourself sitting and

360
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,240
waiting and saying, "Well, I, you know,

361
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,720
I guess I can't get access to the site

362
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,760
today. let's wait a week until I can and

363
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,760
that has impacts on the overall job. Um,

364
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,120
finally, I mentioned these, but unknown

365
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,920
building conditions. I'm going to

366
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:08,320
mention it again because it was uh it

367
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:10,639
was such a challenge on the project.

368
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,480
Really taking good stock of what

369
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,880
buildings are in your planned community

370
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,320
or planned area, understanding what some

371
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,399
of the common things that you may

372
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,519
encounter are, and having a plan for it

373
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:23,920
ahead of time. Um, asbestous remediation

374
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:26,959
delayed some of our building conversions

375
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:29,519
a good 3 to four months in this case.

376
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:32,079
Um, we got into specifically the the

377
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:34,399
lowincome housing apartment buildings.

378
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:36,240
We realized there may be some asbestous

379
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,160
in the joining compound and the walls

380
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,959
that they had used to construct those.

381
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:44,000
And it was about a four-month process to

382
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:46,399
test every single unit, document it with

383
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,200
the state, come up with a remediation

384
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:52,240
plan, have that plan approved, and then

385
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:54,160
have qualified contractors come in, set

386
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,600
up all of their air containment, and do

387
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,760
that remediation so that we could

388
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,279
actually install the heat pumps. So,

389
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,360
it's those types of things that when

390
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,880
you're in the initial planning stage, if

391
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,279
you know there's a chance that these

392
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,360
buildings may have asbestous in them, go

393
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,040
ahead and test it during design. come up

394
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,440
with your remediation plan. That way

395
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,800
when you're into project execution,

396
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,399
you've got it all baked into the

397
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:18,560
schedule and it's not going to delay

398
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:19,920
that particular part of the project.

399
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,760
Moving on a little bit to commissions

400
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,760
and operations because as I said once

401
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,680
the system is in the ground physically

402
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,480
that does not necessarily mean it's up

403
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:31,360
and running. Um a lot of lessons learned

404
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,800
and challenges here as well. These

405
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,880
screenshots here below are from our

406
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,720
real-time SCA system. uh you know there

407
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,199
was a great discussion earlier around

408
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,680
optimization and control and feedback on

409
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:44,160
how you run and operate one of these

410
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,000
thermal energy networks. That's what we

411
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,079
did. We had a SCADA system set up so

412
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,920
that real time any time of the day I can

413
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:52,079
see what my pump speeds are. I can see

414
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,639
my temperatures. I can see my pressures.

415
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:57,519
I can see customer behavior based on the

416
00:14:54,639 --> 00:15:00,160
historic temperature trends. So getting

417
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:02,000
that system up and running was almost

418
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,680
step one before I could even add a

419
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,079
single customer. I wanted to be able to

420
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:09,199
see the system remotely in a in a

421
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:11,600
web-based SCADA. In addition to that,

422
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,360
borefield flushing, pressure testing,

423
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,760
getting air out of the system. These are

424
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,519
all steps that we had to take as we

425
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,920
turned it on, as we started the pumps

426
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,360
up, and as we added customer loads to

427
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,519
make sure that there wasn't any

428
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,839
disruption in service because the last

429
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,760
thing that I wanted was to add a

430
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:29,279
customer and then shut them down

431
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,800
immediately right there after and say,

432
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,480
"Oo, something's wrong with the system.

433
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,079
Hang on. let me address that and we'll

434
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,440
come back in a few days and turn you

435
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:39,600
back on. So, a lot of work went into

436
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,240
making sure that the system was on,

437
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:46,720
stable, free of air, running properly

438
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:48,079
before we could add customer loads.

439
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,759
And then on the building commissioning

440
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:51,440
side, once the loop is on and running,

441
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,240
now you got to turn the buildings on as

442
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,399
well. So, that followed a very similar

443
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,160
process, but it was about getting the

444
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,000
equipment in, making sure the electrical

445
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,759
work was done, the plumbing work was

446
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,680
done. You then have to pressure test

447
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,279
everything on the building side as well

448
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,680
because the last thing you want is a

449
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:09,759
leak in one of these pipes carrying

450
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,680
water and some glycol in this case

451
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:14,320
that's going to flood a basement, flood

452
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,839
a room. Again, the perspective there

453
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,360
from the customer, it's not going to be

454
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,880
a very good one if you have to come in

455
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,240
and say, "Sorry, I just flooded your

456
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,680
basement. I'm going to pump it out, but

457
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:25,600
let me try again." So, a lot of testing,

458
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,600
getting the equipment on and running,

459
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,440
and then opening those valves and

460
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,440
actually tying it into the main loop and

461
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,759
making sure that it's getting energy um

462
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,320
from the system.

463
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:39,759
One of the the challenges that I faced

464
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:43,040
is because we were reusing traditional

465
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:45,120
gas contractors, they had a perception

466
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:48,320
around how you should handle valves on

467
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,160
this system. In their mind, open valves

468
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,839
are good. You want every valve on the

469
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,279
system open because in a gas system

470
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,639
that's what you do. You open everything

471
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:58,079
up. You've got flow. You're great. I had

472
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,560
to go through that entire system and

473
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:04,079
check every single bypass valve that I

474
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:05,600
had because 75% of them were left open.

475
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,199
What that means is when I turn a

476
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,959
customer's system on, they're not

477
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,959
exchanging fluid with the loop. They're

478
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,039
exchanging fluid with themselves and

479
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:15,199
their systems very quickly cool down.

480
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:16,559
They shut off. They throw an error. So,

481
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,600
it's those types of things and

482
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,520
troubleshooting through the

483
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,520
commissioning that, you know, the next

484
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,839
time around, I'm going to be totally

485
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:27,039
sure every bypass on a system is closed

486
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:28,480
before I turn a customer on.

487
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,799
So, lessons learned, you know,

488
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,640
procedures and compliance. I I cannot

489
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,799
stress enough how important it is to

490
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,200
know what you're doing before you do it.

491
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:39,679
Have a documented procedure. Make sure

492
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,080
you check it with your engineering team,

493
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,760
your external engineers, experts in the

494
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,960
industry that have done this before.

495
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,039
have them look at it. They're going to

496
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,640
have some great feedback. Valve

497
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:51,120
positioning, don't need to harp on it

498
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,799
again, but it's very important. Uh loop

499
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,280
flushing and purging, you know, the

500
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:58,320
biggest issue that I have seen on our

501
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:00,000
system at least is air. There's a

502
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,440
there's a procedure, there's a flushing

503
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,120
procedure, but there's always a little

504
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,280
bit of entrained air in these systems.

505
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,720
And so getting it out is extremely

506
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,320
important because it can shut down

507
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,320
customer systems. You got to come out,

508
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,400
it's a trouble call, you purge the air,

509
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,160
you start them back up. Um, so

510
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,880
definitely a step you don't want to

511
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,720
shortcut or miss. Troubleshooting

512
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,960
systems, you know, fortunately as we've

513
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,640
gone into operation here, the problems

514
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,799
have decreased dramatically. We're

515
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,000
having less, you know, issues, errors,

516
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,360
reasons that we need to go out and

517
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,039
address things, but you always need to

518
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,360
be ready to do that, especially at

519
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,960
first. And then finally, I I threw

520
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,360
temporary space conditioning in here

521
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,760
because on the theme of scheduling and

522
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,520
having work done simultaneously,

523
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:42,400
you know, the way our project played

524
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:44,320
out, you didn't necessarily have every

525
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,320
single building ready to just be turned

526
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,000
on straight away. There was a process

527
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,080
for building conversions. So, we

528
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,919
actually had to have a plan in the

529
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,440
schools, for example, when we were

530
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,360
pulling those rooftop units on and

531
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,440
putting the new ones back, how are we

532
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,880
keeping that space conditioned? Do we

533
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,600
have temporary air conditioners? Do we

534
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,200
have temporary heaters? So, all playing

535
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,600
into the whole project management and

536
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,160
logistics of a system like this and how

537
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:11,039
you actually build it and turn it on.

538
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,559
Um, you know, going forward, I I I have

539
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,400
a laundry list of things that I'm going

540
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:16,240
to be able to address the next time

541
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,919
around and head off. So, with that,

542
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,960
hopefully I stayed on time and we've got
