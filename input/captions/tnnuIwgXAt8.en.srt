1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,480
Good. All right.

2
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:21,640
Um, so we're heading in to

3
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,800
our our

4
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:26,640
last of

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:30,480
the as yet intractable dilemmas. We

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:33,760
talked about the curse of familiar atte

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:37,520
uh assessment and today the toxic power

8
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:40,480
of data and experiment. Um let's do this

9
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,840
as an exercise. Grab one other person.

10
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:47,039
Your goal is to make a list as long as

11
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,840
possible. Um what is all the data that

12
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,520
MIT has about

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:54,719
you? If you if you could if you could go

14
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:57,800
through every server that is somehow

15
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:01,039
even tangentially under the control of

16
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:04,000
MIT, what are all the different types

17
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,920
and sources and nature and example of

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,240
data that MIT has about you? Does that

19
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:13,200
make sense? Make the list as long as you

20
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:15,760
can, as fast as you can. Ready? Go.

21
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,720
All right. Let's let's let's start let's

22
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,640
start aggregating some big categories of

23
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,479
things.

24
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,479
financial information. Okay, so they

25
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,880
have a lot of financial information.

26
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,960
Maybe just like what are a few examples

27
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,240
of some of the most maybe sensitive or

28
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,079
personal parts of that.

29
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,640
They know your parents income. They know

30
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:39,200
your know your income. Your income. They

31
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,720
know your bank bank account. They they

32
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,479
know your bank account number or like

33
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,920
you give them literally but they they

34
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,759
don't like have a screenshot of your

35
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,280
like for example. All right. So they

36
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,159
know a lot of financial things about

37
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,840
you.

38
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,840
What what are some other categories?

39
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,840
Health.

40
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,360
What are some sensitive things in there?

41
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,040
History.

42
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,759
History.

43
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,759
Vaccinations.

44
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:07,719
Vaccinations. Prescriptions.

45
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,719
Allergies. Allergies.

46
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,360
Mental health

47
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:15,800
visits. Insurance.

48
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,800
You can also tell people are LGBT

49
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,319
sexual

50
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:26,440
orientation activity.

51
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,440
Okay. What else you got?

52
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,080
Yeah. Register. Let's call it registar

53
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,080
information.

54
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,920
Name

55
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,040
address phone.

56
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:48,480
Oh, they might have their travel data.

57
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:51,480
Yeah, if you have travels, you have to

58
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,480
register.

59
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,560
Like MIT knows.

60
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,319
Yeah, especially if you've been

61
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,720
international. If you do it through the

62
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,400
screen,

63
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,560
or if you're going to like a country

64
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:09,000
that they have warnings for, you have to

65
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,000
be like, I was there. Wow.

66
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,720
What else we got? Academic records.

67
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:18,800
Good.

68
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:21,040
That's part academic records.

69
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,519
What What would that include these days?

70
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,360
They know your grades. What else?

71
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,519
Registration. Like what classes you show

72
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,519
up for?

73
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,760
Test scores.

74
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:38,200
Every click ever in Canvas.

75
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,360
Attendance.

76
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:44,480
Yeah. Um, academic records is a good

77
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:47,040
example of one for which the the

78
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,599
granularity of data over the last 10

79
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,200
years has transformed dramatically. Like

80
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,799
if you if you if we had had this

81
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,720
discussion in 1980, they would have been

82
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,799
like, I guess they know what my grades

83
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,959
were and what classes I signed up for.

84
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,560
Um, but the volume of data about every

85
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,200
activity that you've ever taken online

86
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,720
in any of your classes is substantially

87
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,319
higher um than it used to be. Those

88
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,920
records might not be maintained forever.

89
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,840
Maybe all those sites get deleted every

90
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,360
18 months or so. Something like that. Um

91
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,200
but some of them might be kept for

92
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,359
longer for research or other things like

93
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:21,519
that. All right. Other categories.

94
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:24,840
Residential. Yeah. Home and current.

95
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:28,840
Um let's make it even bigger. Let's say

96
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:31,160
location. Um so they know your

97
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:34,320
residence.

98
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:39,680
Um home and campus.

99
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:42,320
um track your devices on Wi-Fi.

100
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,199
Card swipes in buildings. Um we have

101
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:47,520
some um so you know essentially as you

102
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,960
move around campus it is some somewhere

103
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,639
someone somewhere somewhere there are

104
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,080
databases that record all those

105
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,520
activities how long you know how long

106
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,440
they maintain those materials we don't

107
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,600
necessarily know but I mean I'm sure

108
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,759
they tell us if we asked but what else

109
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,680
they got

110
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,800
from that location they can also tell

111
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,639
like who you hang your outfit

112
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,560
yeah I just learned about this today

113
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,639
what's the system of where you add

114
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,039
people okay so I guess if you live in a

115
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,639
residence you create a guest list of

116
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,840
people that are allowed to visit you.

117
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,520
Like that's like you can just

118
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,680
reconstitute the entire social network

119
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:23,199
of MIT from the get list, you know. Um

120
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,800
yeah, there's there's all kinds of

121
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,560
things you can learn from that. It's

122
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,199
like extracurricular activities so they

123
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:33,840
know what sports teams and like

124
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:38,160
athletics like stats on that. And then

125
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:40,720
if you signed up for like club teams,

126
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,240
it would be all those kinds of things.

127
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:49,120
as well. Yeah, your

128
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:51,199
gym gym membership swipes activity

129
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,320
political affiliations. How would they

130
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,560
how would how would they get your

131
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,479
political affiliation?

132
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,320
Like if you're involved with the recent

133
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,080
stuff that's been going on in campus.

134
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:04,000
Yeah. Or you know and or Yeah. Yeah.

135
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:06,000
Yeah. Good. So, um there are presum you

136
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,759
know increasingly presumably lists of

137
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,199
people who are um affiliated with pro

138
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,240
Palestinian, pro-Israeli, any of those

139
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,600
other kinds of things. But also people

140
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,360
would have just been able to tell before

141
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,960
if you remember I don't I assume there

142
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,120
there's a Democrat and Republican club

143
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:24,479
at MIT I would imagine

144
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:26,800
um someone somewhere emails. Yes, they

145
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,720
have the entirety of your email record

146
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,759
even like broader just like online

147
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:34,160
activity because like emails, websites,

148
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,120
anything you've registered for. Yeah,

149
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,039
they also offer like a

150
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:42,080
VPN. So

151
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:44,800
like it's secure to everyone but like

152
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:48,680
you also have your like Google Drive if

153
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,680
you sign up for the NYC.

154
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,880
Yeah. Um I had a congressional committee

155
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,600
that wanted to find out more about my

156
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:02,000
work um not necessarily in a generous

157
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:04,160
way. um this past year um and uh and the

158
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,720
the office of general counsel did like a

159
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,560
whole search throughout my email um to

160
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,680
find terms that this congressional

161
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,520
committee was interested in learning

162
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,039
more about um and uh and they you were

163
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,120
going back and forth and I was sort of

164
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,319
like you know what do you need from me

165
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,440
and they were like well it's better if

166
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:24,160
you if you help us with this but like

167
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,639
either way we're going to do it. Um so

168
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,720
uh um yeah all you know all the all the

169
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,319
records that you generate and and that

170
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,919
that that's a good example of how even

171
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:35,840
like you know how I'm reasonably

172
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,520
confident that in most circumstances

173
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,440
like MIT is not going through my email

174
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,520
every day and like what's Justin up to

175
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,080
you know like they don't care. Um but

176
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,680
simply having those records um allows

177
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,680
all kinds of things to happen with those

178
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:51,120
records. Um,

179
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:54,520
uh, do you do you guys have automated

180
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,520
laundry machines?

181
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,520
Washing frequency.

182
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,599
It's like an app. Yeah. Yeah. It's even

183
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,599
an app like it's an app like you pay for

184
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:08,800
your machine and you have to sign up for

185
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:10,319
your email. Yeah. You have to do

186
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,800
um Yeah. Yeah. And so that I mean that I

187
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,800
think also raises some questions of like

188
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,039
um it's possible actually that MIT

189
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,039
doesn't have your laundry data, but that

190
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:22,240
MIT just somehow mandates that a third

191
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:25,120
party has all of your laundry data. Um

192
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,919
which again like how keys to your room

193
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,919
if you live on campus. Yeah. Um like

194
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:34,240
physically. Yeah.

195
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:36,560
Keys. Um what what's good about them

196
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,800
having keys?

197
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,440
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, I mean,

198
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,800
and an and you know, like like if

199
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,000
there's a day that you're locked out of

200
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,320
your room, you're going to be like, "It

201
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
is so great that MIT knows exactly what

202
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,320
key goes in my door and can make another

203
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,720
one of those." Um, yeah, we had like

204
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,120
room inspections a few weeks ago where

205
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,320
they went into every room to check if

206
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:01,120
they were abiding by the rules. Yeah.

207
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:04,959
Good. What um what what might be good

208
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:07,120
about room inspections for everyone?

209
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:09,760
I think Yeah. safety like like you know

210
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,920
like if if your if your neighbors are

211
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,360
like having hallogen lamps that can

212
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,600
catch on fire and stuff like that like

213
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,279
you would be glad that um they knew

214
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,839
about that but obviously also seems like

215
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:22,240
a huge invasion of of your privacy.

216
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,600
Yeah, I would I would say like what also

217
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,399
like kind of like made the room

218
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,720
inspections like um good like better

219
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:32,000
than like is also like you're trusting

220
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:34,399
MIT to be responsible for this. So like

221
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,480
they told they told everyone ahead of

222
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:39,040
time and they made sure you know that is

223
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,440
it like a visual inspection all so

224
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,279
they're not going through your stuff but

225
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,880
like obviously that's not a thing for a

226
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,480
lot of colleges a lot of colleges could

227
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,880
just like come barge into your room and

228
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,040
look at anything. Yeah. So you know

229
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,399
institutions make choices about how you

230
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,920
know so I mean hopefully I don't know

231
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,360
what what is what kind of feelings do

232
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,839
you have when you start looking at this

233
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,839
completed list?

234
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,760
Hm. Um the one that like I've been

235
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,040
thinking about lately given uh like the

236
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,640
permanent action stuff is just general

237
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:12,800
demographics. Once you're on campus and

238
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,120
also um something that was not mentioned

239
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:19,120
in financial is like purchase history.

240
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:21,600
So like if you buy anything on campus

241
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,959
they know you got sushi to make. Yeah.

242
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,079
like Tito and like all like the the

243
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:29,800
coffee stores like in

244
00:10:27,079 --> 00:10:31,839
like the ones in like

245
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,120
Forbes stuff like that. Yeah. I mean

246
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,200
particularly if those things somehow go

247
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,040
like can you put money on your ID card

248
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,600
and spend directly to your ID card. So,

249
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,680
you know, there's I mean, like two two

250
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,600
units that we should be thinking about

251
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,440
um anytime we think about school data is

252
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,399
that schools have a bunch of data and

253
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:51,760
then schools authorize third parties to

254
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:53,839
get a bunch of data and sometimes only

255
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,600
the third party has access. Sometimes

256
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,079
both parties have access like both

257
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,839
Canvas and MIT people have access to all

258
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:02,000
of your Canvas data. you know, the

259
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:03,360
laundry app might be a good example of

260
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,720
if nobody I mean, if somebody told me

261
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,880
that the maintenance department had

262
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,000
access to all the laundry data or it I

263
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,279
wouldn't be surprised, but if they were

264
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,880
like, "Yeah, no, we make you sign up

265
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,399
with an email, but you know, only the

266
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,640
laundry people know your laundry data,"

267
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:17,040
that wouldn't surprise me either. Um,

268
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,560
but those are sort of two useful salient

269
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,560
categories that will come up as we keep

270
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,680
talking about things.

271
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:26,880
Your deliveries, too. Oh, yeah.

272
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:30,720
Deliveries. Um, oh, because things go

273
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:32,320
through the mail room. Yeah. So, um they

274
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,920
have uh they like store all of your

275
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,680
information and your deliveries into

276
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,760
like a tracker system and then they send

277
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,279
you emails when your delivery is coming

278
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,560
if you didn't pick it up. Good. Yeah.

279
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:42,640
And so there's, you know, typic

280
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,560
typically the data is exchanged for some

281
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,839
kind of service. You're like want to

282
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,120
know when your new headphones are coming

283
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,959
or something like that. And so you're

284
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,399
glad that they have that, but in order

285
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,680
for them to be able to know when your

286
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,040
new headphones are coming and to do

287
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,480
other kinds of things with it, you know.

288
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,399
I mean, the other thing it's like you

289
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,880
say like, you know, over the past 10

290
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:01,519
years, was it a good idea for MIT to

291
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,839
track the changing volume of deliveries

292
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,680
to individual students? Like yes. Like

293
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,760
I'm sure MIT has had to build all kinds

294
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,760
of infrastructure to make it possible

295
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,839
for you all to get your stuff in a

296
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,240
sensible way and it's probably a good

297
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,279
idea that MIT has data about aggregate

298
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,320
you know partic particularly in the

299
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:19,680
aggregate it's probably a good idea to

300
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,760
know like oh you know in in 2014 um the

301
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,920
typical student got you know 2.3

302
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,079
packages a year and now they get 30.6

303
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,880
packages per year and you know like just

304
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,480
requires a whole different

305
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,959
infrastructure to support those two

306
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,880
kinds of ways of people doing commerce.

307
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,240
Um, any what other feelings do you have

308
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,560
as you look at like the whole at the

309
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,519
whole list of data that MIT might have

310
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,040
about you?

311
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,880
Feel like ultimately I'm not really that

312
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,880
surprised. I feel like we kind of grew

313
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,040
up in a generation where like digital

314
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,399
data has been collected for our entire

315
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,959
lives. Like it was not something that

316
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,480
was introduced but always there. And so

317
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,720
like I feel like I've kind of grown up

318
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,279
in this world knowing that all of this

319
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,639
type of information can and is being

320
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:02,880
collected on me. And so like I'm still

321
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:06,160
gonna like live the same way, but I just

322
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:08,240
like it just is what it is in like a

323
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,240
kind of sad way. Yeah. Yeah. There's

324
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,519
sort of sag, you know, it's not um

325
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,200
you're clearly not comfortable with it

326
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,639
because if you listen to to pe if like

327
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,760
if you stop talking for a second while

328
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,120
people were making the listen listen,

329
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,399
there's like all kinds of awkward

330
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,680
laughter that happens throughout the

331
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,279
whole time. There's something about this

332
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,600
which is like, oh, this doesn't feel

333
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,200
good. Like like any individual category

334
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,120
can make you not feel that great. like

335
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,320
like do you really want MIT's IT

336
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,160
department to be able to track where

337
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,880
everyone can go? Like that seems like it

338
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,720
could go ary. Um and then just like the

339
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,040
whole you know the whole volume in a in

340
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,120
aggregate you realize like how you know

341
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,680
how much school you could make a very

342
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,959
similar list for K12 schools as well.

343
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,959
You can probably guess the places in

344
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:49,040
which things are not exactly the same

345
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:50,320
but um uh you know um and and the data

346
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,839
collection that people can do can be

347
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,440
really influenced by policy. you know,

348
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,800
the states have different rules about

349
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,720
how attendance is connected to funding.

350
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,959
Um, who's there on a particular day,

351
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,480
who's there for what periods of time?

352
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,000
Um, you know, you could imagine that you

353
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,519
want to make sure that if a kid moves

354
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,120
schools three times in a school year,

355
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,600
that not all three of those schools get

356
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,279
like a full students tuition worth of uh

357
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,680
or you know, a student per pupil

358
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,880
expenditure. Um so but there are states

359
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,959
that you know part of the reason why

360
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,000
they issue ID cards to students and

361
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,920
track their entrance and things like

362
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,399
that is to pay really close attention to

363
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,720
that attendance data um just for that

364
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,800
particular policy purpose.

365
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,440
Um yeah I mean adding on to like it

366
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:33,199
being not surprising I would say like a

367
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:35,519
lot of the information that like like

368
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:37,760
they took while we were here like our

369
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,160
like current residence or laundry and

370
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:42,720
stuff like that. It's I feel like it's

371
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:45,600
kind of like much more unsurprising just

372
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:48,480
because like it is something that is

373
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,320
like novel when you come to like a

374
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,079
college or like an institution like this

375
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,480
where it's like oh wow like they really

376
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:57,920
do have this information. Um but I think

377
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:00,320
what's kind of um a little crazy is how

378
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:03,120
much of this information they have

379
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,920
before you even get here.

380
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,360
So yeah, for applicants, for for people

381
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,800
who are admitted, if you're admitted

382
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,839
into the school and things like that,

383
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,560
yeah, there's a lot that you need to

384
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,839
tell MIT for them to be able to to come

385
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,199
here and get here. There's a there's a

386
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:20,639
lot that you need to be able to um you

387
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:22,079
know, uh the if you to get in again

388
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,600
these days, you have to take the SAT,

389
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,959
which means you give, you know, you are

390
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,600
required to give a bunch of information

391
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:29,360
to the College Board. Um and you also

392
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,800
like are in the process of doing that,

393
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,240
you're probably asked to opt in to a

394
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,680
bunch of things. I had I had a master's

395
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,480
student I can't remember all the details

396
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,399
now but uh um did their thesis on

397
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,560
essentially the kinds of things that the

398
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,800
college board did with information that

399
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,120
they got um which to some extent you

400
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,600
could say something like like if you opt

401
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,880
into flowers.com or something like that

402
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,399
you're like man I really want good

403
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,800
information about what flowers are

404
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,519
available and then flowers.com sells

405
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,120
your data you're like well that's like

406
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:00,560
maybe that's a terrible system to exist

407
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,160
in um but flowers.com did ask me if I

408
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,600
wanted to give them my data and I did

409
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,199
agree to let them do anything with it.

410
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,480
So like I you know and that was just my

411
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,839
voluntary relationship but you didn't

412
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,079
really have a voluntary relationship

413
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:11,759
with the college board. Um you know you

414
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,880
had no choice but to interact with a

415
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,959
college board to make it through this

416
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,160
major life milestone. And so to you know

417
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:18,000
to the extent that the college board

418
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,320
does things with your information that's

419
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,519
a different relationship um that you

420
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,240
have with them than you have with

421
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:26,560
flowers.com or pets.com or your own

422
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,800
favorite thing. Um, okay. So, we just we

423
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:32,160
live in a world in which schools have

424
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:34,800
enormous amounts of individ

425
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,399
um about their individual students. Um,

426
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,800
that there's probably pretty big

427
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,480
generational shifts in that experience.

428
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:44,480
You know, one of the main laws that

429
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:46,240
governs um these records is the federal

430
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,759
furpa, the federal education records

431
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,800
protection act, which I think was off

432
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,639
authored in the 1970s. um you know the

433
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,199
kind like we basically we have a legal

434
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:57,040
framework for supervising this data um

435
00:16:55,199 --> 00:17:00,000
which was just built in an entirely

436
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:02,240
different era um you know um furo refers

437
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
to this thing called student records um

438
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,679
at the time it would have been entire it

439
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,120
would have been very very clear what a

440
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,959
student record was you would have like

441
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,640
gone to the registars's office and there

442
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,919
would have been like big file drawers

443
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,559
and you would have pulled out a file and

444
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:16,559
been like that is the student record um

445
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:19,360
are your clicker questions part of your

446
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:21,839
student record are your um codio

447
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:24,079
assignments, are your Canvas entries,

448
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:25,360
are your, you know, Piaza form things

449
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,720
like are those part of your student

450
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,720
records? Like there, you know, there's

451
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:32,200
there's much less clarity over those

452
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:36,480
things um than one might think.

453
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,480
Um the uh

454
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,240
um the term the term toxic has a kind of

455
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,760
negative connotation, but I borrowed it

456
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,320
from a security researcher named Bruce

457
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:49,440
Shire. Um, and part of his argument was

458
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,960
that like toxic things are powerful. Um,

459
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,039
you know, there there are, you know,

460
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,720
chemotherapies are toxic. Um, and they

461
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,240
save your life. They're great. Like like

462
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,480
sometimes it's really good to interact

463
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:01,200
with powerful toxic things. Um, but

464
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,880
toxic things are also dangerous. Um, in

465
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,200
you know, in particular, I think most of

466
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,120
us have an inclination um that when

467
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,640
something is toxic, you should not leave

468
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,840
it lying around for a long period of

469
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,080
time. That was kind of the heart of

470
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:15,760
Bruce's argument was was that companies

471
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:19,360
were making a big mistake by having um

472
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:21,360
by having a a a very capacious approach

473
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,799
to the collection and storage of data.

474
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,240
Um that actually what you should be

475
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,600
doing is like just taking the data you

476
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,440
need and getting rid of the rest of it

477
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,559
because it's a toxic asset to have lying

478
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,160
around. The more you have it lying

479
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,799
around, the more you're vulnerable to

480
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:35,440
breaches, to other kinds of actors doing

481
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,840
various nefarious things um with that

482
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,880
data.

483
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:42,160
Um, if you're an educational

484
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,520
researcher, what what what kinds of

485
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,200
thoughts might you have when you see

486
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:49,080
this like giant list of the data that

487
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,080
schools collect about people?

488
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:56,640
Maybe like honestly like the first thing

489
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,400
that kind of came to my mind was like

490
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,799
excitement in the sense of like if

491
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:05,440
you're forming any type of research and

492
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:07,840
trying to study how any about a person

493
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,880
can like affect whatever you're studying

494
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:13,200
like if you have all of this data then

495
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:17,520
like there's really no limit to what

496
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:20,640
you're able to um kind of research. Um

497
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,840
this was an article from today two days

498
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,840
ago. I'm going to give you a couple of

499
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,760
cutting edge things. Middle schools in

500
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,880
Norway banned smartphones. The benefits

501
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:32,600
were dramatic. A study shows um a study

502
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:36,240
published earlier this year um from a

503
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:38,000
Norwegian doctoral student. Um where

504
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,120
there were hundreds of schools across

505
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,600
Norway that it um that in various ways

506
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,840
banned smartphones. Um some of the

507
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:48,400
outcomes they look at are student

508
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:51,520
outcomes like learning but also mental

509
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,440
health. Um, I show that banning

510
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,280
smartphones significantly decreases the

511
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,760
health care takeup for psychological

512
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:00,080
symptoms and diseases among girls.

513
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:02,240
Postban bullying among both genders

514
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,840
decreases. Girls GPA improves and their

515
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,679
likelihood of attending an academic high

516
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,840
school track increases. These effects

517
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:10,720
are larger from girls from so from low

518
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,960
socioeconomic backgrounds. Um, so in

519
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,160
Norway they have vast informations about

520
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,440
students. Here are some things that you

521
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,799
need to know to make this study work.

522
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,200
You need to know all the students

523
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:22,160
grades. You need to know where all the

524
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:25,440
students go to college. You need to know

525
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:27,440
whenever the students visit the uh

526
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,120
Norwegian health care system and what

527
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,360
kinds of requests they're making from

528
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:34,480
the Norwegian health care system. Uh and

529
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:36,000
you need to have them every year take a

530
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,840
well-being survey that includes a bunch

531
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,679
of questions about bullying. Like that's

532
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,679
a lot of information for the state to

533
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:44,159
collect about all these students. But it

534
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:46,159
certainly seems to me like a pretty

535
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,000
pro-social thing to be able to say,

536
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,159
"Hey, you know, if we, you know, if we

537
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,679
look at the schools that ban um

538
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,240
smartphones in middle school versus the

539
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,679
ones that don't, um there seem to be all

540
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,440
of these health outcomes." And we can

541
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,360
even actually say that the you know, the

542
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,720
health, it's not just academic outcomes,

543
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,159
it's also health outcomes, although the

544
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,000
health outcomes are probably related in

545
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,679
some way to the academic outcomes, but

546
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,240
it's particularly for girls and it's

547
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:10,240
particularly for um students in low

548
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,400
socioeconomic environments. like that

549
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:15,280
seems like pretty useful stuff to know.

550
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:17,520
Um and so that is the kind of tradeoff

551
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:20,799
that people would face as they're going

552
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:22,960
back and forth between um you know these

553
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:25,200
like the the massive data that we

554
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,360
collect about students is also what lets

555
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,960
us do pretty sophisticated complicated

556
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,559
research about those students to be able

557
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:34,480
to make claims about how well they're

558
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:34,480
doing in various parts of their lives.

559
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:40,400
Um toxic power of data experiment. All

560
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,280
right, I'll tell you about at least a

561
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:45,200
couple of other things.

562
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:49,360
Um, there was a study that you read

563
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:51,600
about um in the chapter last night. Um,

564
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,200
this is a headline that came out. It was

565
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,280
in 2018. There's a headline that came

566
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,200
out about it. Pearson tested social

567
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:00,000
psychological messages in learning

568
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,000
software with mixed results. I don't did

569
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,840
we talk about mindset in this class?

570
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,799
Maybe we did briefly. Growth mindset and

571
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,919
fixed mindset. something you're probably

572
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,919
all familiar with it because teachers

573
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,600
talk about all the time. Um but there

574
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,559
were or education researchers other

575
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:17,360
folks um there are some social

576
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:18,880
psychologists who have identified um uh

577
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,320
two kinds of mindsets that people often

578
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,159
have towards learning or other kinds of

579
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,679
things. One is a fixed mindset which

580
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,360
generally says like some people are

581
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:28,720
smart and some people are not smart. Um

582
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,320
and a growth mindset suggests that um

583
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,679
people have fluid intelligence and you

584
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,360
can make yourself more intelligent in

585
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:36,640
other kinds of things. seems to be a

586
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:39,360
pretty good idea um to help young people

587
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,440
adopt the latter mindset rather than the

588
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,120
former mindset. Um better to have them

589
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,280
think uh have a growth mindset rather

590
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:48,960
than a fixed mindset. Exactly how much

591
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:51,360
it matters um is a subject of enormous

592
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,200
debate. There were a number of early

593
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,360
studies that suggested it could matter

594
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,039
quite enormously to all kinds of people.

595
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,799
And some of the more recent larger

596
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:00,320
studies suggest that like the best

597
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:02,720
things that we can do that we know how

598
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,880
to do to improve growth mindset only

599
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,640
help some students and maybe only help

600
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:10,559
them a little bit like a lot of things

601
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:15,600
that we study. Um, so Pearson um offers

602
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:17,679
all kinds of software products and um uh

603
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,600
I think this was a a line of computer

604
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,039
science software products and so you're

605
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,480
like you do a bunch of programming

606
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:24,240
exercises of multiple choice questions

607
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:27,360
or things like that and the thing that

608
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:30,720
they decided to add was not just right

609
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:32,240
or wrong messages but um randomized you

610
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,600
some people getting growth mindset

611
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,200
messages and some people not getting

612
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,640
growth mindset messages. So, I won't get

613
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,400
this exactly right, but example of a

614
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:42,480
growth mindset message, you know, might

615
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:44,320
be something like um you know, uh that's

616
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,080
not right, but keep trying and you can

617
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,440
learn more or you know, other other

618
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,480
things to suggest that if you keep

619
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:55,200
working at this, you'll get better.

620
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:58,000
Um what seems good about implementing

621
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,600
um that kind of intervention in a system

622
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,760
like this and what seems problematic

623
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:05,400
about uh implementing an intervention in

624
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,400
a system like this?

625
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:11,360
Well, problematic is that the control

626
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:13,360
group is essentially like not

627
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:16,960
necessarily being hurt but not

628
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:19,520
benefiting at all. And like like if

629
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:22,640
you're saying that a growth mindset

630
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:24,240
really does help people, choosing to

631
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,159
essentially not help them by putting

632
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,240
them in the control group. Yeah, that's

633
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,400
interest. So I mean Pearson So Pearson

634
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,799
goes and reads a bunch of research about

635
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:35,440
growth mindset and they're like, "Hey,

636
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:39,279
this growth mind stuff seems to work

637
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:41,600
sometimes. Um, but they don't decide to

638
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:43,440
just add it to their product. They add

639
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,679
it to their product in this kind of

640
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:49,440
experimental paradigm where some people

641
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:50,880
get it and some people don't. Um, and so

642
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,679
people in the same class are going to

643
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,679
have a different experience. Um so Dana

644
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:58,320
proposes that one problem with that is

645
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:00,000
that um the people who get the uh

646
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,440
experimental intervention might benefit

647
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,200
in the way that people in the control

648
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,960
group don't. What are some other

649
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,440
problems that kind of potentially could

650
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,440
show up with

651
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:18,640
this? I guess you have to take into

652
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,799
account like who's in the control group

653
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,480
and who's in the experimental group. How

654
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:24,000
good of a job do they do at filtering

655
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,919
out their students to make sure it's

656
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,760
roughly equal in terms of like

657
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,919
socioeconomic background, your prior

658
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,840
experience with the subject, etc. That's

659
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:34,559
good. So, I would and I would say under

660
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:36,799
most circumstances, especially in these

661
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:39,840
kinds of digital systems, we can be

662
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:41,760
really good at randomization. um you

663
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,559
know you I mean you could imagine that

664
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:46,240
if you're like randomizing across whole

665
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,600
schools or something like that there

666
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,760
might be people who are like well I

667
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,200
don't want my school to do it or you put

668
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,559
me in a control group but I just want to

669
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,559
get the intervention anyway or something

670
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:57,760
like that. um these kind of digital

671
00:25:54,559 --> 00:26:00,080
systems can be like very strict about

672
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,760
the implementation of randomization. Um

673
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,679
and you could be pretty sure that

674
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,120
there's not that there's not going to be

675
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,559
any kind of bias and deliver. I mean

676
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,159
there you can imagine ways for bias to

677
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:09,200
show up but for the most part it's going

678
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,520
to be some you know there's going to be

679
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:14,320
some computer code which is like you

680
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:16,799
know if exercise four like assign

681
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,960
someone a zero or one control is zero

682
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:20,320
experiment is one and especially if you

683
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,600
have hundreds or thousands of people who

684
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,200
are participating in the experiment you

685
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:26,159
can be pretty sure that those two groups

686
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:28,080
are are the same. Um not only that but

687
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:30,000
you can also verify that they're the

688
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:32,240
same if you collect all this information

689
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,200
about them going into it. Um so these

690
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,640
things are going to be pretty good at

691
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:40,480
that. Um well I don't know if there was

692
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:42,799
any consent given but like from what I

693
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:45,360
can gather is that this was just done

694
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:47,520
without the students knowledge. Yes. And

695
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:50,000
so it's like I wouldn't necessarily like

696
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,360
it if I like came out of MIT graduating

697
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,120
and then someone's like okay here's a

698
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,520
paper of like what we analyzed during

699
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,880
their four years here. I'm like I don't

700
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,039
necessarily want to know that people

701
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,200
have been like watching my like every

702
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:03,279
move and analyzing like certain things

703
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,760
about me psychologically. Uh-huh. Why

704
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:07,200
not? It feels a little creepy. Feels

705
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,120
like you're being watched, right? Feels

706
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:12,320
a little creepy. Without any consent, I

707
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:14,240
can see why this is like good. Other

708
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,240
other observations that people have?

709
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,799
Also, calling it like a social

710
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:21,120
psychological message kind of makes it

711
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:22,880
feel like the experimental groups being

712
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,720
like propagandized or something like

713
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,360
that. And so it's like, oh, they're

714
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:30,720
being experimented with these like these

715
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:33,120
different gen psychological messages.

716
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:35,279
Yeah. It's like it seems like that

717
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:38,720
specific verbiage can like be kind of

718
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:40,159
uncomfortable for people to accept as

719
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,799
something that is potentially

720
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:44,080
beneficial. Good. Yeah. Yeah. So I mean

721
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:45,840
the reason why people are doing the

722
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,679
social psychological messaging is

723
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,919
because maybe it works actually you know

724
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:51,919
and it's not and in this particular case

725
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,520
it's not just like hey we got kind of a

726
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,720
hunch this works these like well

727
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,240
actually there you know at this point

728
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,520
there was maybe like a decade of

729
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,960
research that was was totally plausibly

730
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,640
suggesting that this could genuinely

731
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,480
help students learn and improve their

732
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,799
their life outcomes and other kinds of

733
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,480
things like that. Um and the and the way

734
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:09,840
you do that is through an inter you know

735
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,760
through a social psychological

736
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,120
intervention. Although it's you know not

737
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:16,520
clear to me what in schools is not

738
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,520
social psychological.

739
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,440
I was going to say another thing that as

740
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:25,360
much as like we need the two populations

741
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:28,240
to be like just as representative are

742
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:30,320
the experimental groups even

743
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,159
representative of the general population

744
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:35,279
like you have to imagine that people

745
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:37,279
aren't being forced to participate in

746
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:39,200
these things or maybe if they are like

747
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:40,799
the schools that they chose are they

748
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,559
actually representative of the entire

749
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:45,200
population. So because like there

750
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:47,039
obviously are studies where they get

751
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,799
like outstanding results but then the

752
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:50,240
population used is not representative of

753
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:52,399
the general population. So then once

754
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,320
they apply those doesn't actually work.

755
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:56,000
Yeah. Yeah. Good. Um you know and to

756
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,159
some extent you might think that

757
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,200
organizations like Pearson would have an

758
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:03,679
advantage over much smaller companies um

759
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,760
because if you have products that are

760
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:07,200
adopted very very widely across the

761
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,559
country in lots of different contexts. I

762
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,080
mean, you might for practical purposes

763
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:13,279
say like, let's just pick these handful

764
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:14,640
of schools um to be able to test things

765
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:17,000
in, but you could say like we're going

766
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,960
to pick these handful of of schools

767
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,360
because like these are particularly

768
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,039
representative schools. Um or, you know,

769
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,640
there might be systems that are that are

770
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:26,399
adopted and laid out in such a way that

771
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,399
you say like, well, let's, you know,

772
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:30,080
let's just pick 1% of all students in

773
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:32,159
any of the schools who are using our

774
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,520
system to get, you know, um participate

775
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,880
in this randomized study or something

776
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,520
like that. I feel like we talked a lot

777
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:40,240
about like all of the things that go

778
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,840
into using like a software program

779
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,240
because obviously that then entails that

780
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:46,399
you have something to run the software

781
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,720
program on. So anything online already

782
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:52,159
comes with its own set of like biases

783
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:54,000
and um like things that affect the types

784
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:55,760
of people that are using it. Yeah. Yeah.

785
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,240
Yeah. No, I think that's fair. Also,

786
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:01,919
another thing that I just realized in

787
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:04,799
what uh Dana said was the population

788
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:06,159
that that they're testing this on is in

789
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:09,360
college. So, they've already probably

790
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:11,919
developed a mindset. Um and also they

791
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:14,159
are in college. Like they probably have

792
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:16,399
already a good enough mindset that got

793
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:18,720
them to college. Yep. Yep. although that

794
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:20,159
you know I mean and um well one thing

795
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,600
that I really love about the study which

796
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:26,880
I think um so so I I wrote some after

797
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:28,480
this article came out um I wrote a bunch

798
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,240
of things which which basically said I

799
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,559
think this is a pretty unfair article.

800
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:35,200
Um here I'll give you the case for why I

801
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:37,200
I I think what Pearson did here is

802
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,240
admirable and needs to be done more

803
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,919
although you don't have to agree with

804
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:44,000
me. Um so number one

805
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:45,520
um generally speaking there's a body of

806
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,320
research that suggests these things are

807
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:50,320
a good idea. We don't know however are

808
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,480
they a good idea in this particular

809
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:55,279
product for this particular population.

810
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:57,200
So I think it makes more sense um to run

811
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:59,200
an experiment in this particular product

812
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,039
for this particular population to test

813
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,279
the thing rather than just roll it out.

814
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:04,960
I mean this is an important sort of

815
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:06,960
counterfactual. If Pearson had simply

816
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,559
added these messages to everyone in the

817
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,799
product, there never would have been an

818
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:13,679
article about it. Um, nobody would have

819
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:15,840
ever written, you know, like like like

820
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:17,679
you know, encouraging messages show up

821
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,080
in software product is like not an

822
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:22,559
article that even the education press um

823
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:24,320
is going to populate. Um, number two,

824
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:28,000
you know, like another counterfactual,

825
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:32,080
there is no nonsocial psychological

826
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,399
response um to like every mark your

827
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:36,000
teacher has ever put on your paper to

828
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:38,640
indicate whether you're right or wrong

829
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,080
is a social psychological message. Um,

830
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,120
if you go on edex and get something

831
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,159
right, you're going to get a green

832
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:44,240
check. If you're going to get something

833
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:46,320
wrong, you're going to get a red X. Like

834
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,159
that is a set of messaging. If you've

835
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:51,279
ever had a, you know, none of us would

836
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:53,200
say that teachers who say try harder or

837
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:54,640
that was great. I'm really proud of you.

838
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,559
Like no one would be like, you know,

839
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:59,039
Miss Jenkins, stop manipulating my

840
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:02,720
children. Like no, that's like exactly

841
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:05,360
what we want them to do. Um

842
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:09,519
uh some people are concerned um about

843
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:10,799
consent. Um people who go to school do

844
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:12,880
not consent to their learning

845
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:16,640
experiences. Um, one of the things that

846
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:19,039
we do as a state is say like you must

847
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,799
learn stuff and in fact you must learn

848
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:23,679
stuff that the state just requires you

849
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:26,080
to learn. Um, you don't get you know um

850
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:27,600
these people didn't get to decide which

851
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:30,880
Pearson product or which computer

852
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:33,200
science project they they chose. Um why

853
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:35,039
should they get to decide whether or not

854
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:38,000
they get an experimental version or a

855
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:39,840
control version? And in fact um uh the

856
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,679
US government for the most part agrees

857
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,840
with this principle. So um there's a

858
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:46,960
rule called the common rule um which

859
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:49,760
dictates how research can be conducted.

860
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:51,200
Um uh there's a bunch of policy guidance

861
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,720
that's associated with that and there's

862
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,720
some categories of research that are

863
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,279
exempt. The first category of research

864
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,519
that's exempt is research about typical

865
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:00,960
educational practices. Um if you're

866
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,960
studying the kinds of ways people teach

867
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,519
and learn in the classroom, you are not

868
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:07,679
held to the same standard if you're

869
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:09,919
doing pharmaceutical research or

870
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,120
something like that. Um there are some

871
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:12,559
there are some exception like if you're

872
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:15,600
doing things that you that like you

873
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:18,880
could reasonably believe in advance um

874
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:20,320
might harm people um then you're not

875
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,320
exempted in the same way although you

876
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:24,559
can still conceivably uh do the

877
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:26,480
research. Um you know another thing

878
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:29,760
that's important about the study is that

879
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:32,159
um like people people talk about the

880
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:34,159
potential benefits of an experiment um

881
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:36,399
but experiments can also harm people.

882
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:38,399
Like it it could be that even if on

883
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:39,840
average this growth messaging was great

884
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:42,000
and worked in lots of studies, it could

885
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:45,440
be that like in this particular context

886
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,200
or other kinds of things um uh it made

887
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,320
things worse and we should probably make

888
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,399
sure that when we introduce things in

889
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,159
the classroom make things worse. Um, how

890
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:53,960
many people would have been concerned?

891
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:58,559
Let's say that in

892
00:33:53,960 --> 00:34:00,399
2017 they had everyone use one Pearson

893
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:03,440
product maybe that doesn't have any

894
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:05,440
growth messaging and in 2018 everyone

895
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:08,000
use a Pearson product that had the

896
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,119
messaging associated with it. Um, do you

897
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,240
think that would have raised people's

898
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:13,760
concern or felt

899
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:16,760
creepy? Like why not? Why does that feel

900
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,760
okay?

901
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:26,320
You're like, "Wait a minute, it's the

902
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,599
exact same thing." I think there's this

903
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:31,280
idea of

904
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:32,960
like potential discrimination, like,

905
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:36,000
"Hey, why can't I be part of that?"

906
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:38,159
Like, it's either everybody or nobody.

907
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,119
But part the more an intervention is

908
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:43,440
particularly powerful, the more you're

909
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:45,919
like, ah, it feels kind of like if you

910
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,679
know control group like gets this

911
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:51,119
intervention and gets an average grade

912
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:52,560
of 89. Um, an experimental group, you

913
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:54,879
know, gets the intervention and they

914
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,159
have an average grade of 89.5. Like

915
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:59,599
that's there's something that seems

916
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:02,400
unfair about that. Although again like

917
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:04,160
you know if in 2018 we give you a

918
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,000
software product that you get an average

919
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:07,680
grade of an 89 and then the following

920
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,920
year we give you a software product with

921
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,839
an average grade of

922
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:12,760
89.5. Um like your birth year was pretty

923
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:15,200
random

924
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:16,800
too. And so there's something about

925
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,240
that. I mean you know the case I want to

926
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,040
make is that here here's another way to

927
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:23,359
think about it.

928
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:24,720
Um most people would be appalled by an

929
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:27,440
education system that didn't have

930
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:29,599
variation. Like my hunch is all of you

931
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,599
believe that variation is an essential

932
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:34,560
part of educational systems. Like you

933
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:36,320
believe that your teachers, your public

934
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,000
your p your textbook publishers, your

935
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,000
software developers should be trying to

936
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,359
improve their products. Um they should

937
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,480
be trying to improve their instruction.

938
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:44,079
They should be trying to improve their

939
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,680
lesson plans. The only way you do that

940
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:47,359
is through variation. You teach one

941
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,720
lesson plan one year, you teach a

942
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:50,000
different lesson plan the next year.

943
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,920
Sometimes it's better, sometimes it

944
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,240
works. My hunch is you all are totally

945
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:56,640
comfortable with the idea that some of

946
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,960
that variation will be bad um and that

947
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:02,079
most of it on average will be good. Um

948
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:05,200
the main thing that randomized trials

949
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:07,119
like this do is they take that variation

950
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:10,240
and they make it systematic so we can

951
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:13,440
learn from it. Um if we do one thing in

952
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:15,520
2017 and a different thing in 2018, it's

953
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,800
actually it's actually much much harder

954
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,960
to figure out if the different thing

955
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,440
worked or not. um because all the people

956
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:23,200
in 2017 might be in some systematic way

957
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,920
different from the people in 2018 when

958
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:28,480
we the the best way to be sure that the

959
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,839
difference between two groups is just

960
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,240
because of the thing we're intervening

961
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:34,720
about is a randomized trial. That is the

962
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:37,040
magic of randomized trial. Um so they

963
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,880
are power like like everyone in the

964
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:41,480
education system believes in variation.

965
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:44,079
We all want things to improve.

966
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:47,280
Um, it's actually not that hard to

967
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:49,240
convince people that the best way to

968
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:52,720
systematically vary things is through

969
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:55,839
randomization. Um, and almost all of us

970
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:57,440
find that randomization creepy. Um, like

971
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:59,119
even if you sort of explain all, you're

972
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,400
like, ah, it still doesn't feel right.

973
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:01,680
Still doesn't feel there's there's been

974
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,280
some cool studies I've done in the past.

975
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:06,240
It shows up in healthcare, shows up in

976
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:08,880
other kinds of, you know, things like um

977
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:10,480
uh you know, you ask patients like, "Do

978
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,000
you want an unproven treatment that

979
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,320
might work better?" And they'll be like,

980
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,920
"Well, yeah, maybe." Um, do you want to

981
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,760
be randomized to an unproven treatment

982
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,079
that might work better? No. Definitely.

983
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,200
It's like it's the same thing. Um,

984
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:25,280
except we can learn from the

985
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:28,520
randomization. Um my question is in this

986
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:32,880
case like how are

987
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:33,880
these different from like when companies

988
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,640
release

989
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:39,200
betas that some people get and some

990
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:41,320
people don't? Oh here's I mean every

991
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:43,440
time you interact with a software

992
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:45,280
product every time you interact with a

993
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,640
web-based software product there is a

994
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,119
reasonable chance you're participating

995
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:51,119
in an experiment just like this. Um one

996
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:53,280
this the numbers won't be right. One out

997
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:55,200
of every hundred times you go to Amazon,

998
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,599
um the buy button is going to be green

999
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:59,359
instead of blue. And someone is doing a

1000
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:01,920
test to figure out whether or not you

1001
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:03,280
pushing the green button is better. um

1002
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,359
you know, one out of every hundred time

1003
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,040
or thousand times or 10 times you go to

1004
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:08,880
Google, they're going to give you some

1005
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,960
variation of the search algorithm to see

1006
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,880
if you're happier or you linger longer

1007
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:16,400
or you're more likely to click ads on,

1008
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:18,720
you know, um we interact every day with

1009
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,560
software platforms that are collecting

1010
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,720
vast amounts of information on us and

1011
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:24,040
conducting experiments on us all the

1012
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:27,119
time.

1013
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:29,680
Um th though the reason why those

1014
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:31,760
companies use those two approaches is

1015
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:34,960
because they are enormously powerful at

1016
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:37,200
improving products. Um the reason why

1017
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:39,440
just about any query you have you go

1018
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,960
into Google and ask it a question and it

1019
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,920
tells you an accurate answer that's

1020
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:46,240
relevant to the question you asked is

1021
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:48,240
because they have conducted billions of

1022
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:50,320
experiments on millions or billions of

1023
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:52,000
people uh all throughout the last you

1024
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:54,320
know 20 25 years that they've been

1025
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:58,160
operating. um it is an like an essential

1026
00:38:54,320 --> 00:39:01,520
part of our software infrastructure. Um

1027
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:04,720
and um I don't like I don't know does

1028
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:06,480
the idea that you are are participating

1029
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,800
in experiments all the time when you go

1030
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,240
Amazon shopping like does that does does

1031
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:14,320
that have the same level of creepiness

1032
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:16,880
to you like for some it's like yeah Jeff

1033
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,560
Bezos do whatever you want but but like

1034
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,960
but you know but but we feel differently

1035
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:23,280
about Pearson for some reason. I have a

1036
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:25,280
question about like beyond the like is

1037
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:28,320
this creepy or not creepy question but

1038
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:30,400
like if I'm a I have decided to buy a

1039
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:32,960
product like I'm paying to use Amazon or

1040
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:35,359
I'm paying to use Pearson and with that

1041
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,960
is the assumption that like I understand

1042
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:38,880
the thing I am buying because you

1043
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,200
pitched it to a certain way and I will

1044
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,880
get it. So then like how does the

1045
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,400
question of like are you allowed or not

1046
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,720
allowed to do this go from there? And it

1047
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:49,359
would be a and it would be a a huge

1048
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:51,359
difference from historical educational

1049
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:53,680
curriculum material purchases. Like it

1050
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:55,839
used to be, you know, like I bought uh

1051
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:58,079
you know, H Hotton Mifflin biology eth

1052
00:39:55,839 --> 00:40:00,800
edition and I just know exactly what's

1053
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:02,079
in eth edition. Like and in fact, you

1054
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,440
know, the salesperson is going to come

1055
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:04,960
back when ninth edition's going to come

1056
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,400
out and they're going to be like, here's

1057
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,599
what's different about ninth edition,

1058
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,960
why you could buy it. And I might be

1059
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:10,800
like, no, I don't like what you did in

1060
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,160
ninth edition. um I'm going to switch to

1061
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,680
a different company's products because

1062
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:17,760
these these improvements are not

1063
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:19,839
improvements. Um yeah. Um under what

1064
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:22,480
circumstances should companies be able

1065
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:24,880
to dynamically improve their educational

1066
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:27,520
products? Um what kind of information

1067
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:30,320
should they make accessible about that?

1068
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:32,560
Um should they tell families? Should

1069
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:34,640
they tell educators? Should they tell

1070
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:36,880
you know my people could come up with

1071
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,560
different answer to these questions. Um,

1072
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,480
I think actually publishing a bunch of

1073
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:43,119
that information is probably enormously

1074
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:44,480
important, but not to parents and

1075
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:46,480
teachers and educators. Parents and

1076
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:48,640
teachers and educators have no time to

1077
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:50,800
be like tracking how your Pearson

1078
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:53,680
computer science like practice problems

1079
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:55,599
are changing. Um, there are specialized

1080
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:57,440
advocates across the country who focus

1081
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:59,119
on education, who focus on student

1082
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,560
privacy or other kinds of things who

1083
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:02,720
like actually would have the time and

1084
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:04,880
expertise to follow those audit records.

1085
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:06,720
Um but like you know if we started

1086
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,880
sending home a notice to parents every

1087
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:10,079
time a you know a company who used one

1088
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,480
of their products was conducting an

1089
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:13,920
experiment people like it would just be

1090
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,319
you know the the back it would be the

1091
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:19,200
terms and service conditions of your um

1092
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:22,960
presumably too by the way um it's it's

1093
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:24,960
very unlikely that when whatever school

1094
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:27,119
bought this Pearson product presumably

1095
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,960
that like their lawyers are competent

1096
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:31,040
and they made them sign a purchase and

1097
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,560
sale agreement that included these kinds

1098
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,480
of conditions in them. Although it's

1099
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,920
also not it's also the case that like

1100
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,079
you know the researchers who did this

1101
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:39,440
thing didn't sit down with these schools

1102
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:41,040
and are like let me tell you what we're

1103
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,720
doing in the next phase so that you you

1104
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,800
know I mean they might I think in this

1105
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:47,400
case they didn't give them much

1106
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:51,440
indication. Um

1107
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:54,560
um would it be like like I guess back to

1108
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:57,119
the conversation of like if it's like

1109
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:59,359
creepy or not. Do you think it might

1110
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:01,359
have anything to do with like the

1111
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:03,040
illusion of choice that you're given?

1112
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:05,839
Like for example, like if you're on

1113
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:08,000
Amazon or something, you can or like if

1114
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:09,920
if if you're on an app, you have the

1115
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,319
choice like sometimes not to update the

1116
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:14,560
app and just stay on the previous y

1117
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:18,160
setting or like if you have something

1118
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:21,040
like Amazon, like you can not use Amazon

1119
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:23,200
or like you you're you're perceiving it

1120
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:25,359
as like you're choosing to opt into

1121
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,560
that. Well, like in a situation where

1122
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:28,240
like you have to use a certain

1123
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:30,240
technology in school, like you could

1124
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:34,400
argue that like this student doesn't

1125
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:35,920
have a choice to opt out of this if they

1126
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,280
like and you could and you could see

1127
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,359
that choice operating at different

1128
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,960
levels. So, a grade school student has

1129
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:43,040
zero choice about whether or not to go

1130
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:46,240
to grade school. Every college student

1131
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:47,760
chose to go to college. Um, now sort of

1132
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:50,000
like once you've chosen to go to

1133
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,760
college, it doesn't it doesn't feel like

1134
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,079
that should mean you have to accept

1135
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:56,560
everything that comes along with

1136
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:59,119
college. Um, although again like you

1137
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:01,280
know you don't like like you know you

1138
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:03,520
could you could choose some majors over

1139
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,920
other majors based on the technology.

1140
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:08,720
You choose some classes over classes. Um

1141
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:12,560
the moment in recently in which some of

1142
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:15,040
this most came into focus was when

1143
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:19,520
schools started requiring students to

1144
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:21,359
adopt um proctoring software. Um so

1145
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:24,240
probably none of you have have any of

1146
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:26,560
you ever taken a remotely proctored test

1147
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:27,520
um at MIT?

1148
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:30,960
Where where did you take a remotely

1149
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:34,280
proctor test at MIT? Uh I believe uh

1150
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:37,200
there was the ASC during my like

1151
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:39,520
freshman like starting year. They used

1152
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:41,680
like some weird proctoring software for

1153
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:43,680
that where you had to like like take

1154
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:45,760
your webcam or take your laptop or

1155
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,920
webcam show the rest of your room all

1156
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:51,520
these kinds of things essentially. Good.

1157
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:55,680
Um so uh there are a number of cases

1158
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:57,119
where um for instance uh universities

1159
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:59,200
implemented this kind of proctoring

1160
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:00,720
software mid-semester

1161
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,319
um and in fact implemented it

1162
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:04,560
mid-semester and required students to

1163
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:06,319
pay for it. Um that like you can imagine

1164
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:08,560
that as a set of circumstances which

1165
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:10,240
like most draws the eye of people

1166
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,599
because like I've like I've already

1167
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:13,520
committed to this college, I've already

1168
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:15,119
committed to this course. Now you're

1169
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:18,160
making me you know essentially install

1170
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:19,839
spyware on my machine. um you know and

1171
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,359
then like I don't know have some random

1172
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:23,200
person see what my dorm room looks like

1173
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:25,599
and other kinds of or my bedroom you

1174
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:27,839
know these sort of things seem creepy um

1175
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:29,839
arguably maybe they're less creepy the

1176
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:32,480
more that they're disclosed to people

1177
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:34,800
over time although I also use the phrase

1178
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:36,480
illusion of choice um because in fact

1179
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:39,440
for lots of things you know for instance

1180
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:42,079
like every there are no cell service

1181
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:45,040
companies that compete on the basis of

1182
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:47,200
not selling your location data um like

1183
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:50,480
it is not really a choice to not have a

1184
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:53,280
mobile phone um anymore in society and

1185
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:54,720
so you're not really ch like um you know

1186
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,839
in theory that's a choice but it's not

1187
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,040
really one you know going to college

1188
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:58,160
like for some people is not really a

1189
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,359
choice like you're going to have to go

1190
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:02,480
to choice to have the life that you want

1191
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:05,359
and things like that um uh but I do but

1192
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:07,440
I do think K12 students in particular

1193
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:10,000
now another sort of unusual feature of

1194
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:13,839
this is that and it goes back to this

1195
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:15,839
sort of data collection um you know K12

1196
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:18,079
many K12 students across the country are

1197
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:20,240
mandated to create a Google account. Um,

1198
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:22,400
and then Google has reams of data about

1199
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:24,640
all these kinds of things that they uh

1200
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:28,079
that they that they do with that data.

1201
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:30,480
Um, and uh um you know and there might

1202
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:32,079
be various ways that again you know so

1203
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,160
should like to what extent these things

1204
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:36,079
are legitimate or not. It's probably

1205
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,440
much less of a debate these days, but

1206
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:40,319
definitely when schools were first

1207
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:42,640
adopting Google for education. Um, it

1208
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:45,040
was not uncommon to hear that school

1209
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:47,440
boards had uh really vigorous complaints

1210
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:49,119
from parents. And oftentimes the com the

1211
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,560
most vigorous complaints came from

1212
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:53,040
parents who worked in the software

1213
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:54,480
industry. Um, like do like I know who

1214
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,160
these people are. I work for these

1215
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:58,880
companies. Um, how are you going to make

1216
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:00,560
my kid do these kinds of things? Um,

1217
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,800
let's talk about another one of these

1218
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:04,720
cases.

1219
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:09,440
Um so another story that you read about

1220
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:11,040
was in Bloom um in 2013. So um the Gates

1221
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,640
Foundation along with a number of other

1222
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:15,760
organizations, Wireless Generation, some

1223
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:18,599
other people sort of observed like man

1224
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:22,480
here's a weird thing. um

1225
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:25,760
companies who serve schools have tons of

1226
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:28,720
data about students and sort of the only

1227
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:30,960
way we can make this system work or the

1228
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:33,200
way the system currently works is like

1229
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,880
some company goes to a school district

1230
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:37,119
and says we'll operate this service for

1231
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:40,400
you but here's all the data we need. Um

1232
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:42,960
and the schools are like yeah okay deal.

1233
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:44,400
Um, and if you make enough of those

1234
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,000
kinds of arrangements, I mean, we

1235
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,680
another exercise we could do here is

1236
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,280
like make a list of all of the

1237
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:51,680
educational software products that

1238
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:53,520
you've ever used in schools. Um, and you

1239
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:56,160
all could probably come up with lists of

1240
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:57,440
like dozens or more software products

1241
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,280
that you've encountered in some kind of

1242
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:01,440
way. Those are all people that have some

1243
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:02,560
kind of data about you somewhere. Um,

1244
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,079
that seems like a terrible

1245
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:06,640
infrastructure. Like you require people

1246
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:08,880
to go to schools. um the schools make

1247
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:10,560
contracts with third parties to provide

1248
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:12,960
services and all those third parties end

1249
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:15,640
up with sort of shards of data. Um so

1250
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:19,200
the idea of inbloom

1251
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:22,359
was let's concentrate all of the data

1252
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:25,359
about students in one nonprofit

1253
00:47:22,359 --> 00:47:27,040
organization. Um let's get let's you

1254
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:29,200
know it be something along the lines of

1255
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:30,880
trying to generate the kind of data set

1256
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:33,119
that the Norwegian study that I just

1257
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:35,200
showed you would require. Um like let's

1258
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:37,040
get all their student records. let's get

1259
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:38,800
all their let's get let's get all all

1260
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:42,160
their app usage let's get all those

1261
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:46,160
kinds of things um and have a nonprofit

1262
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:49,920
entity hold on to that data um and in

1263
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:53,920
particular let's make it so that instead

1264
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:55,359
of um companies making arrangements with

1265
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:57,599
individual school districts to get

1266
00:47:55,359 --> 00:48:00,720
access to the data they need they just

1267
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:03,119
get in touch with this nonprofit

1268
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:05,839
um now what could potentially be good

1269
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:08,640
about having a nonprofit intermediary

1270
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:10,240
between schools and third parties that

1271
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:13,119
want to provide services to schools but

1272
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,119
require data to do

1273
00:48:13,319 --> 00:48:17,760
it. I think public perception is that

1274
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:19,599
nonprofits are a lot more trustworthy

1275
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:21,280
than for-profit companies so people

1276
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:23,040
won't get as freaked out about it. Yeah.

1277
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:24,720
Good. So, do you want like Pearson to

1278
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:27,040
have all of this data or do you want,

1279
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:28,880
you know, InBloom um, you know, funded

1280
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:30,559
by a consortium of state departments of

1281
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:32,240
I mean, it was funded by the Gates

1282
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:33,680
Foundation, but like sponsored by a set

1283
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:37,480
of state departments of education to

1284
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:37,480
have this data. What else?

1285
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:44,640
I had a question like how it functions.

1286
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:46,800
So like if they have the data and then

1287
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:49,280
um like a company or some kind of

1288
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:51,599
researcher is trying to access it, do

1289
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:53,359
they have final say on like how it's

1290
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:56,800
being used or do they then go back to

1291
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:58,079
the schools? So as so the go so in bloom

1292
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,040
failed and we can talk about why it

1293
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:00,880
failed so you don't have to worry about

1294
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:02,480
it existing although I'll show you a new

1295
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:05,520
thing that showed up this past week

1296
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:07,760
which is remarkably similar. Um but I

1297
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:09,440
think some of the key value some of the

1298
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:13,040
key value proposition was that the

1299
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:14,880
companies would go to Inloom um and get

1300
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:16,400
just the data they need. What do you

1301
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:21,720
think InBloom would potentially be

1302
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:21,720
better at than schools might be

1303
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:27,680
raw data processing? Good. So, first of

1304
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:30,559
all, they're just like if if if your if

1305
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:32,880
your job is not to like, you know, teach

1306
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:34,480
kindergarten and Mandarin, but like just

1307
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,839
to process student data, you're probably

1308
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:37,920
going to be better at processing student

1309
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:39,760
data than this organization that has to

1310
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:41,280
like have a field hockey team and run

1311
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:43,680
buses and other kinds of things like

1312
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:45,280
that.

1313
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:47,760
Security is better, too, if that's your

1314
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:50,000
main focus. Why would there are 13,000

1315
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:52,400
school districts in the United States of

1316
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,920
widely varying capacities in all kinds

1317
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,599
of IT things? It seems like an

1318
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:57,760
organization that is like just focused

1319
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:59,839
on IT things is going to be like we

1320
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:01,359
don't even like in a lot of ways if you

1321
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:02,880
have a society where a school has to be

1322
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:05,280
good at IT things you may not be

1323
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:06,800
organizing that society correctly. Um

1324
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,480
and so you can you know if you go to

1325
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:12,040
other countries you know during the

1326
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:15,440
pandemic like we had um schools

1327
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:17,680
provision laptops and hotspots to to

1328
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,960
students. Insane. There's no reason to

1329
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:20,559
think schools should be any good at

1330
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:22,559
that. um like there should be other

1331
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:24,559
institutions in society that are good at

1332
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:26,160
IT procurement like it it shouldn't be

1333
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:27,920
your local I mean I sometimes I would

1334
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:30,160
compare it to people like you know in

1335
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:31,599
the 19th century when we decided that

1336
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:33,359
every household in the United States

1337
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:34,800
should get or in the 20th century we

1338
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:36,559
decided every household in the United

1339
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:38,160
States should get electricity we like

1340
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:39,440
didn't go to the local school principal

1341
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,760
and be like so how are you going to run

1342
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:43,680
wires up the holler um you know we

1343
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:45,200
invented the TVA and other kinds of

1344
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:47,280
organizations that was really good at

1345
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:48,079
electrification um so that the schools

1346
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:50,640
didn't have to be good at

1347
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:53,440
electrification like electrification is

1348
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:56,319
is closer to you know provisioning

1349
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:57,680
broadband and laptops um than it is to

1350
00:50:56,319 --> 00:51:00,000
other kinds of educational things. All

1351
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:01,839
right. So these institutions um could

1352
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,640
conceivably develop a whole bunch of

1353
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:06,800
expertise around data around privacy

1354
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:08,160
things like that. Um another thing that

1355
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:12,160
they could probably get pretty good at

1356
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:14,559
doing is only giving providers the exact

1357
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:16,319
data they need. Um, so schools have a

1358
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:17,680
tough time vetting like all of the data

1359
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:18,880
that they're making available to all

1360
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,319
their different providers. And so

1361
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,680
presumably, you know, they make

1362
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:23,359
arrangements and people just collect

1363
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:25,680
whatever. If there's a sort of

1364
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:27,280
intermediary in that collection process,

1365
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:28,800
you could imagine that InBloom could be

1366
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:30,640
pretty good at being like, "Yeah,

1367
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:32,000
Canvas, you just asked us for these 14

1368
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:34,240
things, but I'm pretty sure to operate

1369
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,520
your system, you need these six." Um, so

1370
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:37,599
why don't you start with these six and

1371
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,880
see how you do from there. um and they

1372
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:40,720
might be able to do all kinds of other

1373
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:44,000
you know right now for Canvas to operate

1374
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:45,440
it needs to have um you know your actual

1375
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,800
email address and other kinds of things

1376
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:48,640
like that. You can imagine building all

1377
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:50,559
kinds of intermediary layers that that

1378
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:52,559
only hashed identifiers are passing on

1379
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:54,520
to these third parties and in Bloom

1380
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:59,200
collects all this.

1381
00:51:54,520 --> 00:52:01,680
Um in Bloom fails um oh almost

1382
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,720
immediately. Um well here's a here's a

1383
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:04,119
few things that were written about it

1384
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:06,720
when it started.

1385
00:52:04,119 --> 00:52:08,079
Um, nonprofit InBloom offers an internet

1386
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:09,440
database service that allows schools to

1387
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:10,640
store, track, and analyze data on school

1388
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,680
chunking. If you think about it, that

1389
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:13,520
information is more than just test

1390
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:14,800
scores. It's whether kids receive free

1391
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:16,000
lunch, a telling indicator of the

1392
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,280
family's finance. The time the school

1393
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,119
got no fight in the schoolyard. It could

1394
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:20,640
be a child's prescription medicine. Um,

1395
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:21,839
the upshot of storing all that data in

1396
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:23,520
one location is it could be used to

1397
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:25,200
tailor curricula to each child. If

1398
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:28,079
Johnny's data suggests he's a tactile

1399
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:30,319
learner, which is not true, there are no

1400
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:32,000
learning styles. Um, and he's failing

1401
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:33,680
math, Inloom's analytic action might

1402
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,119
suggest a particular teaching approach.

1403
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:36,640
Um, this is all about building

1404
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:39,359
personalized learning environments for

1405
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:40,800
kids. Um, but as more school districts

1406
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:42,319
team up with Inloom, including New York,

1407
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,599
parents are becoming increasingly vocal

1408
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:45,440
critics of the data collection. This

1409
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:47,040
information, I have no idea what it is.

1410
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:50,480
I have no idea who's using it, and I

1411
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:52,400
have no idea for what purpose. Um

1412
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:56,000
uh so part of what the existence of

1413
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:57,520
InBloom did was to like was to go to

1414
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,599
communities and be like, "Hey, you know

1415
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:01,839
what's happening right now? There's tons

1416
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:04,280
of data being collected about children."

1417
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:06,960
Um and we're going to put it all in one

1418
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:08,000
place. You can imagine that, you know,

1419
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,359
like for people like me, they're like,

1420
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,319
"Yeah, that's a great idea. We're

1421
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:12,240
totally going to be able to have all

1422
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:13,760
these benefits." But like there's tons

1423
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:15,040
of data being collected about children

1424
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:17,119
and it's all going to be put in one

1425
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:20,000
place. is like not actually as it turns

1426
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:21,680
out a very popular public pitch. Um in

1427
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,079
Bloom CEO is quick to point out that the

1428
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:25,520
company isn't collecting data the this

1429
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:27,200
isn't collecting data the school

1430
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:28,720
districts don't already have. It's just

1431
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:30,800
providing a one-stop dot to make the

1432
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:32,160
data accessible and usable to teachers.

1433
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:33,680
Although really a lot of what it was

1434
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:35,520
doing was making the data accessible and

1435
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:37,520
usable to third parties which might then

1436
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,960
benefit teachers. Schools and districts

1437
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:40,640
collect a lot of data but it's all over

1438
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:42,559
the place. Strainberger says it's it's

1439
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:45,599
different systems are disconnected and

1440
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:48,000
so as a result this data is not usable.

1441
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:49,680
Can anybody think of of uh all right so

1442
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,520
that that was a very serious problem

1443
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:52,960
like schools are collecting tons of data

1444
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:54,800
it's fragmented across all these

1445
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:56,720
services all these kinds of things and

1446
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:59,359
so you know a sense there's like

1447
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:03,359
constant ongoing privacy like either

1448
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:05,760
privacy risk privacy violations and um

1449
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:07,200
not sensible ways to manage them. That's

1450
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:10,400
the problem in Bloom's trying to solve.

1451
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:12,079
Can anybody think of around 2013 like

1452
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:14,559
major things that are happening in the

1453
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:17,559
United States related to uh people's

1454
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:19,680
perception of their data and

1455
00:54:17,559 --> 00:54:23,680
security? You all are a little young for

1456
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:25,359
this now. Target target I think is not

1457
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:27,440
that far away from that. So we start

1458
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:30,160
seeing some of the like major data

1459
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:32,880
security breaches. Cambridge Analytica

1460
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:34,319
uh I think um I think Cambridge

1461
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:36,079
Analytica is a little bit afterwards

1462
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:38,240
because that is around the 2016

1463
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:41,680
election. Yeah. Snowden. Um, this is the

1464
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:44,160
sort of Edward the Edward Snowden era of

1465
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:45,440
uh of of rec recognizing the federal

1466
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:47,200
government is collecting much more data

1467
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:50,160
about people um than was previously

1468
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:52,319
thought. So, so in 2013, first of all,

1469
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:53,839
people are far less accustomed to

1470
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:55,599
surveillance than you all described

1471
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:57,440
yourself as accustomed to surveillance.

1472
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:59,520
Um, and there just been this major

1473
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:01,200
national revelation. Sort of an

1474
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:03,440
interesting thing about the inloom story

1475
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:05,119
is so eventually what happens is there

1476
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:07,200
were sort of 11 states that signed on

1477
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:09,200
initially and the hope was is that like

1478
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:10,480
then 13 and 14 and 18 and 20 that

1479
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:12,319
eventually lots and lots of states would

1480
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:14,640
come on almost immediately states

1481
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:17,920
started withdrawing from it. um in

1482
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:21,520
particular over uh in part because of

1483
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:24,480
the concentrated objection from local

1484
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:27,280
advocates uh lo local advocacy groups

1485
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:28,800
including um like student privacy groups

1486
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:30,559
that were just formed around this time.

1487
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:32,079
New York was like one of the lead ones.

1488
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:33,839
It was one of the last ones to fall out

1489
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:36,640
but it also had one of the most sort of

1490
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:39,119
viciferous determined um community of

1491
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:42,480
student privacy advocates um opting you

1492
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:45,200
know. So um state started p like one of

1493
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:47,040
the one of the main um outcomes of

1494
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:48,640
inloom was not its existence actually

1495
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:50,160
but like a bunch of state laws about

1496
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:51,920
student privacy in part that would make

1497
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:55,440
it more difficult for things like inloom

1498
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:58,720
to exist. um a a a common problem that

1499
00:55:55,440 --> 00:56:00,400
shows up when trying to fix data and

1500
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:02,240
privacy problems and I'm giving you an

1501
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:05,440
example from schools but this is a thing

1502
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:08,079
that you could find in almost any um uh

1503
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:10,799
in any other sector like the the

1504
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:13,520
pre-inloom counterfactual is really

1505
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:15,280
really bad. It is not a good system to

1506
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:16,880
like force kids to go to public schools

1507
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:19,119
and then have a bunch of thirdparty

1508
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:20,720
for-profit companies get their data from

1509
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:22,319
schools. The schools are bad at

1510
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:23,799
managing. they don't have the expertise,

1511
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:28,720
all these kinds of things.

1512
00:56:23,799 --> 00:56:31,119
Um however by trying to fix the problem

1513
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:33,119
in bloom draws attention to the problem

1514
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:34,240
you know like man this data is such a

1515
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:35,760
mess and we're going to collect it all

1516
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:37,839
like in some like there are all kinds of

1517
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:40,720
circumstances in which you like if you

1518
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:43,839
draw attention to data and experiments

1519
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:46,319
even if the sort of like the the status

1520
00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:47,920
quo is really terrible people are not

1521
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:49,520
going to be enthusiastic about the fix

1522
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:51,040
because nobody thinks dayto-day about

1523
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:53,359
the status quo but they think really

1524
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:55,280
intensely about this crazy inloom thing

1525
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:57,200
that you're doing. Um, does that does

1526
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:58,559
that as an idea make sense? Like this

1527
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:00,559
essentially, you know, there's all kind

1528
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:03,119
like other studies come out along the

1529
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:05,119
lines of um, hey, we've come up with

1530
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:06,960
this really good way to protect your

1531
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:09,839
privacy. Will you opt into it? People

1532
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:11,359
will be like, whoa. Um, why would why

1533
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:12,480
would I have to protect my privacy? Why

1534
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:13,760
would I opt into this thing? It's

1535
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:15,359
dangerous. Like, they would prefer the

1536
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:16,960
status quo where their privacy is not

1537
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:21,880
protected towards this thing in which

1538
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:21,880
you've raised their concerns about. Um

1539
00:57:22,599 --> 00:57:29,280
uh so this is an organization that just

1540
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:32,400
came into life um last week. Uh it's

1541
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:36,400
called Safe Insights. Um it was funded

1542
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:39,359
by $90 million from the National Science

1543
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:40,880
Foundation. Uh it is out of Rice

1544
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:42,480
University out of the same people that

1545
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:43,920
developed Open Stacks. We talked about

1546
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:47,040
Open Stacks the other day. They're the

1547
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:48,960
company that creates um uh free and open

1548
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:51,880
source textbooks for community college

1549
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:53,920
folks. Um they

1550
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:55,000
have we have enough time. I'll show you

1551
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:58,079
the one.

1552
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:01,200
Uh, let's see if we can find the the

1553
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:01,200
Safe Insights welcome

1554
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:16,240
video. As a longtime college instructor,

1555
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:18,559
every day of my career has been

1556
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:21,599
dedicated to helping my students reach

1557
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:24,079
their academic goals. I'm always looking

1558
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:26,720
to better support their learning in ways

1559
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:28,559
that are proven to work best. There's so

1560
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:30,880
much we have to understand about how

1561
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:33,280
people learn. Every mind is beautiful

1562
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:35,760
and special. That means we all learn in

1563
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:38,400
different ways. We all have our own

1564
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:40,720
definitions of what success looks like.

1565
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:42,799
If researchers are able to uncover new

1566
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:45,280
and better ways of learning, that will

1567
00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:48,319
have a profound impact on how educators

1568
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:50,480
approach teaching. To do this, we need a

1569
00:58:48,319 --> 00:58:52,799
way to securely connect with a wide

1570
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:54,440
variety of students as they study over

1571
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:57,280
time in real

1572
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:59,680
classrooms. Student needs are changing.

1573
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:02,319
With more learning happening online, it

1574
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:04,880
gets harder and harder to understand

1575
00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:07,520
what each student needs and how best to

1576
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:09,520
help them at the moment when they're

1577
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:11,359
really needed the most. Education

1578
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:12,960
research is essential for advancing

1579
00:59:11,359 --> 00:59:15,359
teaching and learning so that every

1580
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:17,440
student can succeed. We know that

1581
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:18,880
research informed teaching works, but

1582
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:21,040
it's still too hard to conduct

1583
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:23,520
large-scale reliable research and then

1584
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:25,040
apply the results in the classroom. Safe

1585
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:27,359
Insights brings together learning

1586
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:29,839
researchers, educators, schools, and

1587
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:32,079
colleges in a secure environment to get

1588
00:59:29,839 --> 00:59:34,240
the answers we need while strongly

1589
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:36,400
protecting students and their interests.

1590
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:39,599
Every student deserves the chance to

1591
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:41,599
succeed in the classroom and beyond.

1592
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:43,440
Safe Insights will give researchers,

1593
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:45,280
educators, and students what they need

1594
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:47,680
to take learning to the next level. And

1595
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:50,559
as educators, we will benefit from

1596
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:53,230
better research from Safe Insights to

1597
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:58,679
effectively help all our students.

1598
00:59:53,230 --> 00:59:58,679
[Music]

1599
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:05,440
Great.

1600
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:07,319
It it is it is a little dramatic for for

1601
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:10,079
like a

1602
01:00:07,319 --> 01:00:12,079
database but I I mean I don't know I

1603
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:14,720
like database. Okay. Um what are what

1604
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:17,599
are what are your first instincts having

1605
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:19,359
spent a whole bunch of time um uh having

1606
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:21,119
spent you know an hour and 20 minutes

1607
01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:22,480
talking about the toxic power of data

1608
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:24,400
and experiments and how do you think

1609
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:25,760
like a typical American parent or

1610
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:27,839
typical American college student would

1611
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:30,160
react to that video?

1612
01:00:27,839 --> 01:00:31,839
I think it would change like based on

1613
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:34,319
different generations because I think

1614
01:00:31,839 --> 01:00:36,079
our generation who is now like using Tik

1615
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:38,079
Tok when we openly know like they use

1616
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:40,240
our data and like listen to us is

1617
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:42,240
completely different from like our

1618
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:43,920
parents who are like oh my god like

1619
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:46,480
don't have a profile picture don't this

1620
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:48,960
and that. So I think our generation will

1621
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:51,440
be way more accepting of this and I

1622
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:53,359
think as like in like 10 20 years down

1623
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:55,119
the line I think people and parents will

1624
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:58,160
be so accustomed to their children's

1625
01:00:55,119 --> 01:01:00,960
data just being like whatever good. So

1626
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:02,480
you know so conceivably even you know in

1627
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:03,920
bloom launched today might have had a

1628
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:06,319
very different experience than in Bloom

1629
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:08,240
launched in 2013 not because of anything

1630
01:01:06,319 --> 01:01:10,000
different that they did but because of

1631
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:11,119
the context that they operate in. I

1632
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,880
think there's evidence of that. I was

1633
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:15,280
just talking to somebody who runs a a

1634
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:18,079
video repository for uh child

1635
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:21,040
development studies. Um and one of their

1636
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:22,079
conditions is that uh the the videos can

1637
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:23,359
only be used for non-commercial

1638
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:24,799
purposes. And I was like, how you know

1639
01:01:23,359 --> 01:01:26,240
why did you do that? And we're like,

1640
01:01:24,799 --> 01:01:27,440
well, we made it 10 years ago and people

1641
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:28,799
were really worried about stuff and that

1642
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:30,400
sort of helped calm them down. But if we

1643
01:01:28,799 --> 01:01:32,160
did it again today, I you know, I don't

1644
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:34,240
think the same level of concern exists,

1645
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:36,880
not only among people generally, but

1646
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:38,960
like institutionally as well. What do

1647
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:40,079
you say, Courtney? Um I think it was

1648
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:42,319
really smart that they've attached

1649
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:43,839
themselves to Rice because I think

1650
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:45,680
especially like our parents generation

1651
01:01:43,839 --> 01:01:47,839
maybe less so now there's a lot of

1652
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:49,520
goodwill given to universities and so

1653
01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:52,000
like if in Bloom came out today and it

1654
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:53,280
was like oh in partnership with MIT I do

1655
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,799
think people would have received it a

1656
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:56,640
lot differently and like people have a

1657
01:01:54,799 --> 01:01:58,319
lot of trust that like oh it's connected

1658
01:01:56,640 --> 01:02:00,000
to Rice how bad could it really be?

1659
01:01:58,319 --> 01:02:02,880
Yeah. And you know I would say I would

1660
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,480
say the the Gates Foundation related

1661
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:07,440
conspiracy theories were not quite as

1662
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:09,440
strong in 2013. Um but like the Gates

1663
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:11,200
Foundation is not a trusted organization

1664
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:13,359
in the same way that I think uh yeah

1665
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:15,680
Rice University universities in general

1666
01:02:13,359 --> 01:02:17,040
like state schools um are still some of

1667
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:18,640
the most trusted institutions in

1668
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:21,520
society.

1669
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:23,760
Um I think like maybe actually a little

1670
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:26,720
um connected to that trustworthiness I

1671
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:28,480
think is that um if you say like oh my

1672
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:32,240
god look all your data is in one place

1673
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:33,920
like to someone who finds like education

1674
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:37,920
research and things like that really

1675
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:41,200
important and is like much more aware of

1676
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:43,599
um like how that might help that might

1677
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:45,760
sound good but I think to the average

1678
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:48,480
person first and foremost what's going

1679
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:50,480
to pop out when you tell tell them, "Oh,

1680
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:53,119
we have everything in one place and we

1681
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:54,640
promise it's safe." It's like one, like

1682
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:56,720
you're not giving me any information

1683
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:59,280
about how you're keeping the data safe.

1684
01:02:56,720 --> 01:03:01,920
And two, like I think like it's always

1685
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:05,680
been like set up like don't put all your

1686
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:07,760
data in one place. So it's like well how

1687
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:10,400
why are you like saying this is a good

1688
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:13,040
thing because then this means that like

1689
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:15,359
someone can have all my data as opposed

1690
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:19,200
to like let's say if it is split up even

1691
01:03:15,359 --> 01:03:21,440
if it's there I can be like okay like my

1692
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:22,799
teacher might have this piece of data on

1693
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:24,480
me but they might not have this other

1694
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:26,400
piece of data and actually probably the

1695
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:27,440
main technical I mean there'll probably

1696
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,799
a bunch and we don't know exactly where

1697
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:30,240
they'll be then but one of the one of

1698
01:03:28,799 --> 01:03:32,160
the earliest proposed technical

1699
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:34,559
innovations of safe insights is not to

1700
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:36,400
bring all the data together. Um so it so

1701
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:37,760
it doesn't propose that all of it gets

1702
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:40,240
collected. One of the main things that

1703
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:43,119
they want to be able to do um is to be

1704
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:44,880
able to conduct research queries across

1705
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:47,359
data without having people have to

1706
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:49,039
directly access those data. So there's a

1707
01:03:47,359 --> 01:03:50,799
there's a whole field of study called

1708
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:53,280
things like differential privacy and

1709
01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:55,440
stuff like that which basically says um

1710
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:57,119
how do I how do I tell you the kinds of

1711
01:03:55,440 --> 01:04:00,720
things that are in a data set let you

1712
01:03:57,119 --> 01:04:02,720
run a query over that data set um but

1713
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:04,319
never actually encounter that data set

1714
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:06,640
and and in this kind of environment

1715
01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:09,359
there might be how would you run a query

1716
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:11,760
that connects people's you know student

1717
01:04:09,359 --> 01:04:14,160
behavior in a learning platform with

1718
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:16,640
their registar information with their

1719
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:18,799
state test scores without having to like

1720
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:20,960
make one giant data set out of all those

1721
01:04:18,799 --> 01:04:23,200
things, but instead to like, you know,

1722
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:25,520
have the query just, you know, run over

1723
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:27,039
the data it needs, you know, still like

1724
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:28,720
have the main the people who own that

1725
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:31,119
data still hold on to that data, but

1726
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:33,440
have the results of that query go to

1727
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:34,720
technology developers, um, researchers,

1728
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:36,400
things like that without having to have

1729
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:38,880
them collect all of the data. So in some

1730
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:40,400
ways it's like explicitly trying to be

1731
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:42,400
the opposite of inloom like don't bring

1732
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:44,640
all the data in one place like try to

1733
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:46,880
get the benefits of aggregated data

1734
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:48,240
without having to share it with either a

1735
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:51,520
trusted third party or everyone or

1736
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:52,960
something like that.

1737
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:54,799
I was I was just going to say I feel

1738
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:56,720
like you kind of answered it like right

1739
01:04:54,799 --> 01:04:59,039
there with what you were saying, but

1740
01:04:56,720 --> 01:05:03,039
like in your opinion, do you think like

1741
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:05,039
the people who are creating this new um

1742
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:06,799
the safe insights? Do you think they

1743
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:09,000
like really understood what went wrong

1744
01:05:06,799 --> 01:05:11,280
in Inloom? And do you think like

1745
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:14,480
ultimately does it lead back? Boy, it

1746
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:17,920
sure I mean it sure sounds like it to

1747
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:20,799
me. Like powerful privacy preserving

1748
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:23,760
learning research. Um, so like the very

1749
01:05:20,799 --> 01:05:26,680
first concept they they want to ingrain

1750
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:28,799
in your head is safe. Um, the second

1751
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:31,520
concept that I think they're doing

1752
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:34,400
rhetorically is leaning into insight

1753
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:36,880
rather than data. Um, so I think if you

1754
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:38,720
asked people what Inbloom was, they

1755
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:43,119
would have described it as some kind of

1756
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:45,119
data repository. My hunch um is that the

1757
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:47,440
safe insights people are going to

1758
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:50,160
describe themselves as an insight

1759
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:52,000
generator. um as a research producer.

1760
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:53,920
Now, it's the exact same thing, right?

1761
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,760
Um because in order to get the insights,

1762
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:58,160
you have to have the data somewhere. And

1763
01:05:55,760 --> 01:06:00,480
InBloom, InBloom's purpose was never

1764
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:03,039
just to like hoard data. It was to make

1765
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:06,280
learning better for kids. Um but I think

1766
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:09,440
I think there are I like I guarantee you

1767
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:12,319
that all of the pe many of the people

1768
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:14,079
who worked on safe insights um have done

1769
01:06:12,319 --> 01:06:16,960
plenty of studying of what went wrong

1770
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:19,440
with in bloom um and are designing this

1771
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:21,200
enterprise you know so that it's you

1772
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:22,400
know it's with a trusted university it's

1773
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:24,319
founded by the national science

1774
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:28,079
foundation which I assume also has very

1775
01:06:24,319 --> 01:06:30,799
high trust but like all this language it

1776
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:32,319
it definitely strikes me as like like

1777
01:06:30,799 --> 01:06:35,760
people who read up on the inb bloom case

1778
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:39,200
study and are trying a different tack.

1779
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:41,039
I think uh another good thing that they

1780
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:42,799
did was associate themselves with a

1781
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:45,280
previous product that was successful

1782
01:06:42,799 --> 01:06:48,559
which was open stacks which in itself

1783
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:51,760
open stacks I mean they are open what is

1784
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:53,920
it open source uh like preuse uh

1785
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:55,839
textbooks and that in itself has proven

1786
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:57,680
to be like okay we are transparent quite

1787
01:06:55,839 --> 01:06:59,280
literally transparent about what we're

1788
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:02,640
doing and we've already provided a

1789
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:04,599
useful successful product for the masses

1790
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:08,640
and there

1791
01:07:04,599 --> 01:07:10,960
Um they have a ton you know they have uh

1792
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:12,799
40 partners 39 collaborating

1793
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:15,520
institutions of their collaborating

1794
01:07:12,799 --> 01:07:17,440
institutions 77% are minority serving

1795
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:18,960
institutions so they're trying to start

1796
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:20,319
from the beginning saying you know we're

1797
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:22,000
not just going to do this to improve

1798
01:07:20,319 --> 01:07:23,599
Colombia and Rice we're going to do this

1799
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,640
to improve you know lots of different

1800
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:29,359
kinds of organizations

1801
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:32,000
um it it also you know instead of being

1802
01:07:29,359 --> 01:07:35,839
a consortium of states

1803
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:38,559
um it's really mostly a consortium of

1804
01:07:35,839 --> 01:07:42,359
digital learning platforms. Um probably

1805
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:46,000
matters to like they're

1806
01:07:42,359 --> 01:07:47,440
emphasis on college. Um I'm like

1807
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,640
assistance doesn't do anything for

1808
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:50,559
college. So they definitely have some

1809
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:53,200
things that are not I'm not sure it's

1810
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:56,160
literally true, but Assistments 99% of

1811
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:57,920
what they do is serve K12 students. Um,

1812
01:07:56,160 --> 01:08:01,039
but I think it maybe does make a

1813
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:02,799
difference to, you know, in like like

1814
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:04,559
college students are adults. College

1815
01:08:02,799 --> 01:08:05,839
students opt in to go to college. The

1816
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:07,599
state doesn't force anyone to go to

1817
01:08:05,839 --> 01:08:10,640
college. And so you're just operating in

1818
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:12,319
a um in you maybe a luury choice, but

1819
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:13,599
there you're operating in a in a space

1820
01:08:12,319 --> 01:08:17,199
where you feel like people have more

1821
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:21,040
agency to begin with to operate. Um they

1822
01:08:17,199 --> 01:08:22,880
they you know unlike unlike Inloom which

1823
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:24,560
said these 11 states are the

1824
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:25,920
organization like these state education

1825
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:28,239
agencies are sort of the key people

1826
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:30,159
we're interacting with um they don't

1827
01:08:28,239 --> 01:08:31,759
mention higher education accredititors

1828
01:08:30,159 --> 01:08:33,120
or state boards of higher education or

1829
01:08:31,759 --> 01:08:34,480
they basically have like left government

1830
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:37,279
out except for the National Science

1831
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:39,600
Foundation um of this development. Maybe

1832
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:41,199
people are more trustworthy of of these

1833
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:42,560
organizations or maybe they're just like

1834
01:08:41,199 --> 01:08:45,159
even if they're not more trustworthy of

1835
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:47,520
these organizations, people are kind of

1836
01:08:45,159 --> 01:08:50,400
drawn, critics are potentially drawn to

1837
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:52,239
things like New York State approves X,

1838
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:55,199
you know, versus this kind of like

1839
01:08:52,239 --> 01:08:57,799
arbitrary group of universities, some of

1840
01:08:55,199 --> 01:09:00,080
whom might be in New York, approve X.

1841
01:08:57,799 --> 01:09:02,719
Um, so it'll be super interesting to

1842
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:05,920
watch. This is a um the grant that they

1843
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:08,880
got was from the same that $90 million

1844
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:11,199
is probably the largest federal grant uh

1845
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:12,719
um an educational research project ever.

1846
01:09:11,199 --> 01:09:14,319
Although there's a couple of educational

1847
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:15,799
research projects that if you totaled up

1848
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:18,799
all the grants they got over a period of

1849
01:09:15,799 --> 01:09:21,679
time might be sort of at least within

1850
01:09:18,799 --> 01:09:24,560
that ballpark. Um it came from the same

1851
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:27,120
grant funding that supports like

1852
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:28,799
telescopes and ecological plots. um it's

1853
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:31,359
called midscale uh research

1854
01:09:28,799 --> 01:09:33,359
infrastructure things that are like um

1855
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:35,600
where you know no one university can

1856
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:37,279
build like a giant radio telescope and

1857
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:38,319
and you don't want one university to you

1858
01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:39,920
want to build a thing that like the

1859
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:42,480
entire field of astronomy can all

1860
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:44,880
collectively use together um and so this

1861
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:46,719
grant stream is meant to build enormous

1862
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:48,000
things that everyone can can use

1863
01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:50,640
together so it'll be sort of interesting

1864
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:55,040
to see what they do um in the in the

1865
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:56,880
decades ahead but um I think a I mean

1866
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:58,480
you know in some ways especially coming

1867
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:01,400
about 10 years after the collapse of

1868
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:03,600
Inloom. Um, uh, it's to me it's sort of

1869
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:06,400
neat. You know, people still have

1870
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:08,480
optimism that if you pull together a

1871
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:09,920
bunch of student learning data, um, and

1872
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:11,040
data about students and you conduct a

1873
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:13,360
bunch of experiments, you can build

1874
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:16,080
things that help them learn better. Um,

1875
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:18,239
but there are, you know, there are re

1876
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:20,719
there are enormous real risks and there

1877
01:10:18,239 --> 01:10:22,800
may be even more enormous um, kind of

1878
01:10:20,719 --> 01:10:25,120
reputational risks that go into this

1879
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:27,199
work. Um, one thing that I've tried to

1880
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:29,679
communicate, which it sounds like these

1881
01:10:27,199 --> 01:10:31,920
folks are, you know, are adopting to

1882
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:33,120
many different groups is like, you know,

1883
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:34,719
because I'm basically part of the

1884
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:36,159
community of people that would like to

1885
01:10:34,719 --> 01:10:37,840
collect lots of data about students than

1886
01:10:36,159 --> 01:10:39,760
I've done, you know, re, you know, I've

1887
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:41,199
I've I've handled data files that have

1888
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:42,960
like way more information about people

1889
01:10:41,199 --> 01:10:45,280
than I feel comfortable having access

1890
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:46,800
to. Um, and part of the job is doing

1891
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:48,960
things responsibly, but the other part

1892
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:51,120
of the job is like constantly talking to

1893
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:52,800
the public about what we're doing. Um,

1894
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:55,760
you know, the only way people will not

1895
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:58,159
be creeped out by doing experiments, um,

1896
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:59,840
is if a we conduct a bunch of

1897
01:10:58,159 --> 01:11:01,840
experiments that meaningfully improve

1898
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:05,120
learning. Um, a hu a huge challenge that

1899
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:06,880
education has, um, is like we don't have

1900
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:08,239
the equivalent of the human genome

1901
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:10,560
project. We don't have a thing that you

1902
01:11:08,239 --> 01:11:11,920
could point to being like, well, yeah,

1903
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:14,080
we took a whole lot of your data, but

1904
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:16,159
like we're curing cancer here, people.

1905
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:18,159
Um, you know, I mean, if if Safe

1906
01:11:16,159 --> 01:11:21,360
Insights came up with something that

1907
01:11:18,159 --> 01:11:23,040
made students learn math 33% faster, it

1908
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:24,800
would totally change the way people

1909
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:27,360
think about the collection of D. So,

1910
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:29,760
your costbenefit data would transform um

1911
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:31,199
uh quite dramatically. Um, but even in

1912
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:32,800
the absence of that, like it's

1913
01:11:31,199 --> 01:11:34,480
incredibly important to be engaged with

1914
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:35,920
these student privacy groups, engaged

1915
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:37,920
with families, trying to explain to

1916
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:40,560
people like there's always going to be

1917
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:42,800
variation in education. Um, what we

1918
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:44,960
probably could benefit the most from is

1919
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:46,640
systematic variation where we can tell

1920
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:48,560
which parts of the variation work and

1921
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:50,239
which parts don't. And the only way that

1922
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:51,520
we can do that is through some of these

1923
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:53,360
approaches that include data collection

1924
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:55,120
and randomization and things like that.

1925
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:58,239
So you just like made the statement that

1926
01:11:55,120 --> 01:12:01,440
like safe insights comes up with like

1927
01:11:58,239 --> 01:12:04,080
some solution. So is safe insights kind

1928
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:07,040
of like that is it like a third party

1929
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:10,080
that is it is less of a third party than

1930
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:12,400
in bloom. Yes. you know, like clearly

1931
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:14,880
some of the things that that Rice is

1932
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:17,280
going to do with his money is build

1933
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:19,440
systems and study open stacks with it.

1934
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:23,440
Um, like part like much more so than

1935
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:25,199
Inloom. Um, in in Bloom didn't have a In

1936
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:28,320
Bloom never, to my knowledge, never had

1937
01:12:25,199 --> 01:12:30,960
a list of partners that looked like this

1938
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:33,920
list. Um, they never said from the

1939
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:35,840
beginning, oh look, like Cahoot and

1940
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:38,960
Google Classroom and the all these other

1941
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:40,480
people are our lead partners. um and are

1942
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:43,120
going to use this to figure out stuff.

1943
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:46,480
They they like really saw themselves

1944
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:49,199
solving an infrastructural problem um

1945
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:51,000
more that you know like I I think these

1946
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:53,840
folks are positioning themselves more

1947
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:58,080
like first we're going to have a set of

1948
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:59,880
tech products that improve learning um

1949
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:02,080
through better research practices

1950
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:03,440
including better forms of data

1951
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:06,159
management and data sharing and data

1952
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:07,920
privacy. Um, but if it like if it's a

1953
01:13:06,159 --> 01:13:09,840
real infrastructure product, like part

1954
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:13,840
of what you know, I'm I'm sure Rich's

1955
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:15,760
goal um is to say we're going to develop

1956
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:17,920
these research these privacy protecting

1957
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:20,159
research enclaves and we're going to

1958
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:22,320
develop them in an open source way that

1959
01:13:20,159 --> 01:13:23,600
like whatever future edtech companies

1960
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:25,199
come along are going to be able to

1961
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:26,320
benefit from this infrastructure. Like

1962
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:27,920
they're going to be able to do all the

1963
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:30,320
same kinds of things that OpenStacks is

1964
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:31,600
doing to conduct cool experimental

1965
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:34,560
research with lots of data while

1966
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:37,199
protecting people's privacy. Um,

1967
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:40,719
Great. It's 2:25. Um, so I should let

1968
01:13:37,199 --> 01:13:42,080
you go. We'll come in on Wednesday. Um,

1969
01:13:40,719 --> 01:13:44,159
and we'll you have a little bit of

1970
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:46,480
reading about implementation in schools.

1971
01:13:44,159 --> 01:13:49,360
Um, but mostly uh what you should be

1972
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:52,800
working on is um getting some words on

1973
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:54,560
paper for your final product um project

1974
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:56,719
and thinking a little bit. Oh, a thing

1975
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:57,920
that we'll do probably by email this
