1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:07,480
thank you thank you for invitation uh so

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:09,240
we are at truly s MIT spin-off so like I

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:11,040
have been at a mighty energy Initiative

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,559
for the past eight years and this is

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,760
where actually started as a research

6
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:19,480
project and my co-founders are also MIT

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:22,199
graduates and we are also uh down the

8
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:24,680
street so we are very close very part of

9
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:26,640
the ecosystem so as I read mention so

10
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,880
this is an industrial decarbonization

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,519
platform software platform and we are

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,640
very excited to be

13
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:35,800
here with you uh so let's start about

14
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:38,040
what's the problem so project planning

15
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:41,079
whether it's new asset deployment or

16
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:43,879
change of asset technology so on and so

17
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:46,879
forth is a hard topic it takes time you

18
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:49,399
need different groups of people you need

19
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,920
stakeholders uh make scenario analysis

20
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:54,239
so and so forth and when this is in the

21
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,840
context of decarbonization it it is

22
00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:00,199
harder and why because of uncertainty we

23
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,320
have new technology so the uh like the

24
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:04,640
previous five talks presented new

25
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,600
technologies right so like which one to

26
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,400
believe which one to use in your

27
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,040
processes so and so forth and you really

28
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,479
need to do a lot of analysis to really

29
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,280
reflect on the uh benefits and

30
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:17,479
disadvantages of each one of these in

31
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,799
your assets to be able to make inform

32
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:21,840
and better decisions and this is

33
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,479
basically where Sesame plays a huge role

34
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,680
so we created a software platform where

35
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,799
you can really streamline assessing

36
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:31,000
different technology options supply

37
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,840
chain options for your decarbonization

38
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,920
Journey including renewable integration

39
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,880
use of different Technologies so on so

40
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:43,399
forth how do we do it so we created a

41
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:46,159
platform that brings together all your

42
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:49,040
uh decarbonization related uh modeling

43
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,840
needs into one single platform and at

44
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,399
the core of this we have first principle

45
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,600
models so we modeled many different

46
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:58,960
processes many different technology

47
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,719
options uh using physics based models

48
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,719
and then on top of of that we layered

49
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,240
life cycle assessment and cost analysis

50
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:07,159
so that you can calculate scope one to3

51
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:10,360
emissions uh for all these

52
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:14,000
configurations as well as the cost per

53
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:16,080
dollars per produced uh product uh we

54
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,080
also layered optimization so like you

55
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,080
can optimize and simulate all these

56
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,000
Pathways uh and then for the US context

57
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:26,239
we also have policy layers so like you

58
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,200
can see the benefit of getting 45p other

59
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:32,599
tax credits so and so forth uh using the

60
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:35,000
platform how do you do that so there are

61
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:37,680
mainly two different kind of analysis

62
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,560
you can perform uh one is more like big

63
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,879
picture comparison and in this big

64
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:46,360
picture comparison there are three uh

65
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:49,599
main steps one is configure so by using

66
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:51,360
our modular way it is I call it almost

67
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,400
like Sim City for industrial

68
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,800
decarbonization you can build your

69
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,879
pathway uh using our user interface uh

70
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,080
and then you can fully customize all of

71
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:03,920
these and then the second uh and more

72
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,599
important piece is of course analysis

73
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,480
and in the analysis we have three kind

74
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:10,680
of main analysis one is uh emissions

75
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,080
life cycle assessments scope one to

76
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,360
three emissions levelized cost of the

77
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,920
product and full cash flow analysis we

78
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,760
also provide with the sensitivity

79
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,760
analysis on the key parameters that you

80
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:24,640
can see the uncertainty limits and third

81
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:27,360
is comparing these options with other uh

82
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,799
scenarios or other technology options so

83
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,159
this is mostly based on cost of avoided

84
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:34,680
carbon in the context of decarbonization

85
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:38,439
but comparison can be on any other topic

86
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:40,680
as well the second piece of analysis we

87
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:43,159
perform is detailed analysis and in this

88
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,799
case basically this is especially in the

89
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:48,439
context of renewable integration uh we

90
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:50,400
have Global coverage at zip code level

91
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:52,000
weather data and you can pick any

92
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,159
location in the world and you can

93
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,640
optimize your renewable project green

94
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:59,760
hydrogen project so on so forth on the

95
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,760
basis of cost uh and also like during

96
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,799
during the uh break please stop by I

97
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:07,920
will show you we can really do that uh

98
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:10,200
and uh so in this you will get the

99
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,760
configuration sizing of equipment so on

100
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:16,239
and so forth and also the full cash uh

101
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:18,359
flow analysis so so far uh like we have

102
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:21,600
been having a lot of good traction from

103
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:24,800
the uh both uh industrial customers as

104
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,880
well as the government agencies uh so

105
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,560
the ask for today is basically like if

106
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,240
you are an energy company utility

107
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:34,840
company like the data Center operator or

108
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:37,360
Company please stop by uh so you can

109
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,360
definitely uh join our early adapters

110
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,240
program but also there are uh

111
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,000
opportunities to work work with us uh

112
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:48,479
and make your life

113
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,639
easier uh so basically in the final 30

114
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:53,080
seconds so if you have a chance today

115
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:56,360
please stop by I'm happy to show you the

116
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:58,520
demo of our product uh on a topic that

117
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:01,680
you are interested in mostly in the

118
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:04,240
energy space if not this is my contact

119
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,520
please uh reach out to me and we can

120
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,759
book a time to do a demo a customized

121
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:13,120
demo with you and your team and we can

122
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:13,120
take it from there thank you very much
