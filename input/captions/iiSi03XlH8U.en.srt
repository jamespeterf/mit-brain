1
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,720
Um, okay. Everyone can hear me? Uh,

2
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,880
how's everyone doing?

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,720
>> Good. Great. Um, so my name is Chris

4
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,720
Rae. I'm the education program director

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,320
here at MIT's environmental solutions

6
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,240
initiative. Um, it's really important

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,679
for me to talk about that quickly that I

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,440
come at this from an educational lens

9
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,120
and a lot of my projects are about

10
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,719
trying to integrate climate justice or

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,280
environmental justice into educational

12
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,559
contexts both at MIT or in other uh

13
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,280
institutions of higher education and

14
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,440
even in K- through2. Um, so this is a

15
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,600
really high level discussion on how

16
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,840
geothermal energy networks or genens can

17
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,760
meet environmental justice priorities.

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,320
So, uh, just a quick overview. I'm going

19
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,000
to go over like an EJ framework define

20
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,920
environmental justice. I'll probably say

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,320
EJ a lot right now. Um, I'm going to

22
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,559
review EJ concerns with existing gas

23
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,040
networks, talk about how genens can meet

24
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,560
a EJ priorities, and then really briefly

25
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,479
talk about some next steps. How can we

26
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,280
better integrate EJ into this kind of

27
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:13,680
work? So, let's define environmental

28
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,200
justice really quickly. Uh, what is

29
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,560
environmental justice? I think it's

30
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,320
important to remember that environmental

31
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,960
justice is a movement that started in

32
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,560
the early 1980s. um as people of color

33
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,000
and other vulnerable groups like

34
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,520
indigenous people protested the

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,600
inequitable placement of environmental

36
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,360
harms in their community uh and this was

37
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,439
happening in the United States and all

38
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,280
around the world. Uh here you can see a

39
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,040
really famous protest in Warren County,

40
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,960
North Carolina where African-American

41
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,680
communities uh tried to block the

42
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,320
delivery of toxic PCB waste into their

43
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,920
landfills around them. Uh so that famous

44
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,320
protest is cited in a lot of uh

45
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,360
environmental justice studies and it led

46
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:52,240
to these two uh landmark reports that

47
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:55,439
used uh like GIS technology to show and

48
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,200
prove that yes environmental harms uh

49
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,000
were inequitably placed in communities

50
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,280
of color and low-income communities.

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,280
uh that led to the environmental

52
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,119
protection agency and a definition of

53
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,280
environmental justice like this is sort

54
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,280
of a basic definition that all people

55
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,200
have the right to a healthy and safe

56
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,120
environment regardless of their social

57
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,120
identity. Um there's been a lot of

58
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,319
theory new work on defining

59
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,480
environmental justice. So I would

60
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,520
recommend checking out uh David Pell who

61
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,440
has this term called critical

62
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,800
environmental justice or looking up

63
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,800
Kimberly Krenshaw's notion of

64
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,800
intersectionality if you want to go like

65
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,720
do a deeper dive on new definitions of

66
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:33,040
environmental justice. Um so those two

67
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,280
landmark reports helped uh form a field

68
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,200
of environmental justice and maybe some

69
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,040
of you are are familiar with things like

70
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,640
climate justice or maybe energy justice

71
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,280
which is most you know directly

72
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:46,319
connected to today and tomorrow's uh

73
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,840
class. Um so you can see you know you

74
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,239
know this movement has like splintered

75
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,160
into different areas and fields. um it

76
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,360
has expanded in in breadth and depth and

77
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,560
methodology and so like the

78
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,400
environmental justice work that was

79
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,440
being done in the mid1 1980s is totally

80
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,280
different from the work that's being

81
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:03,120
done now. Um I I like to point out that

82
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,640
uh environmental justice helped redefine

83
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,200
the environment. So I think if you look

84
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,200
at American environmentalism uh you know

85
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,080
the environment was pristine natural

86
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:15,360
wilderness and a lot of focus was on uh

87
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,959
nature preservation. Um but uh the

88
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,720
founder of environmental justice uh

89
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,640
Robert Bullard always talks about how

90
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,640
the environment is where we live, work

91
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,000
and play or study or worship and the

92
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,200
environment is all around us which I

93
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,760
think is so connected to the built

94
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,599
environment uh in these in this two-day

95
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,920
conference and also environmental

96
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,920
justice helps theorize or conceptualize

97
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,120
think about what is justice or what is

98
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,040
equity. So uh I kind of want to talk

99
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,360
about network geothermal through this

100
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,040
prism through sort of different forms of

101
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,640
justice. So I think a lot of people

102
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,239
think about social justice. They're

103
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,840
thinking usually about distributive

104
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,480
justice. How are we allocating

105
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,560
resources? Um but they often don't think

106
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,640
about participative justice, right? Who

107
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,319
has a seat at the table? Uh whose voices

108
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,920
are being listened to? Uh and I think

109
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,239
this is a critical component as we move

110
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,319
forward with, you know, uh addressing

111
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,840
the climate crisis. Or there's also

112
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,280
procedural justice, right? When you

113
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,720
start a project, you know, what are the

114
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,239
different checkpoints of the project to

115
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,159
sort of check in to see like are we

116
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:13,120
involving everybody? How are laws and

117
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,560
policies, you know, uh going forward?

118
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,799
There's recognition, right? Who's

119
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,799
getting recognition for this work? Uh,

120
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,000
you know, who's involved, etc. I think

121
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,400
recognition is very connected to

122
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,560
participative and procedural. Uh,

123
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,479
there's historic or restorative justice,

124
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,320
right? Acknowledging the problems of the

125
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,400
past and then when we're engaging in

126
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,800
projects, focusing in on groups who

127
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,479
haven't historically been included. Um,

128
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,160
and then there's epistemic justice,

129
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,880
which I like to just say knowledge

130
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,720
justice. uh are we making sure we're

131
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,400
listening to the voices and experiences

132
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,759
and stories of those who have been

133
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,360
historically marginalized in

134
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,000
discussions.

135
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,840
So let's talk about some EJ concerns in

136
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,160
the energy transition or in relation to

137
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,320
gens through that prism of justice that

138
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,560
I just mentioned. I won't mention all of

139
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,880
those in these concerns, but uh you can

140
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,280
see sort of how they're intertwined.

141
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,360
So, uh, I think it's really important to

142
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,440
just point out that, uh, buildings

143
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,960
account for 30% of US emissions and half

144
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,240
of that comes from on-site combustion. I

145
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,400
think Christopher Reinhardt talked about

146
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,280
that, Jason Jay already. Uh, this is

147
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,880
sort of like an injustice for all. Um,

148
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,479
also I think discussed by Christopher

149
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,120
Reinhardt was sort of how right now we

150
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:21,759
have an individual home market model

151
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,600
where if I want to redo my energy system

152
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,120
at home, it's under my kind of

153
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,800
discretion or responsibility to learn

154
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,320
about that and go through the process.

155
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,080
And it's pretty challenging, right? I'm

156
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,280
still working through that. Like, no one

157
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,360
tells you that when you put in heat

158
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,520
pumps, there's no heat for the bathrooms

159
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,440
or there's uh no heat for your basement.

160
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,360
This is just a little silly example, but

161
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,880
I think that a lot of people uh in

162
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,960
Massachusetts, around the country sort

163
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,360
of lack literacy about this and this can

164
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,120
exacerbate inequity.

165
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,600
Um as people make the transition to

166
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,600
renewable energy, um the co the gas

167
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,199
customer base will go down and this has

168
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,360
showed that this will put a burden on

169
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,759
low-income communities because their

170
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,120
rates will go up. So you can see one

171
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,800
study showed that this will double the

172
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:05,680
economic burden on low-income families

173
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:08,479
by 2050. Um as the gas uh customer base

174
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:12,080
you know goes down this can also make

175
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:13,520
gas utilities vulnerable. And finally

176
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,199
there are gas leaks which have already

177
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,240
been discussed right so this is a health

178
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:21,039
and safety concern. So how can

179
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,919
geothermal energy networks meet those EJ

180
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:25,440
problems that I just discussed? So I

181
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,919
think this this slide is sort of like

182
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,199
almost like a justice for all slide. Um

183
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,880
which I think there's always like some

184
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,319
tension in the EJ movement is like we

185
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,319
need to acknowledge that there the

186
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,000
injustices have been inequitable among

187
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,520
different groups but then there's also

188
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,720
injustices that we all face. So um you

189
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:45,199
know network geothermal can uh decrease

190
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,840
uh carbon emissions by a lot and then

191
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:50,960
also it can uh lead to a lot of savings

192
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,880
at a community level uh and also uh have

193
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,319
an increased energy efficient efficiency

194
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,759
where there's less peak demand on the

195
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:59,680
grid or significant savings. Um also

196
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,039
just mentioning again like gas leaks are

197
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,000
really problematic for our health and

198
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:06,720
the environment. Um and we can move to a

199
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,039
self safe and healthy reliable heating

200
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,960
and cooling uh system which is a better

201
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,479
model for gas utilities and we can

202
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,319
better address urban heat islands where

203
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,000
I know here even in Massachusetts

204
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,160
there's a ton of communities that lack

205
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,240
you know uh you know adequate access to

206
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,680
cooling.

207
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,919
Uh so like thinking a little bit more

208
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,160
about the distribution uh and sharing of

209
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,360
energy resources. Uh I think one thing

210
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,840
that's really interesting and I'm just

211
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,840
learning more about is how uh a

212
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,199
geothermal loop can share heating and

213
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,039
cooling across different kinds of

214
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,280
buildings. So there's one ongoing

215
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,280
project in Chelsea, New York, uh where a

216
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,039
data center is on a loop with a public

217
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,440
housing community and data centers will

218
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:45,280
like release extra heat and that can be

219
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,840
used by another community. So here you

220
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,440
see like uh building infrastructure with

221
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,319
different kinds of resources being able

222
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,080
to sort of more equitably share that or

223
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,319
uh one of the first or the first uh

224
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,240
network geothermal or geothermal project

225
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:01,520
in Boston is in Dorchester in the

226
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,039
Franklin Field community and um so

227
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,759
network geothermal allows us to

228
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:07,280
prioritize EJ communities when we can

229
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,039
provide heating and cooling to every

230
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,039
building on the network regardless of

231
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,280
the resident's income level or home

232
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,599
ownership status which I think addresses

233
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,440
this idea that only sort of wealthier

234
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:20,319
families or families with literacy can

235
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,599
redo their appliances in their home.

236
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,000
Finally, I don't know, I think this one

237
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:26,160
is the most interesting to me. Uh how do

238
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
we engage the community and make sure

239
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,240
all stakeholders and all groups are

240
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,839
involved in the process? Uh when we're

241
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,760
engaging in network geothermal work, so

242
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,080
this again goes from the individual to

243
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,839
the community level. Uh we need

244
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,440
community engagement. This is the the

245
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,200
project in Framingham, the Framingham

246
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,519
loop uh where a number of different

247
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,080
communities um from different contexts

248
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,920
had to be involved in the project. And

249
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,800
then we need to engage in stakeholder

250
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,399
assessment and engagement. Uh there are

251
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,080
renewable energy projects all around the

252
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,080
country that get halted because one

253
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,519
particular community blocks the project

254
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,680
because they hadn't been involved in the

255
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,200
process until later on. So there's

256
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,200
actually a course here at MIT called the

257
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,680
renewable energy facility sighting

258
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,120
clinic. That's quite a mouthful. uh

259
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,560
where they actually teach students how

260
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,399
to do that sort of stakeholder

261
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:16,320
engagement and I'm trying to learn as

262
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:17,760
much about that as I can. So I guess

263
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,279
maybe you could see a little bit how

264
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,800
these like forms of justice

265
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,360
interconnected and sort of those

266
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,880
solutions um and sort of thinking of

267
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,399
this as a framework for future

268
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:30,959
geothermal work. So just really quickly

269
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,279
uh what do we do in the future? Uh we

270
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:35,360
need more legislation. I got I've got

271
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,560
tons of time. We need more legislation.

272
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,920
uh you know I think environmental

273
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:44,480
justice has has a uh like historical

274
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:45,839
roots in uh law and policy. Um so we

275
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,399
need to do that. I think we need

276
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,000
improved participation across sectors. I

277
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,680
think uh the heat the work that heat

278
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,600
does is so incredible where uh the the

279
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,519
energy utilities are involved,

280
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,360
government is involved, education is

281
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,880
involved, uh community organizations are

282
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,640
involved and then individual residents

283
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,959
are involved. This is incredible work.

284
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,440
It takes so much uh you know thought uh

285
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:10,800
and process to do that and we need

286
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,399
education and awareness. So um most

287
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,320
people are still confusing the different

288
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,160
kinds of geothermal. They're confusing

289
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,320
uh deep geothermal with shallow shallow

290
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,120
geothermal. A lot of people don't know

291
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:24,079
that this is a viable um you know energy

292
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,600
resource moving into the future. And so

293
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,800
like we need that at the K through2

294
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,800
level and at the level of higher

295
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,399
education and then also in informal

296
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,920
spaces. This is a term used in the

297
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,200
literature, right? Where we're just

298
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,680
working with individual people and

299
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,240
community residents. And then we need

300
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,320
action at all different kinds of levels.

301
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,680
Um, so that's political action and

302
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,440
communication. And so I just kind of

303
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,600
have this reflection question here is

304
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,760
how can we make sure that an EJ

305
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,000
framework, right, or a framework of of

306
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,680
different forms of justice uh is

307
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,399
included in future geothermal energy

308
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,079
network projects. uh how can we make

309
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,320
sure that all forms of justice are

310
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:03,320
considered? So, thank you for your

311
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,320
attention.
