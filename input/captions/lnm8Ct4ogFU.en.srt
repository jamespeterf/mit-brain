26
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,960
revolutionizing photonics and

27
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:18,840
computational Optics so we will go in

28
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:21,759
this order and have Sam here

29
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,400
first okay while we wait uh hi I'm Sam

30
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,479
I'm so excited to be here I'm a new

31
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:29,079
faculty here at MIT my research focus is

32
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,960
in power Electronics so how to take one

33
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:34,040
type of electrical energy and turn it

34
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:37,560
into another type of electrical energy

35
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:41,079
and so uh I mainly work in discreet oh

36
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:43,320
there we go uh discret circuits uh but

37
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:45,320
it's really exciting to be a part of MTL

38
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,520
and have that connection uh with folks

39
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:50,360
who are working on devices and materials

40
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,799
as well now I'm going to argue today

41
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:55,240
that future electrification requires

42
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,840
improved power conversion what we have

43
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:00,280
right now is not good enough if we look

44
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,079
at applications of electrification uh

45
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,719
electrified transportation is one of the

46
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,600
most common ones uh we have electric

47
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:09,599
vehicles readily available they're not

48
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:12,520
being adopted we still have less than 1%

49
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:14,519
of evv adoption in the US so we need to

50
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,280
make charging more accessible and more

51
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:18,080
affordable if we look at Power

52
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,000
Electronics on board your electric

53
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,080
vehicle it starts with the charger

54
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,360
whether that's DC fast or onboard

55
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,200
charger the motor drive and then

56
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,760
everything else in your car has to go

57
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:31,080
through a power converter I do a lot of

58
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:33,560
work on electrified aircraft and

59
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,879
similarly we have the same type of power

60
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:38,599
drivetrain right we have a battery or a

61
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:41,000
fuel cell or maybe some parallel hybrid

62
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:42,440
structure we have a distribution system

63
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,159
and we have Power

64
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,319
Electronics there's been a lot of

65
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:48,920
discussion today about Computing the way

66
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,040
we deliver power to our gpus and our

67
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:52,959
CPUs matters a lot right we saw that

68
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,400
we're hitting this limit of how much

69
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,519
energy we have available on earth now

70
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,319
imagine if you're losing 10% of that

71
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:03,519
every time you go to a GPU or a CPU so

72
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,280
this building block is absolutely vital

73
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,159
and then we have Renewables which we

74
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,120
already have solar and wind but now

75
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:11,760
we're going to have close to hopefully

76
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,879
100% Renewables on the grid which means

77
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,680
our power converters also now need to

78
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:18,560
offer support and provide inertia to our

79
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,640
grid as we move towards more

80
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,040
Renewables and then there's more uh

81
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,480
Niche applications such as building a

82
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,640
future lunar microgrid right eventually

83
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:29,319
we're going to house uh astronauts on

84
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,760
the moon and we need power converters

85
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:32,000
that are going to be ble to handle

86
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,120
radiation

87
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,280
effects and then we also have high

88
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,239
voltage DC transmission so how are we

89
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,080
going to deal with all of these

90
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:40,560
Renewables on the grid and how are we

91
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,319
going to get that power from one place

92
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,799
to another uh and we need high voltage

93
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:48,439
converters that can handle reliability

94
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:50,239
and resilience and unfortunately what we

95
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:53,560
have right now isn't good enough to meet

96
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:55,680
these needs and when I what I say uh

97
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,040
meet those needs what I mean is we need

98
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,799
better power converters and we measure

99
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,920
this in a few different metrics when I

100
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:03,400
talk about high performance power

101
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:05,640
converters it's not just one place that

102
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,360
we need better power converters it's in

103
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:10,159
a lot of different

104
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,319
metrics the biggest one is efficiency

105
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,360
right we've already talked about that in

106
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:15,840
Computing it also matters for power

107
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,040
delivery how much power I deliver to my

108
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,560
source from my source to my load is the

109
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:24,000
most important question I need to answer

110
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:26,600
we also care about cost the size both in

111
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,360
volume and weight and also the

112
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,520
reliability now what makes my job fun is

113
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,440
that there is is no one size fits all

114
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,000
right if I'm designing a solar micro

115
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,960
inverter I really care about cost but

116
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,240
when I'm putting something on the moon

117
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,960
cost doesn't matter and so this means

118
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,120
that we have to do this optimization in

119
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:46,240
different ways for different power

120
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,759
converters and different

121
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,479
applications so today I'm going to talk

122
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:52,960
a little bit about some general Trends

123
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:55,840
in power conversion uh but like I said

124
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,360
there's really no one size fits all so

125
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,080
my job is to take different circuit

126
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,240
elements and piece them together as

127
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,720
building blocks

128
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,479
in power converters and we have passive

129
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,039
components which allow us to store and

130
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,479
process energy and then Active

131
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:09,759
Components and so you can tell uh that

132
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,759
we are circuits people because we like

133
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,199
to use this ideal switch

134
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,199
model but our passive components this is

135
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:18,840
the first question I want to answer is

136
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:21,360
how to best utilize these passive

137
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,440
components historically for the past 60

138
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,479
years we've used inductors to store and

139
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,680
process energy but that's not good

140
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:29,319
enough anymore and so now we're looking

141
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,479
at different building blocks that allow

142
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:34,319
us to better utilize energy processing

143
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,880
so here I'm showing a survey of all of

144
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:38,319
the commercially available capacitors

145
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,360
and inductors uh this is data scraped

146
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:42,479
from octo part and for each of these

147
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,440
components we're Computing the energy

148
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:47,240
density so the amount of energy per unit

149
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:49,720
volume we can store and what we find is

150
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,960
capacitors have over a thousand times

151
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:54,680
higher energy density potential than

152
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,560
inductors so this begs the question why

153
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:59,080
can't we use capacitors to store and

154
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,840
process energy now unfortunately I can't

155
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,400
just take where I have an inductor in a

156
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:06,919
circuit and pop in a capacitor and it

157
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:09,599
will not work the same o that messed up

158
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:11,520
but we can use hybrid switch capacitor

159
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:14,160
converters now if you look at the

160
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,319
Blurred squiggles you might be able to

161
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,680
tell some of those are

162
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,199
capacitors uh and the idea here is that

163
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:24,319
we primarily use capacitors to store and

164
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:28,240
process energy and this is my main area

165
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:30,560
of research now again we work in discret

166
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,520
power electronics and so so typically

167
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,039
when I show these types of converters

168
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,560
one of the first questions I get is

169
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:39,000
that's too many switches uh and we use a

170
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,080
lot of switches in these converters and

171
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,680
we're in the hundreds of volts region so

172
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,440
it is very difficult to manage these

173
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,560
switching losses but people are

174
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:48,720
primarily concerned from a reliability

175
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,280
aspect uh they worry that these are too

176
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,560
many switches and too many components

177
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,000
and in fact some of these topologies

178
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,440
have been around since the 60s but they

179
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,639
haven't been utilized because of this

180
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:00,360
concern of

181
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:02,759
reliability but because of advances in

182
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:05,960
switch technology better gallium nitride

183
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:08,360
and silicon carbide devices I can now

184
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:11,280
have 20 devices they're all switching

185
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,479
650 volts and I can do it efficiently

186
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,039
and in a small package and this is

187
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:17,960
really vital to our future now as far as

188
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:20,240
the question of reliability goes let me

189
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,680
show you one application so as I

190
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,520
mentioned I work a lot in hybrid

191
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,919
electric and fully electric aircraft

192
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,240
space uh it's an exciting space to work

193
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,319
in even if you don't think we're going

194
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,960
to get to fully electric aircraft even

195
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:34,000
just just moving to partially hybrid has

196
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:36,360
huge impact on emissions fuel

197
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,360
consumption noise maintenance and cost

198
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,680
so it can very directly and immediately

199
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,960
impact people's lives here we've

200
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,280
collaborated with a company called

201
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,440
ampair they're a hybrid electric

202
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,199
Aircraft company located in Southern

203
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,800
California and we built a type of hybrid

204
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:51,400
switch capacitor converter so one of

205
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,800
these lots of switches lots of

206
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,319
capacitors converters uh to interface

207
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,879
with their electric drivetrain on the

208
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:58,840
aircraft so this goes between the

209
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,800
battery and the distribution bus so it's

210
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:04,360
a DCd regulating converter it has a

211
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:06,759
really nice uh efficiency of 99.52%

212
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:08,440
including Gate Drive losses and a

213
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:10,319
specific power density so how much power

214
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,159
per unit weight we can process that's

215
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,840
about five times higher than what you

216
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:16,960
can get off the shelf but what's really

217
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:19,039
exciting about this project is we took

218
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,639
this system and we went through full low

219
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:24,840
altitude flight qualification testing so

220
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:27,759
we did vibration shock thermal Emi

221
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,840
failure Hazard analysis lots of control

222
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,440
to prove that these types of topology

223
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,919
that people were resilient were

224
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:37,320
concerned about the resiliency for can

225
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:39,159
be designed in a robust way we still

226
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,640
have a lot of things to tackle before we

227
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:42,120
can Implement these types of structures

228
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,560
and all of the applications I talked

229
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,399
about uh and that's what my research

230
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:47,880
group focuses on but uh it's a first

231
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,920
step towards showing this kind of

232
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,839
demonstration and in fact a few months

233
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:55,440
ago uh this actually flew on that

234
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:57,360
aircraft shown below as part of this

235
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,440
demonstration now let me zoom out a

236
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,279
little bit more like I said I primarily

237
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,200
work on capacitor-based

238
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,760
conversion but there's another question

239
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:09,519
of are there other passive components we

240
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:12,160
can use to store and process energy uh

241
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,120
and one of them is pasos so instead of

242
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,880
storing energy uh through electric

243
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,800
fields or magnetic fields we can store

244
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:20,680
it through mechanical energy and so Dave

245
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,079
peralt who's a wonderful faculty here at

246
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:25,640
MIT does a lot of work in pazos as well

247
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:27,680
as some folks at Stanford and Berkeley

248
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:30,240
uh and what they have demonstrated is

249
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,839
really impressive power density and even

250
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,160
up to 3 kilowatt which was uh previously

251
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:36,519
unheard of for pasos and so this is a

252
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,000
place we're really excited about in the

253
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:40,240
future uh is how these new devices can

254
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,279
move us

255
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,000
forward so I've talked about passive

256
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:46,320
components let me talk about Active

257
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,839
Components I mentioned briefly that

258
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,360
gallium nitride and silicon carbide have

259
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:53,000
completely changed the field of Power

260
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:56,399
Electronics our goal is to switch as

261
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,880
fast as possible uh in my types of

262
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,000
converters we're Limited in the hundreds

263
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:02,279
of kerz because we have so many Swit

264
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,920
but Dave peralt uh works in the

265
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:05,560
megahertz region and many people are

266
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,360
moving towards that and so are we

267
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,839
because the faster we switch the smaller

268
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,519
our passive components and this is

269
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:12,560
really one of the big bottlenecks

270
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:14,680
towards small and efficient power

271
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,279
conversion and so these new devices

272
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,079
really moves us forward and that's why

273
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:19,760
it's so exciting to be a part of MTL and

274
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,440
be surrounded by researchers who are

275
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,560
working on these new

276
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,680
devices now I'll mention just briefly uh

277
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:30,880
some of the active devices that we're

278
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:33,519
excited about um so currently mosfets

279
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:36,120
can only block voltage in One Direction

280
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,600
uh but there's monolithic bidirectional

281
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,079
switches being developed by a lot of

282
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,160
different companies these are also

283
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:44,440
called four quadrant or AC switches uh

284
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,839
when I talk to device manufacturers

285
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,240
they're not as excited about these

286
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:50,480
devices but in power Electronics we are

287
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,440
so excited because that means I can have

288
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,959
one device that replaces four and from a

289
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,399
complexity standpoint that is huge and

290
00:10:55,959 --> 00:10:59,720
so in our world of Power Electronics uh

291
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,440
this is really kind of the thing people

292
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:04,040
are watching right now and because uh it

293
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:06,480
enables what's called current Source

294
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:09,399
inverters and Matrix converters so you

295
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,959
can directly turn AC into AC right now

296
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:14,120
you have to go AC DC DC AC which is a

297
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:15,560
little cumbersome uh and so this is a

298
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,839
really exciting place to be working in

299
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,839
there's a number of companies that have

300
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:20,880
preliminary devices uh that we've been

301
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:23,320
able to test and we're excited about uh

302
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,480
the future here here we're looking at

303
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,079
combining these devices with

304
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,800
capacitor-based topologies that enable

305
00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:32,320
us to have buck and boost operation in a

306
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:35,000
single stage converter uh this is really

307
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,760
nice it's about a 10 times reduction in

308
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,680
passive component weight compared to a

309
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:43,079
conventional uh approach so 10 times is

310
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:46,000
a big deal in our field um

311
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:48,720
so with that let me end on this slide

312
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,639
because really in Power Electronics we

313
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,040
are pulled forward by new devices right

314
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:55,000
hopefully I've made that clear that new

315
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,880
passive components new switches mean

316
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
that we have new topologies and we can

317
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,720
create better power conversion but

318
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,880
really what matters to us is the

319
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,440
applications of electrification if we

320
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,040
want to tackle these challenges and make

321
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:08,959
Computing available to everybody we need

322
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:12,240
better and more efficient power

323
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:15,839
conversion so that's all thank

324
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:18,800
you thank you so much Sam for this very

325
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,519
interesting talk on your work and do we

326
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,959
have questions either from the audience

327
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:25,880
or from the

328
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:28,760
pig no black says

329
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:32,920
no they say no and we are a little bit

330
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:37,360
tight in time so thanks a lot

331
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:40,959
again so San is our second speaker and I

332
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:43,680
know she was here yes she is here okay

333
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:47,120
great I'm very happy to be here for the

334
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:49,360
4th uh 40th anniversary of MTL so my

335
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,160
name is sishan my lab works on about

336
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,360
Imaging Technologies uh so the hope for

337
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,120
my lab or the dream of my lab is to have

338
00:12:54,360 --> 00:13:00,040
better understanding and diagnosis of

339
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:03,000
diseases with non-invasive Imaging and

340
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:05,480
intrinsic contrast so this is probably a

341
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,720
very different flavor from the other

342
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:11,399
talks because we have not been able to

343
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,240
do this in chips yet but maybe in 10

344
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:16,440
years we will be able to move this to

345
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:19,000
chips so now this is mostly like bulk

346
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:21,440
Optics and devices and we want to bring

347
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,360
it into the hospitals for interoptic

348
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:30,160
Imaging and surgical

349
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:30,160
assessment uh should I use this

350
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:41,920
okay so uh just a brief introduction or

351
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:45,639
background on image and microsopy so for

352
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:47,680
the last 100 years a wide variety of

353
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:49,760
tools have been invented in the field of

354
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,079
biomedical Imaging that has transformed

355
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:55,839
biom medicine and people are probably

356
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:57,880
familiar with x-ray MRI pads which can

357
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,199
penetrate through the entire body and

358
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:02,360
gives you this visualization of internal

359
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:04,759
structures and functions of the body so

360
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:07,160
that doctors don't have to cut US Open

361
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:10,480
and see what's happening within us for a

362
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:13,399
diagnosis and so on the other spectrum

363
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:16,480
of this image modalities we have Optical

364
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:19,360
microsopy which gives us the unique

365
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:22,199
submicron resolution without destroying

366
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:25,440
the tissue so what it means that is that

367
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:28,440
we although we can only see maybe 10

368
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,279
microns 100 microns deep into the tissue

369
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,759
but the unque unque sub Cellar

370
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:34,320
resolution it gives us can help us

371
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:36,360
understand what individual cells are

372
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:40,360
doing in living

373
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:43,079
tissues but if you have uh dealt with

374
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:46,279
certain types of microscopes before most

375
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:49,399
microsopy has been limited to dead and

376
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:51,360
slice tissue and cells why is that what

377
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:54,880
is challenging about image and living

378
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:57,480
tissues so we could take a look at just

379
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:00,040
a tumor tissue for example so there are

380
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:02,440
two fundamental challenges is first

381
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:05,839
there is a lack of contrast the second

382
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:07,000
one is lack of uh contrast so if we look

383
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:10,720
at this

384
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:13,519
one let's see yeah so this is a piece of

385
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,680
tumor tissue if we just use natural

386
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,480
light to look at it it's very hard to

387
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,920
see through right that's the same thing

388
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:22,600
why we cannot see through the my skin

389
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:25,639
unless we use X-ray and the second thing

390
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:28,959
is unless we use stain the tumor

391
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:31,440
contrast won't stand out so uh in the

392
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:33,920
recent decades including two Nobel

393
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,079
prizes there has been a lot of efforts

394
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,920
on engineering the tissue so that we can

395
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:41,160
see through to an extent and have the

396
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:43,279
contrast and this includes the efforts

397
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:45,560
of how to section tissue so that we can

398
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:48,000
actually see what is within each tissue

399
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:50,480
at different Z slices this includes

400
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,720
efforts in clearing staining so that you

401
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,639
can actually see that is a tumor cell

402
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,079
that is normal cell and we can use

403
00:15:54,639 --> 00:16:00,000
morphology of each cell to give the

404
00:15:57,079 --> 00:16:02,360
tumor a grading so this has been very

405
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,040
effective and highly used in hospital

406
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:06,480
and clinical settings and also in

407
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:08,560
biological research Labs but as you can

408
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,720
imagine we would not want to do this to

409
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,519
ourselves while we're alive it perturbs

410
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:16,279
a living system with a very high degree

411
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:19,440
right so instead of engineering the

412
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:21,720
tissue uh we want to engineer the light

413
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,839
so that we can get intrinsic contrast

414
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:25,680
with non-invasive Imaging and we can

415
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,000
directly see what is happening within

416
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:31,240
the living tissue with minimal peration

417
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,360
possible and that's our mission so first

418
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,959
challenge how to generate molecular

419
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:39,279
contrast without staining so we've all

420
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:42,959
seen this before uh in Natural History

421
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:46,000
Museum this is a Utah Museum of Natural

422
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:48,639
History where you see this kind of a uh

423
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
display of rocks if you don't turn

424
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:53,399
lasers on if you just have natural light

425
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,160
it looks very medal core and regular

426
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:58,480
right but if we use different laser

427
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,120
colors to shine the lights onto the

428
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,920
rocks what will you see you will see

429
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:04,760
false fluoresence fluoresence of

430
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,559
different colors so the combination of

431
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,799
different lasers and then different

432
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,880
combinations of the camera colors can

433
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,839
give you indication what kind of

434
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,919
chemicals are there and that's what

435
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:18,679
gives the color it's the same idea for

436
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,959
label-free Imaging of biological tissues

437
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:22,880
so the contrast is a little bit weaker

438
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:25,319
because we have very bright light here

439
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,760
but you can probably see the Hues of the

440
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:31,320
white the yellow light so here we shine

441
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:34,360
the lights of ftoc and near infrared if

442
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:36,120
you detect yellow lights the there will

443
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:38,720
be Auto fluoresence from this thing

444
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:41,320
called fad which is a metabolic product

445
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,400
that everyone has every animal has every

446
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:46,280
cell has for indicating their

447
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:49,840
oxygenation status and just like the

448
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:54,039
Rocks if we switch the laser color from

449
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:57,760
let's say 900 NM to 1200 NM if we detect

450
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:59,159
blue light now we are detecting an ADH

451
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,679
which is another important important

452
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:04,360
metabolic byproducts and by combining

453
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:08,120
the concentration or the intensity from

454
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:11,000
the yellow color fad blue color and ADH

455
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:13,799
we could have educated gas on the

456
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,840
glycolysis TCA cycle and oxidative

457
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:19,280
phosphation of the cells and tissue

458
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:24,360
which is a huge importantly uh indicator

459
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:27,559
for cancer immune responses and embryo

460
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:29,679
development besides Auto florescence so

461
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:32,559
a lot of our tissues are highly

462
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:34,799
organized you can think of them almost

463
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:37,360
as like a nonlinear Crystal so if

464
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:39,840
they're organized enough they are Quasi

465
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,440
phas match that they can generate second

466
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,520
Harmon generation and third Harmon

467
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,760
generation what doesn't mean is that it

468
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:49,000
will convert the near infrared light to

469
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:51,960
half or the third of wavelength that

470
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,320
makes it visible to the detectors again

471
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:57,559
so the green color here shows collagen

472
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:59,880
fibers that is affected by aging that is

473
00:18:57,559 --> 00:19:02,400
affected by by uh different

474
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:04,280
endometriosis different disease status

475
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,440
and then the third hormone generation

476
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:10,320
which gives us this purple color can

477
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:13,159
give you the interfaces of lipid protein

478
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:15,720
collagen fibers which gives you this

479
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:18,159
very very versatile contrast of lipid

480
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:22,159
dropless immune cells and the neuron

481
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:24,440
fibers and when we put this together we

482
00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:26,760
what we did is really like the Rocks so

483
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:29,240
we switch the laser colors and we switch

484
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:31,799
the colors of the photo detectors and by

485
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:34,720
combining the contrast we can have a

486
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:37,039
much more comprehensive view what of

487
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,440
what is happening in the tissue so what

488
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:41,799
we are looking at is a leaving rat with

489
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:44,000
memory cancer and with this deep

490
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:46,080
metabolic Imaging we could see the

491
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,799
cancer cells are forming clusters and

492
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,880
they're going everywhere to meses to

493
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:54,200
other sides and they're forming vessels

494
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:56,480
to provide oxygen to provide nutrition

495
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:58,960
to their further growth which is very

496
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:01,360
scary but which is very important to

497
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,840
capture if we want to do real pathol

498
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:07,159
realtime pathology image guided therapy

499
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:10,640
and rare disease biodiscovery

500
00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:13,480
and so that is one challenge right

501
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,960
generation of intrinsic molecular

502
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:18,840
contrast without staining or changing

503
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:21,520
the tissue the other contrast the other

504
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:24,200
challenge is how to generate the depth

505
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:27,120
penetration without physically cutting

506
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:29,039
through so there has been very

507
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,400
groundbreaking breakthroughs in are

508
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:33,760
filled with invivo optic clearing where

509
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:36,039
they use Dorito dieses to clear the

510
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,320
tissue to make it clear which is very

511
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:40,400
exciting on the other side besides

512
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:43,120
chemicals we can use also use clever

513
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,120
Optics to get deeper so by using the Las

514
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:48,320
Laser Source that's developed by our lab

515
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:51,120
we could push the depth from 50 microm

516
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:55,400
uh 200 microm all the way to 500 microm

517
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:57,480
to even 1.5 mm it sounds very small but

518
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:59,760
if we think about the the half Micron

519
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:02,919
resolution so the ratio of depth and

520
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:05,039
resolution is significant in this case

521
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:07,640
and by doing this we could finally

522
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:09,360
penetrate through the de cell layers of

523
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:12,320
the skin we could actually see the

524
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:14,200
subdermal layers and for brain organoid

525
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,120
we could finally go through the service

526
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,279
and see what is actually happening in

527
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:20,320
the center if the drug penetrates

528
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:23,440
through there if there is drug efficacy

529
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:26,600
in a more realistic model so that's the

530
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:29,400
deep tissue Imaging so what our lab does

531
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:32,080
is we want to leverage the risk vces in

532
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:34,039
Optics and algorithms to advance the

533
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,000
understanding and treatment diseases so

534
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:38,120
we work on light shaping Technologies so

535
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,799
that we don't have to engineer tissue

536
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:42,919
but we can engineer the colors of light

537
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:45,320
so this is a fiber shaper device that we

538
00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:47,320
recently developed in the lab but just

539
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:49,720
this is very simple device but works

540
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:52,320
effectively by just shaping the lights

541
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:55,159
we can control the nonlinear conversion

542
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:57,240
processes within this mod mode fiber and

543
00:21:55,159 --> 00:22:00,080
by control this adaptively with the

544
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:02,159
Imaging process we can control what

545
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,960
contrast we want to maximize in the

546
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:07,480
tissue without engineering the tissue

547
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,720
and then we also realize there is always

548
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:12,360
a limit to the physics instrumentation

549
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:16,320
no matter how hard working we're at in

550
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:18,760
the lab so we use ai physics-based ai to

551
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,840
overcome this physics limitation with

552
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:23,520
trustworthy prediction so this is an

553
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:25,679
example how we use physic basic AI to

554
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,880
overcome scattering and defraction to

555
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:30,320
achieve sub defraction limited

556
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:32,640
resolution deep within the tissue so

557
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:36,559
this was the first demonstration of deep

558
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:38,320
thick 3D isotropic imaging and then on

559
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:40,679
the third one we really don't want to

560
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,840
develop technology just for the sake of

561
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:45,440
technology and thankfully we're in

562
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:49,240
Boston so we have the best technicians

563
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:51,279
and uh uh hospitals and biologists that

564
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:53,640
have the most Frontier questions so we

565
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:56,039
closely collaborate with them to use our

566
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:58,760
technology to help them answer their

567
00:22:56,039 --> 00:23:00,960
important questions in biom medicine so

568
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:03,799
I think I'm running out of time but I

569
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,480
want to highlight three examples in this

570
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:07,679
collaboration between the biomatic

571
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:09,480
questions and the Deep metabolic imaging

572
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:12,320
technology that's developed by our lab

573
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:15,440
so the first one is invivo Imaging of

574
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:17,720
cancer so the goal is that if we don't

575
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,400
use St if we don't use sectioning the

576
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:21,600
dream is that we can just shine this

577
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:25,480
light onto the patient and evaluate the

578
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:27,760
efficacy of drug responses or immuno

579
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:30,960
therapies or just real time diagnosis

580
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:33,520
for better surgical margin assessment so

581
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,919
this is a proof of concept experiment in

582
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:38,360
the rat this leaving rat what you're

583
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:40,520
seeing is their vessels are flowing and

584
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:42,480
the purple cells you're seeing are the

585
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:45,039
neutral fils that are coming in and out

586
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:48,960
of the uh vessels to fight or

587
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:50,960
collaborate with the uh tumor cells so

588
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,039
this capability of non-invasive

589
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,760
monitoring of immune responses can

590
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:58,200
Empower realtime pathology and image

591
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:00,960
guided cancer therapy in human clinical

592
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:03,880
trans translation the second example I

593
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:08,000
want to highlight is uh Imaging of brain

594
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:09,919
Organo so we have uh an expert Professor

595
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,520
Roger Kim in biological engineering

596
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:14,919
mechanical engineering at MIT who is an

597
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:17,679
expert on creating brain Organo

598
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:20,960
mimicking neurodegenerative diseases

599
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:24,400
like ALS but the organ noise unlike

600
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:26,559
their president which is 2D cell culture

601
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,799
this 3D cell culture are really thick

602
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:30,480
hard to see through so use the Deep

603
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:33,159
metabolic Imaging you can see through

604
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:35,520
the entire thing and using the AI based

605
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:38,640
fist based AI you can reconstruct the

606
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:40,880
highly resolved cells with individual

607
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,200
metabolic status so now we can have a

608
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,080
more accurate assessment of the disease

609
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,919
progression and we can finally see if

610
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:49,960
the drug actually penetrates to the

611
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:51,880
center of the brain organoid the final

612
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:56,360
example I want to highlight is a recent

613
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:59,120
collaboration with a Dr Mickey so McKey

614
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:01,240
is an expert on line disease so Lyme

615
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,919
disease is prevalent on the east coast

616
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:05,880
and Europe so when we when some people

617
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,679
get the tick bites they're fine but

618
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:10,200
other people get stic bites they would

619
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:12,200
develop really severe connective tissue

620
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:14,640
disorder and so there is a huge

621
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:17,200
heterogenity in this immune response and

622
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,399
also treatment response and this deep

623
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,919
metabolic Imaging uh that's conducted

624
00:25:19,399 --> 00:25:24,559
between the two laps allows us to see so

625
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:27,159
if you can see here these like warm like

626
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:29,600
structures are the bacteria and this was

627
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:32,799
the first visualization of this bacteria

628
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,600
they are freely swarming in the patients

629
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:37,159
in the mouse patients that are

630
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:40,080
susceptible to Lyme disease what's more

631
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:42,399
interesting is that when we compare so

632
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,159
this mice is mimicking this mouse is

633
00:25:42,399 --> 00:25:46,679
mimicking human conditions that are

634
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:50,640
susceptible to Lyme disease and this

635
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:52,919
mouse on the right is mimicking um human

636
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,760
patients that are more resistant to Lyme

637
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:56,559
disease so they have very different

638
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:59,240
immune responses and we are now

639
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:01,480
characterizing the bacteria distribution

640
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:03,799
and also the immune responses to see if

641
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:06,640
they can serve as biomarkers for

642
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:09,760
personalized diagnosis and treatment so

643
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:12,200
this is the last slide um so given the

644
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:14,840
recent breakthroughs in about Imaging uh

645
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:17,760
we really hope that with the Optics and

646
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:20,960
ACR venes we can make Optical by Optical

647
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:23,279
microscopy a go standard for invivo

648
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,460
pathology and personalized medicine

649
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:29,089
thank you

650
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:29,089
[Applause]

651
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:35,600
excellent yeah fascinating so do we have

652
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:35,600
questions yes there is

653
00:26:38,399 --> 00:26:44,399
one uh the question is the longest

654
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,399
wavelength is 1100

655
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:52,279
NM yes so for for ACT 1100 nomers is so

656
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:54,159
far our favorite wavelength because

657
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:56,640
because it supports all the way uh all

658
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:58,600
the modalities in a single shot is is

659
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,559
there any benefit to going to longer

660
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:02,200
wavelengths that's actually a great

661
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:04,640
question so it's a hard debate in our

662
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:06,880
field because the longer you go it's the

663
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,840
similar like why you see the red sunset

664
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,760
while you see the Blue Sky it scatters

665
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:13,039
less so you would want to go to longer

666
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:15,000
wavelengths right uh so there is

667
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:17,640
trade-off because longer wavelength also

668
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,480
has higher water absorption so if you

669
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:23,799
have samples or diseases that has less

670
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:26,760
water it might be beneficial to go uh to

671
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:28,720
go rder however it's complicated because

672
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:32,320
it's engineering trade-off issue because

673
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:35,399
if you go rder the so the wavelength of

674
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:39,760
the light has to match the energy gap of

675
00:27:35,399 --> 00:27:41,600
the fluorophor so you kind of have to um

676
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:45,200
yeah do this trade-off of quantum

677
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:48,799
efficiency and uh signal yield yeah but

678
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:51,559
we are actively going from 1100 to 1300

679
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:53,559
to 1700 just to see if we can push that

680
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:55,200
depth even bigger great question does

681
00:27:53,559 --> 00:27:59,559
that help with the penetration depth

682
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:03,360
also or uh yeah because uh because for

683
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:05,720
example if we do 1300 nomers what we see

684
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,799
this really varies on different tissues

685
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:09,960
so brain organoid although everybody

686
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:12,320
claims they're highly scattering they're

687
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:15,360
semi-transparent in our image modality

688
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:18,600
but the skin is super super thick like

689
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:21,039
for skin if we use this thing uh the

690
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:24,760
same modality it just disappear the

691
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:28,120
signal disappears after 100 microm uh so

692
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:32,519
which we need to use longer wavelengths

693
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:35,399
to C it down yeah so other questions we

694
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:38,720
will take in the after session during

695
00:28:35,399 --> 00:28:38,720
the reception thank you so

696
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,240
much thank you and as I introduced at

697
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,840
the beginning our third speaker is deina

698
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:49,600
sarar

699
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:52,559
so okay hello everyone it's a great

700
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:55,120
pleasure to be here today uh my name is

701
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:58,120
deblina sarar I'm an assistant professor

702
00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:00,640
at MIT media lab and today I'm going to

703
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:02,320
talk to you about our lab's work in life

704
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,559
nanom machine

705
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:07,279
symbis so just to give you a little bit

706
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:10,600
background about myself I actually

707
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:13,559
started my research Adventure in Nano

708
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:15,080
electronics and applied physics and

709
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:17,320
specifically in developing energy

710
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:20,480
efficient Nano Electronics so we

711
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:22,600
developed a transistor which channel is

712
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,679
only six atoms in thickness and showed

713
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:28,080
that it can overcome the fundamental

714
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:29,960
limits of power of existing devices and

715
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:32,840
and then while working on energy

716
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:35,880
efficient low power electronic devices

717
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:38,159
for electronic computation I realized

718
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:40,519
that brain is the lowest power computer

719
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:42,440
ever so I did a very steep transition

720
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:44,399
from the field of Nano electronics and

721
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:46,360
applied physics to the field of

722
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:49,039
neurotechnology and Neuroscience to

723
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:51,080
learn more about the brain and there we

724
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:53,760
developed a technology which helps us to

725
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:56,080
look at previously unseen biomolecular

726
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:58,880
building blocks of the brain and how

727
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:01,880
that leads to brain computation

728
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:04,919
and in my own Lab at MIT which I call

729
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:07,600
the nanoc cybernetic botre we fuse these

730
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:11,159
fields together we fuse Nano Electronics

731
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:13,279
Applied Physics with Biology so we

732
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:16,360
continue to innovate in the space of

733
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:18,799
energy efficient uh Nano electronic uh

734
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:22,159
devices specifically for creating energy

735
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:25,600
efficient Ai and there we are very glad

736
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:28,840
and happy to be a part of MIT and mtl's

737
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:32,120
uh AI Hardware program and then we also

738
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:34,880
fuse these Nano electronic devices with

739
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:38,279
Biology and the idea is to create a new

740
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:40,760
paradigm for Life machine symbiosis and

741
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:43,000
in this regime we have created the first

742
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:46,240
autonomous and non-surgical brain

743
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:49,039
implant we have created bioelectronic

744
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:52,240
devices which we have shown can treat

745
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:55,440
brain cancer which is even resistant to

746
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:57,600
drugs and radiation we have also created

747
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:59,519
a novel bi electronic therapy for

748
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,519
disease dises of aging and

749
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:04,279
neurogenerative

750
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:07,559
diseases so why do you want to fuse

751
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:10,120
nanoelectronics with Biology so the

752
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:13,200
versatility of Nano Electronics is that

753
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:15,279
they can be designed from scratch and

754
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,880
according to an ingenious dream to

755
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:20,480
create functionalities which are beyond

756
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:22,760
the capabilities of biology and

757
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:25,399
specifically in our lab we create

758
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:27,039
subcellular sized wireless Nano

759
00:31:25,399 --> 00:31:29,559
electronic devices so these are

760
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:32,240
subcellular sized sized much smaller

761
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:34,600
than size of even a single cell so they

762
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,679
are wireless and Battery free so you do

763
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:39,880
not need a battery or you do not need

764
00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:42,320
wire coming out of open wound or wires

765
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:45,559
uh going through the body so these

766
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:48,519
devices can be seamlessly integrated uh

767
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:51,240
with Biology and they can c-li and

768
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:54,320
coexist with the biological structures

769
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:57,039
without destroying them specifically we

770
00:31:54,320 --> 00:32:00,080
are creating devices which can form

771
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:03,679
unique hybrid with our biological living

772
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:07,080
cells we have built electronic devices

773
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:09,480
uh which can sit on top of cells or wrap

774
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:12,000
around living cells like variable

775
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:14,360
devices we have created devices which

776
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
can even work from inside a living cell

777
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:18,600
we have created an antenna which is

778
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,399
called cell Rover which can be

779
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:24,120
wirelessly actuated from inside a living

780
00:32:21,399 --> 00:32:26,080
cell and you have also created devices

781
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:28,320
which are not completely inside the cell

782
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:31,000
or completely outside they just sit at

783
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:33,600
the transmembrane space so they can

784
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:36,279
communicate with both extracellular and

785
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:39,159
intracellular environment so with the

786
00:32:36,279 --> 00:32:42,080
limited time here I'm just going to talk

787
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:43,480
about uh two of these Technologies today

788
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,600
so the First Technology I'm going to

789
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:47,200
talk about is what we called the

790
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:50,240
variable for

791
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:54,080
cells so just like we human body we have

792
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:57,919
our head we have our hands our legs

793
00:32:54,080 --> 00:33:01,000
cells such as neurons also have uh such

794
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:02,919
specific parts so they have the Soma

795
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,639
which is like the head they have the

796
00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:08,080
exons and dendr which are like the hands

797
00:33:05,639 --> 00:33:10,399
and the legs so just like we have

798
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:13,440
variable devices for our body can we

799
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:16,919
also have variable devices for cells

800
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:19,480
inside our body and indeed we show that

801
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:21,639
that is possible so this kind of

802
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:23,760
Technology uh where it would be useful

803
00:33:21,639 --> 00:33:26,600
is that it can create a potential

804
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:29,440
treatment for intractable and deadly

805
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:31,799
diseases such such as multiple sclerosis

806
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:35,200
which currently has no cure so multiple

807
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:38,600
sclerosis is a disease where uh the

808
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:41,559
neurons they lose their natural myeline

809
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:44,720
sheets so myeline sheets wrap around

810
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:47,039
axones and create a protective layer but

811
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:50,120
in this disease multiple sclerosis the

812
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:53,000
neurons lose their natural mine sheets

813
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:56,000
and currently there is no biological way

814
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,320
of recreating these malins and with such

815
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,480
a technology of variable for sell we can

816
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:03,480
actually completely forego this

817
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:06,639
biological mechanism and create

818
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:08,720
synthetic artificial milein sheets so

819
00:34:06,639 --> 00:34:12,760
which could lead to a potential

820
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:15,760
treatment for this deadly brain disease

821
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:19,159
so we have developed such variable for

822
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:21,440
cell devices in our lab and using MTL

823
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:24,240
facilities and you have shown that these

824
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:27,119
devices can be wirelessly actuated to

825
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:30,480
create devices which can roll over with

826
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:33,919
ultra low radi of curvature we have

827
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:37,119
shown that these devices can wrap around

828
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:39,200
cells and then without causing any Toxic

829
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:42,159
effect or without affecting the

830
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:45,599
functionality of living cells we have

831
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:48,639
further showed that these devices we can

832
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:50,879
further uh uh integrate different kinds

833
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:54,159
of electronic materials like

834
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:56,240
semiconductors metals or insulators so

835
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:58,240
they can also Roll Along with these

836
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:00,480
devices without f failure or

837
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,240
functionality so this can lead to

838
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,000
further Advanced functionalities to

839
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:06,000
these

840
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:09,480
devices so that means it is possible

841
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:12,200
right uh that apart from having variable

842
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:14,800
devices for our body we can have even

843
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:17,760
variable devices for cells within our

844
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:20,280
body so what you see in the middle image

845
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:23,560
is basically ai's rendition of variable

846
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:26,119
for cell devices while in the right are

847
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:29,119
actual scanning electron microscopy

848
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:31,720
images of the variable for cell devices

849
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:34,119
that we have built again using MTL and

850
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:37,400
MIT Nanos facilities these images are

851
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:39,520
also taken at MIT Nano so in blue here

852
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:43,040
these are the actual cells and cellular

853
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:44,839
parts of neurons and in red here are our

854
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:48,320
uh

855
00:35:44,839 --> 00:35:50,920
devices so the second technology that uh

856
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:53,880
I'm going to discuss is the first

857
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:56,560
autonomous and non-surgical brain

858
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:58,359
implant so I apologize from in the very

859
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,240
beginning because this work work is not

860
00:35:58,359 --> 00:36:02,680
published yet so I'm not going to be

861
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:05,280
able to show a lot of data but happy to

862
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:07,240
talk to you uh in person to discuss more

863
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:10,400
details but I would uh give you an

864
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:13,920
overview and why we are so much excited

865
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:18,920
about this technology and what it can do

866
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:21,040
so why do we need a brain implant um So

867
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:23,240
currently more than three billion people

868
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:26,400
around the world suffer from different

869
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:30,440
brain diseases and mental illnesses

870
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:31,800
currently no brain disease have any cure

871
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:34,640
and according to World Health

872
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:37,560
Organization neurological disorders are

873
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:40,160
the number one cause of ill health and

874
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:42,960
disability and drugs have mostly been

875
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:45,520
known to be ineffective in uh curing or

876
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:48,760
treating uh neural

877
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:52,480
diseases however electrical stimulation

878
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:55,079
of neurons have been shown to treat even

879
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:58,319
neural diseases which are resistant to

880
00:36:55,079 --> 00:37:01,119
drugs however existing techologies for

881
00:36:58,319 --> 00:37:03,720
brain stimulation have severe

882
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:06,040
limitations right now the only way to

883
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:08,400
stimulate a region focally deep inside

884
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:11,480
the brain is to create a hole in the

885
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:14,720
skull and putting a centimeter scale

886
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:18,400
probe in that's highly highly invasive

887
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:21,160
in nature uh any kind of such surgical

888
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:24,160
technology is associated universally

889
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:26,599
with pain but also risk of infection

890
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:29,079
morbidity mortality and psychological

891
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:31,400
adverse effects moreover such kind of

892
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:34,520
intracranial brain implant is only

893
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:36,560
limited to less than 1% of the patients

894
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:39,119
so currently only one% of the patients

895
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:42,240
can undergo such kind of

896
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:44,560
procedure now imagine a new paradigm

897
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:47,240
where you can have extremely small Nano

898
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:49,119
electronic devices which can be

899
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:52,520
introduced to the bloodstream or

900
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:55,760
cerebral spinal fluid they can travel

901
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:58,839
through uh the body fluids and have the

902
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:01,760
capability of autonomous ly recognizing

903
00:37:58,839 --> 00:38:03,839
a particular disease region in the brain

904
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:06,400
and they can self- implant in that

905
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:09,000
disease targeted region without the need

906
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:11,040
for any surgery so this is not a science

907
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,920
fiction anymore we have developed uh

908
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:15,000
such a technology in our lab and also

909
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:18,680
this non electronic devices have been

910
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:20,720
built using MIT Nano's uh facilities and

911
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:23,400
this is the first demonstration of

912
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:25,520
electronic devices which can cross the

913
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:28,160
bloodb brain barrier and after the

914
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:30,839
devices are self- implanted in the brain

915
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:32,760
so we call it self implantation because

916
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:35,160
this procedure does not require any

917
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:37,520
external Imaging or guidance procedure

918
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:39,880
for the implantation and after they get

919
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:42,800
self- implanted we wirelessly actuate

920
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:45,800
them to electrically stimulate uh the

921
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:49,160
brain so this indeed creates a new

922
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:51,560
paradigm a paradigm from invasive brain

923
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:54,359
surgery creating a hole in the skull and

924
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:56,920
putting things in to the Paradigm of a

925
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:58,599
simple injection but it's also important

926
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:01,839
to distin distinguish it that this is

927
00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:04,319
not just injectable Electronics because

928
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:06,280
if you had to inject Electronics

929
00:39:04,319 --> 00:39:08,200
directly into the target region of the

930
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,839
brain that will still be invasive and

931
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:12,760
you still have to create a hole in the

932
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:15,480
skull and inject Electronics in but this

933
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:18,280
creates autonomous targeting so we are

934
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:19,480
actually injecting the devices for from

935
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:22,040
through the periphery through the

936
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:25,040
peripheral uh blood vessels or cerebral

937
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:27,880
spinal fluid and these devices can

938
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:29,920
autonomously Target and recognize uh the

939
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:32,599
particular diseased uh

940
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:34,640
region and it it can create

941
00:39:32,599 --> 00:39:37,040
accessibility great accessibility so

942
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:40,200
compared to as a mention only 1% of the

943
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:43,480
patient can go through this uh highly

944
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:45,359
invasive uh intracranial surgery so a

945
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:47,040
simple injection in the peripheral you

946
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:49,839
know blood vessels could make it

947
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:51,880
accessible to most and this can be

948
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:54,960
accessible to different age groups uh

949
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:57,440
also people who cannot undergo surgery

950
00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:00,040
also by completely eliminating Surgical

951
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:02,760
cost uh this basically is accessible to

952
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:03,599
people across diverse uh socioeconomic

953
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:06,560
uh

954
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:09,000
spectrum and how does it compared to uh

955
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:12,079
what exists today so I think everyone

956
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,920
knows about um neurolink and other

957
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:17,079
companies like metronic who actually

958
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:19,720
make wired implants for the brain again

959
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:21,760
they are highly invasive in nature

960
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:23,680
requires creating a hole in the skull

961
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:26,160
neuralink device requires creating a

962
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:28,520
1-in hole in the skull to put things in

963
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:31,400
so these are highly highly invasive

964
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:32,720
invasive electrons cannot reach eloquent

965
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,640
structures in the brain there are

966
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:37,079
structures in the brain very very

967
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,880
sensitive so you cannot put invasive

968
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:41,560
electrod there there's a region in the

969
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:43,920
brain called brain stem that's called

970
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:46,800
touch notot region so if something

971
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:49,680
happens there the surgeons just leave it

972
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:51,400
as it is and the patient is left to die

973
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:53,720
because if you want to surgically reach

974
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:55,200
there it will make things even worse and

975
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:57,480
there regions in the brain if you want

976
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:59,119
to do surgery a person will look lose

977
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:01,960
their Consciousness or will they will

978
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:04,920
lose their uh other abilities such as

979
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:08,000
picking or normal uh locomotive uh

980
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:10,000
functions so uh surgery surgical

981
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,319
procedures are not possible in many

982
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,520
regions of the brain there are also

983
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:16,440
endovascular electrodes where people try

984
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:19,000
to put electrodes to the catheter but

985
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:21,640
that also requires surgical uh

986
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:24,480
procedures and again is only access

987
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:26,240
accessible to less than 8% of the brain

988
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,160
there are procedures such as

989
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:32,079
transcranial a magnetic stimulation that

990
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:34,920
does not include a implant inside the

991
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:38,040
brain those are uh magnets which are

992
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:41,280
placed outside the skull but they do not

993
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:43,000
have spao temporal resolution required

994
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:45,480
in many cases you know to treat brain

995
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:48,000
diseases and also they're only confined

996
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:50,440
to the brain surface uh they cannot go

997
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,359
deep inside the brain so right now

998
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:54,599
treating anything deep inside the brain

999
00:41:52,359 --> 00:41:56,040
the only way is to again creating a hole

1000
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:59,040
in the skull and putting this uh

1001
00:41:56,040 --> 00:42:01,480
centimeter scale probin our technology

1002
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:03,160
does overcome uh these challenges

1003
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:06,119
moreover none of these Technologies can

1004
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:08,359
do autonomous targeting so autonomous

1005
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:11,079
recognition of targeting and that's very

1006
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:13,160
important because there are microscopic

1007
00:42:11,079 --> 00:42:16,800
pathological sites in the brain which

1008
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:19,839
may not be even recognizable by uh for

1009
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:22,520
example Imaging such as MRI so our

1010
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:23,599
autonomous targeting can uh overcome uh

1011
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:26,119
those

1012
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:28,240
challenges I'm very happy to share that

1013
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:30,559
we received the highest recognition from

1014
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:33,160
National Institute of Health for this

1015
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:36,000
work uh we received the ni director's

1016
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:39,240
new innovator award and actually got the

1017
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:41,440
highest and rarely achieved uh impact

1018
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:43,920
score uh we received actually the

1019
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:46,599
perfect uh impact score of uh 10 for

1020
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,520
this work and Co from Ni statement

1021
00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:52,160
mention that this technology has the

1022
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:56,960
potential to create a Herald a new era

1023
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:56,960
um yeah thank you very much

1024
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:02,880
yeah we also have uh other awards that

1025
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:05,079
we got including the Mind prize

1026
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:07,440
distinguished scientist award and the um

1027
00:43:05,079 --> 00:43:09,359
you know deg new innovator award and

1028
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,400
again I'm very thankful and happy to be

1029
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:13,800
a part of MIT Nano facilities our

1030
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:16,240
wireless devices Nano electronic devices

1031
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:18,920
are built in MIT Nano this is our second

1032
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:22,160
home and very thankful to my students

1033
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:25,000
and posts uh who make this work possible

1034
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:27,839
a final last slide happy to also share

1035
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:30,040
that we recently Incorporated a Dela SE

1036
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:32,880
Corp to translate this technology to

1037
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:35,520
humans we have demonstrated this um very

1038
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:37,280
very robustly in animals and right now

1039
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:39,280
we are you know ready to go forward to

1040
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:41,559
the next step and translate to humans so

1041
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:44,400
we call this uh company kahira

1042
00:43:41,559 --> 00:43:47,480
Technologies kahira in Irish actually

1043
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:49,359
means a warrior it's a Female warrior

1044
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:51,839
and the idea is really to set a war

1045
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:54,400
against currently intractable and deadly

1046
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:56,640
brain diseases and again we are part of

1047
00:43:54,400 --> 00:44:00,000
MIT start Nano program very very

1048
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:01,680
Greatful full and uh this uh companies

1049
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,559
uh very soon will be uh there will be

1050
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:06,079
opportunities for investment so if you

1051
00:44:03,559 --> 00:44:08,280
interested happy to talk to you further

1052
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:10,200
and I didn't show much data but happy to

1053
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:12,000
you know show the data and details when

1054
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:14,160
you talk in person yeah thank you very

1055
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,960
much excellent thank you thank you for

1056
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:19,280
the fascinating work Kina but given the

1057
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:22,880
time I think questions will wait until

1058
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:26,040
after the session okay so and we have

1059
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:27,680
our last speaker Elena notos so

1060
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:29,640
introduction as mentioned my name is

1061
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:31,040
Yelena natos I'm an assistant professor

1062
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:33,920
here in the department of electrical

1063
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:35,880
engineering and computer science um and

1064
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:37,680
today I'll be talking to you about the

1065
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:40,319
work done in our group The photonics and

1066
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:42,079
Electronics Research group um on Silicon

1067
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:44,240
photonics I'm really grateful for the

1068
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:46,200
MTL leadership um for giving us the

1069
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:48,880
opportunity to introduce some of this

1070
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:50,400
this work to you so before we get

1071
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,160
started on the work being done by our

1072
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,160
group I thought maybe let's do a show of

1073
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:57,160
hands who here is familiar with silicon

1074
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:57,160
photonics

1075
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:02,119
okay good I see about like half the

1076
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:04,520
hands went up so this is a a good slide

1077
00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:07,240
to show then to start us off um an

1078
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:09,000
introduction to Silicon photonics so the

1079
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:10,960
idea behind silicon photonics is that we

1080
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:14,000
want to repurpose standard seos

1081
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:17,040
fabrication and tools to create uh

1082
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:19,920
chip-based optical devices and systems

1083
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:21,319
so on the bottom uh panel here we have a

1084
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,040
cross-sectional view of a silicon

1085
00:45:21,319 --> 00:45:26,000
photonics platform that we've developed

1086
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:28,559
on the past on the very far left hand

1087
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,880
side you can see a bulk seos transistor

1088
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:31,559
which probably everyone in the room is

1089
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:33,359
pretty familiar with you have the

1090
00:45:31,559 --> 00:45:34,839
Silicon layers the dope silicon the

1091
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:37,640
metal coming down into contact with the

1092
00:45:34,839 --> 00:45:39,240
dope silicon well what we can do for

1093
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:41,240
silicon photonics is we can take all

1094
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:43,400
these standard device layers and

1095
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:46,240
components and we can repurpose them to

1096
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:48,200
create Optics on chip so for example in

1097
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:50,000
the center here we have our silicon

1098
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:51,720
dialectric wave guide that's going to

1099
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,480
look like a rectangle of silicon that's

1100
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:55,440
patterned to create a long thin

1101
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:58,040
rectangle that's going to confine and

1102
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:59,680
guide the light down arches

1103
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:01,400
we can then take that wave guide and you

1104
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:03,480
see here this active device we can

1105
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:06,000
stretch the wave guide out we can dope

1106
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:08,000
regions of uh the side of this wave

1107
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,079
guide and we can place metal that those

1108
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,720
orange bars down into contact with the

1109
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:15,119
dope regions to enable modulation

1110
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:17,079
through electrooptic effects of the

1111
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:18,599
light in our wave guide so we can

1112
00:46:17,079 --> 00:46:20,680
confine the light we can guide the light

1113
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:22,079
we can modulate the light and then we

1114
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:24,400
can create all kinds of different

1115
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:26,040
interesting passive devices maybe we can

1116
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,680
emit the light off the chip we can

1117
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:29,480
create filters

1118
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:31,720
um Splitters

1119
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:34,000
combiners so by creating these silicon

1120
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:36,319
photonics platforms we can take optical

1121
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,240
devices that were once complex and bulky

1122
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:40,520
maybe you know there was an optical

1123
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:42,359
table filled with bulk Optics or Optical

1124
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:44,480
fibers and we can take that entire

1125
00:46:42,359 --> 00:46:47,000
system and we can integrate it onto a

1126
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:48,440
millimeter scale completely flat

1127
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,559
photonic

1128
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:53,559
chip also by taking advantage of wafer

1129
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:55,319
scale fabrication processes you can see

1130
00:46:53,559 --> 00:46:58,280
an example of a photograph of one of

1131
00:46:55,319 --> 00:47:01,680
those Wafers uh fabricated for our group

1132
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:03,160
by um aim photonics and Sunni and Albany

1133
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:05,559
uh by taking advantage of these wafer

1134
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:08,559
scale fabrication processes we can take

1135
00:47:05,559 --> 00:47:11,119
advantage of the high yield enabled by

1136
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:13,880
silicon photonics in addition to um

1137
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:17,480
having lowcost ways to fabricate these

1138
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:20,280
photonic devices and also scaling up the

1139
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:22,720
the production really to seos type of

1140
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:24,559
scales also and I I think that this is a

1141
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:27,040
little bit of a unique functionality

1142
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:28,559
right we can take these um uh by

1143
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:30,200
integrating down onto the chip scale we

1144
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:32,680
can enable new functionality that was

1145
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:35,480
never before possible with bulk Optics

1146
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:37,000
or fiber optics and I'll talk uh to you

1147
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:38,000
about some of these functionalities as

1148
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,559
we keep

1149
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,960
going so this field of silicon photonics

1150
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:46,079
was really driven in the last couple of

1151
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:48,400
decades by this primary motivator of uh

1152
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:49,680
applications in Datacom or Telecom and

1153
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,359
the idea was can we create these

1154
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:55,000
photonic chips that can process light in

1155
00:47:52,359 --> 00:47:57,839
a very energy efficient and high-speed

1156
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:00,280
way but all on the chip

1157
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:02,200
and because of the the real promise that

1158
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:04,559
silicon photonics has had on the Telecom

1159
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:07,599
and Datacom industry there is a lot of

1160
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:09,720
Financial Resources um and Innovation

1161
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:12,839
that happened in our field especially

1162
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:15,280
over I'd say the last five to to 10

1163
00:48:12,839 --> 00:48:17,400
years with a lot of semiconductor um

1164
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:18,760
infrastructure being being brought up

1165
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:21,400
and now we're seeing these silicon

1166
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:23,920
photonic specific foundaries and

1167
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:26,359
platforms that are now standard and

1168
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:28,720
available to everyone in the world and

1169
00:48:26,359 --> 00:48:30,960
that brings us to today we can now start

1170
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:32,480
thinking about can we create silicon

1171
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:35,119
photonic systems that aren't just

1172
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:36,359
limited to processing light on the chip

1173
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:38,559
but can we create chips that are going

1174
00:48:36,359 --> 00:48:40,319
to emit light off of the Chip and

1175
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:42,040
interact with the surroundings and

1176
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:43,280
that's really what our group here at MIT

1177
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:45,960
is focusing

1178
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:47,920
on so in our group we're developing

1179
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:50,119
these novel silicum photonics

1180
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:51,880
fabrication Platforms in collaboration

1181
00:48:50,119 --> 00:48:54,520
with many different foundaries around

1182
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:56,319
the world we then use these platforms to

1183
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:58,160
enable novel devices using first

1184
00:48:56,319 --> 00:49:00,119
principle electromagnetics and device

1185
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:01,880
physics and then we take these devices

1186
00:49:00,119 --> 00:49:05,240
and integrate them up on you know the

1187
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:07,240
kind of 10,000 100,000 uh device scale

1188
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:09,160
up into large scale systems to enable

1189
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:11,240
enable uh new solutions for many

1190
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:12,839
different applications you know just

1191
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:15,240
listing off some of them here we have

1192
00:49:12,839 --> 00:49:17,280
lar sensors AR displays trapped iron

1193
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:18,520
Quantum system biophotonics and Chip

1194
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:22,000
based 3D

1195
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:23,960
printing so for the sake of time here um

1196
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,520
I'll just very quickly talk you through

1197
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:29,160
some of our recent results um in many of

1198
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:31,359
these these spaces so first we can think

1199
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:34,400
about can we create chip scale solutions

1200
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:36,520
for liar sensors if you take a look at a

1201
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:38,280
standard autonomous vehicle you'll see a

1202
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:40,640
large box sitting on the top of the car

1203
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:43,040
that's the car's lar sensor that lar

1204
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:44,440
sensor is sending out light pulses H

1205
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:46,520
that bounce off the surroundings and

1206
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:47,760
come back and then the entire box spins

1207
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:49,440
around to create a full

1208
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:51,480
three-dimensional uh map of the

1209
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:53,839
surroundings of the car this allows you

1210
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:55,880
to have very high resolution sensing but

1211
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:57,319
the limitations are we have a box

1212
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:59,400
sitting on top of the cart that's

1213
00:49:57,319 --> 00:50:03,720
mechanically spinning around right so

1214
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:06,040
this is a a a a um cost prohibitive

1215
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:08,119
solution it's not going to be very

1216
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:10,760
robust over time right if we have a

1217
00:50:08,119 --> 00:50:11,760
mechanical object rotating around and

1218
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:14,559
most importantly it's going to be

1219
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:16,359
limited in the detection range so as a

1220
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:19,200
solution we can enable these silicon

1221
00:50:16,359 --> 00:50:20,720
photonics based liar sensors what that

1222
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:22,680
looks like is we're going to have a

1223
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:24,960
silicon photonic chip that's going to

1224
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:27,200
sit here it's going to emit light off

1225
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,559
the chip we can then use

1226
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,680
these structures called integrated

1227
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:32,680
Optical phas drays that take these light

1228
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:34,680
beams and scan them around non-

1229
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:36,200
mechanically we can then receive the

1230
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:38,839
light back on the chip and do all the

1231
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:40,880
processing on our chip so this is some

1232
00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:42,359
nice work led by my students uh Daniel

1233
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,839
and Ben which you can see in the top

1234
00:50:42,359 --> 00:50:45,960
there recently we showed the first

1235
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:48,079
demonstration of a multi-beam system

1236
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:52,760
that can track multiple targets and once

1237
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:54,680
using the Silicon photonics uh lar

1238
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:57,160
technology additionally we can think

1239
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:59,079
about can we create solutions for for AR

1240
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:01,160
displays so when you think about a

1241
00:50:59,079 --> 00:51:03,280
current AR display what that looks like

1242
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:04,839
is you have um a little micro display

1243
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:06,799
that sits on the side of the head and

1244
00:51:04,839 --> 00:51:08,559
you have a b a bunch of Optics that take

1245
00:51:06,799 --> 00:51:10,920
the information projected by that

1246
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:13,920
display and put it out in front of the

1247
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:16,720
user that's viewing it the limitation

1248
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:18,520
here is that of course I think like uh

1249
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:21,960
pre brought up earlier there's some

1250
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:23,680
social limitations to um walking around

1251
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:25,160
with these little Optics on the side of

1252
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,599
our head so we're not seeing a lot of

1253
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:28,960
adaptation just because of the form fact

1254
00:51:26,599 --> 00:51:30,720
Factor if you look at def the defense

1255
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:33,799
industry they're very interested to have

1256
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:35,280
a lower weight solution for AR displays

1257
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:36,839
because if you're in a high G

1258
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:38,319
environment in a fighter jet and you

1259
00:51:36,839 --> 00:51:39,760
have these Optics sitting on the side of

1260
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:44,480
your head that's going to strain your

1261
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:47,319
neck or maybe you're um a soldier or or

1262
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:48,720
you know a more uh the the more discreet

1263
00:51:47,319 --> 00:51:50,960
side of the Department of Defense and

1264
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:52,880
you want a solution for AR displays

1265
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,760
that's that's not going to be able um to

1266
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:56,599
be

1267
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:59,520
detected so what we we've done is we've

1268
00:51:56,599 --> 00:52:01,079
velop this solution um for AR displays

1269
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:03,160
that consists of a single silicon

1270
00:52:01,079 --> 00:52:04,559
photonic chip that sits in front of your

1271
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:06,559
eye and actually projects three

1272
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:09,680
dimensional holograms for the user to

1273
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:11,319
see that's only uh only requires a

1274
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:13,640
single transparent chip that could be

1275
00:52:11,319 --> 00:52:15,240
integrated in a pair of glasses and it's

1276
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:16,680
actually going to project holographic

1277
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:19,079
information for the

1278
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:20,799
user now to enable this if you were to

1279
00:52:19,079 --> 00:52:22,160
take a standard silicon photonic chip

1280
00:52:20,799 --> 00:52:23,799
and put it in front of your eye you

1281
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:25,200
wouldn't be able to see through it and

1282
00:52:23,799 --> 00:52:28,920
that's because silicon photonic chips

1283
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:30,520
are based on a silic wafer handle so we

1284
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:33,760
had to work with Foundry Partners to

1285
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:35,680
actually develop the first uh 300 mm uh

1286
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:38,520
platform for fabricating visible light

1287
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:41,640
photonics but now on transparent Wafers

1288
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:43,799
this is work L by my former student

1289
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:46,119
mea and then if we think of these

1290
00:52:43,799 --> 00:52:47,839
applications where we're using visible

1291
00:52:46,119 --> 00:52:51,240
light as opposed to infrared light we

1292
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:53,040
need to also develop new devices so here

1293
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:55,520
uh we developed these liquor

1294
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:57,520
crystal-based integrated modulators uh

1295
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:59,400
that for the first time enable um

1296
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:02,599
visible light modulation using liquor

1297
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:05,160
Crystal on chip and this enables us to

1298
00:53:02,599 --> 00:53:07,079
take these uh modulators and Shrink them

1299
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:08,920
down to orders of magnitude compared to

1300
00:53:07,079 --> 00:53:11,119
what you would normally use for visible

1301
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:13,839
light integrated uh modulators again

1302
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:16,680
work led by Mila and um Andre is

1303
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:16,680
actually sitting in the back

1304
00:53:16,799 --> 00:53:21,079
here also we can think about using

1305
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:23,280
silicon photonics and emitting light off

1306
00:53:21,079 --> 00:53:25,640
the chip to revolutionize how we think

1307
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:27,079
about 3D printers so if you look at a

1308
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:28,440
standard 3D printer

1309
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:31,040
what that's going to look like is a

1310
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:32,799
system a big box that sits in your lab

1311
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:35,240
that's going to plop out little balls of

1312
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:37,040
plastic and create a 3D object if you go

1313
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:39,160
to higher resolution 3D printers they're

1314
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:41,119
laser based and again what that looks

1315
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:43,559
like is a box that sits in your lab but

1316
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:46,799
now that scans mechanically scans laser

1317
00:53:43,559 --> 00:53:48,920
beams around to cure 3D objects well

1318
00:53:46,799 --> 00:53:50,839
what we're proposing here and what uh we

1319
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:52,799
recently showed as a first step towards

1320
00:53:50,839 --> 00:53:54,880
this is can we take that entire 3D

1321
00:53:52,799 --> 00:53:57,680
printer and now integrate it onto a

1322
00:53:54,880 --> 00:54:01,240
photonic chip that's going to project

1323
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:04,240
visible holographic images into a vat of

1324
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:07,520
photocurable resin to enable a portable

1325
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:09,839
completely um different form factor uh

1326
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:11,440
chip scale solution for 3D printers I

1327
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:13,280
think that this is the first proposal of

1328
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:16,280
actually using a chip to do 3D printing

1329
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:18,760
we're pretty excited to see where this

1330
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:20,680
goes also we can use silicon photonics

1331
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:22,520
to enable different biophotonic

1332
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:24,480
solutions so we can have a chip that

1333
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:26,400
emits light and focuses light above the

1334
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:27,880
chip and then actually traps and

1335
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:30,680
manipulates different types of

1336
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:34,000
biological particles so here we're using

1337
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:36,640
uh this chip to manipulate cancer cells

1338
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,960
um this is the first uh demonstration of

1339
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:42,240
a biological experiment using a single

1340
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:44,440
beam integrated Optical tweezer a work

1341
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:46,200
Le by my students tell with help from

1342
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:48,799
Sabrina and

1343
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:51,599
mea and then if we think about different

1344
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:54,319
biological applications um maybe some

1345
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:55,640
type of sensors or probes into the body

1346
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:57,160
we can't have chips that are just going

1347
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:59,280
to sit on top top of the body we need

1348
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:01,359
something that's going to be more um

1349
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:03,119
integrated with the body so again we

1350
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:06,240
worked in collaboration with our Foundry

1351
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:08,839
Partners to demonstrate the first uh 300

1352
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:11,760
mimet flexible silicon photonics

1353
00:55:08,839 --> 00:55:14,680
platform work L by Mila with help from

1354
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:16,640
Andre and Ashton and then finally we can

1355
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:18,359
also create chips that emit light off

1356
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:21,559
the chip to interface with different

1357
00:55:18,359 --> 00:55:23,039
types of quantum bits cubits and our

1358
00:55:21,559 --> 00:55:26,440
Cubit of choice at the moment is the

1359
00:55:23,039 --> 00:55:28,920
trapped ion um ions need different

1360
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:31,799
Optical uh wavelengths and polarizations

1361
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:34,440
to enable State preparation Cooling

1362
00:55:31,799 --> 00:55:35,839
excitation and readout uh so here we're

1363
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:38,079
working in collaboration with Lincoln

1364
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:39,720
lab to enable integrated photonic chips

1365
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:42,400
that emit light off the chips to

1366
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:45,720
interface with these ions to create a

1367
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:47,359
scalable and stable way uh to move these

1368
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:49,799
trapped ion quantum computers from the

1369
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:52,000
lab to more large scale systems and

1370
00:55:49,799 --> 00:55:53,559
specifically we demonstrated the first

1371
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,319
um integrated photonic devices that

1372
00:55:53,559 --> 00:55:58,480
enable polarization diversity down at

1373
00:55:56,319 --> 00:56:00,599
visible wavelengths and then use those

1374
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:02,960
devices to show polarization gradient

1375
00:56:00,599 --> 00:56:05,319
cooling uh to four times below the

1376
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:07,319
Doppler limit using an integrated fonic

1377
00:56:05,319 --> 00:56:09,520
system for the first time this is work L

1378
00:56:07,319 --> 00:56:12,240
by Sabrina also in the back here with

1379
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:14,559
help from Ashton tal and

1380
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:16,720
mitaa so I hope this gives you a flavor

1381
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:18,440
for the type of work that our group does

1382
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:21,520
and different directions that the field

1383
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:23,039
of silicum photonics can go um I could

1384
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:24,960
never talk about our work without giving

1385
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:27,240
a huge shout out to my wonderful

1386
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:29,359
students uh if you have any questions

1387
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:30,839
you're very welcome to go talk to them

1388
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:33,240
um you'll notice we're all wearing our

1389
00:56:30,839 --> 00:56:34,920
perg polos if you um look at the

1390
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:36,880
students sitting back there they're all

1391
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:38,720
wearing the red poos too so during

1392
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:40,319
dinner if you can seek them out and ask

1393
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:42,000
them some questions and of course we'll

1394
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:45,039
give a shout out to our collaborators as

1395
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,039
well thank

1396
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:56,440
you thank you fascinating so do we have

1397
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:56,440
a quick question for

1398
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:07,039
yes for the work on other topics thein

1399
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:09,039
consider any interfacing of Optics and

1400
00:57:07,039 --> 00:57:11,160
oh thank you for the talk and there was

1401
00:57:09,039 --> 00:57:13,280
a few themes about brain and Optics and

1402
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:15,599
so with the ways that you're advancing

1403
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:17,440
uh photonic circuits any thoughts about

1404
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:19,680
um using it in some of the ways have

1405
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:21,200
been discussed for brain interfaces yeah

1406
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:23,200
that's a great question actually I think

1407
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:25,920
if the IT team can pull back up the

1408
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:26,920
slide we can pop that back up wonderful

1409
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:28,960
thank you

1410
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:30,640
um so yeah one of the the topics that we

1411
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:32,720
are looking at is actually creating

1412
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:35,119
these Optical chips that can trap and

1413
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:37,640
manipulate cancer cells that's the work

1414
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:40,720
um there on the bottom uh second from

1415
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:42,720
the left that was showing a chip that

1416
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:44,880
could actually sit outside of the body

1417
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:47,799
and then probe into the body to actually

1418
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:49,520
do some manipulation so for this initial

1419
00:57:47,799 --> 00:57:53,880
demonstration we were just um

1420
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:55,839
manipulating cells in the lab uh not in

1421
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:57,359
Vivo but there's actually some recent

1422
00:57:55,839 --> 00:58:00,039
work where people were showing this kind

1423
00:57:57,359 --> 00:58:03,359
of system with bulk Optics um doing

1424
00:58:00,039 --> 00:58:05,640
invivo manipulation of cells in a a

1425
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:07,480
mouse model um so I think it would be

1426
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:09,079
really exciting to explore some of that

1427
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:10,760
and I think U some of the work that

1428
00:58:09,079 --> 00:58:13,039
we're we're working on with the flexible

1429
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:15,400
Wafers I feel like if you're really

1430
00:58:13,039 --> 00:58:16,520
wanting to explore uh interfacing with

1431
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:18,920
the body you need to think about the

1432
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:21,240
form factor for these types of chips as

1433
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:23,960
well another thing I'll mention is that

1434
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:25,880
the majority of um silicon photonics

1435
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:27,760
platforms really because of the Telecom

1436
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:30,039
data com initial applications they were

1437
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:32,039
really focused on infr wavelengths so

1438
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:35,319
for a lot of these bio applications were

1439
00:58:32,039 --> 00:58:36,920
shifting to visible light or up into mid

1440
00:58:35,319 --> 00:58:39,200
infrared like cichon was mentioning

1441
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:41,160
earlier um and that requires a lot of

1442
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:43,000
this type of platform development so I

1443
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:44,920
didn't even have a chance to pop it up

1444
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:48,359
here but we're working in collaboration

1445
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:50,559
with uh Sunni poly that's um houses a

1446
00:58:48,359 --> 00:58:52,839
photonics if you're familiar with that

1447
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:54,720
um to actually develop a platform that

1448
00:58:52,839 --> 00:58:56,720
pushes down into visible wavelengths and

1449
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:58,880
that's work that Andre and Henry are

1450
00:58:56,720 --> 00:59:00,760
really um pushing forward we're going to

1451
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:01,960
be putting out a really nice big paper

1452
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:05,799
on that soon

1453
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:09,160
too thanks thank you so let's thank

1454
00:59:05,799 --> 00:59:11,799
Elena again and all our four Future

1455
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:14,359
Leaders for sharing their extraordinary

1456
00:59:11,799 --> 00:59:16,720
research with us so thanks a lot for

1457
00:59:14,359 --> 00:59:19,640
your participation we are 20 minutes

1458
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:21,960
past the schedule but this was very

1459
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:21,960
interesting
