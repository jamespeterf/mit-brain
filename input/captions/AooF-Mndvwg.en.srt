1
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,719
I have the best honor of the day to

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,440
introduce our our first Speaker uh

3
00:00:08,719 --> 00:00:13,839
Professor varasi I'll say Professor

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,760
varasi is one of those cases in

5
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:21,240
which I really urge you to keep an open

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:25,240
mind he has an impressive resume an

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:27,439
impressive book of past

8
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:30,519
accomplishments but what you'll see here

9
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:33,560
today is opportunity to do new things in

10
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:33,560
the future Professor

11
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,350
[Music]

12
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,399
ver all right thank you so much uh can

13
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:53,600
you all hear me good morning everyone

14
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:56,719
and uh it's a honor to be here uh I'm uh

15
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:00,039
uh I love Japan it's great to come back

16
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:03,239
and uh I hope to uh for some good

17
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:04,760
collaborations and uh connections today

18
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:06,799
uh so let me tell you what I do in my

19
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,080
lab my lab uh we work on Advanced

20
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,920
Materials and interfaces apply to a

21
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:14,080
whole range of different uh Industries

22
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,119
because interfaces are ubiquitous and

23
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,240
and they are everywhere uh we've been

24
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:20,840
able fortunate to work across the energy

25
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,320
water biomedical and Agriculture and

26
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,520
other uh other areas so this is a very

27
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,840
busy slide but shows uh the things that

28
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:32,360
I've dabbled in in my career starting

29
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:36,439
from uh power plants all the way to um

30
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:39,240
uh energy industry to biomed and uh

31
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:41,159
Aviation as well as Agriculture and a

32
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,119
lot of my works today uh these days have

33
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,920
been focused on uh sort of

34
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:48,719
decarbonization to uh to

35
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,399
healthcare um so this kind of gives you

36
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:56,000
uh an idea of the uh areas of work that

37
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:58,439
go in my lab uh starting from uh energy

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
all the way to uh biomedical work and

39
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:04,079
along the way we use our expert in

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,439
materialss uh manufacturing and scale up

41
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:09,800
and and so

42
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:11,920
on um uh so again a busy slide with uh

43
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,959
with a lot of these areas and I uh am

44
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,560
happy to interact with you after my talk

45
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:18,879
I'm not going to be able to go through

46
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:21,800
all of these today but we'll give you uh

47
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,640
sort of a uh teaser on on some of the

48
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,480
work that has been done and some of the

49
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,720
things that we are working on uh so

50
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,720
let's get started with thinking about uh

51
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,519
the CO2 problem you know it is a

52
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,360
gigascale problem right there is

53
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:37,920
gigatons of CO2 uh that we have put into

54
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,959
the atmosphere since we discovered fire

55
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,680
we've been putting CO2 into the into the

56
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:44,599
atmosphere and that's causing problems

57
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,800
and we need to be able to solve this but

58
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:52,080
solve it by actually creating some value

59
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:54,680
to the uh to at the end and so if we

60
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,800
look at uh where we are uh to where we

61
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:00,280
should be we should be removing gigatons

62
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,400
of CO2 that means uh it's a big cap aex

63
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,599
as well as an Opex problem and our

64
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:08,120
efforts have been looking at how to sort

65
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:09,440
of overcome both of these challenges on

66
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,480
the other side of the story is

67
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,599
Renewables for Renewables to become uh

68
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,879
effective you need storage and you need

69
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:18,720
storage that is safe because you need to

70
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:21,799
be able to put gigawatt hours of storage

71
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:26,360
out there and to be able to do that we

72
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:28,280
need something that um is both uh safe

73
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,360
sustainable and can be manufactured

74
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:33,400
anywhere and and I'll talk about about

75
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,480
some inventions in non-lithium and non-

76
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,439
Cobalt and nonflammable batteries that

77
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:40,120
we are actually commercializing through

78
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:43,640
a company of mine called alsim

79
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:46,120
Energy and uh so uh again kind of

80
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:48,040
straddling this going from capture to

81
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,840
Circular e economy to some

82
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,319
biomanufacturing if I'm able to get

83
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:55,879
there we'll discuss some uh things that

84
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:57,599
we have done in this space um uh in the

85
00:03:55,879 --> 00:04:00,400
biomedical space we've been working on

86
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:02,640
bio interfaces to delivery to enhancing

87
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,680
biom manufacturing and I'll highlight

88
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,640
two projects uh one that's kind of

89
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,040
completed uh working with the Gates

90
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,879
Foundation we've been able to come up

91
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,680
with new ways to inject High

92
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:15,319
concentration biologics these are

93
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,720
sometimes as viscous as thousand times

94
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:19,799
the viscosity of water and we we've been

95
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,720
able to show that we can inject them

96
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:24,919
through a regular syringe needle kind of

97
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:27,120
a system and so uh this is a huge Market

98
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:31,440
apart from vaccines you're looking at

99
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:34,800
all kinds of uh all kinds of uh um areas

100
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:37,800
uh starting from uh uh cancer to to

101
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,479
cardiovascular to others where uh where

102
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,080
biologics are becoming very important

103
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:44,759
and I I know Stacy is going to talk a

104
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:46,160
lot about that in the next uh talk um

105
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:48,120
but I think what we have done here is

106
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,919
really democratize access to healthcare

107
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:53,960
by creating a platform where we can uh

108
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:56,960
do this and uh give a lot of freedom to

109
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,479
drug formulators and so on uh another

110
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,880
project that you know currently going on

111
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:04,039
in the lab is looking at early detection

112
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,280
of ovarian cancer um ovarian cancer is a

113
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:08,240
killer Disease by the time it's you know

114
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:11,320
one it's detected you're already stage

115
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,479
three and can cause really a big impact

116
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:17,039
you know essentially there is you know

117
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:19,160
uh it's pretty much um a very difficult

118
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,400
decision at that point by the time it's

119
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,840
detected so what we are trying to do

120
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,520
here is based on some of the work from

121
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,240
our amazing collaborators who have found

122
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:31,600
that ovarian cancer originates in uh in

123
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,520
the pH opan tubes and not the ovaries we

124
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,720
looking at ways to do early detection so

125
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,160
that there could be opportunistic uh

126
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,199
surgeries that could remove of the

127
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,880
Fallopian tubes and thereby take the

128
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:44,080
risk of cancer to zero and all of this

129
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:46,120
involves some very interesting uh

130
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,319
interdisciplinary research and in my

131
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,360
group we do a lot of interdisciplinary

132
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:52,800
work we've been fortunate to learn a lot

133
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:55,360
of new things um because we work at the

134
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,440
interfaces of matter and uh so that

135
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,680
meant you know working on thermal fluids

136
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,400
to electrochemistry to soft matter

137
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,240
matter and then always think about

138
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,120
Manufacturing in scale so we can take

139
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,759
our ideas to to Market so this kind of

140
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,880
gives you a road map of how I think

141
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,840
about research in my lab where we you

142
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:14,000
know establish a business case first

143
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,880
talking to people like you and then sort

144
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,160
of go bring in our expertise and create

145
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:20,720
a focused R&D effort in the in at my lab

146
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,680
and then sort of that leads to some

147
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,240
pilot scale work and all the way to

148
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,520
commercialization and so uh over the

149
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,759
past decade we've been able to

150
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,080
commercialize a number of Technologies

151
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,639
uh starting from a company called liquid

152
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,400
Glide where we able to uh create a

153
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,599
hypers slippery surface to which nothing

154
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:42,319
sticks and we've been able to take that

155
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:44,520
sort of to uh to Market through uh some

156
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,919
consumer packaging work as well as some

157
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,360
biomedical work now and then uh we have

158
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:50,360
infinite cooling where we are able to

159
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,759
capture the plumes and create a lot of

160
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:55,639
value to power data centers and other

161
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:58,199
cooling areas and uh my co-founder and

162
00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:00,919
former student Maher damak is here who

163
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:04,280
uh will be talking about this uh also uh

164
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:07,080
later this today uh Alim energy is this

165
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:10,560
non-lithium nonflammable inherently

166
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:13,560
non-flammable Battery Technology for uh

167
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,080
for energy storage uh and then if I have

168
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,039
time I'll get to axen where we are

169
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:20,000
reducing they amount a pesticide spread

170
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,599
and creating value to both Farms as well

171
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,039
as the chemical companies to do better

172
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,080
formulations of their pesticides and so

173
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:28,240
on and coflow medical was what I just

174
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,240
discussed which was the uh High

175
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,960
concentration biologics injectability

176
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:36,960
design uh so I'll start off by looking

177
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:39,319
at efficiency improvements and then talk

178
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,000
about decarbonization and and other

179
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:45,000
topics so I started off looking at the

180
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,199
energy area looking at U you know the

181
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,479
mundane steam cycle which has been there

182
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,919
for now more than what 100 years to

183
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:55,240
really convert uh you know a chemical

184
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,879
energy into electricity by using a cycle

185
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,639
which we all know very well you know

186
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,360
take water boil it from Steam uh Steam

187
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:03,240
does work on a turbine and then you

188
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,000
condense it back and come back uh and

189
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,800
complete the cycle but there are a

190
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,159
number of big efficiency problems

191
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,400
whether it's on the turbine interfaces

192
00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:13,960
or heat exchanger interfaces which is in

193
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:16,199
a condenser a boiler and uh we have we

194
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:19,360
have uh sort of solved these problems by

195
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:20,919
designing uh interesting surfaces uh in

196
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,479
this case you know we've been able to

197
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:26,479
make surfaces that can bounce off liquid

198
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:29,039
thereby prevent formation of films on uh

199
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:32,320
on these turbine blades and that has led

200
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:34,919
to significant efficiency gains uh we

201
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,279
have taken these ideas to other topics

202
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:40,080
uh here we've shown how we can do

203
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:42,360
condensation or understand condensation

204
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,240
at a micro scale or freezing at micro

205
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:48,160
scale and then develop surfaces that can

206
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:50,920
even sort of uh be slippery to something

207
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,360
as sticky as a crude oil right in this

208
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:55,880
case uh or other kinds of things and

209
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,760
I'll I'll talk more uh in detail about

210
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:00,480
this uh so here are some other examples

211
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:03,279
where we've shown the that we can uh

212
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,560
improve or change the surfaces to shed

213
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:08,000
liquids as droplets while condensing

214
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:10,560
them on surfaces so you prevent sort of

215
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,720
these films that are forming uh and

216
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,399
reduce uh heat transfer and thereby

217
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:18,600
increase the heat transfer efficiency

218
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:21,079
you can make filters that are uh sort of

219
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:24,160
um preferentially wetting to one phase

220
00:09:21,079 --> 00:09:27,600
in this case oil uh as you can see here

221
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,880
and then uh water basically um doesn't

222
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,440
pass through so you can look at it for

223
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:34,600
oil water separations here we made some

224
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,880
photo thermal materials that allow us to

225
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,720
convert the incident light into Ambi

226
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,720
into a temperature increase on the

227
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:45,760
surface thereby using the sunlight to

228
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:49,720
you know uh to effectively deise a

229
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:52,399
surface so I I sort of focus on on one

230
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:56,079
aspect of these surfaces which is the

231
00:09:52,399 --> 00:10:00,040
ability to kind of uh uh sort of shed

232
00:09:56,079 --> 00:10:01,480
extremely viscous uh materials uh we you

233
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,120
know we are all surrounded by viscous

234
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,959
fluids which include you know if you

235
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,040
have um in the morning you would have

236
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,079
brush your teeth you would use a

237
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:11,320
toothpaste imagine all the toothpaste

238
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:13,720
that's left behind to uh to maybe uh

239
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:16,279
condiments to even in healthcare where

240
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:18,920
you have uh catheters and others which

241
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:21,920
uh basically um cause blood clots and

242
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:24,680
things like that so this technology the

243
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,880
idea was uh seems simple but you know

244
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:30,839
seemingly seemingly simple but has a lot

245
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:33,079
of interesting uh uh uh Dimensions to it

246
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:35,560
uh so we have a what we do is we Infuse

247
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:38,160
liquids into a porous or into a textured

248
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:40,480
surface and uh the liquid is held by

249
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,760
capillary and other kinds of forces

250
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,000
intermolecular forces and that allows us

251
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:48,240
to create highly slippery surfaces for a

252
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,839
variety of liquids uh so we use uh

253
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,079
thermodynamic platforms to really uh

254
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:55,160
come up with uh the design of our

255
00:10:53,079 --> 00:10:57,079
materials but it fundamentally sort of

256
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:59,560
changes the Paradigm on when you think

257
00:10:57,079 --> 00:11:01,519
about Coatings and surfaces you don't

258
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:03,920
have to stick with a solid film you have

259
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:07,200
now a composite of a solid and a liquid

260
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:10,639
that gives you amazing new properties

261
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,320
right so if we take uh for example uh

262
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:14,880
packaging packaging there's a

263
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,360
significant amount of wastage uh and

264
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:20,360
because of that way so a there's wastage

265
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,800
uh so you put energy into this to make

266
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:25,200
uh these product and a lot of that

267
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:26,560
product is left behind but also you have

268
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,920
uh to use a lot if you're going to

269
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,320
recycle it and if you take take some of

270
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,800
these p packaging and you throw it in a

271
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,680
recyclable bin it doesn't mean that it

272
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,760
it will get recycled because of the

273
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,639
leftover product you had to clean it out

274
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:42,240
and that is leads to a significant sort

275
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:43,880
of a water consumption as well so when

276
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,480
we developed this technology and we went

277
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:48,880
to the Press you know the hasn't been

278
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,320
guilty of assault on a ketchup bottle

279
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:54,040
but has technology finally caught up

280
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:58,600
with ketchup look at that thing slide

281
00:11:54,040 --> 00:12:01,839
amazing oh my God our long National

282
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:04,160
nightmare is over mechanical engineering

283
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,600
students at MIT have come up with a

284
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,560
super slippery coating that makes

285
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,680
anything from ketchup to mayonnaise

286
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:14,120
practically leap out of a bottle coated

287
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:16,600
with a stuff they call it liquid Glide

288
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,839
even Tony Soprano would be beholden to

289
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,600
these

290
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:23,519
students look how annoyed Tony gets at

291
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:26,240
the dreaded ketchup clog and if col us

292
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,240
that's talking

293
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:34,480
homicide liquid Glide let it slide no

294
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:38,600
more bangging with shoes guess we all

295
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:40,120
been in that in that space uh and so uh

296
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,600
you know actually all of this started

297
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,240
when my wife was trying to get honey out

298
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,880
of a bottle and she said why don't you

299
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:47,839
solve this problem and uh so you know

300
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:50,040
there's always we are always looking for

301
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,440
problems to solve and uh it always

302
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:54,480
motivates us to come up with solutions

303
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,959
that may not be easily you know you

304
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,839
can't think of that and that's kind of

305
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:59,839
why these forums are very important

306
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,920
where we can learn what are some of your

307
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:05,320
key challenges right uh so this stuff we

308
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:08,480
then took it to apply to all kinds of uh

309
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:11,000
products um and this is peanut butter

310
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,079
you know which is very sticky and uh

311
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,079
we've been able to make like a uh

312
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:18,240
squeeze bottle for this but we've taken

313
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:20,800
this and you know it took some years to

314
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,279
take that idea and then think about how

315
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,000
do you scale how do you work with a

316
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:25,600
customer but at the end of the day we

317
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,480
have been able to commercialize it with

318
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:31,560
Colgate uh to make the world's first

319
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:34,199
zero waste and also fully recyclable uh

320
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,560
toothpaste packaging right uh and this

321
00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:38,360
could be applied to a whole range of

322
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:41,160
things we uh well we got a good uh press

323
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:43,440
from Trevor NOA here uh ended up on

324
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,880
colgate's annual shareholder report but

325
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,760
we are moving this to other products

326
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:52,360
such as consumer package such as uh um

327
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:55,759
Cosmetics or skincare products uh as

328
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:57,720
well as to uh to other kinds of things

329
00:13:55,759 --> 00:14:01,720
uh which inspires new kind of packaging

330
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:03,800
this is you know um cream cheese and

331
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:07,320
typically it's in a jar it's in a tub

332
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:09,000
and we have to use some sort of a uh um

333
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,680
you know you had to use a knife and a

334
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,920
fork and it's can be sometimes annoying

335
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,800
but you can you know directly uh put it

336
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:19,079
onto onto your bagel here so it's kind

337
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:22,240
of transforming uh packaging uh and when

338
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:24,880
you think about um uh you know postco

339
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,240
world you know if you have large tubs

340
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,720
and you're a cosmetic and you're putting

341
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,440
your hands in it it can be very icky or

342
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:34,880
very sanitary so we can do this uh

343
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,560
directly into a into a dispensable uh

344
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,079
kind of a bottle and and things like

345
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:42,160
that so overall you know you can get rid

346
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:43,920
of all kinds of uh uh clutter in

347
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:47,560
packaging which leads to a lot of

348
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,880
landfills and and down down side effects

349
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,959
and you can actually make very

350
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:53,360
minimalistic and very elegant uh

351
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:55,519
packaging uh we have taken this to

352
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,440
looking at things like U manufacturing

353
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:00,320
of the same products and improve yield

354
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,000
losses um and applied this to uh Even

355
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,160
Flow batteries where if you want to

356
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,320
increase the capacity uh your flow

357
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,800
battery electrodes get very very wiscus

358
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,560
and they don't uh they can't actually

359
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,880
flow anymore and uh here is an example

360
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:15,959
where we able to using such surfaces

361
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,320
create some interesting flow battery

362
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:20,759
kind of uh

363
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,160
configurations yeah one can use these to

364
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:24,800
prevent ice buildup uh and you know the

365
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,759
applications are endless you can prevent

366
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,600
for example fowling whether it's

367
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:30,720
biofouling or whether it is uh scaling

368
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,120
and so

369
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:36,199
on uh we have also taken this to

370
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:39,000
biomedical products here is a catheter

371
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:40,560
where we can prevent uh formation of uh

372
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,839
blood clots and be

373
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,079
anti-thrombotic uh we have also taken

374
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:48,000
this to space stations where we can uh

375
00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:50,920
prevent bofilm formation uh and this is

376
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,600
actually a uh the astronaut trying this

377
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:56,399
out in the space station showing that we

378
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:59,839
can actually prevent biofilms and redu

379
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:02,759
and create strong antimicrobial kind of

380
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:04,600
uh surfaces and that allows for

381
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:06,399
improving astronaut Health like you

382
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:09,199
don't want them to get sick or you know

383
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:11,120
if you have any parts that can actually

384
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:13,600
uh lead to failures because of biofilm

385
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,360
formation in space you know you're not

386
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,800
you don't have a Walmart next door to go

387
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,440
and pick up a extra part so uh these

388
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:22,519
kind of surfaces become very very

389
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:25,920
important uh to to to maintain both

390
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:28,480
equipment as well as to uh to to ensure

391
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:31,480
astronaut health and so on uh another

392
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:35,120
application that we have uh that we have

393
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:38,880
uh developed here is uh applying this to

394
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,560
ostomy patients so if your um an ostomy

395
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,440
patient has you know they basically

396
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,319
colon or things are taken out so you

397
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:47,000
have to use a bag and sometimes you know

398
00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:48,959
uh when the stool comes out it can push

399
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,120
on the bag and can everything come out

400
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:53,800
and essentially a lot of the osty

401
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,839
patients uh it's a very it completely

402
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:58,519
affects their lifestyle and um you know

403
00:16:56,839 --> 00:16:59,560
it it can put it can take people into

404
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:01,959
depression

405
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:04,280
so what we have done here is make a new

406
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:06,439
product which is a coating that we can

407
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,679
we or or a product that put we put into

408
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:10,120
osty bag and when you rub it you create

409
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:12,319
this coating and when the stool comes

410
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:14,439
out it can easily fall in and therefore

411
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,959
you don't have those kinds of problems

412
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:19,760
and it's really having a great uh impact

413
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,919
on uh on a lot of the folks are using it

414
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:25,480
and they uh and I'm you know I always

415
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:27,280
feel very uh honored to see uh some very

416
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,760
positive feedback from all of them

417
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:33,400
saying that this has been a lifechanger

418
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:36,120
uh uh so you know we can uh we we we are

419
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,679
imbuing this with antibiotics we are uh

420
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:42,280
and trying to solve a number of other

421
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:44,039
other problems um I um uh so I'll switch

422
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,880
gears and talk about some uh water

423
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:47,679
capture work which actually Mahir is

424
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:51,720
going to go through but what we have

425
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:53,400
done here is taken um U the water that

426
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,720
comes out of this cooling towers as

427
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,400
plumes and we are able to capture this

428
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,440
so I will I will leave it to my ha to

429
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:02,679
discuss this because this is a a very

430
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,960
very important uh kind of a uh

431
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:07,760
application because cooling is becoming

432
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,520
a huge bottleneck for many Industries

433
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:13,159
whether it's power plants or data

434
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:14,480
centers uh or uh HVAC and other things

435
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:16,720
and we have some very innovative

436
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,919
solutions that are at scale have been

437
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:22,960
deployed now and uh and Mah will discuss

438
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:25,880
those uh as as he comes up in in couple

439
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,919
of talks from now uh we have taken some

440
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:30,200
of the ideas which we developed with

441
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,919
infinite Cooling using electrostatics

442
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:34,799
and looked at how we can prevent for

443
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:38,080
example dust formation on panels solar

444
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:41,039
is is expanding uh a photo takes are

445
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:43,960
growing rapidly but a big uh show

446
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:46,480
stopper could become formation of dust

447
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:49,520
something as mous dust accumulating on

448
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,799
these panels leads to a big efficiency

449
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,120
loss if you don't clean the panels uh

450
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:56,280
within a week you could be losing a

451
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,559
percent or a 2% and then um you know

452
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,159
sometimes when you have a dust storm

453
00:18:57,559 --> 00:19:01,080
like if you're in a desert which is the

454
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:04,960
ideal place to put the panels you can

455
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:06,919
lose almost 30% of your uh Power uh so

456
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,400
here you know what we have seen in the

457
00:19:06,919 --> 00:19:11,440
lab we sort of recreated that problem

458
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:14,039
right where you you have a dust of

459
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:16,080
course you you're blacking out the panel

460
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:17,919
and uh uh the waste that are cleaned

461
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,440
today are using water which has to be

462
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:22,840
demineralized and very clean and it's a

463
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:24,440
huge Opex cost uh and you're in the

464
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,880
middle of a desert where you need to get

465
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:29,240
such clean water right and then uh if

466
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,200
you go to dry scrubbing you scratch the

467
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:34,559
surfaces and that say leads to

468
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,360
irreversible damage so uh this is you

469
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:39,000
know if you don't solve this it's a big

470
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:40,679
a big sustainability issue for solar uh

471
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
and so our goal has been to create

472
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:45,280
waterless ways or contactless ways to do

473
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,679
this and as we were experimenting in the

474
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,600
lab trying to use some charge effects we

475
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:52,200
found some interesting new phenomena

476
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,600
where uh we found that by electrostatic

477
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,679
induction we were able to get the dust

478
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:59,280
particles to sort of repel off of the

479
00:19:56,679 --> 00:20:01,039
surfaces and as we dug more into it we

480
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,640
found that you know all these particles

481
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:05,840
made out of some level of silica and

482
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:08,520
that able to absorb a little bit of uh

483
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:11,039
uh water films and that allows us to

484
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:14,200
then use electromagnetic induction to

485
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:16,280
actually um um repel to charge the

486
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:18,799
particles as the land on the surfaces

487
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:20,520
and can be removed so we have shown that

488
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:23,039
you know we've taken a made a prototype

489
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:24,600
where we can uh you know put it on a

490
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:27,080
robotic arm and sort of move things

491
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,720
around and take uh the dust off of these

492
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:31,559
surfaces so we are looking at scaling

493
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,320
this technology and then uh really

494
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:35,880
implementing this so that you know the

495
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:39,480
water footprint of solar as well as

496
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,480
other Opex cost could be

497
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:47,080
reduced so let me jump into my next

498
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:49,960
topic which is my recent passion which

499
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:54,919
is to solve sort of the carbon uh CO2

500
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:57,720
problem and as I mentioned um this is a

501
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:59,880
problem of scale really because uh you

502
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:03,240
know you need to be removing gigatons of

503
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:05,520
CO2 and the way to do this is of course

504
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,200
taking care of Point sources taking care

505
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,440
of also the atmosphere because there's a

506
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,799
lot of CO2 out in the atmosphere so

507
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:14,120
we've been looking at both Dak and dock

508
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:16,520
uh systems which I'll discuss today and

509
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:18,120
then uh you know also valorizing that

510
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:21,159
CO2 so that at the end of the day there

511
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:23,400
is a useful product and so if you take

512
00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:25,000
the CO2 emissions a lot of this you know

513
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:28,120
of course it's in the ambient but it's

514
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:31,400
also uh partitions into the oceans

515
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:33,240
oceans take up about 30% of the CO2 it's

516
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:36,400
the biggest contactor there is with the

517
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:39,039
atmosphere right and so what we have

518
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:41,480
here is as the oceans take up the CO2

519
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:44,480
you have uh essentially the pH of the

520
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:46,919
oceans oceans are acidifying and the pH

521
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,200
is decreasing as you can see and even a

522
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:51,799
small change there it may not seem like

523
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:54,240
oh I'm going from 8.5 to 8.1 but that's

524
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:56,400
huge because this is a logarithmic scale

525
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,240
and this is leading to unwanted effects

526
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,720
for example corals are getting affected

527
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,559
or marine life is getting affected and

528
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,720
then we have hard to uh hard to

529
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:06,760
decarbonize Industries such as Aviation

530
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,159
or shipping and others so how are we

531
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:11,799
going to do this and do this fast and do

532
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:14,039
this in a way that we can have an good

533
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:15,320
economics uh as well with it so those

534
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:18,039
are the kind of problems you're trying

535
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:20,200
to address and this is a simple example

536
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:22,039
of shipping a runof-the-mill ship like

537
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:25,159
50 megawatt kind of engine could be

538
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:28,240
emitting as high as 500 or 600 tons of

539
00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:29,880
CO2 per day right and so we and there's

540
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,080
IM more timeline here of reducing

541
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:34,200
emissions by 50% so you're looking at

542
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,559
new ways where you could retrofit onto

543
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,760
the ship's exhaust and directly do the

544
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:40,559
capture and in this process we've been

545
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:42,559
thinking about integration and

546
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:45,360
integrated approaches if you take

547
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:46,880
traditional ccus you're taking capture

548
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:50,520
and when when you're doing capture you

549
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:52,320
know uh the capture is not uh uh is is

550
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:55,279
thermodynamically favorable because you

551
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:57,240
have sorbents that can absorb CO2 but

552
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:59,679
then the extraction of CO2 from the

553
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:02,520
sorbent is costly and then after that

554
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:04,799
you know conversion can be a lot more

555
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:07,200
expensive both in terms of capex and

556
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:09,480
Opex so what we've been doing in my lab

557
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:13,919
is uh to really integrate processes so

558
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:16,840
that we can go directly from capture to

559
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:19,480
conversion and uh like I said we work

560
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:21,760
with uh no matter what the source is uh

561
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:23,559
we we've done work with Point sources

562
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:26,320
where you have a higher concentration so

563
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:28,520
easier to separate the CO2 two oceans

564
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,200
where the concentration is maybe 4%

565
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:33,000
similar to what happens at a gas turbine

566
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:35,640
exhaust to air which is 400 PPM 100

567
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,840
times less than uh that and then upcycle

568
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:41,559
it and create uh value products such as

569
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,360
fuels or um other chemicals uh and and

570
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:45,440
so

571
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:48,640
on um so I'll highlight few efforts that

572
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:52,279
are going on here we uh are taking uh

573
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:55,440
some of the uh our ways to capture these

574
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:58,600
uh is using uh sort of the goal is to

575
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:01,559
reduce capex so using again the the play

576
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:04,720
on surface area and improve the uh

577
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:06,559
capture efficiency and then uh you know

578
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,760
uh We've invented a technology to

579
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:13,240
capture Mists which uh which we'll

580
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:15,520
discuss in Mah's talk in in a few few uh

581
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:17,279
talks from now and then we have some new

582
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,320
electrochemical conversion techniques to

583
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:21,159
convert that back into products and then

584
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:24,480
we can regenerate our sorbent and kind

585
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:27,320
of put it back so that allows us to take

586
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,399
uh uh Towers like this this is a a

587
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:31,159
postcombustion

588
00:24:28,399 --> 00:24:34,039
PCS capture called Petrova plant which

589
00:24:31,159 --> 00:24:36,640
is huge almost the size of a skyscraper

590
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:39,679
and um one of my uh thoughts was like

591
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,640
why is it so why do you need such large

592
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,679
capex especially when you're using

593
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:46,200
sorbents into which CO2 solubility is

594
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,840
pretty high and the reason for that is

595
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,000
there's not as much interfacial area

596
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:52,240
available to you and that's because some

597
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,200
of these films are only 600 microns

598
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:58,039
thick and now if you take this and make

599
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,559
finer droplets you can go to much higher

600
00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:03,440
surface areas and then you can

601
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:06,399
essentially uh get you know 100 fold

602
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,760
Improvement in uh in the capture

603
00:25:06,399 --> 00:25:10,720
efficiency and uh you know we've

604
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:13,960
developed electrostatic ways to capture

605
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:15,480
The Mists which uh allow us to uh do

606
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,919
something like this so I'm going to

607
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:21,880
steal a little bit of Mah's Thunder here

608
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:24,039
uh so this was in Mah's PhD thesis uh

609
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:26,159
where we have used plumes like this and

610
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:28,880
when you apply an electric field you

611
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:31,799
capture these uh these Miss and we are

612
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:34,159
able to then uh essentially not have

613
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:36,279
emissions so if we use something like

614
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:40,559
this we can redesign completely from

615
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:42,440
scratch how we put together a absorber

616
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,760
and what kind of drop sizes and

617
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:46,559
distributions we need that allow us to

618
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:49,919
do this capture better and we can

619
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:52,520
significantly reduce the uh the the

620
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:55,080
capture uh sort of the the tower sizes

621
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:57,000
and so on and thereby reduce capex

622
00:25:55,080 --> 00:26:00,440
significantly this also could be used

623
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:03,880
for DAC processes because uh significant

624
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:07,159
cost here is in the uh contactor and the

625
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:09,120
absorber costs and um uh like Mah will

626
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:11,240
describe we have already scaled up this

627
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:13,080
these kind of systems and therefore we

628
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:15,240
are very confident that we could apply

629
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:18,080
this technology and really take it uh

630
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:19,520
take it for forward into into the market

631
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,640
and those are some of the efforts that

632
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:24,960
are going on in the lab I'll switch

633
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:26,039
gears to another topic which is U uh on

634
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,360
the Marine

635
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:31,320
CO2 uh like I said uh the oceans are the

636
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,799
biggest contactor the capture is already

637
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:36,559
done for you so you don't have to build

638
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:38,200
a tower to do the capture but uh now

639
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:41,480
it's how to take the CO2 out of the

640
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:43,640
oceans in a efficient manner uh the

641
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:47,399
concentration of CO2 is about 100 times

642
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:49,919
more than in air so that's about 4% you

643
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:52,200
know similar to the exhaust of a gas

644
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,360
turbine output so uh which is kind of

645
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:56,159
mindboggling that you're putting so much

646
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:59,279
CO2 into the oceans and it's only going

647
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:01,039
to increase and the potions are amazing

648
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:02,520
you know they they are able to kind of

649
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:05,679
self-heal in a way they have this

650
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:08,039
buffering system that takes in the CO2

651
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:11,000
right and forms carbonic acid and the

652
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:14,600
carbonic acid Spates as bicarbonate and

653
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:18,440
carbonate ions as the ph and it's a pH

654
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:20,640
mediated equilibriums as a pH decreases

655
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:22,120
what we see is more of the bicarbonate

656
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,360
and that's also why it's having an

657
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:26,480
impact on sea life because they use

658
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:29,480
carbonate ions to form shells and other

659
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,320
things so what we have come up with is a

660
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:34,480
all electrochemical just using

661
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:36,760
electricity as a input right we take the

662
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:40,360
ocean water using this reaction we

663
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:43,000
protonate that and thereby uh uh move

664
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:45,799
the equilibrium to CO2 aquous and which

665
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,360
can be then removed from the uh from the

666
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:50,760
system and now we have another cell

667
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:53,240
where we deprotonate and thereby real

668
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:55,600
alkalize and put this thing back so the

669
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:57,919
real alkalized water essentially can

670
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:00,480
capture more CO2 or could be used as a

671
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:05,039
Val stream for example in aquaculture

672
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:06,559
and other sort of areas and um uh we

673
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:08,840
have some of the best energetics in the

674
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:10,519
world uh because we uh this system

675
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:12,399
operates almost like a battery right so

676
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:14,679
we are taking putting protons here and

677
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:16,360
taking protons out from this side and

678
00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:18,480
then there are no membranes we don't

679
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:21,760
have any waste products or waste

680
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:23,360
chemicals so it's a very uh uh you know

681
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,640
I'm very excited about this technology

682
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,399
and we're looking at uh scaling this and

683
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:29,399
then being able to apply this in real

684
00:28:27,399 --> 00:28:32,039
world application ations uh

685
00:28:29,399 --> 00:28:34,480
soon uh the economics works out also

686
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:37,440
well uh we this is just including our

687
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:40,840
electrochemical cost we at a54 per ton

688
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,960
of CO2 and then we uh have have now come

689
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:45,679
up with new ways to extract the CO2 in a

690
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:48,200
vacuum free manner or use the CO2 Waters

691
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:50,200
in a way to do direct conversion and

692
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:53,000
this allows us to apply this on Offshore

693
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:54,600
platforms in shipping or in desalination

694
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,279
plants and various places where you're

695
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:59,200
already moving ocean water or Fisheries

696
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:02,720
for example I know Japan has a lot of

697
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:04,200
aquaculture business uh as well right so

698
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,519
uh this is what's happened right with

699
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:10,120
ocean life pre-industrial revolution you

700
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:12,720
have uh enough carbonate ions for these

701
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:15,880
shellfish to form uh the shells but as

702
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:18,960
you go into now a lot of the uh because

703
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:22,720
of the decrease in the pH a lot of the

704
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:25,720
uh uh uh uh DIC or the dissol in organic

705
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,840
carbon is in a bicarbonate form making

706
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:31,320
it difficult uh for the shellfish to

707
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:34,399
form shells and actually uh in in the us

708
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:36,640
alone you know both on Washington as

709
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:38,840
well as in Gulf of Maine uh there's been

710
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:41,640
a significant impact people have to

711
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:44,279
treat their ocean waters now with care

712
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:46,159
with way to neutralize and be able to

713
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:48,679
use it for their hatcheries and and

714
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:50,080
other things uh the shellfish Market is

715
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:52,919
about you know close to a billion

716
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,840
dollars in the US just in in Washington

717
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:57,760
alone you know there's been1 10000

718
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:59,760
million loss because they are not able

719
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,960
to the Washington oyster economy was

720
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:04,600
affected because of the acidification

721
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:08,039
kind of issues so we uh we have been

722
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:10,480
continuing to uh um sort of uh make

723
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:12,640
strides on the technology development

724
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,960
and we are recently uh working with

725
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,799
University of Maine we have a new

726
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:17,760
collaboration where we where we are

727
00:30:15,799 --> 00:30:20,760
scaling this and applying this to this

728
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:24,120
aquaculture uh systems uh if you look at

729
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:25,840
CO2 removal Market it's a huge Market uh

730
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:29,120
but in the shellfish aquaculture which

731
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:31,240
is also a big Market but the value of

732
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:33,080
really dealing with the CO2 problem is

733
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:34,880
immense because you know it's both

734
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:36,840
affecting Coastal communities their

735
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,240
economy as well as you know they are

736
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:41,640
actually using chemicals to buffer uh

737
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:44,480
and having to input you know materials

738
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:46,720
and cost to buffer the ocean so we can

739
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,519
really come in as a good economic uh

740
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:52,440
gain here as well for these uh this

741
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:53,919
industry and so yeah we have some uh

742
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,120
current work that's going on where we

743
00:30:53,919 --> 00:31:00,200
are scaling our system into a modular

744
00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:02,600
stuff that could then be uh taken uh

745
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:05,679
forward I think I have few more minutes

746
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:07,760
uh and I will uh wrap up soon but uh so

747
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:10,440
you get all that CO2 what do you do with

748
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:13,840
all the CO2 right how do I then take it

749
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:15,360
and make value with this thing um and so

750
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:19,159
one of the approaches we've been looking

751
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:22,960
at is uh electrolysis of CO2 right so

752
00:31:19,159 --> 00:31:25,840
you take uh the CO2 and uh we can uh

753
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:28,240
basically uh do electrolysis and create

754
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,919
high value products and uh again

755
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,679
technoeconomics we always do

756
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:33,760
technoeconomics as we go along with the

757
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:36,360
science so that we know that we are you

758
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:38,399
know approaching the right market and we

759
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:41,039
can then accordingly engineer our

760
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:43,440
systems and one of the products here is

761
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:46,880
ethylene which has a significant market

762
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:50,279
and a big contributor to uh emissions

763
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:52,559
and uh to be able to make this work a uh

764
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:54,600
one needs to be able to do this at very

765
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:56,600
very high current densities if you are

766
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:59,600
at low current densities which is a lot

767
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:01,840
of uh the work is it makes it sort of

768
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:04,960
difficult to commercialize these kind of

769
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:07,840
systems so what we did here was uh we

770
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:10,279
took uh existing uh gas diffusion

771
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:13,159
electrodes where CO2 comes in here

772
00:32:10,279 --> 00:32:16,960
interacts with the electrolyte and forms

773
00:32:13,159 --> 00:32:18,840
uh the products we can then essentially

774
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,720
uh uh there's been a major challenge

775
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:23,080
where if you uh have high you need both

776
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,799
High conductivity and high

777
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:26,480
hydrophobicity because if you have high

778
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:28,760
conductivity and and don't have the

779
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:31,559
hydrophobicity the electrolyte can just

780
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:33,399
get into or flood this gas diffusion

781
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:36,120
layer thereby adding a big mass

782
00:32:33,399 --> 00:32:37,840
transport resistance but if you have

783
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,480
something that's hydrophobic like Teflon

784
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,880
then it's not conductive and the

785
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:44,679
electrons have to go through a very thin

786
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:48,279
uh region thereby creating a huge omic

787
00:32:44,679 --> 00:32:51,120
losses so uh so we kind of uh created

788
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:53,720
kind of Best of Both World scenario by

789
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:56,200
uh creating a hierarchically conductive

790
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:58,600
gas diffusion electrode that allowed us

791
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:01,559
to then uh really sort of

792
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:04,679
uh both uh reduce all these omic losses

793
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:07,679
and also make a tunable way to both make

794
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:10,120
U you know carbon monoxide or uh

795
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:12,519
ethylene or have a combination of these

796
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:14,200
kind of uh materials or these kind of

797
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:16,880
products and so we've been able to show

798
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:19,039
high faradic efficiencies uh and also

799
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:22,080
high efficiency towards uh ethylene and

800
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:24,360
scale uh this uh reactor so that it can

801
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:26,880
then be modularized and scaled to

802
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:28,760
Industrial sort of applications and this

803
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,919
is kind of where we ended up a lot of

804
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:33,559
the literature in the space is at low

805
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:35,399
small sizes but as you scale this there

806
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:37,159
are a lot of challenges and I think

807
00:33:35,399 --> 00:33:39,399
that's why you know thinking about scale

808
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:40,240
as you're doing science is uh is very

809
00:33:39,399 --> 00:33:43,200
very

810
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:46,600
important uh we also do another Pathway

811
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,840
to capture CO2 using biological uh uh

812
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:51,120
approaches here we use in this case

813
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:53,120
algae and created sort of

814
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:55,320
photobioreactors uh and these photobio

815
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:57,399
reactors use light as an input and the

816
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:59,159
algae and they're very extremely

817
00:33:57,399 --> 00:34:02,600
efficient effent more efficient than

818
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:05,559
trees to uh to move the CO2 and and be

819
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:07,440
sequestered uh so what we do here is uh

820
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:10,200
for example a kilogram of algae can

821
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,720
consume up to 2 kilog of CO2 and then

822
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:14,919
you can create value products like

823
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:17,159
omega3 and food and so on and a big

824
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:20,440
challenge in this space is biofouling

825
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:22,919
and we have uh Tre uh used uh various

826
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:25,399
other surfaces where we can create a

827
00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:28,320
surface that is uh negatively charged

828
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:30,480
and algae surfaces or algae cells have a

829
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:33,639
negative charge and thereby can prevent

830
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:36,879
you know um prevent sttion of these

831
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:38,520
cells and and keep these bioreactors uh

832
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:41,919
clean

833
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:44,200
um so I'm going to switch gears I think

834
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:44,200
I

835
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:50,560
have what one minute okay so I'll do uh

836
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:53,399
in one minute I'll just talk about the

837
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:55,960
Battery Technology uh so uh with

838
00:34:53,399 --> 00:35:00,520
batteries the uh like I said the key

839
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:04,160
challenge here is is U um flammability

840
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:05,800
you know as we go to uh storage you know

841
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:07,640
when we when you have a when you have a

842
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:09,359
lithium I mean I'm sure all of you know

843
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:11,440
what batteries are right so you have two

844
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:14,200
electrodes anode and cathode and then

845
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,240
you are using some sort of a uh ion that

846
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:18,880
moves shuttles back and forth and you're

847
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:21,800
storing uh storing charge and thereby

848
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:23,520
storing energy uh in that in that form

849
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:26,000
if you're taking your iPhone it has a

850
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:29,720
lithium cell which is fine it is a very

851
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:32,760
low uh low low capacity so but then you

852
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:34,240
take the same material and go to um

853
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:37,320
stationary storage where you're going to

854
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:40,079
megawatt hours and lithium is explosive

855
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:41,680
so that has led to major problems uh

856
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:44,560
while lithium is a king but when you go

857
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:47,079
to these large applications can lead to

858
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:50,640
significant uh fires and so on this has

859
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:53,319
happened recently in many places and um

860
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:57,640
this uh can be catastrophic because when

861
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:59,599
these uh things go off um just because

862
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:01,920
lithium can be very explosive here you

863
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:03,599
know I'm showing you I think this video

864
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,800
is probably not working but if you

865
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:08,599
puncture a cell it can blast off and uh

866
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:11,920
and the fires that you're getting emit a

867
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:15,240
lot of lot of fumes that can be very

868
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:17,880
dangerous so uh so that has led us to

869
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:19,800
really think about uh new kind of uh

870
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:22,200
approaches where we are doing

871
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:24,480
non-lithium uh and non flam in

872
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:26,079
inherently non-flammable batteries uh

873
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:29,680
through this uh through this company of

874
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:33,839
mine alsim uh energy and what we have is

875
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:35,839
a mixed metal oxide where we use uh both

876
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:39,680
sort of a manganese based cathode and a

877
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:42,359
metal oxide based anodes and we are able

878
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:44,760
to uh develop these cells uh here we are

879
00:36:42,359 --> 00:36:48,000
going to put out 3.4 megawatt hours per

880
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:51,400
40t storage container and this should be

881
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,440
out sometime in 2026 so we are uh we we

882
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:56,000
have commercialize this technology and

883
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:59,240
along this path uh this can also operate

884
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,079
at high temperatures for IC and others

885
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:03,599
and then we are going to the next one

886
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:05,880
which would be at 6.8 megawatt hours per

887
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:08,599
40ft container applicable to shipping

888
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:11,359
and other uh Marine sort of

889
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:14,200
applications um and I'll just uh quickly

890
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:16,200
end uh by showing how this technology

891
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:18,920
works as you can see you know people

892
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:21,359
here in the in our uh in our our company

893
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:23,040
are assembling cells in open air if you

894
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:25,960
are a lithium cell you can't do this you

895
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:28,400
need a glove box so it allows us to man

896
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:31,240
uh do uh simplify Manu ufacturing

897
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,640
drastically uh we had a 500 kilowatt

898
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:36,280
Proto plant and now we building a

899
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:39,200
megawatt plant and from a point of view

900
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:42,079
of how this could be applied we could do

901
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:44,480
all kinds of ways to do the discharge it

902
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:46,680
is software configurable uh some

903
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:50,040
utilities want to be able to do 12-hour

904
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:52,640
cycle maybe 4our cycle uh we can easily

905
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:55,560
do that because a material allows this

906
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:58,040
we could do c uh we have a co4 discharge

907
00:37:55,560 --> 00:38:00,680
rate we are trying to get to CO2

908
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:03,359
but this allows us to then uh really

909
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:05,640
choose what discharge rate you want for

910
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:08,119
what power you're going to do and then

911
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:10,560
what kind of a capacity there will be

912
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:12,240
and so at the moment we are on parity

913
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:15,280
with the with the on the levelized cost

914
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:17,599
of storage with lithium at a container

915
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:21,400
level right because we can pack more

916
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:24,200
cells uh and and uh we can also uh be

917
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:27,760
efficient with the land uh that uh one

918
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:31,560
could use um essentially we can do this

919
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:33,520
at a at a much smaller uh land footprint

920
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:36,680
so I'll pause here uh we have a number

921
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:40,160
of applications from utilities to uh to

922
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:42,440
Data Centers to others where storage is

923
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:44,040
important and if you're a chemical plant

924
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:46,400
you can't put lithium there because it

925
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:49,160
can be explosive and has all these uh

926
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:51,000
safety risks but this Battery Technology

927
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:53,440
can can readily be

928
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:58,480
applied thank you very much I'm happy to

929
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:58,480
address any questions uh

930
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:14,480
all right so the question is how do how

931
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:16,160
long do the liquid coating last we can

932
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:20,079
make them

933
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:24,280
um last as long as you want I mean

934
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:26,119
that's right so we um we we for example

935
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:28,000
some of the products that I showed you

936
00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:31,359
we designed it for the shelf life

937
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,200
of the of the product uh we could also

938
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:35,680
replenish the coating as this is

939
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:38,240
happening so in a way it could have you

940
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:41,000
know as long a life as as one as

941
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,000
application might

942
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:48,200
me okay the surface engineering can stop

943
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:49,880
formation of blood clots and biofilms is

944
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:52,040
it also effective in preventing

945
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:55,440
rejection of biomaterials for

946
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:57,599
implantable devices uh yes so one could

947
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:00,119
actually do that as well uh we been

948
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:02,720
looking at ways to reduce protein

949
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:04,599
absorption and other things so yeah I'm

950
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:07,920
happy to discuss more if you tell me

951
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:07,920
what your biom material

952
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:13,240
is how can you find such a fitting

953
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:14,839
market for your technology do you

954
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:16,040
aggressively speak with industry people

955
00:40:14,839 --> 00:40:18,000
is there a particular industry you're

956
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:19,960
looking to engage that's a great

957
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,680
question and that's why you know I came

958
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:25,200
all the way here to talk to all of you

959
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:27,000
uh so you've seen a flavor of what we do

960
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:29,400
uh talking to Industry is key because

961
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,160
the the problems are there right I can

962
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:33,640
sit in my office and imagine all kinds

963
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:36,119
of problems but that may not be real

964
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:38,240
though you know we do uh we we we we

965
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:40,359
want to look forward and think about

966
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:42,680
what could be but at the same time I

967
00:40:40,359 --> 00:40:45,599
think there are critical bottlenecks

968
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:48,000
that if Sol could lead to uh could lead

969
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:51,000
to breakthroughs and I think you know

970
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,599
one uh area that I can I can highlight

971
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:56,319
is uh in the in this agriculture space

972
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:58,200
that I was looking at when I was at USDA

973
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:59,800
I gave gave a talk almost 10 years ago

974
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,520
and said okay what is a wish list of

975
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:03,599
problems that you want me to solve these

976
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:06,880
are my skills and they talked about

977
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:09,520
pesticide uh runoff and that led to

978
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:11,480
actually this company uh that is solving

979
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:14,400
that problem today and we deployed this

980
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:17,079
technology now in 65,000 acres in the US

981
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:19,400
and reducing the amount of pesticide

982
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:21,960
footprint but I'm happy to discuss

983
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:24,800
across you know Carbon capture to energy

984
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:26,440
to biomedical what could be some of the

985
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:29,280
interesting areas that you are looking

986
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:31,319
at interesting topics what bottlenecks

987
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:33,400
you might have and uh you know we can

988
00:41:31,319 --> 00:41:35,920
bring some of our expertise to bear and

989
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:38,440
I can tell you if I can solve it or not

990
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:40,599
uh and uh and and and potentially come

991
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:44,040
up with ways to uh think about how to

992
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:44,040
scale and commercialize these

993
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,680
things all right so can carbon

994
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:53,040
deposition during CO2 capture due to

995
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:55,319
chemical reactions be prevented by

996
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:57,240
applying magnetic fields or coating

997
00:41:55,319 --> 00:41:58,640
Technologies to create a protective

998
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:00,720
barrier

999
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:03,400
beforehand

1000
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:06,599
uh so I guess you know the the point

1001
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:08,160
here is uh I I'm I need to understand

1002
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:11,640
this question a little bit more but I

1003
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:15,680
can broadly kind of say that in the

1004
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:19,359
absorb Towers you want best sorption

1005
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:22,520
into your sorbent and most often you are

1006
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:24,760
limited by surface interfacial area and

1007
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:27,240
the reactivity of your sorbent for

1008
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:30,720
example if I take hydroxide Solutions

1009
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:34,040
which are a aquous you know less I would

1010
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:36,359
say more benign than most other sorbents

1011
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:38,680
uh you want High hydroxide concentration

1012
00:42:36,359 --> 00:42:40,880
to absorb that CO2 and then when you

1013
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:43,520
want to release it you want to go back

1014
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:47,520
into slightly more acidic regime where

1015
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:50,880
the CO2 can go from carbonate back to uh

1016
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:53,000
the CO2 aquous form and so in all of

1017
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:55,480
these yeah interfacial engineering plays

1018
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:58,920
a very important role so I'd be happy to

1019
00:42:55,480 --> 00:43:01,200
hear what your specific uh you know

1020
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:04,880
challenge here is and can thereby you

1021
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,880
know see what the best way to address

1022
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:11,520
that is liquid light technology

1023
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,839
applicable to extremely large surface

1024
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:16,400
areas as high-rise buildings cars trucks

1025
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:18,280
what level of constraints okay that's a

1026
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:20,079
that's a great question we always

1027
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:21,960
thought about you know can we quote the

1028
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:25,200
bottom of the ship right so that you can

1029
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:27,240
prevent biofouling or quote large areas

1030
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:29,200
I mean it is it it can be completely

1031
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:31,040
done it's uh you know all it comes down

1032
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:34,200
to is what's the business case and what

1033
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:37,280
is the customer willing to pay for for

1034
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:39,280
what is the kind of the benefit right uh

1035
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:41,480
is it easier for someone to go and clean

1036
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:44,160
is it easier to have a robot do that

1037
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:45,720
versus you know is it better to put in a

1038
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,680
coating so I think it it's more of a

1039
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:50,800
technoeconomics issue than a technology

1040
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:52,960
issue we can scale and it depends on uh

1041
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:56,240
what the application is and what is the

1042
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,240
cost benefit

1043
00:43:57,319 --> 00:44:03,680
all

1044
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:03,680
right thank you very much uh
