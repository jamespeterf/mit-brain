1
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,160
go uh my name is Brian Anthony I'll I'll

2
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:17,000
chare the session really what that's

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:19,160
going to mean for this session is I'll

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,600
give you a case example of what we mean

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:23,320
in this case about talking about

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,880
modeling of matter as you'll see we're

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,679
going to talk a lot about Imaging uh

8
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,400
Imaging of matter and how we use that to

9
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:31,560
characterize or control the the

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,280
production of matter in this session um

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,960
we won't have a panel discussion at the

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,040
end so after each speaker we should have

13
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,840
time for one or two questions so each

14
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,200
person will have about 15 minutes or so

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,800
I'll try to keep mine under that um but

16
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,120
be ready with your questions for each

17
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,840
speaker after after they

18
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:52,480
go okay so um with that um our prior

19
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,079
session was talking about novel

20
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,320
computation novel computers the the the

21
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:59,680
stuff on which we run algorithms so it's

22
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,039
nice to sort of connect to there um we

23
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,160
heard a little bit as well about sort of

24
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,760
the applications in in medicine um so

25
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:07,280
we'll make some connections to there so

26
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,560
Imaging of matter um what we're going to

27
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,640
talk about though is is in many ways

28
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,000
computational Imaging or or modern

29
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,960
Imaging in some sense so computational

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,759
Imaging is the intersection of

31
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:22,640
collecting data and processing that data

32
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,560
um to make an image right unlike what

33
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,479
you think of maybe the way that your

34
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,320
cell phone works uh you don't actually

35
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,880
see the raw data that comes off of your

36
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,399
image sensor uh you see a highly

37
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,040
processed image and often with their

38
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:36,799
modern phones they're taking multiple

39
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,720
images to sort of create something that

40
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,040
is sort of rich in experience and allows

41
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,280
you to rapidly segment and and have

42
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,920
multiple focal

43
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,560
planes so um and I don't Advocate this

44
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,759
new selfie stick but you know we we we

45
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,520
benefit a lot from the the types of

46
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:53,360
computation that we can intersect with

47
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:56,159
imaging and image is a function of our

48
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,479
data um so there are many forms of

49
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,399
computational Imaging tomography whether

50
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:03,399
it be x-ray or or

51
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,200
ultrasound imaging off of of disperse

52
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:07,360
and non-reflective surfaces seeing

53
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,400
around corners for example High dynamic

54
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:14,400
range Imaging and many other

55
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:15,879
examples what I want to do is I'll use

56
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,959
start with ultrasound tomography I'll

57
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:20,840
use ultrasound as a motivating case

58
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:23,120
example for how we think about this

59
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:27,480
session being the intersection of

60
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:30,440
Imaging physics Imaging data for

61
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:33,239
characterization and for process control

62
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:35,040
where we're exploring or creating novel

63
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:37,599
materials so I'm going to start with the

64
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,280
macro scale I'm giving you an example of

65
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:43,239
the space of of computational Imaging um

66
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:46,920
what we're seeing in the middle is a a a

67
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:49,360
lowcost um ultrasound imaging tank where

68
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:51,560
we have what's moving is a single

69
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,239
transducer uh that is receiving the

70
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,720
sound that is currently being generated

71
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,360
by the stationary transducer which is on

72
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,760
the other white frame the data that's

73
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,959
being collected in this is the

74
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,640
transducer that's stationary sends out a

75
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:06,920
sound wave that you can see represented

76
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,799
sort of in the bottom image of it's

77
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:11,080
playing yeah there it goes and that

78
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:12,920
sound wave goes into the medium that is

79
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,440
in the water tank in this case it's a

80
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:17,519
it's a replica of a human limb it

81
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,239
balances off of the interfaces and then

82
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,120
goes out to be received by all of the

83
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,080
virtual receivers that are around this

84
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,720
tank in this case that those virtual

85
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,840
receivers are the the moving platform

86
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,360
and the the left and right images are

87
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:36,439
the the raw data that we collect now

88
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:40,280
those data can be put into a the wave

89
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:43,200
equation uh and we can iteratively solve

90
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:46,319
the wave equation to take those

91
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,480
observations and say well what did the

92
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,920
thing that the sound was propagating

93
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,640
through need to be to explain our

94
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,640
observations so that's sort of a

95
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,879
classical inverse problem where I'm

96
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,439
going to collect all these data I'll go

97
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,120
through this iterative process of

98
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:02,079
forming this image that's shown in the

99
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:05,400
center to result in a final speed of

100
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:07,599
sound image now in doing that though um

101
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,439
it goes through this algorithm this

102
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,239
computation the punchline of this

103
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,519
algorithm though is what is happening is

104
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:15,959
I'm comparing my observations the data

105
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,720
that I've collected I'm iteratively

106
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:21,799
running those data through a simulation

107
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:25,120
comparing the those data to a simulation

108
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:26,240
of a the medium the the the water tank

109
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,199
with something in the center of the

110
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,520
water tank where I've

111
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:32,120
simulated what the distributions of the

112
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,880
density and the speed of sound are in

113
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:37,520
that Medium propagate synthetic data so

114
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,160
simulated data through that to generate

115
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,240
a a synthetic or a fake data set and I

116
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,960
compare that data set to the things that

117
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,600
I've observed and I sequentially over

118
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,759
time converge until I figure out well

119
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,440
what was that map what was that image of

120
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:56,440
what is in our

121
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:58,759
domain now um I can do that I can apply

122
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:01,560
it to a lot of different processors and

123
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:03,919
because I'm iterative applying a a very

124
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,280
complex with lots and lots of data full

125
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:08,479
waveform a physics model um it takes me

126
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,479
a lot of time 3 to 6 hours just to

127
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,960
collect one the data set can be acquired

128
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:15,080
in 10 minutes but it takes many hours to

129
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,880
actually robustly solve that iterative

130
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:19,960
problem that's potentially a challenge

131
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,960
um but I do get something nice and

132
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,759
beneficial by having all these data

133
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,600
coming at different angles I'm actually

134
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,319
able to break what you might normally

135
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,520
think of as the wavelength resolution of

136
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:31,800
the wave that we're using so the speed

137
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,759
of sound in a medium has a certain

138
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,039
wavelength that should be the limit of

139
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,759
the resolution that we're able to

140
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,600
resolve but since we have these data

141
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:40,319
from different orientations around it

142
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:43,240
we're able to actually get something a

143
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:46,199
little bit better than wavelength

144
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:48,880
resolution now if we had that data in

145
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:50,960
real time though we could actually use

146
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,039
it to control a process so what type of

147
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,479
process could that water tank

148
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,199
potentially be used for so we can sort

149
00:05:55,479 --> 00:05:58,800
of do characterization and we can do

150
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,280
online or sort of real-time

151
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,120
characterization

152
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,199
so in this case the one of the

153
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:08,000
motivating applications for this water

154
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:11,720
tank uh phenomena is can we collect data

155
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,960
of an from an ampute te um in sitting on

156
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,199
a comfortable table with their leg

157
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:18,039
residual limb in a water tank have this

158
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:20,639
ultrasound thing spin around them and

159
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:22,759
come up with an image that characterizes

160
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,880
both the geometry of their limb in three

161
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:27,639
dimensions not just a slice and also the

162
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,880
tissue properties of the limb if we have

163
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:31,960
that type of data and if we can do it in

164
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:34,360
10 20 30 minutes and not have to wait

165
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,960
hours for this type of data um we could

166
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:39,000
collect it something like this um we

167
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,960
could have then instead of just a slice

168
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,199
that is showing the geometry the image

169
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,479
what you typically think of as the

170
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:46,280
structure in your image um you could

171
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,560
have both the structure and the material

172
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:51,919
properties and with those material

173
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:54,440
properties then I can then feed that

174
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:58,680
data into an additive manufacturing

175
00:06:54,440 --> 00:07:01,319
process or I can 3D print a socket that

176
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,639
is the perfect G geometry it sort of

177
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:05,919
matches conformally the outside geometry

178
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:07,560
of the limb but also has the correct

179
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,080
material properties so it's it's

180
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,840
mechanically stiff where it needs to

181
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,520
mesh it's mechanically soft where it

182
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,319
needs to mesh with the mechanical

183
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,960
properties of the limb right so I need

184
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,639
to be able to acquire that data in real

185
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,360
time so I'm not having my patient

186
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:23,039
sitting there in a long time with the

187
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:26,639
prosthetic trying to form my my my the

188
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:29,560
cup that's matching me to my my

189
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,879
prosthetic okay so if we're able to do

190
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,199
something like that real

191
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:35,599
time then there's many applications but

192
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:38,080
how do we make it real time how do we

193
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:40,240
get around how can we use sort of comput

194
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,960
other computational approaches to get

195
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,400
around the fact that fundamentally if we

196
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:46,360
really want to have that analysis the

197
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,080
mechanical properties be physic

198
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:52,400
physically grounded the the structure be

199
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:54,240
physically grounded you know how do we

200
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,319
use machine learning how can we do some

201
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,960
training to maybe think of a faster way

202
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:02,479
to not solve the inverse problem

203
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:04,879
um but a a learned way to solve the

204
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:06,639
inverse problem so when we're doing

205
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,520
classical inversion the way that we're

206
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,360
going to do this is collect our data and

207
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,639
iteratively solve a physics physics

208
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:16,560
problem but can

209
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:20,319
we feed the the inverse of that problem

210
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,520
so feed in the the image that we're the

211
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,360
data that we're acquiring and

212
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,000
automatically train a network to kick

213
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,759
out the image that's what machine

214
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,159
learning could provide for us but to do

215
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,240
that we need lots and lots and lots lots

216
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:32,560
of data

217
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,760
and human data is really hard to acquire

218
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,719
so there's no easy source of of the

219
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:40,279
massive quantity of data that we'd like

220
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:43,159
to acquire to teach a network how to

221
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:45,040
very rapidly solve our inverse problem

222
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:49,120
the the raw data that we get in and

223
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,560
automatically fast kick out the image

224
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,760
even if it takes a long time to train

225
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,600
the algorithm you know we can imagine

226
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,480
the inverse being that running that

227
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,120
inverse problem being fast so we don't

228
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,160
have a lot of really good easy data to

229
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,519
acquire on humans that would be the the

230
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:05,000
the training data that we would need for

231
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:08,240
this but we do have really good physics

232
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,279
models of of the physics of the Imaging

233
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,240
process in this case of ultrasound we

234
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:14,079
can write down the first principles of

235
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,760
the wave equation dispersive or not in

236
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:19,320
two dimensions and three dimensions we

237
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:21,920
can create a a speed of sound map of

238
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,120
some domain we can simulate a transducer

239
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,920
the mechanical properties of the

240
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,839
transducer and how sound propagate

241
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:28,800
through that so we can create some

242
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:30,079
really robust synthetic data we can

243
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,440
simulate them

244
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:34,440
for our Imaging

245
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,160
scenario or the water tank and a

246
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,079
residual limb put into the center of the

247
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:41,480
water tank we can simulate for all the

248
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:43,120
as many different sort of physical

249
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,720
virtual physical things that we want to

250
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,560
put into that domain we can simulate and

251
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:50,760
understand what those ultrasound signals

252
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:53,800
would be and then we can flip it around

253
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:56,680
now we have a physics based or a

254
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:59,600
synthetic way of getting our training

255
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:01,000
data and the input to a network for

256
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,920
which we want to learn the parameters of

257
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,240
how we map input to Output data the

258
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:07,200
input would be the raw data that we

259
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,640
receive see if my laser pointer works

260
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,240
here oops the raw data that's not the

261
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:15,079
laser

262
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:17,279
pointer we go the raw data that we

263
00:10:15,079 --> 00:10:19,120
receive um going into a network to

264
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:22,920
automatically kick out the sounds speed

265
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,360
map now machine learning is great for

266
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:27,279
fitting within the boundaries of the

267
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,600
data that is that it has observed right

268
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,800
it's not going to work very well for

269
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:33,240
things that it hasn't n observed so just

270
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,120
as an aside one of the nice things about

271
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,440
this type of approach if we can teach a

272
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,480
network to take our raw data in and get

273
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,720
a good estimate of what the actual

274
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,839
domain looks like what the speed of

275
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:49,079
sound map looks like then we could also

276
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:51,200
use that as the starting guess to our

277
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:54,160
conventional or classical physics-based

278
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,920
inversion process that the closer that

279
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,880
we can get our initial guess the initial

280
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,440
condition of that iterative Loop we

281
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:03,399
don't have to be constrained just having

282
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:05,120
observations that are uh that that our

283
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:06,959
network has been trained with but we can

284
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,040
sort of get close and then still allow

285
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,240
the physics to sort of do the things

286
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,600
that are maybe outside of our

287
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,160
observational space okay so this is what

288
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,880
a network looks like um that has allowed

289
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:19,920
us now to First confirm with our

290
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:22,079
synthetic data that if on the left we

291
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,279
have these are data that weren't used in

292
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:26,120
the training of this network there

293
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:27,800
speeds the sound Maps randomly generated

294
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,440
we trained a network how to do this

295
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:31,240
Imaging how to create those images

296
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,399
directly from the raw data that we

297
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:36,279
acquire and you see some of the noisy

298
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:39,040
images that are generated on the right

299
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:42,000
now we've been able to do this now to do

300
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,839
realtime Imaging of this of the speed of

301
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,040
sound map so the tomography example that

302
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,519
I showed you previously water tank this

303
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,000
data that's collected over 10 or 20

304
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,839
minutes still takes three hours to

305
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,079
reconstruct to form the speed of sound

306
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:55,920
map the image on your right was

307
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:58,240
collected and analyzed in real time 30

308
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:02,160
frames per second and it was that image

309
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,320
inversion had been is performed by a

310
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,920
network that we've trained with

311
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:09,639
synthetic data but these are now being

312
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:11,399
applied on real data so here just to

313
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:14,920
show um how one of the areas of how

314
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:18,000
we're using this um if you take muscle

315
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:20,120
um if you activate muscle meaning you're

316
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,760
loading it or unloading it the speed of

317
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:25,480
sound in the muscle changes so if you

318
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:28,880
have the ability to

319
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:31,240
image the speed of sound of the tissue

320
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,199
in real time you can actually visualize

321
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:35,199
in real time how your muscles are being

322
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:37,519
activated and so here we do an

323
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:39,240
experiment um in the emersion lab over

324
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,959
at MIT Nano where we go through the

325
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,160
squatting exercise standing on your toes

326
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:45,839
and squatting while we're collecting

327
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:48,160
real time ultrasound data of a probe

328
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,800
attached to the side of the leg and we

329
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,279
can see through these this this false

330
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,760
coloring the coloring being

331
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:56,079
corresponding to the speeds of sound in

332
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,680
the muscle the thing that we would

333
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,279
expect to happen in normal healthy

334
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:02,480
muscle which is when we go from a

335
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:04,360
standing to a squatting um motion that

336
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,480
the the muscle activation is going to go

337
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,160
from the gastrock to the Solus and then

338
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,959
when going when starting in a squatting

339
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,079
position back up to active it goes

340
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:15,399
similarly from the soas back up to the

341
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:16,920
gastrock right now that is true in the

342
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:18,480
situation where we have healthy muscle

343
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,839
we see this transition the red going

344
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,760
from the bottom the red going to the top

345
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:25,880
but it it also allowed Us in this very

346
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:29,720
um small clinical study in N of two two

347
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:31,279
people we found and um accidentally

348
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,600
discovered and sent this individual off

349
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:35,600
to get um to to actually see a doctor

350
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,720
where the was later confirmed that this

351
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,839
individual had nerve damage they did not

352
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,560
realize they had nerve damage um but

353
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,480
their muscles had their brain had

354
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:45,240
learned how to rewire how their muscles

355
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,880
activated and we observed something very

356
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,720
unusual in their muscle activation

357
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:52,160
process through observing speed of sound

358
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,480
maps from a network that had been

359
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,639
trained with synthetic data coming from

360
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,360
a physics

361
00:13:55,639 --> 00:14:01,560
model okay so um what I want to do today

362
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,800
and so here just sort of with that same

363
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:06,880
idea for ultrasound scanning um we're

364
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,600
also applying moving from the macro to

365
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,279
the micro and it can be used for doing

366
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:13,000
things like characterizing of defects

367
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,560
and voids through a package where you

368
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,800
can see both the package and the

369
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,199
internal structures you can see de

370
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,800
delaminations and structures and and

371
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,639
things that you wouldn't see in an x-ray

372
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,959
you can see because you're able to

373
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,720
visualize some of the mechanical

374
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:28,839
properties that AR that aren't visible

375
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:31,399
in x-ray um but what I want to do today

376
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:33,399
is is for this session take this

377
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:34,959
perspective of well where does

378
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:36,920
computational Imaging so this

379
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:40,120
intersection of Imaging physics Imaging

380
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:41,639
data allow us to impact Metrology so if

381
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:44,360
we're doing offline

382
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:45,680
characterization um or sort of online in

383
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,079
real time

384
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:51,920
characterization and and we'll see when

385
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:54,120
we conclude with Julie um that one of

386
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,320
the points that came up earlier today

387
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:59,160
where well how is AI actually allowing

388
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,160
us to physically interact with the world

389
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:03,279
we have some interesting ways to connect

390
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:05,240
image acquisition with robotic

391
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:07,600
manipulation of helping us to discover

392
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:09,600
and experiment with materials and so

393
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,920
there's there is early work that is

394
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,000
helping us to sort of connect physical

395
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,040
interaction with the world based on

396
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,920
automatic decisions that an AI or an

397
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:20,000
algorithm is telling us so we're going

398
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,199
to hear today U First from George Barb

399
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,279
stus that'll talk a little bit about

400
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:25,399
Optical physics and machine learning uh

401
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,759
for inspection and control uh Bill

402
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:28,319
Freeman will talk a little bit about

403
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,880
visualization of the tiniest little

404
00:15:28,319 --> 00:15:31,839
motions in so looking at how we can

405
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:33,959
apply those in other domains and then

406
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,759
Julie finally a little bit on on

407
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:39,160
autonomous exploration of materials uh

408
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:40,240
again we're not going to take uh

409
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:43,600
questions at the end we'll take them at

410
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:46,199
the as after each speaker except for me

411
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:49,959
um and with that I we turn it over to uh

412
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:52,839
my good friend uh George um and um we'll

413
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:52,839
take it away

414
00:15:53,800 --> 00:16:00,199
okay thank you

415
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,600
Brian Okay so so my name is George

416
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:03,839
barbastathis

417
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,240
um and

418
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,839
um so I'll be talking about something

419
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,600
very related actually so I'm very

420
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:15,920
grateful to Brian for the for the um for

421
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:18,560
for the setup I guess um so first of all

422
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:21,720
let me acknowledge all my my former and

423
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:25,560
current students especially those in

424
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:29,079
boldface um and um so I'll pick up from

425
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:30,639
where Brian left it uh basically our

426
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:33,680
claim here is that using machine

427
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:36,079
learning in something like computational

428
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,839
Imaging maybe it's a good idea right so

429
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:41,959
I'll try to make the case for why it is

430
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:44,959
a good idea and show you a few examples

431
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:46,440
of the work we did in our group so I

432
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:48,639
think you're all familiar with these S

433
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:50,440
curves it basically tells you that even

434
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,959
if you're willing to pay a lot of

435
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:55,560
money at some point performance such

436
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:57,720
rates usually because of some physical

437
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:59,839
limitation and the technological

438
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:02,759
innovation is actually to push up the S

439
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:05,799
curve so you can either pay the same

440
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:08,880
money and get better performance or

441
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:11,039
actually pay less money for the same

442
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,199
level of performance that before used to

443
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:18,559
cost you a lot of money so the way we

444
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:20,720
figured out how to use um how to how to

445
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:23,919
shift up the curve in computational

446
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:27,400
imaging is as Brian very well put it by

447
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:30,160
a combination of optical physics and and

448
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:33,280
data and AI and I'll show you a few

449
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:36,160
cases so so we started working on this

450
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:40,000
about 8 years ago in

451
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:41,720
2016 interestingly it came up through a

452
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,520
disagreement I had with a student of

453
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:47,000
mine Justin Lee who had sort of an

454
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:49,320
argument and and we decided to do this

455
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,360
kind of work but uh so basically I'm

456
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:54,080
touting my own horn here but before that

457
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:56,760
I really want to acknowledge at least

458
00:17:54,080 --> 00:18:01,039
one uh other colleague that is professor

459
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:03,679
uner at tfl who he started doing this at

460
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:06,480
about the same time as us and he showed

461
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:09,919
that it is possible to reduce the dose

462
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:12,320
of X-ray radiation on a patient by using

463
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,280
AI that was un's accomplishment as far

464
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,720
as back as then so that was very

465
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:18,120
inspiring for us and um and then of

466
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,720
course we did a lot of work and I'll

467
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,840
tell you a little bit about it one of

468
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:24,720
them one of these had to do can I go

469
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:27,039
back yeah okay here we go yes one of

470
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,360
those projects had to do actually with

471
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:32,039
um integrated

472
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:34,960
inspection that was founded by an agency

473
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:36,559
called I arpa where I stands for

474
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,840
intelligence and there's not the

475
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:42,679
intelligence as in AI That's the

476
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:44,120
intelligence in the CIA acronym okay so

477
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:46,600
I have no idea why they wanted to

478
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:50,000
inspect circuits but they they gave us a

479
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:52,919
project to do it it's a it's a really

480
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,600
difficult problem circuit inspection

481
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:57,039
because of course circuit features are

482
00:18:54,600 --> 00:19:01,039
very very small they go down to maybe a

483
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:03,440
few nanometers these days and also it's

484
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:06,480
a lot of them uh this calculation

485
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:08,880
actually I computed about 10 to the 18

486
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:12,880
voxels that you need of course voxel is

487
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:15,000
a 3D generalization of a pixel so this

488
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,799
calculation is already conservative I

489
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,080
did this a few I don't know a few years

490
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:21,559
ago and already the number of degrees of

491
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:23,520
freedom in this imag system is higher so

492
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:25,760
it's vast right sort of astronomical

493
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:28,360
level uh

494
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:30,440
complexity and this is actually what uh

495
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:32,760
Drew was What attracted us to this to

496
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:36,280
this project we we thought AI can help

497
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:38,159
us do it so we succeeded but it it

498
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:41,120
actually took us a long time to figure

499
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:44,679
out what exactly AI can do and actually

500
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:47,919
it comes down to Time Savings uh we were

501
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:50,520
able to do an operation that without AI

502
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:53,559
would take a rather long time we were

503
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:55,720
able to do it 100 times faster and you

504
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:58,240
can see one reconstruction here of one

505
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:00,159
such circuit and also I should

506
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,400
acknowledge the most of these data were

507
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:05,520
taken at actually not most all of these

508
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:08,000
data were taken at at argon National

509
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:11,640
Laboratory uh with a synchrotron a

510
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,600
synchrotron is a kind of a x-ray quasi

511
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:16,600
laser okay it is a vast instrument it's

512
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:19,760
diameter is a couple of miles if I'm not

513
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:22,400
mistaken maybe bigger and they they were

514
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:25,280
taking the data and

515
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,720
um and uh I think I put yeah maybe I'll

516
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,120
tell you a little bit about how this

517
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,840
works it involves two operations in one

518
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:34,320
of them you kind of zigzag a beam over

519
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:37,880
the integrated circuit and collect uh

520
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:42,240
data this is called tgraph and then the

521
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:44,159
second step is you rotate the specimen

522
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,919
as as you know with respect to the

523
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,960
incident beam and you repeat you zigzag

524
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:51,440
and you rotate and you zigzag and you

525
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,520
rotate the rotation is tomography Brian

526
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,679
showed the sound uh equivalent of it

527
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:58,640
this is of course X-rays and the

528
00:20:56,679 --> 00:21:00,600
combination of those two is called tyo

529
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,960
tomography now why you need both steps

530
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:05,440
it's a little bit technical so if you

531
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:07,799
want I can tell you after the talk and

532
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,320
um I'm not joking here actually for a

533
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:13,880
full integrated circuit uh that you

534
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:17,039
might use as a CPU or a memory somewhere

535
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:20,200
it would take a full year I'm really not

536
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:23,799
joking a full year it would have to sit

537
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:27,120
in front of the synchroton and be

538
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:29,640
scanned and all kinds of computations

539
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,720
it's a really moonot kind of problem so

540
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:34,440
we were able to reduce that by a factor

541
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:38,400
of 100 which makes it I guess worth a

542
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:40,039
few days H we did a scal down version um

543
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,720
let me tell you a couple of other things

544
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:45,679
first so one thing we broke kind of a

545
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,559
record there uh one of the ways to

546
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:50,080
reduce the time it takes to do this

547
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:53,200
Imaging operation is obviously to reduce

548
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:54,720
the exposure kind of like uner had done

549
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,400
but here we do it not because the

550
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,559
circuit Minds the exposure we do it

551
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,320
because we want to do it faster right so

552
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:05,000
we kind of overdid it we went down to

553
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:07,400
one Photon per pixel now if you don't

554
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,679
remember how much energy is in a photon

555
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:12,840
let me tell you that the level of

556
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:14,919
Illumination here is 10 to the 18 times

557
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:17,840
less than the light we have in this room

558
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:19,480
10 to the 18 that's 10 with 18 zeros

559
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,919
following right that's the level of

560
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:24,400
Illumination that we used and we were

561
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:26,559
able to you know to actually get good

562
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,400
quality images as you can see in a

563
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:31,080
series of papers

564
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,120
and then we did the tomography problem

565
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:37,440
first we did it with a toy problem with

566
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:40,400
a glass actually not a real AC glass uh

567
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,799
but on the on the glass we patterned

568
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:46,120
things that look like circuits in fact

569
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:48,240
we copied a cad file from a real circuit

570
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:50,240
and that's what I'm showing here and of

571
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,880
course people were making fun of us they

572
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,600
were saying this is ridiculous why do

573
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:57,679
you do it this is this is not solving a

574
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:59,799
real problem but actually thanks to this

575
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:02,080
experiment we we did manage to solve the

576
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:05,360
real problem that's how we did the

577
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:07,360
actual integrated circuit basically we

578
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:11,640
thanks to the what we learned from the

579
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:13,919
glass Phantom we were able to figure out

580
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:16,559
how to reduce the number of exposures in

581
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,840
tomography and still recover the same

582
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:20,880
quality of the Reconstruction on the

583
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:24,760
integrated circuit so we did a lot of

584
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:27,880
this analysis and um and um basically

585
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:31,600
this shows you how the how what is the

586
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:34,279
limit of image so that of how few

587
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:36,320
exposures you can do without uh

588
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:38,720
sacrificing any image quality that is

589
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:41,080
the purpose of this analysis here and

590
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,360
this is basically what the factor of 100

591
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:45,880
came

592
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:47,000
from okay so I'll tell you one more

593
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,600
example this is now in the

594
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,159
pharmaceutical

595
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:55,200
industry H and uh it is not uh it is not

596
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:58,200
Imaging um sort of objects like

597
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:01,159
integrated circuits but imagine powders

598
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:03,919
which are used in the manufacturing of

599
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:06,080
PE this turns out to be a very delicate

600
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:08,440
process and you want to be delicate

601
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:11,159
because when you take a drug it better

602
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:13,360
be precisely the dosage that is

603
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:16,000
prescribed right that's very important

604
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:18,520
and the FDA has a lot of very stringent

605
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,320
requirements for how these processes

606
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:23,159
should operate so what you see this

607
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:25,320
movie there is one of the stages of this

608
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:27,240
process where they have to dry the

609
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:29,720
powder and they have to do it carefully

610
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:31,720
so it does not agglomerate if it aerates

611
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,679
basically the FDA requirement will not

612
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:36,039
be met and the company will lose a lot

613
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:41,320
of money so they have people who look

614
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:44,440
into the reactor and try to discern

615
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:47,520
visually if the process is agglomerating

616
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:49,399
so they can take corrective action so we

617
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:52,679
didn't do that what we did is actually

618
00:24:49,399 --> 00:24:55,480
we simply illuminated with a laser beam

619
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:58,399
and then um we do not even bother to

620
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:00,440
image the power we take the back scatter

621
00:24:58,399 --> 00:25:02,880
from the particles from the from the

622
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:05,799
surface of the particles and then we you

623
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:08,279
we use a physical law it turns out with

624
00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:10,320
Optical figes you can calculate

625
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:14,000
something called the autocorrelation of

626
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:16,320
this scattering um scattered beam and

627
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,000
then you can see in real time we can

628
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:21,039
characterize the histogram of particle

629
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,799
sizes so this is of course a control

630
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:25,679
experiment where we know exactly the

631
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:28,640
particle sizes we can verify that

632
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:30,440
they're correct and then we did um let

633
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,080
me skip this one and come back to it and

634
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:35,679
then we did experiments with actual

635
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:39,360
processes so you can see here the

636
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:41,279
initial histogram is the red one then

637
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,840
the process begins to agglomerate it

638
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:46,399
shifts to the right which is blue and

639
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:48,880
then we pour more solvent it shifts back

640
00:25:46,399 --> 00:25:50,760
to the green near the center and then

641
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,960
finally near the end you get something

642
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:55,279
called attrition the particles due to

643
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,039
friction they actually begin to crack

644
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:59,120
and that's why the histogram SES to the

645
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:01,360
left but you only see four curves here

646
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:04,200
in fact there is thousands of Curves

647
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,919
here that we obtain at U not quite video

648
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,720
rate but about half the video rate so

649
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:09,240
it's actually pretty fast and our

650
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,520
colleagues are very excited because this

651
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,679
will allow them

652
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:16,799
to physically quantify now this very

653
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:18,840
complicated dry and other processes in

654
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:20,919
pharmaceutical industry this was funded

655
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:23,399
by Takeda by the way which is a

656
00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:26,080
pharmaceutical company with offices and

657
00:26:23,399 --> 00:26:28,360
Labs nearby in

658
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,080
Cambridge I want to go back and show

659
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:32,840
this because this shows that our neural

660
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,399
network has learned physics it turns out

661
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:36,919
I don't not have time to go into the

662
00:26:34,399 --> 00:26:39,320
details but the formula we derived

663
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:42,440
predicts that the information about

664
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:45,279
particle sizes is in the rings that you

665
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,880
see around this this looks like a comet

666
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:48,760
of some kind it's not a comet it's this

667
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,880
autocorrelation function and the

668
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:53,440
information is in the rings that

669
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,520
surround it and then you see these flame

670
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,360
like shapes these are actually the

671
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,960
activation patterns of the neural

672
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,399
network that we use used to solve this

673
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,480
problem and you can see depending of

674
00:27:01,399 --> 00:27:06,320
course on the physical object that we

675
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:09,320
put to test the the algorithm you can

676
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:11,640
see that the Rings kind of change sh

677
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:15,000
sorry the neural network activation

678
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:16,760
change shape to accommodate the rings

679
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,880
that it thinks corresponds to the

680
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:20,520
particles so we're very happy in my

681
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,440
opinion actually this is a highlight of

682
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:26,080
this work it shows that the neural

683
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:29,279
network is is um uh it has been sort of

684
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:32,120
built in a way that is weaving with the

685
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:34,320
physics that govern this

686
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:36,440
problem the last thing since this is a

687
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,640
nano Center and Bill is coming after me

688
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:40,600
to talk about

689
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:41,799
visualizing uh minuscule motions I

690
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,120
thought I'll show you something that we

691
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:44,640
haven't published yet and that's all

692
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,159
right this now has to do with

693
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,919
nanomechanical motion it is also a

694
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:51,080
synchroton experiment with a different

695
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:53,519
group this is one at Brook Haven and you

696
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:56,600
can see the names here my friends from

697
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:59,440
Northwestern and Stonybrook and we try

698
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:01,519
to characterize motion of nanomechanical

699
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:04,600
devices these are used in a number of

700
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:08,519
applications including Quantum Computing

701
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:10,760
and and and Quantum um basically quasm

702
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:12,399
microscopic behavior of quantum systems

703
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:15,159
very interesting devices but we don't do

704
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:17,399
that horio Espinosa at the Northwestern

705
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:19,080
does it we just help him characterize

706
00:28:17,399 --> 00:28:21,440
the Dynamics of these

707
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:23,279
devices and this looks like an easy

708
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,279
problem but it isn't because we want to

709
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:27,360
do it very very fast and also the

710
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:29,440
problem is very under sampled so if you

711
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,679
had plenty of then you would get the

712
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,919
signals that you see on the left but

713
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:36,679
again I'm not kidding you what you do

714
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:38,480
get is this very very highly under

715
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:41,080
sampled pattern that you see on the

716
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:43,279
right that's our signal this blinking

717
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:46,000
dots that's what you that's the only

718
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:48,120
thing we can rely on okay how we can

719
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,519
pull it off that that sounds that's that

720
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:53,320
sounds really really awful but actually

721
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:55,840
once again we know physics and in this

722
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:59,120
case is not just Optical physics it does

723
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:01,039
come in but also classical Dynamics

724
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:03,080
because this Nome mechanical oscillator

725
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:05,360
is sort of Shifting according to

726
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:07,559
something that we call well the harmonic

727
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:10,080
oscillator or maybe not so harmonic but

728
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:12,320
we can correct for that then we can set

729
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:14,760
up an optimization procedure that will

730
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,559
actually approximate the motion of the

731
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:18,840
mechanical oscillator even though the

732
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:20,799
measurement is terrible right and what

733
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:23,640
you see here is a movie that shows the

734
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:26,240
evolution of this approximation process

735
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:27,799
as we acquire a few time frames doesn't

736
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:30,000
take too many time frames I forget how

737
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:32,600
many but I mean a few I mean a few

738
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,919
hundreds right but not not exceedingly

739
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:37,279
High anyway so that's another thing that

740
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:39,760
was sort of just started playing with uh

741
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:41,880
this is a MRI project funded by the Air

742
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:44,880
Force office of scientific research and

743
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:47,279
we're very excited because uh because um

744
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,480
not only it allows us to characterize

745
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:52,640
complex Dynamics but also again I'm

746
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:54,880
going to steal some of what Brian was

747
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,840
saying it will also in the in principle

748
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,640
allow us to control these processes

749
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:04,159
right both in the matical case and in

750
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:06,679
this um Nano Dynamics it is possible to

751
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:08,679
to use the what we produce to use it for

752
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:10,720
feedback control we haven't done it yet

753
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:12,279
but it's in the works okay I think I'm

754
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,120
going to stop here I'm going to put up

755
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:17,360
all the movies and happy to take your

756
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:17,360
questions thank you very

757
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:23,679
much so just a question George um how do

758
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,440
you see so there's the physics that you

759
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,200
can generate synthetic data with and so

760
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,799
of use it to hear but there's been a lot

761
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,960
of talk as well about how do you embed

762
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:34,519
physics into the into the network maybe

763
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:36,640
you could opine about that yeah I mean

764
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:38,159
that's exactly what we did in this uh

765
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:41,000
actually in both cases this is one

766
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:44,279
evidence as I was arguing before um in

767
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,559
the nanomechanical oscillator um

768
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:49,000
basically the way this works again I'm

769
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:51,600
going to borrow something that Brian

770
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,440
said what this is trying to do is he

771
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:57,120
trying to

772
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:59,799
guess given this horrible data it is

773
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:02,880
trying to guess what is the best match

774
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:06,559
of an object that is likely to have

775
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:09,519
produced this horrible jumping dots the

776
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:12,440
difference is that um here it is not

777
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:14,480
only considering a static object but it

778
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:18,200
is actually taken into account the

779
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:20,440
sequence of the frames that come as the

780
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,760
oscillator is moving right sorry I keep

781
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,799
saying oscillator I should say the

782
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:27,559
canver right as the can liver is moving

783
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:29,440
it is taken into account so so basically

784
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:31,480
what you have here Brian is you have a

785
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,760
differential a set of differential

786
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:35,399
equations which are built in the neural

787
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,320
network I don't know how else I can say

788
00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:39,399
it without so in equations here and I

789
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:42,200
don't want to spill equations into your

790
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:45,200
nice afternoon but but um but yes there

791
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:46,799
is a way to write differential equations

792
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,039
that you may remember with nightmares

793
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:51,880
from your college days or whatever it

794
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:55,279
there's a way to weave differential

795
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:58,159
equations with the kernels that deep

796
00:31:55,279 --> 00:32:01,600
learning uses to operate this is what we

797
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:03,240
have done here and and um and it is

798
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,399
actually some of our colleagues at MIT

799
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:07,720
Alan Edelman and Chris raaas who

800
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:11,279
pioneered this kind of idea what we've

801
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:14,080
done here is basically similar to to

802
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:16,799
theirs but we've added Optical physics

803
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:20,960
right we basically added the the

804
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:23,279
observation uh model if you wish to to

805
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,600
solve this very difficult problem so so

806
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:27,480
I think this is actually where the

807
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:29,240
future is because uh because physical

808
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:32,639
system

809
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:36,519
are very often involve complex processes

810
00:32:32,639 --> 00:32:39,000
complex Dynamics uh mixing uh

811
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:41,000
complicated movements and not

812
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,120
necessarily robotics I mean this nanome

813
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,760
mechanical actuator is just as

814
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:48,320
complicated as a robot actually if you

815
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:49,799
want to look at it in detail and uh yeah

816
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,679
I think there's are opportunities there

817
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:53,960
to get quantitative models where

818
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:55,320
previously we couldn't so is I think

819
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:59,480
it's very

820
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:59,480
exciting thank you

821
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,080
okay so uh next up uh Bill Freeman um

822
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:10,480
and sort of you know seeing motions big

823
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:10,480
and small and hopefully at all

824
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:18,720
scales thank you and thanks for the

825
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:22,279
invitation to be here so this is uh work

826
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:24,760
that's been we've done over many years

827
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:27,159
uh involving many people but the primary

828
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:29,039
contributors uh in addition to me uh are

829
00:33:27,159 --> 00:33:32,600
there on the bottom Mickey Rubenstein

830
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:35,480
Neil wadwa and Professor Fred Durand at

831
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:39,279
MIT so

832
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:41,399
um science progresses in many ways by

833
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:44,279
having Imaging techniques that let us

834
00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:46,840
see things that we can't see otherwise

835
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:49,360
uh of course telescopes and microscopes

836
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:51,120
have uh let us understand the world in

837
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,519
ways that we couldn't without

838
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:56,720
them and what we wanted to do is

839
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:59,399
introduce a an analogous thing uh

840
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:01,320
instead of amplifying the size of an

841
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:03,760
image we want to amplify the motion of

842
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:05,840
an image and I want to show you uh

843
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:08,879
examples of that so here's an input

844
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:10,800
video of a baby and often parents of

845
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:14,000
perfectly healthy newborn babies ask is

846
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:15,200
the baby breathing and so now we can we

847
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,720
can see whether or not the baby's

848
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:23,560
breathing with this motion magnification

849
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:26,560
technique um and it works not only for

850
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:29,359
uh small people but also for large

851
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,800
structures um so here's a crane and you

852
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:33,839
know that thing's you know blowing in

853
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,320
the wind but you can't really see it and

854
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:38,760
but if you motion magnify it then you

855
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:40,440
can see those motions so how does it

856
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:42,720
benefit us to look at these tiny motions

857
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:44,800
and amplify them well one thing is I

858
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:46,720
have this sort of Mantra that um big

859
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,960
catastrophic motions are often preceded

860
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:50,560
by tiny almost invisible motions so if

861
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,480
you can image these tiny motions ahead

862
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:55,119
of time that's going to be useful and

863
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:57,119
also you can learn things about the

864
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:58,480
structure of the deorations by seeing it

865
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:00,880
that you might not

866
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,920
be able to otherwise um so okay these

867
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,200
next slides are just to persuade you

868
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:06,119
that this would be something that's easy

869
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:08,960
to do you could do it in real time on

870
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:10,079
lowcost Hardware uh and just to tell you

871
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,839
how we do it there are a number of ways

872
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:13,880
to do it but here's one simple way if

873
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:16,599
you take the image and instead of

874
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:19,119
represented by pixels represented as uh

875
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:24,000
s and cosine phase little wavelets like

876
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:25,480
are shown here um so you would take a

877
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,359
that that phase plate at the top left

878
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:31,440
and you'd represent it by the the um

879
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:33,920
filter responses shown at the bottom um

880
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:37,400
you you'd have these s and cosine phase

881
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:40,560
wavelets at oh I have laser pointer here

882
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:43,839
how about I don't

883
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:48,119
sorry the bottom button ah yes says

884
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:51,560
laser okay you have these uh s and

885
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:52,880
cosine uh s and cosine phase filters uh

886
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:55,680
at all different orientations and all

887
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,640
different scales and so here's four

888
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,560
different orientations here's the

889
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:01,119
different scales and you measure sign

890
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,800
and cosine response a tiny motion just

891
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:05,920
changes the phase the relative phase of

892
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:07,480
the S filter and the cosine filter just

893
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:11,040
by a tiny amount but you can measure

894
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:14,560
that and amplify it and um

895
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:16,960
sorry using this architecture you can

896
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:18,760
then uh have a very simple real-time

897
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,560
system that takes an input video and

898
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:22,240
gives you a modified output video with

899
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:24,680
the Motions

900
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:27,000
Amplified uh I should say as an aside

901
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:29,560
you can also amplify colors in a kind of

902
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,640
analogous way here's on the left is

903
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:36,200
someone uh just staring at us and on the

904
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:37,960
right is a video uh of with the the

905
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:40,760
small color change is Amplified again

906
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:44,480
showing the benefits of visualizing uh

907
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:46,040
things in a video so I got to say this

908
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,520
was one of the most funnest most

909
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,839
enjoyable research projects I've had

910
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,560
because I get to kind of look around the

911
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:53,359
world and ask where might there be tiny

912
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:55,280
motions that would look interesting if

913
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:56,720
we amplifi them and so I just want to

914
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,119
show you a number of examples this is

915
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:00,079
okay the rest of talk is just a number

916
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:02,800
of examples okay and what I'm hoping

917
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:05,319
you'll do is think you know how might I

918
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,560
use this in my own work and uh you know

919
00:37:05,319 --> 00:37:10,520
feel free to get in touch with me I'd

920
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:13,560
love to um expand our set of examples to

921
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:15,640
new things and um you know there could

922
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:20,280
be a useful collaboration to come out of

923
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:22,680
this so um it's useful in physics uh so

924
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:25,839
here is a highspeed

925
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:27,640
video there that it's a PVC pipe viewed

926
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:30,200
end on it's a highspeed video that

927
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:32,359
little Hammer comes down and hits it

928
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:34,400
that's the input video now you know from

929
00:37:32,359 --> 00:37:36,640
your high school physics classes what

930
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,079
really happens when you uh hit the thing

931
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,480
it kind of rings like a bell and there

932
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:42,040
these normal modes that are excited and

933
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:45,720
we can see those just from that input

934
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:48,920
video if we filter temporarily to um

935
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:50,560
amplify motions at a very narrow band of

936
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:52,280
frequencies that correspond to these

937
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,480
normal modes and you can search for the

938
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:56,119
normal modes and find them then you can

939
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,880
get these produce these output videos

940
00:37:56,119 --> 00:38:01,520
that came all from that input video on

941
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:04,880
the far left um and you can you know see

942
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:06,359
that the uh okay the the the amplitudes

943
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:09,240
of the normal modes and how they what

944
00:38:06,359 --> 00:38:11,280
their shapes are um and I'm told that if

945
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:12,880
there's a fracture in the pipe it

946
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,680
changes the normal mode structure and

947
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:19,640
you could perhaps identify

948
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:21,280
that um so again you know asking

949
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:22,839
physicist friends where are there small

950
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:25,520
things in the world that that uh are

951
00:38:22,839 --> 00:38:27,560
useful so the transition to turbulence

952
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,560
involves small oscillations that become

953
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:31,440
bigger oscillations there's something

954
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:33,400
called a tling sliting wave which is a

955
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:36,079
streamwise instability and laminer flow

956
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:39,119
so here's some incense you visualize in

957
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:41,200
video um there it is it's easier to see

958
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:43,079
what's going on if you freeze a frame so

959
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:45,119
on the left is a frozen frame of the

960
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:47,599
input video on the right is a frozen

961
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:50,319
frame of the motion magnified video and

962
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:52,480
there you can see this again streamwise

963
00:38:50,319 --> 00:38:54,880
instability uh sinusoid that gets bigger

964
00:38:52,480 --> 00:39:00,560
and bigger and then finally

965
00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:00,560
um goes unstable in the uh transition to

966
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:08,319
turbulence um okay

967
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:11,280
engineering so this is

968
00:39:08,319 --> 00:39:14,800
um a the inverted the uh inverted

969
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:16,960
pendulum problem so this is from RR lab

970
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,680
uh they had a a control it's it's the

971
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,240
pole balancing problem but even made

972
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:22,319
even harder because it's got two joints

973
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,480
to it and this poor little controller at

974
00:39:22,319 --> 00:39:27,079
the

975
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:29,760
bottom has to uh move this thing around

976
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:31,640
so doesn't fall over the evil graduate

977
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,800
students in the one on the right they

978
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:36,400
loosen the bolts so it's not the system

979
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:38,119
that the controller is expecting to see

980
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,440
and in the slow ordinary slow motion

981
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:41,480
video you really can't see much of a

982
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,920
difference between these two conditions

983
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:48,040
but in the if you take those input

984
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:50,400
videos we just saw and motion magnify

985
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:52,640
them uh then you can see that the one on

986
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,400
the right with the Loos and bolts is

987
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,640
kind of struggling to to control this

988
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,040
thing because it's not behaving the way

989
00:39:55,640 --> 00:40:02,680
it expects it to behave because it's a

990
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:02,680
different um system than it was trained

991
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:08,319
on okay here's one that's fun this is

992
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:11,000
the bridge um in Portsmouth New

993
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:14,400
Hampshire from New Hampshire to Maine

994
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:17,200
it's got this uh structure that comes

995
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,839
down it's like a draw bridge but it's

996
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,520
horizontal and parallel and when it

997
00:40:18,839 --> 00:40:23,079
comes down it gives a the the bridge a

998
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:25,000
kind of a kick so then we went up there

999
00:40:23,079 --> 00:40:27,800
and and just ordinary frame ordinary

1000
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,520
Speed video we filmed

1001
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:31,880
the bridge

1002
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:34,560
um after the thing came down and gave it

1003
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:36,839
a kick nothing nothing to worry about

1004
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,880
everything's fine uh but if you motion

1005
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:41,200
magnify it and select the frequency of

1006
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,520
the torsional mode you can actually

1007
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,520
visualize what's going on with the

1008
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:48,240
bridge after that thing comes down and

1009
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:50,560
gives a little kick and you know there's

1010
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:52,280
tiny motions on the bridge that that um

1011
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,599
I think you don't even feel if you're on

1012
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:56,640
the

1013
00:40:53,599 --> 00:41:00,520
bridge um and again maybe these small

1014
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:04,079
motions will useful to uh catch

1015
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:05,800
instabilities before they become big uh

1016
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,880
instabilities and then it's fun to look

1017
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:11,240
at people

1018
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:13,839
too so here's my daughter and um I asked

1019
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:17,079
her just to stay still so the top left

1020
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:19,760
picture is the input video of a person

1021
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:21,680
just staying still then we motion

1022
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:25,119
magnify different temporal frequency

1023
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:28,240
components of that top left video so the

1024
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:31,200
top right video is low fre quen is

1025
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:33,520
Amplified and what can you identify

1026
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:35,599
there well to me it looks like uh the

1027
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,839
breathing is Amplified and we can now

1028
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:40,839
see the the

1029
00:41:36,839 --> 00:41:42,880
breathing um the bottom left is kind of

1030
00:41:40,839 --> 00:41:45,359
midband frequencies one to two Hertz

1031
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:48,079
Amplified and there you see these little

1032
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:49,880
uh micro expressions and then people

1033
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:52,560
often ask can you tell what she's

1034
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:55,400
thinking uh from those and you know we

1035
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:58,640
have no idea I really don't know if

1036
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:59,680
those imperceptible facial Chang changes

1037
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:02,240
have anything to do with what she's

1038
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:04,240
thinking but you could look into that

1039
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:06,119
and then the bottom right is high

1040
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:07,839
frequency Amplified and you can kind of

1041
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:09,640
see the isod a little bit and you can

1042
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:12,319
also see that we're starting to amplify

1043
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:15,440
uh noise in the background cabinets just

1044
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:15,440
from the uh

1045
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:21,079
sensor and you know the beauty of the

1046
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:23,079
web is you can post the code online and

1047
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:25,559
people use it so there a graphic design

1048
00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:27,440
student in Yale made this uh composite

1049
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:29,359
of on the left side is the input videos

1050
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:33,319
on the right side or motion magnified

1051
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:36,200
videos I thought that was a nice

1052
00:42:33,319 --> 00:42:38,920
design um and here's another one this is

1053
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:42,400
also a pole balancing problem uh a a

1054
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:44,160
ballet dancer stands on one foot and you

1055
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,760
know that there's all sorts of control

1056
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:49,119
going on to keep her from falling over

1057
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:50,599
but now we can actually see it uh

1058
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:52,680
Amplified so on the left is the input

1059
00:42:50,599 --> 00:42:55,119
video you know she's she's perfectly

1060
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:56,599
motionless it seems and on the right we

1061
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:59,920
can see all the control that she's

1062
00:42:56,599 --> 00:42:59,920
having to do to keep from falling

1063
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:06,559
over

1064
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:09,119
um here's one again that was uh

1065
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:11,800
contributed by the public uh someone

1066
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:15,210
posted this using our software uh you

1067
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:17,599
can visualize uh motions of a baby in

1068
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:21,359
[Music]

1069
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:23,359
uo um the eye moves so here's again left

1070
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:25,079
is input right is output and you can see

1071
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:27,920
these micro

1072
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:30,000
cads and it looks like a you know know

1073
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:32,680
bowl of jelly underwater which I think

1074
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:37,000
is probably close to what it really is

1075
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:37,000
um Jello underwater

1076
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:42,119
um and this one's fun this is Mickey

1077
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:45,880
Rubenstein one of the primary graduate

1078
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:48,200
students who did this work um here it's

1079
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:49,480
high speed so the video we amplifi can

1080
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:51,319
be ordinary speed or it can be high

1081
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:53,800
speed here it's highp Speed video and

1082
00:43:51,319 --> 00:43:57,200
he's going to sing for

1083
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:59,040
us uh

1084
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:02,160
okay and then we record the sound and we

1085
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:03,680
record the uh frequency response from

1086
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:07,160
the audio you can see that at the far

1087
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:10,319
right so let's grab the base the

1088
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:11,400
fundamental frequency there and mo

1089
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:13,800
motion

1090
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:16,319
amplify only only oscillations in the

1091
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:17,880
input video which are at that temporal

1092
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:19,119
frequency and again this is

1093
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:21,800
straightforward to do you just filter

1094
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:24,480
each of those coefficient pairs narrow

1095
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:26,839
band filter for that frequency and and

1096
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:29,200
reveal what's going on in the throat so

1097
00:44:26,839 --> 00:44:31,440
that's on the right now you can see the

1098
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:34,920
the the vibrations from the outside of

1099
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:37,680
the vocal cords as he makes that

1100
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:40,359
sound um you can go and grab the first

1101
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:42,319
harmonic so this is twice as fast and

1102
00:44:40,359 --> 00:44:44,720
you can see the little nonlinearities in

1103
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:46,359
the mechanical system uh they're ulating

1104
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:49,440
at twice the fundamental

1105
00:44:46,359 --> 00:44:52,200
frequency um as a control we Amplified a

1106
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:54,839
non harmonically related frequency and

1107
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:58,359
you don't see anything special which is

1108
00:44:54,839 --> 00:45:01,520
good um okay and then so finally this

1109
00:44:58,359 --> 00:45:03,440
one relates to Nano but all these so I

1110
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:05,200
guess the point is you can do this with

1111
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:06,720
telescope data you can do it with

1112
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:09,760
photographic data you can do it with

1113
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:12,359
microscope data all you need is input a

1114
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:13,760
video and it can be an ordinary frame

1115
00:45:12,359 --> 00:45:14,720
rate video it can be a highspeed frame

1116
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:17,200
rate

1117
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:20,440
video and maybe there are useful things

1118
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:22,480
going on in your microscope images that

1119
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:24,400
you could usefully ampli amplify the

1120
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,800
Motions of and see something that you

1121
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,880
see some structure there that you

1122
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:29,760
weren't able to see before so here's an

1123
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:32,800
example of that this is from uh Denny

1124
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:35,559
Freeman's lab no relation to me uh but

1125
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:39,000
we work together and uh he is interested

1126
00:45:35,559 --> 00:45:44,240
in um acoustic waves across a particular

1127
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:46,160
membrane in the inner ear um and so uh

1128
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:48,599
there it is you know there's the top is

1129
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,760
the input video and what he had done

1130
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:51,440
before we started working together on

1131
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:54,160
this he would he could measure the the

1132
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:55,760
amplitude of oscillation of the membrane

1133
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,480
you can do that but but somehow

1134
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:59,359
visualizing it really bring at home and

1135
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:00,720
let's you see the form of it and they

1136
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:03,359
use that for their talks when they

1137
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:04,400
describe it even though we're not adding

1138
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:05,760
new data we're just adding a

1139
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:09,960
visualization of

1140
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:14,119
this um let me just sorry go back to

1141
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:17,960
there um and

1142
00:46:14,119 --> 00:46:24,480
um oh yeah and then one last thing

1143
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:26,760
uh sorry let me okay here's a a

1144
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,720
cup it's not a wine glass so it's not

1145
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:31,200
quite quite out the resonance that a

1146
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:33,960
wine glass would have but but

1147
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:36,400
um you can hear it ping so you know it's

1148
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:40,200
oscillating but have you ever seen it

1149
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:42,520
oscillate no why not there's two reasons

1150
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:44,680
why you haven't seen it oscillate and

1151
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:45,440
when say what they are or what one of

1152
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:48,359
them

1153
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:49,559
is so one reason you haven't seen wine

1154
00:46:48,359 --> 00:46:51,720
glass oscillate is because the

1155
00:46:49,559 --> 00:46:53,880
oscillation is too small so we'll take

1156
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:55,280
care of that with motion magnification a

1157
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:57,160
second reason you haven't seen oscillate

1158
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,880
is the frequency is too high it's like

1159
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:00,680
you know 500 Herz or something we can't

1160
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:02,280
see that and so what we're going to do

1161
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:05,319
is we use a special camera here that

1162
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:07,800
just grabs 1 Mill second of exposure

1163
00:47:05,319 --> 00:47:10,800
each frame and so we're going to Alias

1164
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:12,559
down or beat down the the this high

1165
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:15,040
frequency of oscillation down to a a

1166
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:17,240
frequency band that we can see visually

1167
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:20,400
and and that gives us a live demo that

1168
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:22,359
I'm showing you a video of that lets you

1169
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:24,960
visualize a wine glass oscillating and

1170
00:47:22,359 --> 00:47:27,640
then this this beep that you heard uh we

1171
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:31,359
we have set up a speaker next to it and

1172
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:35,319
and uh um play it at the glass and then

1173
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:35,319
you can it allows you then to watch the

1174
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:39,319
thing oscillate in real

1175
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:46,800
time so now you can see a a wine glass

1176
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:46,800
oscillating in response to a

1177
00:47:48,119 --> 00:47:54,960
sound um and again the the the special

1178
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:56,960
camera took care of putting it into a

1179
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:58,599
band that you can see visually and and

1180
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:01,240
then the motion magnification took care

1181
00:47:58,599 --> 00:48:04,079
of it amplifying it so you could see it

1182
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:07,480
also um so

1183
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:09,319
I I um really think that this is going

1184
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:11,400
to be useful for internal diagnostic

1185
00:48:09,319 --> 00:48:13,599
medical imaging you know the the the

1186
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:15,079
canonical picture of a doctor is someone

1187
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:17,280
with a stethoscope around their neck

1188
00:48:15,079 --> 00:48:19,160
what's a stethoscope well it takes audio

1189
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:21,920
and amplifies it that's motion

1190
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:24,480
magnification but at the audio bands

1191
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:27,359
surely it it's going to be useful I

1192
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:30,040
think without without any basis uh

1193
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:32,760
surely it might be useful to amplify

1194
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:34,760
motions in in diagnostic video Imaging

1195
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:37,480
as well and maybe there'll be diagnostic

1196
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:39,480
value to amplifying small motions inside

1197
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:43,119
the body so we're exploring that in

1198
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:46,760
collaboration with Brian and his team um

1199
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:46,760
and I think there's a lot to be done

1200
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:52,200
there so that's the story um this is a

1201
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:53,599
tool I think it has a lot of uses I'd

1202
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:56,599
love to hear your

1203
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:58,160
applications and that's it thanks very

1204
00:48:56,599 --> 00:49:04,799
much

1205
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:07,359
[Applause]

1206
00:49:04,799 --> 00:49:09,599
so let you pick the uh which which which

1207
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:11,880
question you'd like to

1208
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:12,520
sorry um what are the stability I'll

1209
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:15,599
just

1210
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:16,799
go uh there's two tied for one what are

1211
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:21,040
the stability requirements from The

1212
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:22,920
Source video ah yes can uh so yes it can

1213
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:26,119
be implemented with microscope images

1214
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:29,520
and videos thank you um augmentation

1215
00:49:26,119 --> 00:49:30,640
bias or SEL itive you have to so there's

1216
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,280
two restrictions I didn't quite have

1217
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:34,880
time to go into one is every one of

1218
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:37,240
these things was on a tripod because you

1219
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:38,599
um you want to separate out the camera

1220
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:40,480
motion from the motion of the thing

1221
00:49:38,599 --> 00:49:42,760
you're amplifying the Motions of the

1222
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:45,200
subject motion so it's easiest if you

1223
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:47,559
just have the camera Frozen and then you

1224
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:49,160
uh amplify the signal so that's happens

1225
00:49:47,559 --> 00:49:50,520
kind of naturally with a microscope

1226
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:52,000
application it happens naturally with

1227
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:54,799
telescope applications but with handheld

1228
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,920
cameras you have to put it on a tripod

1229
00:49:54,799 --> 00:49:59,559
um and then for all these cases also so

1230
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:02,240
we we uh we're actively selected what

1231
00:49:59,559 --> 00:50:04,680
frequencies to amplify and that matters

1232
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:06,160
um it could be of interest to explore an

1233
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:07,440
automatic selection but we haven't done

1234
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:10,520
that

1235
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:12,799
yet and then the second one could motion

1236
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:15,319
magnification be coupled with FAA

1237
00:50:12,799 --> 00:50:17,720
structural model deflection to predict

1238
00:50:15,319 --> 00:50:19,480
failure points um finite element

1239
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:21,880
analysis right

1240
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:24,640
um

1241
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:26,119
um so okay yes is the answer sorry I'm

1242
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:28,920
just thinking through right now is all

1243
00:50:26,119 --> 00:50:30,599
pixel-based but yes you could uh

1244
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:33,520
presumably do it in a finite element

1245
00:50:30,599 --> 00:50:35,920
representation as well and I I think um

1246
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:37,200
that might be value um again you know

1247
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,720
we're not giving you measurements that

1248
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:41,680
you didn't have but we're letting you

1249
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:45,880
see them in a kind of intuitive and

1250
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:47,839
understandable way um for the can the

1251
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:51,599
motion amplification be done if the

1252
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:51,599
video is acquired with a sparse array of

1253
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:58,000
receiver uh see so there was no acoustic

1254
00:50:55,480 --> 00:51:00,319
image that I showed um we had one where

1255
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:03,960
we recorded things with a single

1256
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:05,760
microphone um but we did it was a 2d uh

1257
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:10,880
highspeed video of the

1258
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:12,359
throat um yes you can well it might be

1259
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,920
uh for this question you might be

1260
00:51:12,359 --> 00:51:17,640
challenged if you to make an image from

1261
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:19,200
the sparer ray of receivers uh so in

1262
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:20,599
many sense I think requires really an

1263
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,599
image coming in so maybe the answer is

1264
00:51:20,599 --> 00:51:25,540
no on that one so Bill thank you very

1265
00:51:22,599 --> 00:51:28,640
much thanks

1266
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:31,319
[Applause]

1267
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:33,079
okay Julie come on up and we'll we'll

1268
00:51:31,319 --> 00:51:35,760
impact the physical with the with the

1269
00:51:33,079 --> 00:51:35,760
algorithms as

1270
00:51:37,319 --> 00:51:44,079
well well uh great to be here uh so

1271
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:46,520
initially I saw this uh Symposium is on

1272
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:48,559
modeling uh at atomic scale so actually

1273
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:50,920
we do have some work on fitting the

1274
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:53,079
entire periodic table uh we're able to

1275
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:55,640
do uh simulations with Quantum

1276
00:51:53,079 --> 00:51:58,280
simulation accuracy but much faster but

1277
00:51:55,640 --> 00:52:00,559
then I found out this is really uh uh

1278
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:03,280
about Optical Imaging computer vision so

1279
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:05,880
we do actually have uh quite a bit of

1280
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:08,760
generative AI from um mining the

1281
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:10,720
literature data to come up with uh newer

1282
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:13,040
molecular designs for for example

1283
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:15,359
batteries and here you see mixing

1284
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:17,359
several flu together electrolytes for

1285
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:19,240
Batteries there still human that sort of

1286
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:23,960
operating on these kind of

1287
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:25,839
workflows and uh recently uh with ton PC

1288
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:28,640
we have been discussing you know what

1289
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:30,799
kind of pitfall we have in this kind of

1290
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:33,480
autonomous experiments and it's turns

1291
00:52:30,799 --> 00:52:35,920
out that uh a lot of irreproducibility

1292
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:37,920
issues you would think that with robots

1293
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:39,760
they wouldn't uh make mistakes but it

1294
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:41,839
turns out that there's still a lot of

1295
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:44,880
like cognitive issues uh even when you

1296
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:47,400
use robots and sometimes uh you also can

1297
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:49,520
find that by changing the hypothesis uh

1298
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:51,200
even So-Cal failed experiment for

1299
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:53,319
example the discovery penicillin is

1300
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:55,440
really come out of a failed bacterial

1301
00:52:53,319 --> 00:52:57,200
growth experiment so by just changing

1302
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:59,520
the hypothesis because there is really

1303
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:01,599
no wrong experiment it's really wrong uh

1304
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:03,480
mind models if you change the Mind model

1305
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:06,599
then you can turn a failed experiment to

1306
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:08,200
a successful experiment so uh in my lab

1307
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:10,200
we've been looking at this multim

1308
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:13,400
metallic uh Nano catalyst so here we're

1309
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:16,040
mixing a few uh salt precursors and then

1310
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:18,559
we drop them on carbon paper uh and then

1311
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:20,760
later is fast forward we heat it up and

1312
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:23,520
then we cut into electrodes we do this

1313
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:25,319
test in uh three electrode experiments

1314
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:28,280
and we're using active learning to

1315
00:53:25,319 --> 00:53:30,760
change recipe on the fly and uh you know

1316
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:33,440
we do hundreds of experiments uh in in a

1317
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:37,799
campaign to sort of uh do optimization

1318
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:41,200
in a in a multicomponent uh alloy space

1319
00:53:37,799 --> 00:53:43,599
and uh it's kind of uh surprising that

1320
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:45,720
uh it took actually more than a year for

1321
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:48,200
us to get consistent results meaning

1322
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:51,440
that uh if we do these different recipes

1323
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:53,680
on the bottom nominally same uh a mon in

1324
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:56,119
between we can get roughly similar

1325
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:58,920
results uh so what other kind of problem

1326
00:53:56,119 --> 00:54:01,319
we have for example uh here I'm just

1327
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:03,680
showing this liquid drop a pad

1328
00:54:01,319 --> 00:54:06,319
experiment and you will notice that the

1329
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:08,839
droplet size uh is not actually the same

1330
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:11,720
so the speed at which it gets wetted

1331
00:54:08,839 --> 00:54:13,280
into carbon strip is is different and

1332
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:14,960
initially we thought okay that's maybe

1333
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:17,920
because of the supplier didn't not give

1334
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:20,480
us a uniform material uh that's actually

1335
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:23,280
one uh possible reason but later we

1336
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:26,079
found that uh just like Bill mentioned

1337
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:29,000
uh very small uh perturbations actually

1338
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:31,839
we because we shock the carbon strip uh

1339
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:33,640
sometimes they're not fully flat uh and

1340
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:38,000
so we have this curvature so you know at

1341
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:39,480
some point uh we have this uh uh uh U

1342
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,440
you know bigger drop plate sometime it

1343
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:43,480
doesn't even drop at all so it's only

1344
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:47,319
through kind of a computer vision that

1345
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:49,839
we can actually find that and then uh we

1346
00:54:47,319 --> 00:54:52,359
got this kind of garbage data because um

1347
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:55,119
many different problems one is for

1348
00:54:52,359 --> 00:54:58,160
example after a while the copper holder

1349
00:54:55,119 --> 00:55:00,640
got corroded and uh the solution is we

1350
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:02,880
bought a few hundred dollars of gold and

1351
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:05,280
that solved that problem so we actually

1352
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:07,920
identified uh a lot of different problem

1353
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:10,240
the most sort of uh embarrassing problem

1354
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:12,480
is is this one because this hit sort of

1355
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:14,960
right beneath our eyes so I can really

1356
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:17,400
appreciate what build it's sort of right

1357
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:19,400
we we we see it uh but we didn't catch

1358
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:21,720
it so what happened was we're trying to

1359
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:24,960
mix multiple liquids and this is what

1360
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:27,400
should happen we're mixing two fluids uh

1361
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:29,880
two different kind of salts and uh we're

1362
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:33,240
doing this aspiration up and down uh in

1363
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:36,079
a bit uh and that homogenized the fluid

1364
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:38,200
that's what should happen uh but what

1365
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:42,640
actually happened for more than a year

1366
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:45,119
half a year is uh we use a smaller pipet

1367
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:47,079
and we thought it's homogenized but

1368
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:49,640
because this plate is actually beneath

1369
00:55:47,079 --> 00:55:52,440
us so we're looking at from top down and

1370
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:54,640
sort of just hiding in plain sight and

1371
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:56,599
really give us a lot of garbage data

1372
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:58,559
because what we think we made was not

1373
00:55:56,599 --> 00:56:01,960
what we actually made and drop on the

1374
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:05,400
carbon paper uh so we cause these uh

1375
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:08,799
seral killers in the AI City uh so we

1376
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:10,760
have uh cable Monsters uh so if you buy

1377
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:13,880
the cheap cables from Amazon they

1378
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:16,680
somehow don't work uh we have these uh

1379
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:20,799
uh temperature in homogeneities uh we

1380
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:22,839
have this coffee ring Monster uh this uh

1381
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:25,039
U you know we have a magnetic stirer uh

1382
00:56:22,839 --> 00:56:28,280
in in this uh Beaker and sometime it

1383
00:56:25,039 --> 00:56:31,240
just drops for whatever reason so uh we

1384
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:33,559
actually made this kind of uh things uh

1385
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:35,200
just to uh sort of as as examples of

1386
00:56:33,559 --> 00:56:37,039
future AI may be able to sort of

1387
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:42,160
diagnose these

1388
00:56:37,039 --> 00:56:45,799
issues uh but uh what we come to realize

1389
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:50,400
that we probably can use AI itself uh to

1390
00:56:45,799 --> 00:56:52,680
diagnose uh these problems uh it's uh uh

1391
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:54,680
very important that you know experiment

1392
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:57,319
is very different from a program because

1393
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:59,079
in programs uh you can uh always

1394
00:56:57,319 --> 00:57:02,079
reproduce the same error but what we

1395
00:56:59,079 --> 00:57:04,640
found is very often for example uh even

1396
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:06,640
if an experimentalist is did everything

1397
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:08,520
correct but so you know his labmate did

1398
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:10,760
something wrong in the glove box that

1399
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:13,200
messed his whole experiment up and I

1400
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:15,559
have a situation where I had a postto

1401
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:17,079
who uh you know had a beaker which

1402
00:57:15,559 --> 00:57:19,200
looked like this versus a beaker like

1403
00:57:17,079 --> 00:57:21,799
this for battery Castle give different

1404
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:23,880
results also I had a Korean postar who

1405
00:57:21,799 --> 00:57:26,280
is leaving and I had two students just

1406
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:29,000
follow him from day to the evening

1407
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:30,640
follow an a synthesis experiment and

1408
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,799
they took good notes and they did

1409
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:34,880
everything but when The postto Returned

1410
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:38,920
they just couldn't repeat uh the result

1411
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:42,200
so all kinds of issues uh so what we

1412
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:45,280
think uh we can do is is really to uh

1413
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:48,400
use large multimodal models and language

1414
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:50,559
to assist the debugging of experimental

1415
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:53,440
processes so here uh would have S this

1416
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:57,000
is my pH student J he's now doing a

1417
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:59,680
startup company so using the laser

1418
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:02,200
cutting ma to cut plywood for making a

1419
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:04,400
sample stage I set the laser cutting

1420
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:06,760
parameters assistant across the sample

1421
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:09,200
stage but apparently I got a failure

1422
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:13,480
piece could you analyze this

1423
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:13,480
phenomenon hey meta take a

1424
00:58:24,119 --> 00:58:29,920
picture the image analysis reveals two

1425
00:58:26,839 --> 00:58:32,359
main anomalies non-uniform cut depths

1426
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:34,160
and some charring these could be due to

1427
00:58:32,359 --> 00:58:36,440
inconsistent material density or

1428
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:39,079
variations in the plywood's thickness

1429
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:41,319
resulting in uneven Cuts despite uniform

1430
00:58:39,079 --> 00:58:43,119
settings another possibility is that the

1431
00:58:41,319 --> 00:58:45,240
Laser's focal point or distance may have

1432
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:47,400
shifted during The Cutting process

1433
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:48,839
causing inconsistency in cutting depths

1434
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:51,599
and potential

1435
00:58:48,839 --> 00:58:54,359
Charing so so what's interesting is this

1436
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:56,319
is zero shot learning meaning all juu

1437
00:58:54,359 --> 00:59:01,440
did was to ask that question and then

1438
00:58:56,319 --> 00:59:04,559
send an image uh and it seems that the

1439
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:06,880
uh CH GPT is is able to uh give

1440
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:08,839
reasonable hypothesis on on why uh you

1441
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:11,079
know that happened so what we try to do

1442
00:59:08,839 --> 00:59:12,520
is to prevent uh cross contamination

1443
00:59:11,079 --> 00:59:14,880
between two different drop plate so we

1444
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:17,799
made actually this holder to isolate the

1445
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:20,160
drop but then during the laser we

1446
00:59:17,799 --> 00:59:22,280
eventually had a stainless steel uh this

1447
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:24,280
a holder but when we use wood to do the

1448
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:26,799
initial prototype you know it kind of

1449
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:30,440
called fire but then you know what what

1450
00:59:26,799 --> 00:59:32,160
what happened is the AI wasn't trained

1451
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:34,319
specifically on laser cutting wood but

1452
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:35,599
apparently it have seen maybe something

1453
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:37,119
about lasers and something about

1454
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:39,359
carpentry and is able to come up with

1455
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:42,039
reasonable actual hypothesis on what

1456
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:45,680
happened so now uh we're having this log

1457
00:59:42,039 --> 00:59:48,480
agents where uh the uh the student just

1458
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:49,920
have this camcorder and uh it's just

1459
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:52,880
capturing all the things and you don't

1460
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:55,480
need to even write logs anymore uh so we

1461
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:59,000
are using it to just capture uh what

1462
00:59:55,480 --> 01:00:02,000
happens in the lab and this enables the

1463
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:04,400
searching but more importantly uh allows

1464
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:06,640
us to ask questions on on what might

1465
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:09,280
happen what might cause some kind of

1466
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:11,520
irreproducibility in the system and

1467
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:15,359
another very interesting thing is uh now

1468
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:17,920
we have a script driven sem so uh this

1469
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:21,119
is uh fully automatic you just use

1470
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:24,319
software to move the microscope around

1471
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:27,640
but then uh we now ask GPT to maybe for

1472
01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:31,039
the first time to control this sem uh

1473
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:33,640
and identify Marite versus uh austinite

1474
01:00:31,039 --> 01:00:35,720
so this is a piece of Steel sample they

1475
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:38,839
just lying somewhere in the

1476
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:40,640
lab and we have this Crest system CR

1477
01:00:38,839 --> 01:00:43,319
please take a picture of the boundary

1478
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:46,119
between the austinite and maride with

1479
01:00:43,319 --> 01:00:47,960
field width of 80 microns yeah initially

1480
01:00:46,119 --> 01:00:50,599
see it's a merchandise not Mar side but

1481
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:52,620
later he recognized it's it's a material

1482
01:00:50,599 --> 01:00:54,240
science problem so change it to Martin

1483
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:57,559
[Music]

1484
01:00:54,240 --> 01:01:00,520
side so no h control at all we just give

1485
01:00:57,559 --> 01:01:02,599
it a goal and then it's sort of Auto GPT

1486
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:06,720
but in the physical world it it use a

1487
01:01:02,599 --> 01:01:08,799
script to move the semm uh image uh

1488
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:11,359
Center and then Zoom uh and then there's

1489
01:01:08,799 --> 01:01:12,960
another thing which is segment M so only

1490
01:01:11,359 --> 01:01:15,599
three

1491
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:18,000
operations uh

1492
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:20,640
and I should say that this is a

1493
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:22,799
successful example uh the success rate

1494
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:24,720
initially is pretty low it's like 20%

1495
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:27,599
it's like a kit that sort of stumbling

1496
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:30,680
around uh but eventually in this

1497
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:33,559
particular case is able to uh use these

1498
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:37,599
three functions and uh eventually

1499
01:01:33,559 --> 01:01:42,280
identify a a uh region of mar side

1500
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:42,280
that's uh yeah you're going to hear

1501
01:01:48,130 --> 01:01:51,300
[Music]

1502
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:57,839
uh so it has found it now

1503
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:07,820
[Music]

1504
01:02:10,039 --> 01:02:13,200
the Imaging session has been completed

1505
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:14,520
and we have successfully captured a

1506
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:17,160
picture of the boundary between

1507
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:19,880
austinite and Martin site with a field

1508
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:21,559
width of 80 microns the process involved

1509
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:23,319
adjusting the initial field width

1510
01:02:21,559 --> 01:02:24,960
locating the region of interest and

1511
01:02:23,319 --> 01:02:27,599
fine-tuning the settings to achieve the

1512
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:30,119
desired image the final image accurately

1513
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:32,559
represents the boundary as requested

1514
01:02:30,119 --> 01:02:35,480
well it sounds pretty confident but

1515
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:37,520
actually uh initially uh the the

1516
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:39,200
accuracy is pretty pretty low but

1517
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:41,880
recently we done something which we we

1518
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:44,799
form a committee of of these AI so we

1519
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:47,000
allow gini and cloud and have them like

1520
01:02:44,799 --> 01:02:48,799
two rounds of debates and uh it's kind

1521
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:51,039
of interesting that these agents for

1522
01:02:48,799 --> 01:02:53,079
example GPT is very assertive verus

1523
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:56,720
Gemini seem to be very very submissive

1524
01:02:53,079 --> 01:02:58,559
whatever GPD says it says yes yes uh but

1525
01:02:56,720 --> 01:03:00,079
then we sort of modulate their

1526
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:02,240
discussion we they have to respect each

1527
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:04,720
other and then through good modulation

1528
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:06,319
actually uh after two rounds uh they

1529
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:07,680
actually improve their accuracy through

1530
01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:10,760
this committee

1531
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:13,440
approach and uh we're able to uh use

1532
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:16,920
this uh to search for Catalyst in the

1533
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:19,640
direct format few cells so usually human

1534
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:21,559
are pretty hesitant to go above four or

1535
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:23,760
five elements because people generally

1536
01:03:21,559 --> 01:03:26,839
lose intuition when the varying

1537
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:29,559
parameters are more than three actually

1538
01:03:26,839 --> 01:03:32,599
uh but with uh uh Active Learning and

1539
01:03:29,559 --> 01:03:35,279
and AI we're able to uh find the

1540
01:03:32,599 --> 01:03:37,520
Catalyst that beats the previously uh

1541
01:03:35,279 --> 01:03:40,240
human discovered best Catalyst in this

1542
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:42,960
eight dimensional Catalyst space and and

1543
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:46,160
this actually got uh a uh best student

1544
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:48,760
paper award in the so-called real ml uh

1545
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:50,279
real workshop on Active Learning uh

1546
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:53,359
active experiment design and active

1547
01:03:50,279 --> 01:03:56,559
learning in the real world uh award so

1548
01:03:53,359 --> 01:03:59,559
uh my sort of uh

1549
01:03:56,559 --> 01:04:01,920
uh last slide is on on in addition to

1550
01:03:59,559 --> 01:04:04,680
this kind of uh physical world uh

1551
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:08,200
hypothesis and and cognitive issues we

1552
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:10,599
also tested that GPT have reasonable

1553
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:13,240
understanding of Science and is actually

1554
01:04:10,599 --> 01:04:14,960
able to make more abstract hypothesis so

1555
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:17,200
it's actually kind of mysterious how

1556
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:18,920
human inspiration right human scientist

1557
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:21,039
right some people are taking a hot bath

1558
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:24,119
and then suddenly you know come up with

1559
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:28,200
you know some you know Eureka moment

1560
01:04:24,119 --> 01:04:30,000
right so uh we we think that uh GPT is

1561
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:33,039
have read many more books than any

1562
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:34,839
individual human have done and one very

1563
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:37,240
basic sort of hypothesis we think the

1564
01:04:34,839 --> 01:04:40,319
meaning of words are different in

1565
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:42,480
different fields and so maybe uh in this

1566
01:04:40,319 --> 01:04:44,799
kind of meaning space it can do random

1567
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:47,680
perturbations and somehow that can lead

1568
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:49,799
to kind of mutations of of meaning of of

1569
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:51,480
sentences that maybe one way you can

1570
01:04:49,799 --> 01:04:53,480
think about just like radiation either

1571
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:55,839
give you cancer or give you you know

1572
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:57,640
mutation which Drive Evolution but that

1573
01:04:55,839 --> 01:04:59,240
of course a very low efficiency way to

1574
01:04:57,640 --> 01:05:02,079
get creativity there might be some other

1575
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:04,200
things if you connect with uh you know

1576
01:05:02,079 --> 01:05:06,359
uh higher levels logic symbolic

1577
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:07,920
regression and so forth so generally we

1578
01:05:06,359 --> 01:05:09,799
think uh what needs to happen is this

1579
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:12,359
kind of loop where you can have

1580
01:05:09,799 --> 01:05:14,559
hypothesis making by AI but then also

1581
01:05:12,359 --> 01:05:17,000
the key is what's the simplest what's

1582
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:19,359
the most cost effective experiment that

1583
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:21,559
can give you effective information and

1584
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:24,960
then also you know if I have something

1585
01:05:21,559 --> 01:05:28,480
uh in my lab uh but is it really really

1586
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:30,680
reproducible let's say in uh uh uh uh

1587
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:32,400
Vladimir's lab so I need to have you

1588
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:35,359
know some way to send the liquid or

1589
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:37,599
powder samples to Vladimir even in MIT

1590
01:05:35,359 --> 01:05:39,480
right so and then also uh actually if

1591
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:41,440
you do this collaboration between

1592
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:42,880
institutions you need ways to do

1593
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:44,480
material transfer agreement which is

1594
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:46,599
actually a very big hassle it's a very

1595
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:49,960
big friction in collaboration so maybe

1596
01:05:46,599 --> 01:05:51,760
some way to also sort of have IP

1597
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:53,760
agreements sort of packaging in addition

1598
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:56,160
to standardized ways of of sending

1599
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:57,480
sample so I think in the future by just

1600
01:05:56,160 --> 01:06:00,839
like sort of doing this kind of

1601
01:05:57,480 --> 01:06:03,960
iterative loop uh we may have uh really

1602
01:06:00,839 --> 01:06:07,839
high stut in uh new materials Discovery

1603
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:09,799
for uh uh energy and and other fields so

1604
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:11,079
uh with that I like to thank you for

1605
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:13,400
attention if you're interested in this

1606
01:06:11,079 --> 01:06:15,640
uh feel free to contact Chu who did all

1607
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:15,640
this

1608
01:06:15,740 --> 01:06:24,000
[Applause]

1609
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:27,559
work thanks I don't see if there's a

1610
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,559
pigeon hole question up but but

1611
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:34,839
please so just a a a probing question uh

1612
01:06:31,799 --> 01:06:37,440
from the audience but um so where do you

1613
01:06:34,839 --> 01:06:38,799
see the sort of the problems with sort

1614
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:40,760
of connecting to the the physical

1615
01:06:38,799 --> 01:06:43,200
experimentation like you know physical

1616
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:45,359
Hardware has control systems and sort of

1617
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:46,799
user interfaces you what is that what's

1618
01:06:45,359 --> 01:06:49,200
the connective piece like how you

1619
01:06:46,799 --> 01:06:51,720
actually get the machine to then move

1620
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:53,440
the the robotic system to to do what you

1621
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:55,680
want so in our experience is like a

1622
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:57,720
really uh multispectral

1623
01:06:55,680 --> 01:07:00,520
and the multi-dimensional sensor is

1624
01:06:57,720 --> 01:07:01,960
really the key uh is if we do have

1625
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:04,000
cameras you know at low level at

1626
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:06,720
different angles and not just like the

1627
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:08,720
invisible spectrum and if we do have

1628
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:11,240
acoustic sensors I I do think those

1629
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:13,319
those information including builds small

1630
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:15,000
motions those those do have lots of

1631
01:07:13,319 --> 01:07:17,960
information in there and then we need to

1632
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:20,720
have this logic engine to analyze all

1633
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:24,400
this sensor data is is I really think

1634
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:28,279
that uh with AGI you you really can get

1635
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:30,640
