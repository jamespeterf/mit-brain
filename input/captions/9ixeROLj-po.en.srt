12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,399
flaked off the moment they took it out

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,000
of the oven or how the electrode would

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,559
fold weirdly onto itself the big fails

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
were kind of funny but discouraging the

16
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:41,079
students had worked for a month

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,440
experimenting with different materials

18
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:44,879
and 17-year-old Briana Tong of mden

19
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,600
wondered if they'd finally gotten it

20
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,160
right would their electrode work well

21
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,559
enough to power a microbial fuel cell

22
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:53,079
the students secured their electrode

00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,239
with alligator clips someone hit start

24
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:57,000

powerful sensitive detection and

50

measurement tools typically their

ways of making devices without needing a

17-year-old Angelina Ang of Everett the

59
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:14,280

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,080
coming together to problem solve for a

00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,239
healthier and more sustainable Earth she

62
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,720
says it made me realize that we hold the

63
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,319
answers to fix our dying planet with the

64
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,879

inks carbon based materials nail polish

66
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,640
and a certain smelling bacterium the

67
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,160
students got literally a trial by fire

68
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,120
in introduction to the scientific method

69
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,400
at one point one of their experimental

70
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,760
electrodes burst into flames other

71
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,400
results were more promising the students

72
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,120
took advantage of the electrical

73
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,080
properties of a bacterium shanella o

74
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,680

75
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:49,840
microscopic power plant as part of their

00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,120
generate electricity by oxidizing

78
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:57,400
organic matter in essence they spit out

79
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,920
electrons put enough together and you

80
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,680
get a few milliamps to build bacteria

81
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,400
friendly electrodes one of the first

82
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,400
things the students did was culture

83
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,239
shanella they learned how to pour a

84
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,879
growth medium into Petri dishes where

85
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:11,440
the reddish normally lake living

86
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:13,519
bacteria could multiply the microbes

87
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,519
first notes are a little stinky like

88
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,640
cabbage but we think they're really cool

89
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,680
she says with the right engineering

90
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:22,120
shanella can produce electric current

91
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,920
when they detect toxins in water or soil

92
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,519
they could be used for Bio remediation

93
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,480
of Wastewater lowcost versions could be

94
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:31,159
useful for areas with limited or no

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,560

hosting high school chemistry students

105
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:56,400
in her lab for the summer first was

106
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:58,319
intrigued she traces her own passion for

107
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,120
science to a program she'd happened upon

108
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,120
between her Junior and senior years High

software engineer and a businesswoman

111
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:07,879
first was casting around for potential

112
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:09,799
career interests when she came across a

113
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:12,360
summer program that enlisted scientists

114
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:13,720
in Academia and private research to

115
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,880
introduce high school students and

116
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,880
teachers to aspects of the scientific

117
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,720
Enterprise that's when I realized that

118
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,239
research is not like a lab class where

119
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,800
there's an expected outcome first

120
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:26,120

121
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,360

a toaster oven shrinks to a of its size

148

149
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,720
electrodes based on shrinking inks would

the conductivity says Tong who plans to

190
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,599
pursue a career in science if we saw

191
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,160
there was a high conductivity we got

192
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,680
excited and thought those materials

193
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:12,080
worked the Moment of Truth came in first

194
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,240
MIT lab where the students had access to

195
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,879
more sophisticated testing equipment

196
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,800
with their electrodes conduct

197
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:21,240
electricity many of them didn't Tong

198
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,960
says at first we were sad but then Dr

199
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,400
first told us that this is what science

200
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:28,199
is testing repeatedly and sometimes not

201
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:30,199
getting the results we wanted Lou agrees

202
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:32,160
if we just copy the data left by other

203
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:34,360
Scholars and don't collect and figured

204
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,919
out by ourselves then it is difficult to

205
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,599
be a qualified researcher he says some

206
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:41,039
of the students plan to continue the

207
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:42,720
project one afternoon a week at MIT and

208
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:45,159
as an independent study at molden

209
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,400
Catholic the long-term goal is to create

210
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:50,120
a field-based soil sensor that employs a

211
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:52,159
bacterium like shanella by Chance the

212
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,319
student's very first electrode made of

213
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:56,360
graphite powder ink and nail polish glue

214
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,319
generated the most current one of the

215
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,919
team's biggest surprises was how much

216
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,080
better black nail polish Works than

217
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:04,199
clear nail polish it turns out black

218
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,840
nail polish contains iron based pigment

219
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:09,319
a conductor the unexpected wind took

220
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:11,479
some of the sting out of the failures

221
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:13,440
they learned a very hard lesson your

222
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:15,240
results might be awesome and things are

223
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:20,360
exciting but then nothing else might

224
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:20,360
work and that's totally fine first says
