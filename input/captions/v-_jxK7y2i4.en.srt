1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,920
So, I'm Khalisa Stevens. I'm the chief

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,759
operating officer at the Surplus. We are

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,200
a certified BC Corp Deep deep tech

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,440
company operating across three

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,200
continents. Um, we specialize in

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,839
circular intelligence that enables

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,359
resource security and our mission is to

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,880
build the universal digital

9
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,279
infrastructure that makes secondary

10
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:24,640
resources instantly discoverable and

11
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:26,880
tradable across uh global markets. We're

12
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,560
also graduates of the MIT Design X

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:33,440
program and we're honored to be here.

14
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,239
So our founder Rana Rasuli is a

15
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,719
University of Cambridge PhD researcher

16
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:42,320
um in engineering with 13 years industry

17
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:45,680
experience. Our team is made up of um

18
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:48,399
tech in bleeding edge technology a

19
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,239
commercial excellence team and we're

20
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:53,199
female majority from mostly

21
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:55,039
underrepresented backgrounds.

22
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:58,079
We're also backed by a world-class

23
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,760
international advisory board and we

24
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,559
founded the surplus because we

25
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,600
identified that two trillion dollars

26
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:08,720
worth of excess resources go untraded

27
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:12,080
every year. Um meanwhile companies face

28
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:14,720
supply shocks, trade wars and resource

29
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,040
nationalism.

30
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,960
So, we developed an intelligent platform

31
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,119
that thousands of businesses have been

32
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,320
using in the past few years to generate

33
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,799
over $6 million in trading surplus

34
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,600
resources while diverting millions of

35
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,840
kilos from landfill at the same time.

36
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,040
Uh, but for every successful match, we

37
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,040
found that there were 10 more

38
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,040
opportunities that weren't being

39
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,040
realized.

40
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,720
uh circular uh sorry industrial

41
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,960
symbiosis a subset of the circular

42
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,040
economy could be one way to unlock that

43
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,000
value but we saw that today's current

44
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:53,759
approaches are manual fragmented and far

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,520
too slow. Um the solution is not another

46
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,479
circular marketplace but really the

47
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,719
digital infrastructure to support

48
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:03,280
secondary material markets so that they

49
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,880
can be traded as easily as primary um

50
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,520
commodities.

51
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,840
So building on our existing product,

52
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,560
we've developed an additional feature um

53
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,480
that we're calling cluster X. This is

54
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,080
the first universal protocol for

55
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,480
secondary material markets. Um we use

56
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:24,400
opensource intelligence for speed, but

57
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:27,760
our differentiator is our proprietary AI

58
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:31,520
uh graph. It connects messy disconnected

59
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,120
signals into a clear graph. Um,

60
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:36,400
essentially

61
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,040
this allows businesses to identify um

62
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,080
secondary material resources in seconds

63
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,879
versus in months.

64
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,959
So we already have contracts with

65
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,640
worldleading banks, conglomerates and

66
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,519
economic free zones across three

67
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,519
continents. Um they act as distribution

68
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,480
partners which is giving us a confirmed

69
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,160
pipeline of over a million businesses.

70
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,360
um for our partners is not just about

71
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:03,680
sustainability but it's about resource

72
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,239
security and with supply shocks and

73
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,480
trade nationalis trade wars and uh

74
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:11,040
resource nationalism

75
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,519
resource security is a geopolitical

76
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,840
priority.

77
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,239
Uh Dubai Holding is one of the leading

78
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,319
diversified investment firms uh uh

79
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,959
portfolios in the Middle East. They

80
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:25,680
cover verticals from hospitality, FnB,

81
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,599
retail and real estate. And so they

82
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,760
brought us on as their tech tech

83
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:32,159
partners for their gift it forward

84
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,400
initiative last year. Um this is the

85
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,760
impact of some of the work that we've

86
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,200
done with them. We've managed to

87
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:43,200
transform over 300,000 surplus items

88
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:45,519
that are valued to nearly $4 million um

89
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,319
and redistributed them successfully to

90
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,000
over 16,000 beneficiaries. I'm pleased

91
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,599
to say that they were so happy with our

92
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,440
work that they invited us back for a

93
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:56,480
second year. And so we've built

94
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:59,200
additional features onto our product um

95
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,680
including uh logistics tracking for

96
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:05,040
supply chain and accounting for carbon

97
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,640
emissions from logistics to the embodied

98
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,080
carbon of the items as well. And so

99
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,080
we're hoping to make a larger impact

100
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,080
this year.

101
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,879
Um for partnerships, we are sector

102
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,040
agnostic. We work with all kinds of um

103
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,400
sectors and resources. But for

104
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,320
partnerships, we're looking specifically

105
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,000
at banks and financial institutions,

106
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,880
conglomerates and free trade zones,

107
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,440
logistics and port terminal operations.

108
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,000
Um, so please join us because we are

109
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,160
building the digital infrastructure to

110
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,758
map, price and trade secondary

111
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,778
materials. Thank you so much.

112
00:04:35,758 --> 00:04:37,778
>> [applause]
