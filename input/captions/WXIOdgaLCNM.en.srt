1
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:16,640
Hello out there. Can people hear me? Oh,

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,320
nice one. People at least can uh

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,960
intuitive what it means when I wave at

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:24,880
them. Uh okay.

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:27,279
Uh so today we are going to uh you know

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,519
continue our discussion of probability

7
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:33,920
and in particular we're going to talk

8
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:36,160
about um a very naughty word uh what we

9
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,559
call random variables.

10
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:44,160
Um unfortunately a random variable is

11
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:45,600
neither random nor a variable. Uh so

12
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,320
like it it's just called this for

13
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,840
historical reasons. Um

14
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,440
it's very silly. I'm just going to be

15
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,520
referring to them as RVs through the uh

16
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,600
through the lecture. Um this is what it

17
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,440
stands for, but uh you know it's it's

18
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:01,359
it's a very silly name. It's it's a bit

19
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:03,440
of a misnomer. Okay. So

20
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,440
what is an RV?

21
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,440
Okay.

22
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:13,119
So basically what an RV is like it's

23
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,119
neither random nor a variable. It is a

24
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,119
function.

25
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:26,560
uh from our sample space to say the real

26
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:29,360
numbers. Okay, that's all it is. It's

27
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:32,400
just it's just a function. Um you can

28
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,240
have you know like the the co-omain r is

29
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,159
not particularly important. You could

30
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,640
have uh you know you could just easily

31
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,119
have co- doain n. Uh you could also have

32
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,960
complex valued rs but like you know we

33
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,360
won't we won't be looking at those in in

34
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,119
this class um for now. You can just

35
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,479
think of it as you know real valued

36
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:53,840
function. Okay, whose uh domain is the

37
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:57,720
sample space. Okay,

38
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,720
so for instance

39
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:04,640
suppose

40
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:06,719
our sample space or you know suppose uh

41
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:11,280
you know our our experiment is we're

42
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:12,720
we're flipping three coins. Okay. Uh so

43
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,080
we're going to assume for now that they

44
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,840
are fair. They're you know they're

45
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,200
they're you know normal physical coins.

46
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,680
They're independent. If you flip one,

47
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,480
it's not going to affect the uh the

48
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:26,680
outcome of any of the others. Uh so what

49
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,680
is our sample space in this case?

50
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,080
What does our sample space look like? Am

51
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:37,239
I giving the right lecture? This this is

52
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,239
61200, right? Okay. Uh

53
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,640
if we flip three coins, what are the

54
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,200
possible outcomes?

55
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,200
Yeah.

56
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:52,920
Yeah. each of them being heads or tails.

57
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,920
Okay, so if we flip three coins,

58
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,000
our sample space is going to be

59
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,680
so each coin can take either, you know,

60
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,360
it can be either heads or tails. There

61
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,200
are three of them. So we're going to be

62
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,280
considering, you know, ordered triples

63
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,800
of, you know, either heads or tails.

64
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:15,040
Okay.

65
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:20,080
And maybe we've got this function f that

66
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:23,120
maps uh an outcome omega to

67
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:28,200
the number of heads

68
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,200
in omega. Okay,

69
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,640
so that's one possible uh one possible

70
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:37,200
RB, right? We're taking an outcome

71
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:40,799
and we're mapping it to some number,

72
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:44,680
right? The the number of heads. Okay,

73
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,680
another one could be

74
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:52,400
uh maybe instead we just look at you

75
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:55,400
know is the first uh coin flip heads or

76
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,400
tails.

77
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:03,760
Oh, maybe I should not write it as uh

78
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:08,519
that just yet. So one

79
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,519
if and only if uh first flip

80
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:18,079
is heads and it's zero otherwise.

81
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,400
Okay,

82
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,600
so these are two examples of of RBs.

83
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:26,320
There are functions that map outcomes to

84
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,479
real numbers. Okay, does this make sense

85
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,479
to everybody?

86
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,800
We could have one more that's like h of

87
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,880
omega

88
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:41,800
is one

89
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,800
if uh all three coins match

90
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,520
zero otherwise.

91
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,120
Okay.

92
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,440
So these are just you know examples of

93
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,880
RVs that we could have.

94
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:02,479
Uh so G and H in particular

95
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:06,600
have a special property right they are

96
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,600
either one or zero.

97
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,639
So this is what we call an indicator.

98
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:27,440
So all that an indicator is is just an

99
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,120
RV whose co- doain is 0 and one. Okay,

100
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,520
that's that's all it is. It's just a

101
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,520
binary RV.

102
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,440
Okay.

103
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,880
uh and uh RVs and in particular

104
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:57,800
indicator RVs naturally give rise to

105
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,800
events. Does anybody see how

106
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,280
Yeah.

107
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,240
Yeah, exactly. So the answer was you

108
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,880
know in particular if you have an

109
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,280
indicator RB right you can look at the

110
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,840
set of outcomes where it's one right

111
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:36,560
that's an event or its complement is the

112
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:38,560
set of outcomes where it's zero okay so

113
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,440
uh more generally

114
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:44,560
if we have

115
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:48,440
an RBF

116
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,440
uh and a value x

117
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,240
uh we can define the event.

118
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:06,000
So a slightly weird notation here fals x

119
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:09,960
okay

120
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,960
uh by the set of outcomes

121
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:25,759
omega where uh f of omega equals x.

122
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:28,319
Okay.

123
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:34,400
uh or you know you may also have seen

124
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:37,440
the notation uh f inverse of x.

125
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:40,319
Okay. Um inverse here meaning inverse as

126
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,759
a relation not as a birectionraction. Uh

127
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,599
but if you haven't seen this notation

128
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,599
don't worry about it. Um this is what we

129
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,800
uh this is what we call it in terms of

130
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:52,479
probability. Okay.

131
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:55,680
Uh and uh you know vice versa. If you

132
00:07:52,479 --> 00:08:00,039
have uh an event, you can define the uh

133
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,039
indicator of that event.

134
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:10,599
So if we have uh an event A

135
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,599
corresponds

136
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,960
to the event

137
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:21,039
here, this is the notation I was trying

138
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:22,879
to use before. Uh blackboard bold one of

139
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:26,479
a

140
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:30,720
Uh this notation here just means the

141
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:33,760
indicator right that is one precisely

142
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:36,760
for the outcomes in a.

143
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,760
So

144
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:46,360
if omega is in a and zero otherwise.

145
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,519
Okay. Does that make sense? Does this uh

146
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,080
correspondence make sense? Yeah,

147
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:56,880
question

148
00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:01,279
explain the notation again. Okay. Yeah.

149
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:04,800
So, um basically we are taking an event

150
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:07,760
and using it to define an indicator RV.

151
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,920
Okay. Um this notation is just how we

152
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:14,040
write it. Uh this is called the

153
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,040
indicator of A.

154
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:24,480
Okay. And all it means is just the the

155
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,720
indicator RV which takes the value one

156
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,640
on all of the events in A and it takes

157
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,000
the value zero on all of the events that

158
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:34,240
or sorry all of the outcomes that aren't

159
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:38,120
in A. Okay. Does that make sense? Cool.

160
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,120
Uh any other questions?

161
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,160
Okay.

162
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:52,680
Or actually maybe maybe we should keep

163
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,680
that visible for now.

164
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,320
We can also define uh a different kind

165
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:06,760
of event

166
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,760
f greater than or equal to x

167
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:12,399
right. Uh so that one you know obviously

168
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,720
doesn't make sense uh for for complex

169
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,720
numbers but you know for real numbers or

170
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:21,600
any any subset of the reals this this is

171
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:24,079
perfectly fine. Okay as you might expect

172
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:28,040
uh this is going to be the event uh that

173
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:28,040
contains all of the outcomes

174
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:37,680
omega such that f of omega

175
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:40,480
is greater than or equal to x. Okay.

176
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,079
So analogous to what we just defined.

177
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,320
Okay.

178
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:47,839
Um

179
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:52,480
and more generally we could say you know

180
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:55,519
f in some set s or maybe t right because

181
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:59,120
s is our sample space.

182
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:03,880
This is going to be omega such that f of

183
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,880
omega is in t.

184
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,240
Okay,

185
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:19,399
does that make sense to everybody?

186
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,399
Okay,

187
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:28,000
so as you might expect, we can, you

188
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,920
know, condition on these events uh just

189
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,839
as we can, you know, condition on any

190
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,440
other events.

191
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,279
uh we can also have you know

192
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,600
independence of random variables just as

193
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:41,800
we have you know independence of events.

194
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,800
Okay sorry

195
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:52,880
for instance

196
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:57,440
now we could talk about the probability

197
00:11:52,880 --> 00:12:01,000
that uh uh what did we call them

198
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,000
uh f

199
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:11,320
= 2 conditioned on uh

200
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,320
h = uh 1.

201
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,800
Okay.

202
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:23,639
So what is this probability? What is it

203
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,639
saying?

204
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:38,279
Yeah.

205
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,279
Oh, is that a hand or just Okay, sorry.

206
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,600
Yeah.

207
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,399
Yeah. Exactly.

208
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:53,920
So we're looking at the probability that

209
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:57,200
we have exactly two heads conditioned on

210
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,480
all three coins being the same. Okay. So

211
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,600
you know we could think of these as two

212
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,880
events A and B. uh you know if we

213
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,600
actually you know write out what this

214
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:12,800
means this is the

215
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:15,680
probability that uh f= 2 uh and

216
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:21,839
h = 1

217
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:25,279
uh divided by probability that h = 1

218
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:27,760
right uh and this probability in

219
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:30,399
particular is zero

220
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,160
okay so all three coins are the same.

221
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,480
It's impossible for exactly two of them

222
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:37,279
to be heads.

223
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,959
Okay, does that make sense to everybody?

224
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:41,120
Like we're basically doing exactly the

225
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:43,360
same thing with these weirdly written

226
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:48,040
events as we did with, you know, any

227
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,040
other events. Okay.

228
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:56,279
Uh and we can also extend this to

229
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,279
independence.

230
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:04,279
But I should point out here that things

231
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,279
are going to diverge a little bit.

232
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:19,399
Okay.

233
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:19,399
Uh so we're going to say that two uh RBs

234
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,279
are independent.

235
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:36,720
If and only if

236
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:38,320
for all possible uh x and y.

237
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:42,959
Uh

238
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:45,440
probability that f = x

239
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:49,160
uh and

240
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,160
v = y

241
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:59,040
equals the probability that f= x

242
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:03,560
times the probability

243
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,560
that t equals y.

244
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,959
Okay,

245
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,880
so it's similar to what we had for

246
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:14,600
events,

247
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,600
right? How is it different?

248
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:27,279
Well, for events, right, we didn't have

249
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:30,399
this quantifier, right? We just said

250
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:32,320
that two events are independent if the

251
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,279
probability of their intersection is the

252
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,920
same as the product of their

253
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:38,399
probabilities.

254
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:42,079
Right? Now we have to quantify

255
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:44,560
everything. Right? It's not just enough

256
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,480
to say you know the the event that each

257
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,399
of them you know takes value zero is

258
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,079
independent. We kind of need that for

259
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,480
all possible pairs of values that they

260
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:56,279
could take. Okay. Does that at least

261
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,279
intuitively make sense?

262
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:01,279
Yes. No.

263
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:04,279
Some nods, tentative nods at least.

264
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,279
Okay.

265
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:10,480
Uh or you know just as with uh you know

266
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:14,120
normal events we could equivalent

267
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,120
equivalently say

268
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:20,079
uh for all xy

269
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,639
either

270
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:25,680
uh probability

271
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:30,480
uh that t equals y

272
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:32,160
equals zero. Whoops, not of or

273
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:37,680
uh

274
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:39,839
probability that f= x conditioned on p=

275
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,160
y

276
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:45,160
is the same as the unconditional uh

277
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,160
probability.

278
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,240
Okay,

279
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:54,680
so if you prefer you could think of it

280
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,680
in terms of uh conditional probability.

281
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
So we're basically saying that two

282
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,240
random two two RBs are independent if

283
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,799
and only if like all of the events that

284
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:08,079
they generate you know the events f= x

285
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:10,959
and gals y uh those are all independent

286
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:12,720
events

287
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:15,280
and you know intuitively it's saying

288
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:18,880
that uh if we know something about the

289
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:20,640
the value that that g takes for instance

290
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,360
it doesn't tell us anything about what

291
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,360
value f takes.

292
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:29,880
Okay.

293
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,880
So, example

294
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:39,280
uh where were they? FG and H.

295
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:42,280
Are those independent? So, are F and G

296
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,280
independent?

297
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,799
Who thinks F and G as I've defined them

298
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:04,080
over there are independent?

299
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:05,840
Show hands.

300
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,919
Yeah. Who thinks they're not

301
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:12,000
independent?

302
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:14,480
Few hands. Who's still fast asleep?

303
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,600
Oh. Oh, that's unfortunate. Um, I'm

304
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,600
sorry. Me, too. Uh,

305
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:23,880
okay. So, does anybody want to give me

306
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,880
an explanation one way or the other?

307
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,720
Presumably, somebody is not asleep. I

308
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,720
don't need an explanation for why you're

309
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,720
asleep.

310
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:39,480
Anybody else? No.

311
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,480
Yeah.

312
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:49,440
Yeah. Exactly. So

313
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,720
if g is zero right that tells us

314
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,320
something about the value that f can

315
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:57,320
take right it cannot be three.

316
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,320
Okay.

317
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,799
So the events g is zero and f and three

318
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:08,280
or f is three are not independent

319
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:08,280
events. So the rvs are not independent.

320
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:16,880
Okay. Uh or perhaps even more obvious if

321
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:21,200
f is zero right that tells us exactly

322
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:23,039
what g is right g must also be zero.

323
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:28,200
Okay.

324
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:28,200
Uh what about uh

325
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,799
f and h.

326
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:45,600
So f is the number of heads. H is one if

327
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:49,039
and only if all three coins match.

328
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,559
Who thinks those are independent?

329
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:52,720
No.

330
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:56,720
Who thinks they're not?

331
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:59,720
Few hands. Okay. Why?

332
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,720
Yeah.

333
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:06,000
Yeah.

334
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:08,960
Yeah. So f basically tells us everything

335
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,120
we need to know about about h right like

336
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:14,559
h is just a function of f and well

337
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:16,400
neither of them is is trivial. Okay so

338
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:20,080
if we know if we know f no matter what

339
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:22,400
it is we know what what h is okay so

340
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:25,640
these are also not independent. What

341
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,640
about G&H?

342
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,679
Who thinks G and H are independent?

343
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:47,960
Hans. Who thinks they're not?

344
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,960
Oh, nobody. Okay. Why?

345
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,360
Yeah,

346
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,840
sorry.

347
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,280
Yeah, intuitively that's what's going

348
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,280
on. The the first flip doesn't tell us

349
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,280
anything about the other two. And in

350
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,640
particular, it doesn't tell us anything

351
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,559
about, you know, whether the other two

352
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:16,080
match each other and the first flip,

353
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:18,000
right? Uh so we could, you know,

354
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,760
put it all into here and, you know,

355
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,520
figure it out. But uh you know I will

356
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,880
leave that as an exercise to the reader.

357
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:28,640
Okay. Uh basically you know no matter

358
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:30,320
what happens you've got uh uh one in4

359
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,720
chance that the other two coins are

360
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,880
going to match the the first one. Uh and

361
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:39,720
that matches the probability that uh

362
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,720
that they all match to begin with. Okay.

363
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:48,000
Okay. Does anybody have any questions

364
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:51,720
about uh independence before we move on?

365
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,720
people reasonably happy.

366
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,360
Okay,

367
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:04,600
so next topic is distributions.

368
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:14,480
Okay, so for those of you who have seen

369
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:17,360
RVs before, uh this is probably the

370
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,520
context or this is probably, you know,

371
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,280
the context in which you've seen them.

372
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:24,480
Uh historically, this is where they

373
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:26,640
started and

374
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:31,280
more or less where they got their name.

375
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:34,080
Uh but basically um the distribution

376
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:37,120
uh is is it's basically a fancy way of

377
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:39,919
you know talking about the RV without

378
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:42,799
the underlying sample space. Okay, it's

379
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:45,520
talking about the probabilities that it

380
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:48,880
takes each uh each individual value uh

381
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:51,360
in its range. Okay,

382
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:54,240
so there are kind of two equivalent ways

383
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:57,600
to uh to talk about it

384
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,760
uh at least for real valued uh RVs.

385
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:04,000
So

386
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:07,360
for an RV uh f

387
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:11,799
uh we define

388
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,799
the probability mass function

389
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:24,520
often abbreviated as PMF

390
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,720
uh

391
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:40,559
of omega oh sorry x

392
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:45,440
and this is just the probability

393
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:48,440
that f equals = x.

394
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,440
Okay.

395
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,520
So, does that definition make sense to

396
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:07,600
everybody?

397
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:10,159
Right. the the PMF of an RV is just

398
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:12,799
talking about the probability that that

399
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:15,279
RV takes each individual value in its

400
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:18,279
range.

401
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:18,279
Okay,

402
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:26,400
so you could think of this as uh you

403
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:29,360
know a probability space uh over R.

404
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,799
Okay, so that's that's how RBS

405
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:35,720
originated like you know talking about

406
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:35,720
probability spaces over R. Equivalently,

407
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:42,360
you could also define

408
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,360
the cumulative

409
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,799
distribution function.

410
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,240
CDF

411
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:04,279
as CDF

412
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:04,279
subfx.

413
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:13,840
This is just the probability

414
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:16,720
that uh f is less than or equal to uh x

415
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:21,279
which is the sum

416
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:28,200
y less than x of the probability

417
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:28,200
that uh f equals x.

418
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,600
Okay.

419
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:52,400
Uh so I should warn you that um you know

420
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:54,480
if you see like in many other

421
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:57,679
probability classes

422
00:25:54,480 --> 00:26:00,640
uh a PMF would or something analogous to

423
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:03,840
a PMF would often be called a PDF

424
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:06,400
uh for uh probability density function

425
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:09,919
instead of probability mass function. Uh

426
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:13,279
and I believe in particular the uh the

427
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:14,960
text does this. Okay. So for the

428
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:19,600
purposes of our class, those are the

429
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:22,640
same, right? Uh if you see PDF, uh you

430
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:24,159
know, think to yourselves PMF. Uh we

431
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,840
prefer this notation because this is

432
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:27,600
what's used for uh discrete

433
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:31,760
distributions. But you know, if you have

434
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:33,200
a continuous distribution like uh well,

435
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,039
it's kind of hard to talk about the

436
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,760
probability that a uniform random

437
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:40,000
variable over, you know, the interval

438
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,840
from 0 to one takes exactly a particular

439
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,440
value, right? like that's, you know, if

440
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,200
you throw throw a dart at a dart board,

441
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,279
you're you're never going to hit one

442
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:50,640
particular point essentially, like you

443
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:51,919
you have null events. So it it doesn't

444
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,440
really make sense to talk about the

445
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:55,279
probability that you hit a particular

446
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,200
point because that's always zero. So

447
00:26:55,279 --> 00:27:00,159
instead you look at the the density

448
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:02,480
function instead. Okay. But for discrete

449
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:04,400
distributions, uh you know, it does make

450
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,559
sense to talk about the the probability

451
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,960
that you hit exactly one particular one

452
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:11,360
particular value. Okay, does that make

453
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,679
sense to everybody?

454
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,760
So for this class you know PMF and PDF

455
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:19,799
are the same. If you see continuous

456
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,799
probability they won't be.

457
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:28,799
So often it is useful to talk about uh

458
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:32,640
RBs in terms of their distributions like

459
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:34,559
in terms of their uh PMFs or CDFs uh and

460
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:38,240
just kind of forget about the uh the

461
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:40,240
underlying sample space. Okay. So, a

462
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:44,279
couple of examples

463
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,279
um indicator

464
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:54,120
uh indicators like what does the PMF of

465
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,120
an indicator look like?

466
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:03,679
Well, it can only take two possible

467
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:07,840
values, right? So, it's going to be zero

468
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:09,440
everywhere except at zero and one. Okay.

469
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,880
And you know at one of those it'll take

470
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,279
the value P. At the other one it'll take

471
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:17,360
the value 1 minus P.

472
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:21,640
Okay. Uh and we call these uh we say

473
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,640
that these have a Bernoli distribution.

474
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:34,559
Okay. So

475
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:37,919
there uh PMFs like basically look like

476
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:41,320
this. you'll have you know two values

477
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,320
everywhere else

478
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:49,200
it's zero. Okay. And the uh

479
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:52,960
CDF

480
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:55,960
is going to look like this.

481
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,960
Okay.

482
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,840
Oh, wait. No,

483
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,880
should be at one.

484
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,760
Okay.

485
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:31,240
Uh, another useful one is a uniform

486
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,240
random variable.

487
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:39,279
Okay.

488
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:42,559
So a uniform RV right it can take uh you

489
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:44,720
know any value uh with with equal

490
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:48,360
probability. So in particular let's look

491
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,360
at uh

492
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:55,960
uh an RV on the set up to n.

493
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,960
Okay.

494
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:05,440
So here the PDF

495
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:12,039
of X is going to be 1 / n

496
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:12,039
if and only if uh X is in this set

497
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:20,480
and zero otherwise

498
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:22,159
and CDF

499
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:25,880
of X

500
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:25,880
what is that going to be?

501
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:37,159
Well, you're basically going to have a

502
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:37,159
peacewise function, right? So,

503
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:48,720
it's going to be zero up until one.

504
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:52,000
Then at one,

505
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:56,480
it'll go up to uh 1 / n. At two, it'll

506
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,600
go up to 2 overn, etc. Okay.

507
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,600
So, you got something that looks like

508
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,600
that.

509
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,960
So, uh yeah, question

510
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:31,840
Uh oh. Explain again how I got to this

511
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:36,559
graph. Okay. Um so

512
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:40,159
uh well the CDF right is you could think

513
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:44,880
of it as like a a sum of the PDF or uh

514
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:51,360
or sorry sum of the the PMF right. So

515
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:55,760
you know the CDF at uh at one right it's

516
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:58,640
the probability that this uniform RV is

517
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:02,080
no greater than one like how can that

518
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:04,240
happen well only if you you take the

519
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:09,519
value one that happens with probability

520
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:11,919
1 overn right so at one

521
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:14,159
you know we should get probability 1

522
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:14,159
over

523
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:18,960
Okay,

524
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:22,320
anything between one and two has that

525
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:24,399
same probability, right? The the CDF of

526
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,679
one and a half, right? The the

527
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:27,679
probability that we're no greater than

528
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:28,960
one and a half is the same as the

529
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,799
probability that we're we're no greater

530
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,640
than one, right? Because we can't take

531
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:36,399
any value between one and one uh one and

532
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:39,760
a half. Okay, so like all the way up to

533
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:42,720
two, it's going to be constant.

534
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:45,919
Okay. And then at two, it's going to

535
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:48,159
jump up by another one overn,

536
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:49,519
right? Because at that point, right, the

537
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:51,039
probability that we're no greater than

538
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:52,960
two is the probability that we take

539
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:56,000
either of these two values, which

540
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,840
happens with probability 2 overn. Okay?

541
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,480
So we kind of get this like pie-wise

542
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:03,120
step function that uh you know at every

543
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:06,519
integer it increases by 1 over n. Does

544
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,519
that make sense?

545
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,960
Is there any way that you can, you know,

546
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,519
beat random chance? Is there any way

547
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:26,640
that you can do better like win with

548
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:30,000
probability greater than 1/2?

549
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:35,679
Right? It's not really obvious.

550
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:40,559
Okay, so let's simplify the game a bit.

551
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:42,720
So suppose I guarantee that one of the

552
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:45,960
boxes has more than five candies and the

553
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,960
other one doesn't.

554
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:50,200
Can you then beat random chance?

555
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:56,080
I'm seeing some nods. Yeah. How

556
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,480
how do you beat random chance in that

557
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:01,480
case?

558
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,480
Yeah.

559
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,200
less than five.

560
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:10,720
Yeah, exactly. You you you pick either

561
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,480
box, you open it, right? If it has more

562
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:14,240
than five, that's that's the the box

563
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,839
with more, right? You stick with that.

564
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:17,520
If it doesn't have more than five, well,

565
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:22,480
the other one does, so the other one has

566
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:25,200
more. Okay? So, if you know that one of

567
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:27,200
the boxes is is, you know, has more than

568
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:29,440
five and the other one doesn't, then you

569
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:32,320
can win with certainty, right? Like,

570
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,280
it's still not probabilistic. Well, I I

571
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,760
suppose you could think of it as

572
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:38,240
probabilistic, but like you can

573
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:40,320
definitely do better than a half.

574
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:42,800
Okay.

575
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,399
Does this give you any ideas as to how

576
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,200
you might win with probability greater

577
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:49,119
than a half, even if you don't know that

578
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:51,679
one of the boxes has more than five

579
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:53,839
candies and the other one doesn't?

580
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:56,839
Any ideas?

581
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:56,839
Yeah.

582
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:11,200
Okay. So, uh your colleague's proposal

583
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:12,800
was do it anyway, right? Uh if you, you

584
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,800
know, open up a box with less than five

585
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,560
candies, you switch and hope that the

586
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:20,640
other one has has at least more than

587
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:22,079
than uh what you found. If you open up a

588
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,680
box that has more than five candies, you

589
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:26,320
stick with it and, you know, hope that

590
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:28,160
the other one has fewer.

591
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:31,839
Um,

592
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:35,880
does anybody see a problem with this?

593
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:35,880
What is the probability of winning?

594
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,960
Yeah.

595
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:50,400
Yeah. So,

596
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:52,000
let let me try and rephrase that. Um I

597
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,560
haven't given you any probabilities of

598
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,839
like you know uh what the probability is

599
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:59,520
that that I've put a certain number of

600
00:35:55,839 --> 00:36:02,720
candies in in either box right so it

601
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:06,079
kind of depends on what I've done right

602
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:08,000
there are kind of two cases right if I

603
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:10,320
have split them like you know greater

604
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,720
than five and and and less then you win

605
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:16,079
with certainty if I haven't then you win

606
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:18,720
with probability exactly 1/2

607
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:20,640
right if they're both greater than five

608
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:23,440
right you you win if you picked the uh

609
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:25,760
the bigger one to begin with. And if

610
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,200
they're both less than five, then you

611
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,680
win if you picked the smaller one to

612
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:31,200
begin with.

613
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,880
Okay? So, you're still not doing worse

614
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,800
than a half, but you're not doing

615
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,400
better, right? Or you're not

616
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:40,079
guaranteeing that you're doing better

617
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:41,200
because, you know, I made no guarantees

618
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:43,280
as to how I was splitting up the

619
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:45,520
candies. I may put fewer than five in

620
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:49,040
both of them. Or, as I did this time, I

621
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:52,320
may put more than five in both.

622
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:54,480
But can you use a similar idea to get

623
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:57,880
greater than 1/2 probability no matter

624
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,880
what I've done?

625
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:22,320
What if instead you know that I've put

626
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:25,480
more than two candies in one box and not

627
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,480
the other?

628
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,560
Can you win in that case?

629
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,400
Anyone?

630
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:51,119
If if you know that I've put more than

631
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:55,640
two candies in one box and not the other

632
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:55,640
one, how do you win?

633
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:08,040
It's It's not a trick question. I

634
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,040
promise.

635
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,320
Like just as what your colleague said

636
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,680
with five, you can open up one of the

637
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:24,400
boxes and see whether or not it has more

638
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:26,000
than two candies, right? If you know

639
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,599
that one of the boxes has more than two

640
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,280
candies and the other one doesn't,

641
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:32,079
right? You can identify which is which

642
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:34,320
by, you know, looking at one of them.

643
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:37,320
Okay,

644
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,320
so

645
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:41,359
why don't I start writing some of this

646
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,359
down?

647
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:46,400
So

648
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:50,800
if one box

649
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:54,839
so exactly one box has uh you know at

650
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,839
least one candy

651
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:02,480
right then you know we open up our box

652
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:05,359
we see whether or not it has any candies

653
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:08,440
and if it does we take it. Okay so we

654
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:08,440
can win.

655
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:15,839
So if we know

656
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:17,839
that two boxes, sorry, if one box has

657
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:19,680
greater than or equal to two candies,

658
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:21,920
right?

659
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:25,359
If we know this,

660
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:27,280
we can win, right?

661
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:29,200
If we know that one of them has greater

662
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,280
than or equal to three candies, we can

663
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,760
still win.

664
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:37,040
Okay,

665
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:39,839
the problem is, you know, we don't

666
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:41,359
actually know any of these.

667
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:44,359
So, what can we do about that lack of

668
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:44,359
knowledge?

669
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:51,520
Yeah.

670
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:53,520
Yeah. Exactly.

671
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:56,960
So, we don't know, but we can guess,

672
00:39:53,520 --> 00:40:00,520
right? like one of these uh 10 things

673
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,520
has to be true,

674
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:04,320
right? I I've told you that I've put

675
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:07,599
different numbers of candies in each

676
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:09,599
box, right? So there is some divider.

677
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:10,960
One of these at least one is true. Like

678
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:12,079
maybe I've put zero and one and 10 in

679
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,839
the other, in which case they're all

680
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:17,040
true, right? But at least one of them

681
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:19,680
has to be true. So if you randomly guess

682
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:23,359
one of them and just say like like

683
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:24,880
pretend that you know it, okay? and you

684
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:28,160
know adopt the strategy we were just

685
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:31,599
talking about, right? If you guessed

686
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:34,160
correctly, then you win.

687
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:36,000
And if you didn't guess correctly, as uh

688
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,760
your colleague in the back pointed out,

689
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,560
you still don't lose at least like you

690
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:45,160
still win with probability 1/2.

691
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:45,160
Okay, does that make sense to everybody?

692
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:49,560
So our strat

693
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:53,520
is guess the threshold

694
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:02,280
Okay. And then assume it's true.

695
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:11,520
Okay.

696
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:15,160
So what exactly is the probability of

697
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:15,160
winning if we do this?

698
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:35,920
Well, it's going to be we can use uh the

699
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:39,440
law of total probability. It's going to

700
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:43,480
be the probability that we win

701
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,480
conditioned on being correct,

702
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:50,680
right? times the probability that we are

703
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,680
actually correct

704
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:57,520
plus

705
00:41:54,400 --> 00:42:01,560
the probability that we win

706
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:01,560
conditioned on being wrong

707
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,599
times the probability that we're wrong.

708
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:15,319
Okay,

709
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:15,319
so what are each of these probabilities?

710
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:27,760
What's the probability that we win if we

711
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:31,200
made the correct guess

712
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:36,280
or a correct guess rather?

713
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:36,280
One. Yeah, exactly. Okay.

714
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,400
What's the probability that we made a

715
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:44,160
correct guess?

716
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,720
Yeah,

717
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:48,560
one10enth. Uh, well, it might be

718
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:54,160
greater, but it's at least one/10enth,

719
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:57,680
right? So, it's at least 1 * 110th

720
00:42:54,160 --> 00:43:01,400
plus what's the probability that we win?

721
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:01,400
Condition on being wrong.

722
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:12,480
Yeah.

723
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:12,480
12. Yeah.

724
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:18,480
Right? So if we guess wrong, you know,

725
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:21,119
say without loss of generality, our

726
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,240
threshold is uh is too low, we're going

727
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:24,160
to open up a box and we're going to

728
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:26,240
stick with it regardless of what it is.

729
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:30,319
Okay? So we win if and only if we happen

730
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:34,000
to pick the uh the bigger one. Okay? So

731
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:35,839
we win with probability 1/2.

732
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,160
And what's the probability that we made

733
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:39,160
the wrong guess?

734
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:58,359
Yeah.

735
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:58,359
Nine times. Yeah.

736
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:16,119
So, what is this going to be? This is

737
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:16,119
going to be what? 55%.

738
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:22,000
Okay.

739
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:27,160
So, it's not that much better than a

740
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,160
half, right? But it is better.

741
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:40,440
So, does that make sense to everybody?

742
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,440
So we we Oh, yep.

743
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:50,079
Yeah. So we we we don't actually know

744
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:52,000
that, right? Um so it's it's possible,

745
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:53,359
right, that I could have, you know, a

746
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,680
large difference in in the number of

747
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:57,920
candies in each box, right? Uh we do

748
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:00,480
know that there's at least a onetenth

749
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:02,079
probability that that uh you know, we

750
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:07,480
picked the right threshold. Like it it

751
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:07,480
could be more than that, right? Um

752
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,880
but like you know if there are say two

753
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:18,680
correct thresholds then instead of this

754
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:18,680
you have uh 1x 210 plus 1/2 by 8/10.

755
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:24,640
Oh uh because you know these are the the

756
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:26,720
thresholds that we're picking from

757
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:28,960
right. So like we we do know that there

758
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:31,200
are uh between zero and 10 candies in

759
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:33,440
each box, right? So we're going to pick

760
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:37,240
a threshold that's you know in that

761
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:37,240
range. Okay.

762
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:46,160
But yeah, if if I have uh you know put

763
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:47,599
you know

764
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,920
if I've allowed you to pick you know

765
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:52,560
more than one correct threshold then

766
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:55,280
that just you know increases by 5% per

767
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:58,280
you know candy difference between the

768
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:58,280
boxes.

769
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:06,880
Okay

770
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:10,400
are people reasonably happy with this?

771
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:12,000
Okay. So this is an example uh of a

772
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,839
problem where we've taken something that

773
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,400
isn't exactly a probability problem to

774
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:18,319
begin with but we've turned it into a

775
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,640
probability problem and we've given what

776
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:25,680
we call a probabilistic algorithm for

777
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:27,040
solving it. Okay. So, uh yeah, if you do

778
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,880
it deterministically, right, you know,

779
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:30,960
there's not much you can do, right? You

780
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:33,040
you pick a box and you know, if I happen

781
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:36,079
to feed you the correct one, then uh you

782
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:38,000
know, you you win. Uh but you can do

783
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:39,760
much better if you introduce randomness

784
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:43,200
into your algorithm and make random

785
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:47,680
choices. Okay? So, you will see a lot

786
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:51,040
more of this in uh in doub uh 61210 and

787
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:56,359
even more of that in uh 1220. And uh

788
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:56,359
Eric, do you remember 5210, 5220?

789
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:59,839
There are other randomized algorithms

790
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:01,599
classes there. There are some uh you

791
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:03,040
know higher level ones whose numbers I

792
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:05,599
forget that are you know entirely about

793
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:07,359
randomized algorithms. So it's it's a a

794
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:09,359
very powerful tool that that is

795
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:11,599
frequently used in computer science to

796
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:13,520
uh you know make your algorithms uh you

797
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:15,520
know more efficient or make them better

798
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:18,520
in in various ways.

799
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,520
Okay.

800
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:25,119
Uh,

801
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:28,000
so now that we've finished with our with

802
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:29,680
our candy boxes,

803
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,280
unless anybody has any questions

804
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:33,200
questions about candy boxes before we

805
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:36,680
move on?

806
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,680
No. Okay.

807
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:45,680
So

808
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:49,000
let's give another example of a very

809
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:49,000
common distribution

810
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:04,000
called the binomial distribution.

811
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:08,000
Okay.

812
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:10,319
Uh so this is a distribution that arises

813
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:13,319
very frequently in computer science.

814
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:13,319
Okay.

815
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,760
And in fact we've already been kind of

816
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,599
dealing with it implicitly in this

817
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:24,319
class. We just haven't you know named

818
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:26,960
it. Uh it's parameterized by two values.

819
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:31,119
So

820
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:32,880
bin of n comma p.

821
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:37,359
Okay.

822
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:40,960
And uh basically this models uh the

823
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:43,960
following experiment. So we have n

824
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,960
coins.

825
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:53,839
Uh these are all, you know, they're

826
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:55,520
coins. They're independent. Uh you know,

827
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:57,200
flipping one doesn't affect, you know,

828
00:48:55,520 --> 00:49:00,200
any of the others. They're all mutually

829
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,200
independent.

830
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:12,000
Okay.

831
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:14,880
And they're biased, right? They're not

832
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:18,920
necessarily fair coins. Each comes up

833
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:18,920
heads with probability P.

834
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:34,160
Okay.

835
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:40,240
And then

836
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:43,880
the RV X which is the number of coins

837
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:43,880
that come up heads

838
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:50,839
is or has the uh binomial distribution.

839
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,960
Oops.

840
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:15,240
Run out of frame. Sorry. Okay,

841
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:22,640
so we've already seen this uh you know

842
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:25,760
in particular with with P equals 1/2,

843
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:28,079
right? Flip several fair coins and uh

844
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:30,240
you know count the number of heads. uh

845
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:33,520
we did that at the very beginning with n

846
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:35,920
equals 3. Okay. But more generally,

847
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:37,440
right, you can flip n coins and they can

848
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:43,079
be biased towards heads with probability

849
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:43,079
p or away from heads as the case may be.

850
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,240
You could also model different things

851
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:55,200
like you know maybe you've got a very

852
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:56,559
complicated device. Each component you

853
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,240
know may or may not fail. They're all

854
00:50:56,559 --> 00:51:00,559
independent. fail fail with probability

855
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:02,319
P. Uh then you could also count the

856
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:05,920
number of failures. This would also

857
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:08,920
follow the uh binomial distribution.

858
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,920
Okay.

859
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:22,920
So can anybody tell me the uh PMF of a

860
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:22,920
binomial distribution?

861
00:51:54,160 --> 00:52:00,200
Okay. So, sorry. Could you repeat that?

862
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:12,440
Nice.

863
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:12,440
Okay. Why?

864
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:43,440
Yeah. So if if you look at you know

865
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:48,720
sequences of uh of these coin flips

866
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:51,680
right um there are n choose x sequences

867
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:54,880
right that have exactly x heads

868
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:58,800
right and if you have a sequence with

869
00:52:54,880 --> 00:53:01,040
exactly x heads right uh you know each

870
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:03,440
index which is a heads that's heads with

871
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:05,760
probability p and each index that's

872
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:08,400
tails of which there are n minus x of

873
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:11,040
them is tails with probability n minus

874
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:13,040
uh sorry 1 minus p.

875
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:14,559
Okay,

876
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:16,720
so product rule says that we can

877
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:21,200
multiply all of those together. We get p

878
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:24,319
to the x 1 - p to the n minus x, right?

879
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:26,400
And now each of those uh each of those

880
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:28,000
sequences, you know, they're distinct

881
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,440
outcomes.

882
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,359
Uh each occurs with the same

883
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:34,160
probability. So we just count them and

884
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:38,520
then multiply by that probability.

885
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:38,520
Okay, does that make sense to everybody?

886
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:46,440
Okay.

887
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:46,440
Uh, what about the CDF?

888
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:18,520
Can anybody tell me what the CDF of the

889
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:18,520
binomial distribution is?

890
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,960
Yeah.

891
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:30,520
Mhm.

892
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:45,319
Yeah. Exactly. So let's say from i = 0

893
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:45,319
to floor of x of pmf

894
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,480
of i.

895
00:54:57,839 --> 00:55:00,839
Okay,

896
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:08,800
so that is frequently how you'll want to

897
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:12,480
compute a CDF in practice, right? Like

898
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:16,400
it it it is often, you know, easy to

899
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:19,040
figure out the uh the uh PMF

900
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:21,040
uh and then you can just, you know,

901
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:23,839
compute sums to give you uh to give you

902
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:25,680
the CDF. Um there are other cases where

903
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:28,079
it's easier to go in reverse, right?

904
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:30,480
Like maybe the CDF is easier to uh to

905
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:33,599
compute and then you can compute finite

906
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:35,440
differences to get back to the PMF.

907
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:37,440
Okay,

908
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:38,880
but uh you know the fact that that both

909
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:40,960
of these are equivalent ways of talking

910
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:42,960
about the distribution

911
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:45,119
uh means that you know you can use

912
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:46,880
either one of them and the other one can

913
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:48,480
be computed fairly easily from from the

914
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:51,480
first.

915
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:51,480
Okay.

916
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:55,880
Uh

917
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:05,599
okay.

918
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:09,839
So unfortunately right there are

919
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:14,599
summations involved though. So

920
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:14,599
that can be a little bit unwieldy.

921
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:20,960
uh so it is often easier rather than

922
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:24,240
dealing with the CDF you know exactly

923
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:26,079
to approximate it and this might be good

924
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:29,640
enough for you know whatever purpose you

925
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:29,640
you have in mind

926
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:36,119
okay so

927
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:44,000
let's see how we can do that or actually

928
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:45,280
let's um

929
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,640
For the sake of notation, let's

930
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:53,880
abbreviate uh the the PMF. Let's just

931
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:53,880
call it F. Okay. So,

932
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:05,720
and big F can be the CDF.

933
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:14,160
Okay.

934
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:19,079
So, how could we approximate

935
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:19,079
f of say alpha * n.

936
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:36,040
Any ideas?

937
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:57,520
Well, first why don't we write out you

938
00:57:54,559 --> 00:58:00,520
know what exactly this says in terms of

939
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:00,520
factorials.

940
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:08,480
So this is going to be n factorial /

941
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:15,920
alphan n factorial

942
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:23,440
uh time 1 - alpha * n factorial

943
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:24,960
times uh p to the alpha n 1 - p uh to

944
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:27,040
the

945
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:30,040
1 - alpha

946
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:30,040
n.

947
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:35,480
Okay. Now, who remembers sterling?

948
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:44,559
Oh, hand. Yeah. Okay. How can we use

949
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:48,920
sterling to uh to simplify this?

950
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:48,920
Oh, was that not a hand?

951
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:52,599
Oh, sorry.

952
00:58:55,599 --> 00:59:01,559
Well, we we've got a bunch of factorials

953
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:01,559
here, right?

954
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:09,319
If we approximate each of these

955
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:09,319
factorials using sterling,

956
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:14,480
then we're going to end up with the

957
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:18,160
following. So n factorial is going to be

958
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:19,920
roo<unk> 2 pi n

959
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:22,480
uh

960
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:27,000
actually let's um

961
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:27,000
let's kind of split up the terms nicely

962
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:37,359
over<unk>

963
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:38,880
2 pi alpha n uh<unk> 2 pi 1 - alpha

964
00:59:37,359 --> 00:59:43,119
n.

965
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:46,799
Okay. Uh

966
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:51,040
then multiply this by

967
00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:55,079
okay. So for the top we have uh n minus

968
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:55,079
uh sorry n / e

969
00:59:55,119 --> 01:00:06,319
to the n. Uh on the bottom we've got uh

970
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:09,680
alpha n / e to the alpha n

971
01:00:06,319 --> 01:00:15,440
uh 1 - alpha

972
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:17,200
uh n / e to the 1 - alpha

973
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:21,440
n.

974
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:25,640
Uh and then these p and 1 minus p terms

975
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:25,640
we can just uh keep as they are.

976
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:31,319
to the 1 - alpha.

977
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:34,599
Okay,

978
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:40,760
so a little bit unwieldy as it is, but

979
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:40,760
we can simplify it.

980
01:00:41,839 --> 01:00:48,920
Okay,

981
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:48,920
uh how can we simplify this?

982
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:54,480
Well, those n's and e's over on the

983
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:57,799
right, those aren't really doing

984
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:57,799
anything, right?

985
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:05,040
We've got n / e to the alpha n e 1 -

986
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:06,960
alpha * n. And here we've got n / e to

987
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:11,040
the n.

988
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:14,799
Okay, so we can get rid of those.

989
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:16,880
This is just going to end up being 1 /

990
01:01:14,799 --> 01:01:21,839
uh

991
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:26,440
is it uh alpha to the alpha n 1 - alpha

992
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:26,440
to the 1 - alpha * n.

993
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:41,359
Okay. And over here we have 1 /<unk>

994
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:45,880
2<unk> alpha * 1 - alpha * n

995
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:45,880
And then our P terms remain.

996
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:59,720
Okay.

997
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:03,799
What next?

998
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:21,040
Well, let's try shoving these P's and

999
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:26,799
one minus P's in here. Okay, so this

1000
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:32,760
carries down. We've got uh p / alpha

1001
01:02:26,799 --> 01:02:32,760
to the alpha n time uh

1002
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:42,799
1 - p over 1 - alpha

1003
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:45,799
to the 1 - alpha*

1004
01:02:42,799 --> 01:02:45,799
n

1005
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:10,839
What can we do next?

1006
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:33,880
Well, what happens if we take the log of

1007
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:33,880
this and then raise two to that power?

1008
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:38,799
It's going to be the same thing, right?

1009
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:41,200
But as it turns out, that's going to

1010
01:03:38,799 --> 01:03:46,559
make our life a bit easier. So, this

1011
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:52,240
continues to carry down. So, two to the

1012
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:59,000
uh this is now going to be n times

1013
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:59,000
alpha log of P / alpha

1014
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:02,799
plus

1015
01:04:00,799 --> 01:04:05,359
1 - alpha

1016
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:08,319
* log

1017
01:04:05,359 --> 01:04:11,119
of 1 - P

1018
01:04:08,319 --> 01:04:13,920
/ 1 - alpha

1019
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:16,920
and parentheses

1020
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:16,920
here.

1021
01:04:20,319 --> 01:04:24,119
Are any of you here physicists,

1022
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:28,520
proficient in physics?

1023
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:35,480
Does that uh exponent look familiar to

1024
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:35,480
anyone?

1025
01:04:59,839 --> 01:05:05,119
Well, as it turns out, this exponent,

1026
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:08,640
even though it looks kind of ugly,

1027
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:11,839
uh it's always negative except for when

1028
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:13,599
uh p equals alpha.

1029
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:18,119
Okay,

1030
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:18,119
so what happens when p equals alpha?

1031
01:05:20,319 --> 01:05:26,160
Well, we've got a log of p over alpha

1032
01:05:22,799 --> 01:05:29,839
here. That's zero. Log of 1 - p over 1 -

1033
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:33,039
alpha, also zero, right? So the exponent

1034
01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:36,400
is zero there. And if p is not equal to

1035
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:39,280
alpha, uh then you know because log is

1036
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:41,200
concave, this is just going to be uh

1037
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:44,960
it's going to be negative. So we've kind

1038
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:46,400
of got this this bump right at P= alpha

1039
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:50,200
and it's going to get exponentially

1040
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:50,200
smaller everywhere else.

1041
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:57,319
Okay, does does that make sense to

1042
01:05:54,319 --> 01:05:57,319
everybody?

1043
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:04,160
So if we actually put in some concrete

1044
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:07,599
values, so for the sake of uh

1045
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:10,319
simplicity, let's say P equals.5

1046
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:13,839
uh N equals

1047
01:06:10,319 --> 01:06:15,440
say 100, right? Evaluating, you know,

1048
01:06:13,839 --> 01:06:17,920
100 choose whatever is going to be a bit

1049
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:19,760
of a pain, right? But if we just use

1050
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:23,359
this approximation,

1051
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:24,240
then uh you know, we can get uh we can

1052
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:26,400
get actually some pretty good

1053
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:31,039
approximations.

1054
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:33,039
So if alpha also equals 0.5,

1055
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:36,359
right?

1056
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:36,359
What happens?

1057
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:53,520
Well, as we've just established, this

1058
01:06:50,799 --> 01:06:56,880
exponent is zero, right? So, this this

1059
01:06:53,520 --> 01:07:01,039
term is is one here. We've got 2 pi

1060
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:03,760
alpha * 1 - alpha * n, right? So this is

1061
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:08,559
going to be 1 over<unk> pi uh sorry 1

1062
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:10,880
over<unk> 2<unk>i * 12 * 12 * n.

1063
01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:15,359
Okay. So that's that's going to simplify

1064
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:17,520
to pi n /2. It's going to be uh

1065
01:07:15,359 --> 01:07:22,960
f of 50

1066
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:28,960
is approximately equal to uh 1 over

1067
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:30,559
square<unk> of pi * 50.

1068
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:34,240
Okay.

1069
01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:37,119
And as it turns out, this is about uh

1070
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:40,920
0.08.

1071
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:40,920
So pretty small.

1072
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:46,280
What about alpha equals 0.25?

1073
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:05,520
As it turns out when alpha is 0.25 right

1074
01:08:03,839 --> 01:08:08,720
like this you know it doesn't change too

1075
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:10,640
much but this term starts decreasing

1076
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:15,760
exponentially

1077
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:22,080
so we actually end up with uh f of 25

1078
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:24,960
is about uh 10us 7.

1079
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:27,040
Okay. So if you flip a 100 coins, right,

1080
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:30,319
the probability that you get exactly 25

1081
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:31,839
heads is minuscule.

1082
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:35,520
Okay.

1083
01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:37,120
Uh and I think the last lecture, right,

1084
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:41,199
Eric, is about tailbounds. Do you

1085
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:42,799
remember? Okay. So, uh yeah, last

1086
01:08:41,199 --> 01:08:47,040
lecture we'll we'll discuss how to get

1087
01:08:42,799 --> 01:08:49,759
bounds on the uh uh on the CDF uh

1088
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:52,799
instead of just the uh the PMF.

1089
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:54,319
Um, and

1090
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:59,239
yeah, as it turns out, it's kind of

1091
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:59,239
funny, right? The probability

1092
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:08,719
that you get at most 24 heads, right?

1093
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:09,759
How do you think this compares with the

1094
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:13,159
with the probability that you get

1095
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:13,159
exactly 25?

1096
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:31,759
Turns out that this is actually smaller

1097
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:33,520
than uh f of 25.

1098
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:35,440
So because it's decreasing

1099
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:37,679
exponentially, right? The CDF is also

1100
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:40,000
decreasing exponentially. So it turns

1101
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:41,920
out that it's it's more likely to get

1102
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,520
exactly 25 heads than to get fewer than

1103
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:45,040
25 heads, which might be a little bit

1104
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:46,640
counterintuitive, right? like for larger

1105
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:49,359
numbers that's that's definitely not

1106
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:52,640
true, right? Like it's much more likely

1107
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:54,880
that I'll get uh fewer than 50 heads

1108
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:57,520
than exactly 50 heads, right? Because

1109
01:09:54,880 --> 01:10:00,239
the uh the probability of exactly 50

1110
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:02,159
heads is 8%.

1111
01:10:00,239 --> 01:10:04,320
Right? So the probability of fewer than

1112
01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:07,280
50 heads is going to be, you know, half

1113
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:11,520
of the complement of that, right?

1114
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:15,600
So what's that? 47% 46% I can't I can't

1115
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:17,520
math. 46%. Right? So, it's much more

1116
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:20,159
likely that you get fewer than uh 50

1117
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:21,679
heads than exactly 50 heads. But then

1118
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:23,840
because it decreases exponentially as

1119
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:26,080
you get close to the tail, uh turns out

1120
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:30,480
it's it's more likely to get exactly 25

1121
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:32,080
than fewer. Okay. Uh so that's all we

1122
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:33,600
have time for today or sorry that's all

1123
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:34,960
we have planned for today. We have a

1124
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:36,560
little bit of time left over for

1125
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:40,159
questions if you want to uh come up and

1126
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:43,159
ask and otherwise we will see you next

1127
01:10:40,159 --> 01:10:43,159
week.
