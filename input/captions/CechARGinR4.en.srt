1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
All

2
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:25,519
right. I want to welcome Stfan Andrev uh

3
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:27,599
as guest lecture today. He has been a

4
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:30,160
significant part of this course over the

5
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,840
past I think 11 years. Is that right,

6
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,880
Stefan?

7
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,680
A long a long period and

8
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,200
>> count that far

9
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:41,920
>> partly because his uh lectures are the

10
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,320
most popular in the course and we really

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,840
are glad to have him come back again.

12
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:50,480
His background um is very interesting.

13
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:54,719
He has a PhD in chemical physics from

14
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:58,160
Harvard and he has worked at the top

15
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,760
firms on Wall Street. Morgan Stanley

16
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,840
Cedell

17
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:06,479
and now to Sigma. So he's a really great

18
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,560
person to uh share his expertise with

19
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,040
us. So thank you.

20
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,159
>> Thank you.

21
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,280
>> Okay.

22
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:17,200
>> Thank you. Thank you guys. Um

23
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:20,479
very nice to to meet you all. Big class

24
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:23,439
big class this year. That's exciting. Um

25
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,119
I like I I'll start with this before

26
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,799
everybody gets gets tired. But I wanted

27
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,840
to say that like I we're going to talk

28
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:32,320
about principal component analysis today

29
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,840
and the

30
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:38,240
some of the main things I want you to

31
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:40,320
take away from this are this is a

32
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:45,119
absolutely core data science tool in

33
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:47,439
finance. That's number one. Number two,

34
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:51,280
it's great to like this kind of stuff

35
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:55,280
you only learn by doing it. So doing

36
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:58,479
like actually doing some kind of project

37
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,719
that where you use this toolkit

38
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:03,360
is um is like essential for you to kind

39
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:06,640
of relearn it.

40
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:09,440
And um three if you ever want to get a

41
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,680
job in finance like I think having

42
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,360
having like some experience having like

43
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,360
done a project with this and having some

44
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,200
familiarity with what this is about

45
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,319
might help you during interviews quite a

46
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,080
bit. Um we're going to have lectures the

47
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,560
slides are minute we're going to have

48
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,280
some the slides are on the web on the

49
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:31,040
classroom website.

50
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:34,000
In addition to that there is um there is

51
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:38,480
a notebook and a Jupyter notebook and a

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,400
data set that I've used to prepare these

53
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,200
slides to at least the first the first

54
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,000
example we're going to talk about.

55
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,760
I've um like I think that that's like

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,560
that's a great reference if you ever

57
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:53,519
want to like like see how you actually

58
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:57,440
like how this stuff gets computed and if

59
00:02:53,519 --> 00:03:01,360
you want to do a final or like a project

60
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:04,959
final project in the class. Um

61
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,120
it would be something like that notebook

62
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,480
but like a little more elaborate. So it

63
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,080
gives you like a little bit of a flavor

64
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,159
of what the starting point and uh what

65
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,920
you know what the project would be like.

66
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,360
Probably would be a little a little more

67
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:21,519
extensive than than what we're talking

68
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:24,800
about here, but but um like in the same

69
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:27,599
same spirit.

70
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,120
So yeah, that's so now that we got this

71
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,599
over with like we're g let's talk about

72
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:35,200
like what is PCA and where where does it

73
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:37,360
fit within the world of um machine

74
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,640
learning algorithms

75
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,480
and it's it's basically um it's it's a

76
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,280
un method for unsupervised learn

77
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,040
learning. So it's it basically a method

78
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,879
to cluster reduce dimensional

79
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,480
dimensionality to make sense of the

80
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:53,280
data.

81
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,640
It it's not it doesn't

82
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,560
it doesn't necessar it's not a

83
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,879
regression so it doesn't like there's no

84
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,239
causality implied when you use PCA but

85
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:04,400
it is it's uh yeah it's a way to

86
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:07,599
understand data better especially data

87
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,280
that has a lot of dimensions where

88
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:12,159
things are like many many of those

89
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:15,040
dimensions are highly correlated

90
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:18,079
here we have I've listed a bunch of

91
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,880
examples of where PCA can be applied

92
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:24,000
generally really

93
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,840
it's it's widely applied in large data

94
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,800
sets, multi-dimensional data, like a lot

95
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,320
of data. Um it's mostly like the actual

96
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,639
the actual calculations are mostly

97
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,639
linear algebra. So it's efficient and

98
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,400
fast and scalable. So and this is one of

99
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:40,960
the reasons people generally like to

100
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,759
to use it. I'm not going to go through

101
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:48,479
all of these, but like it's it's very

102
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:51,680
it's their applications are very widely

103
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:53,840
they widely across across science and

104
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:57,120
and in finance it's used like very

105
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:59,040
extensively as well.

106
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,600
Okay. So first thing I wanted to talk

107
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,680
about is like kind of go through a

108
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,240
visual example

109
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,720
of um these are some of these things

110
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,440
that I'm going to talk about are like my

111
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,520
mental toy models to understand that I

112
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,639
always refer to when I think about what

113
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:20,160
is happening when I'm using PCA.

114
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:24,240
In this example, uh do you guys see?

115
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:26,560
Well, okay, good. In this example, I've

116
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,240
prepared effectively

117
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,560
three data sets, but they're really like

118
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,000
one data set. Like it's one I've I've

119
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,759
just made this up, right? It's just one

120
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,520
it's like one dimensional data set. And

121
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,400
all I've done is I've taken this

122
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,479
onedimensional data set and

123
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,400
um I've made it two dimensional by just

124
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:47,759
adding an extra coordinate like the blue

125
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,360
line the extra coordinate y I made zero

126
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,240
and then I took this data set and I just

127
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:55,919
like rotated it like 45 degrees and 90

128
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:59,600
degrees. And in the in this two

129
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:01,199
dimensional world like it's it's two

130
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,960
each point has two coordinates. So it

131
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,400
looks like it's two dimensional, but I

132
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:08,639
know it's like it's onedimensional

133
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:11,840
because I I made it. And and the key

134
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,160
thing that that PCA would do is like is

135
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,680
PCA kind of would immediately tell you

136
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,680
when it looks at this data that it's

137
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,120
actually onedimensional.

138
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,639
If just by like you download the data,

139
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,039
you do the calculations, it's going to

140
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,919
be onedimensional. So how how would it

141
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:28,880
work? Um,

142
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:31,919
PCA basically you can think of PCA as

143
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:36,240
like a as a as a way to rotate the

144
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:38,639
coordinate system. And

145
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,120
we basically when when you apply PCA to

146
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,039
this it will tell you if you apply to

147
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,479
the blue blue data it will tell you that

148
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:48,240
the PC1 the first principal component

149
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,000
you guys have done uh Peter you guys

150
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,680
have done the math part already right of

151
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,840
PCA. Yeah. So the first principal

152
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,919
component is going to be the x

153
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,039
direction. When you do the the red line,

154
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,520
it's going to tell you that it's like

155
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:04,560
the the one one direction and and it's

156
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:08,080
going to just discover this this um

157
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,840
this dimensionality. And okay, the first

158
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,319
data set was like very very simple, but

159
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,080
there was no is purely onedimensional.

160
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,360
This one here is like kind of the same

161
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,560
thing, but I've added a little bit of

162
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:22,160
noise in in the other dimension.

163
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,000
And um now when I apply PCA to this,

164
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,960
it's going to tell me basically the same

165
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,880
thing. PC1 is going to be the same, but

166
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,720
PC2 is is going to have a little bit of

167
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,039
variance along PC2 along the

168
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,520
perpendicular direction. So in both of

169
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:39,440
these cases A and B, it will tell me

170
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:41,199
that PC1 and PC2 vectors are the same.

171
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,599
And it's what's going to be different is

172
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,440
the there's going to be zero variance in

173
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:47,680
case of B on the PC2 direction and a

174
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:51,599
little bit of variance in in in the

175
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:54,080
first in the in the example A

176
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:57,520
along the PC2 direction.

177
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,039
So it basically tells us the two thing

178
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,840
it tells us like the directions along

179
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:04,479
which the data is concentrated and the

180
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:10,039
variance or the how important that

181
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:10,039
direction is on a relative basis.

182
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,720
We can generally what's nice about this

183
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:20,400
like I've done this two-dimensional

184
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,400
plots but PCA like when you actually do

185
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,360
it it's just linear algebra and you can

186
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:29,120
do it on you can do it on any number of

187
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:32,000
dimensions you can do it on um yeah it

188
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:36,240
so when you have high dimensionality

189
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,240
this is a very robust and powerful tool

190
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,839
what's what's really nice about that and

191
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,760
the high dimensionality is like it's

192
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,560
it's not a minimization, it's not an

193
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:48,080
optimization, it's just a linear algebra

194
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:50,080
calculation and it's fast. So you can

195
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,640
you can process very large amounts of

196
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,640
data very quickly.

197
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:02,080
Like a very common

198
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:03,839
like when you use this in practice

199
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,640
like the answers that you get from like

200
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:09,200
the things you kind of learn from PCA

201
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,760
are going to be

202
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,320
it tells you like a relationship between

203
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,000
variables. Like in our first example, if

204
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,680
you look at this diagonal line, it's

205
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,839
going to tell you that like it's

206
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,760
basically like y equals x is kind of the

207
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,360
line, right? And then you can you can

208
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:27,360
think, well, I can discover the same

209
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:29,120
thing if I run a regression y regress y

210
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,839
on x and and then it's going to tell me

211
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,040
pretty much like the same if I if I look

212
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,200
at my diagonal line, it's going to tell

213
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,640
me the same thing.

214
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,880
And that that is true in the

215
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,720
one-dimensional example. But I wanted to

216
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:44,640
kind of give an illustration of what is

217
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:48,160
the difference between regression and

218
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:51,440
and PCA. And the difference is like the

219
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:54,080
PCA is is kind of um

220
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,360
it's remember it's it's unsupervised

221
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,760
learning. So there's no causality

222
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,360
implied. So X and Y are kind of on the

223
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,959
same footing.

224
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,399
Each dimension is on the same footing.

225
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,320
There's no special dimension that's

226
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,480
dependent and one that is independent.

227
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,480
So when you regress, this is like the

228
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,519
same data set and you can see here the

229
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:15,040
regression of Y versus X, the regression

230
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:19,120
of X versus Y and the PC1 line, they're

231
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:21,200
they're similar. They're not but they're

232
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,680
not the same. it it like it's actually

233
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,959
optimizing it's minimizing the distance

234
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,560
to the line but like in a in a

235
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,760
in a like this is this is like

236
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,360
minimizing the distance in the

237
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,640
perpendicular direction and the others

238
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,120
are minimizing distance in the

239
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,040
independent variable direction so when

240
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,560
you do a regression so it's not exactly

241
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,760
the same I think it's good to keep that

242
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:45,760
in mind because sometimes

243
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:48,399
if you really want to understand how

244
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:51,519
you know like given an observation X how

245
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:53,519
I should model I maybe PCA is not the

246
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,680
right approach maybe you should run a

247
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,760
regression

248
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,920
but like if you want to understand the

249
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,839
the correlation structure of X and Y of

250
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,320
two variables there there is no you

251
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,680
don't have necessarily one depends on

252
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,560
the other you don't know anything about

253
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:12,680
their relationship then then PCA is

254
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,680
probably a more appropriate tool

255
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,519
um yeah so I was just saying like if

256
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,000
there's there's some data that is in

257
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:25,519
some like if data is like in a

258
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,959
particular line PC1 which is the red

259
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,720
direction here would always discover

260
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:31,440
where that direction is and if you

261
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,839
actually map the the data into like PC

262
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,800
coordinates it's just going to look like

263
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,720
a straight line like that and a couple

264
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,680
of things that I like about this example

265
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,839
is like you can you can see how rotating

266
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,640
this data set doesn't doesn't change the

267
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,560
PC coordinate output so it look it's it

268
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,399
finds a direction appropriately The

269
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,959
second thing that's very important is

270
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,120
robustness. In the real world, like when

271
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,640
you do, it could be in science or in

272
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,880
finance,

273
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:01,120
you're not going to have perfect data.

274
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:04,399
Everything is very noisy. Noise is a

275
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:07,200
huge problem. And robustness to data

276
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:09,040
noise is very important. So this kind of

277
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,079
illustrates how robust things are. So if

278
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:14,000
if I if I take one point and I just move

279
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:17,200
it around

280
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,839
my um you can see that my the red the

281
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:23,120
red line which is the the direction of

282
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,880
my PC1 doesn't it's like it's quite

283
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,680
robust

284
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,600
it's quite robust to to to noise in to

285
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,519
one particular if everything else is

286
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,680
aligned like just moving around one data

287
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:37,600
is it doesn't really change things too

288
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:39,920
much um if I make them a little bit more

289
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,920
spread

290
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,800
It's it's a little less robust, but it's

291
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,240
still still pretty robust, right? And

292
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,160
the thing that I wanted to kind of say

293
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,800
like what happen people are just going

294
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:53,360
to very often you just take some data

295
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,920
and you just shove it into PCA and you

296
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,200
don't actually care too much before you

297
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,839
even know what the data is and you just

298
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:02,320
put it into PCA and PCA always gives you

299
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:05,760
something. But suppose the data doesn't

300
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:08,399
really have a dominant direction

301
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,959
then the PCA algorithm becomes not

302
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,240
robust. So you can see now look I'm

303
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:16,079
moving one data and look what happening

304
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,600
to the coordinate one data point is I

305
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:19,920
can just move that a little bit and like

306
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,480
it's just completely giving me the

307
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:25,440
output is like super sensitive to to any

308
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,200
noise in the data. So it's kind of

309
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,639
worthless.

310
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,800
So it's very important when we're

311
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:33,120
looking at the data

312
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,639
if we don't really know what this data

313
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,079
kind of looks like very sometimes it's

314
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:39,600
high dimensional you can't even really

315
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:42,079
visualize it you have to think how do I

316
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,519
understand whether there is actual

317
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:46,320
structure in the data that I'm trying to

318
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,320
discover this will help me discover

319
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,839
quantify the structure but it's also

320
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:54,560
good to understand qualitatively how

321
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:57,279
much the structure is um

322
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:59,600
one thing that is that PCA also like

323
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:04,320
part of the PCI analysis and the output.

324
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:07,040
Yes. Do you have any like tool for like

325
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,519
wiggling around the points to see how

326
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,920
how robust it is to see if the data is

327
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:16,199
actually alive or not?

328
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,199
Well, um it's

329
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,639
no but what it's not I don't have like

330
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:23,279
you can write tools to do that but like

331
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,839
I think what you want like one thing

332
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,360
that you can do that is very important

333
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:31,120
is to kind of when you do your PCI

334
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,560
analysis is to look at the en values

335
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,079
because people very often people like

336
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,360
look at the vectors and like oh these

337
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,199
are my directions and I'm going to

338
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,480
project things and I'm going to assume

339
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:42,399
everything is like factorized nicely

340
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,079
and like we don't really look as much at

341
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:47,760
the values but it's very important to

342
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:50,800
look at the values and the reason is

343
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:53,440
that in this example when there's no

344
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,040
dominant direction the values which

345
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,560
measure the variance along each

346
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:01,279
direction would be very similar. So when

347
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,720
you look at when you're look using a a

348
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,800
principal component like the first

349
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,600
principal component you want to make

350
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:10,959
sure that your the value of that

351
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:14,639
component you're using is is like quite

352
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:16,720
distinct from the rest of the values

353
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,800
in finance we'll see later like we're

354
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,519
dealing with a time series of PCA like

355
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:23,199
every day you construct the PCA model so

356
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,040
everything anything that's a number here

357
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:28,240
like a value is actually a time series

358
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:31,440
of value so the thing I look at a when

359
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:34,639
I'm doing analysis is I look at value

360
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:37,839
plots in log space and I want to see

361
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:41,120
that each distinct

362
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,560
component that I use ideally you want to

363
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,760
see it that it's like an order of

364
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:48,560
magnitude different than the next one in

365
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:51,519
in variance variance invariance

366
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:53,360
basically which if that's true like

367
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,279
that's great and that actually and that

368
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,800
doesn't always happen but at least you

369
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,160
want it to be like visually you want it

370
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:01,360
to be distinct You want it to be like

371
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,639
different. You don't want if you if you

372
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,240
have a time series of things, you don't

373
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,800
want like the first and the second one

374
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,560
to cross. And if that's happening, then

375
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,040
the first and second principal component

376
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,199
if they're if the values are small

377
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,680
changes are causing them to switch

378
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:17,920
places, this basically means there isn't

379
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,680
a lot of structure and the PC output is

380
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,959
noisy and it's actually going to

381
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:25,440
obiscate rather than clarify the thing

382
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:27,839
you're looking at. I've put here like a

383
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,800
little bit of math notation. You guys

384
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:35,440
have um done your math lecture on PCA.

385
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:38,639
So, we can be relatively quick here. But

386
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:41,440
I do want to go through it. The the main

387
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:44,160
thing is like you have um your we have

388
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,480
your data data matrix is generally like

389
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:49,440
there's

390
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:52,399
n observations in pd dimensions and we

391
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:55,920
think of that as a matrix and then uh if

392
00:16:52,399 --> 00:17:00,480
this matrix is x then uh everyday's

393
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:02,720
observation are vectors of size p

394
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:06,079
and then you have a coarian matrix which

395
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:08,400
is xt * x

396
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,240
and um

397
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,839
um

398
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,559
the

399
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:18,959
and then like there is I I've here like

400
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:21,039
defined the the W K or the orthonormals

401
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:24,000
vectors representing the these are the

402
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:25,919
vectors W K and then I've written down

403
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,600
the math of how you do the projection of

404
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:33,760
data onto principal components

405
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:37,039
and um and how you compute the variance.

406
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:39,039
How do you get these vectors? Well,

407
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:41,039
there is

408
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:43,200
you could you could do you could take

409
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:46,400
your data compute coariance matrix feed

410
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:50,480
it into an veg value calculator which is

411
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:52,240
basically in in the in my work

412
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,240
our data is not really the number of

413
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:57,360
dimensions is not actually that high. So

414
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,880
that that's pretty that's okay. it does

415
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:02,160
kill

416
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,600
as um like that thing is

417
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,000
potentially maybe a little bit slow but

418
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:09,919
it's not actually that slow. There is

419
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,919
also a more efficient method called SVD

420
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,160
um single singular value composition

421
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:16,160
where you can just compute your

422
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:19,039
projections without calculating the

423
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,720
coariance matrix. I like to compute the

424
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,960
coarian matrix because we generally need

425
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,280
to compute the coarian matrix for other

426
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:29,360
things in any case. So if you have it

427
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:33,000
already then then it's then it's um you

428
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,000
might as well use it.

429
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:41,200
Some there's some I've listed here some

430
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:44,799
properties of this vector matrix that

431
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:48,000
are important that it's orthonormal

432
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:50,720
which means that it's the transpose of

433
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,240
the vector matrix is kind of also

434
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,160
inverse.

435
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:57,200
The coariance matrix is can be written

436
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:59,440
as the in this in this form where lambda

437
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,760
is the igen value matrix that's the svd

438
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,840
de composition that there's total

439
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,840
variance quantity you can think about

440
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,160
like which is the variance of x which is

441
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,960
just the trace of lambda so like the

442
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:13,280
product of ien values is the variance of

443
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,679
your data set

444
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,919
and there is something called percent

445
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,320
variance explained

446
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:24,480
which is just defined as how much

447
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:26,799
variance is is um along a particular PC

448
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,360
direction divided by the total variance.

449
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:33,200
So that adds up to 100%.

450
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:35,840
Like when you're and um but that's very

451
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:38,000
useful because remember how I was saying

452
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,679
you want to look at the values to

453
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,600
understand

454
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,360
how important each direction is.

455
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:46,480
Variance explained tells you that as a

456
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,840
kind of a number you want to look at.

457
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,640
You want to when you when you're trying

458
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:52,640
to model your data set with as few

459
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,760
dimensions as possible, you want to kind

460
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:58,960
of add more PC directions until you get

461
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:01,280
to a relatively high variance explain.

462
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,640
If you're able to explain

463
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,200
um if you have like a 10 dimensional

464
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,280
data set and you're able to explain

465
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:11,480
80% of it using three dimensions, that's

466
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,480
a pretty that's a pretty big win.

467
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:17,840
And I've also like written out this out

468
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,520
of sample variance explained or very

469
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,080
often what we do is we we calculate a

470
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:27,120
PCA we calibrated on historical data and

471
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:30,720
then we apply it to future data

472
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:32,640
that um we're trying to model like

473
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,559
trying to model what will happen in the

474
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:39,200
future and especially in finance we do

475
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:42,159
that. So when when the data you're cal

476
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,400
calibrating your your um PCA on is

477
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,320
different than than the other data then

478
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,919
this

479
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,159
you hope that the structure of the two

480
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:51,520
data sets are the same. So if if the

481
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,120
structure is the same you'll get the

482
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,440
same kind of variance explained

483
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:59,280
structure but to the extent that is not

484
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:03,760
true you you may not. So you may see

485
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:05,520
that um your dominance of certain PC1

486
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,400
factor becomes like it starts to explain

487
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:10,320
less variance as you as your um out of

488
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,559
sample data becomes more different from

489
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,000
the the data which you calibrate. So

490
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:17,440
this is a little bit of like the

491
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:20,240
modeling art of it where

492
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,600
you're going to be using some data to to

493
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,720
calibrate a model and then going to

494
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,640
you're going to use this to to um

495
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,960
predict the variance the correlation

496
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,880
structure of what hap what happens in

497
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:34,200
the future like future market moves or

498
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,200
future returns.

499
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:41,440
Okay. So um

500
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,919
a typical how do we like what do we

501
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,600
generally do when we apply PCA? We we're

502
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:49,600
going to take our data set we're going

503
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:52,799
to demean it and then maybe we're going

504
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,640
to normalize the variance to one. Like

505
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,159
when I say maybe and the reason this

506
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,120
maybe is like sometimes you want to do

507
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:01,360
that and sometimes you don't.

508
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,360
It's um

509
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:06,960
very often whether you want to do that

510
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:09,840
or not depends on

511
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:13,039
how exactly you're going to use your uh

512
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:15,360
PC factors and uh your your dimension

513
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:16,799
your dimensions. Generally I would say

514
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:20,240
that most of the time you you want to

515
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:22,320
normalize it in in a in a certain you

516
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,080
you want to normalize in a way that you

517
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,080
want the expected at least the expected

518
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:30,320
variance along different along your

519
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:31,520
dimensions to be unit to be similar.

520
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:35,200
Then you're going to compute your

521
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:37,280
coariance matrix and calculate the igen

522
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,320
values and then you're going to order

523
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:42,960
them by decreasing value.

524
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:45,679
Um and um and you're going to have like

525
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,520
a certain cut off where you say okay the

526
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:50,640
only the top I'm going to use only the

527
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,000
top X factors to model the the structure

528
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,600
of my data set.

529
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,280
>> Yeah.

530
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,120
>> So you say like maybe you would

531
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:59,120
normalize it. What would be like a

532
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:03,320
concrete example of like where it would

533
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:03,320
be better to not normalize it?

534
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,840
>> Um

535
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:11,520
well

536
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,520
here's an example.

537
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:18,480
So let let actually let yes I'll start

538
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,919
with this. So this is an example of like

539
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,520
it's a little bit of a toy example and

540
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,760
I'll talk about a real example. So in

541
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:26,000
this toy example there's the blue and

542
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:29,039
the red data set

543
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,600
and uh the red one looks that it's kind

544
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:34,400
of one-dimensional

545
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:36,080
and the blue looks like

546
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,720
it's just a blob. There's no direct

547
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:41,760
dimensionality. So when if I tell you

548
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,840
okay should we use PCA is there what is

549
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,039
PCA going to work on the blue data set

550
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,679
is going is it going to reduce

551
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:49,280
dimensionality and the answer will be no

552
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,880
no because it's there is no dominant

553
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:53,200
direction

554
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,840
and in the red one it definitely will it

555
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:58,000
will pick the right direction now what's

556
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:01,600
fun about these two examples is that

557
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,679
these two are the same data except I've

558
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:08,640
normal in the blue data set I've

559
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:11,760
normalized the variance along X and y

560
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:14,760
and in the red one I haven't.

561
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,760
So

562
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:22,080
if if I if these two dimensions were

563
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:26,240
you know like

564
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:30,000
I don't know temperature versus

565
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:31,919
um temperature in Seattle versus temp

566
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,080
in Atlanta or something. They're like

567
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:37,120
the kind of very distinct and generally

568
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,799
like different things where you're only

569
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,279
interested in correlation and the the

570
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:43,279
relative variance doesn't quite is not

571
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:46,320
very meaningful then you you would want

572
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:47,919
to normalize it because you're you're

573
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,520
that otherwise the units are not going

574
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:51,679
to be you want to have like somewhat

575
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,840
related units. So the units will be

576
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:56,159
standard deviations if you normalize it.

577
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,440
If you don't the units will be arbitrary

578
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,080
and they don't it wouldn't really make

579
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:03,360
sense.

580
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:06,000
On the other hand, if

581
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:08,320
um if this was like

582
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,840
if x- axis was your grades on quiz one

583
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:14,880
and y axis was your grades on quiz two,

584
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:17,279
these two are like the same units now.

585
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,840
And you you may not want to normalize.

586
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:21,520
You you want to actually like these

587
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,039
grades are these numbers are meaningful

588
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,960
relative to each other. So there's no

589
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:26,480
necessarily like you want to actually

590
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,320
model

591
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,240
the actual grades including the the

592
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,600
variance of quiz one and quiz two. So

593
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,720
there is no necessarily need to

594
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,919
normalize it.

595
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,600
>> That makes sense. Thank you.

596
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,520
>> Yeah.

597
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,279
>> But it's like that part is to be honest

598
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,279
that part is very much the art of

599
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:43,120
things. We've had a we have a lot of

600
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:45,120
discussion work. Are we normalizing it?

601
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:48,240
How are we normalizing it? What are we

602
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:50,400
using to normalize it? Like that's like

603
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,000
you'd be surp surprisingly this is

604
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,360
sometimes cutting edge research is to

605
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,679
actually understand how you normalize

606
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,840
it. It's that these are the things that

607
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:00,240
actually make a difference. The other

608
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:03,440
thing I mentioned is we need to demean

609
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:05,360
the data set. Why is that important?

610
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,400
Because remember the principle of

611
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:12,240
component analysis is a rotation. So it

612
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:16,000
it always rotates around zero zero. So

613
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:17,760
what zero is it matters a lot.

614
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,080
And this is two examples of the same

615
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,840
data set. These two blocks are the same

616
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,080
data set, but one is like not the mean

617
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:28,559
and the other is the means. So this one

618
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:30,480
here is centered at zero. And PCA

619
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:32,320
finds that there's a direction dominant

620
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,240
direction. It finds it. It works like

621
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,240
it's supposed to. This one here is not

622
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,520
centered at zero. Like for example,

623
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,440
let's say you do a bunch of stock

624
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,120
prices. Like you just put prices into

625
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,880
PCA.

626
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:45,360
Stock prices are not centered at zero.

627
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,600
They're always positive. So, it's going

628
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:49,360
to have some direction, but it's going

629
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,039
to be somewhere far away from zero. When

630
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,799
you run PCA on it, it's going to be like

631
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:55,840
it's going to try to rotate around zero,

632
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:58,240
but it's not it's like it can't find

633
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,799
anything because

634
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,720
it's not you're not like you can see why

635
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:04,320
like you can't rotate this thing. You

636
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,640
can't there's nothing to find if you

637
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,720
don't center it at zero.

638
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,679
You cannot rotate around it's rotating

639
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:13,200
always around the origin.

640
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,919
So

641
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:20,840
me mean that near zero or close to zero

642
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:20,840
or exactly zero is is very important

643
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,799
and surprising like it's surprising how

644
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,320
often comes up somebody just does PCA on

645
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:31,360
some

646
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:34,080
on some numbers that are just like large

647
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:36,320
positive numbers and like nothing comes

648
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,799
out and like ah this doesn't work but

649
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:41,600
you just have to normalize to zero. How

650
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:44,320
do we actually do it? Well um this is

651
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:46,720
just the examples of various places that

652
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,640
have implementations of this value

653
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,640
calculations. But I think when I started

654
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:53,679
doing this

655
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,679
um like 11 what I don't know how many

656
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:58,159
years ago this actually was more

657
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:59,440
relevant. Now it's like everybody uses

658
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:02,880
Python, everybody knows Jupyter

659
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:06,600
notebooks and like you guys um now now

660
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,600
it's like standard toolkit.

661
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:14,600
Okay. Now what's special about finance

662
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,600
when it comes to BCA?

663
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,880
It's mostly what is special about

664
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:21,520
finance. This is not exclusive by the

665
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:24,480
way, but like most of the time

666
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:26,080
we are going to be doing PCA on time

667
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,399
series

668
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:33,520
in in quantitative finance like in in

669
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:36,320
the quant world that I live in and I I

670
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:40,320
work in. I would say

671
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:43,120
it's our the general job is to discover

672
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:45,679
patterns in the that are that have

673
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:49,840
happened in the past and try to use that

674
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:52,240
information to model the future and to

675
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:54,480
somehow like it use that as part of your

676
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:58,720
toolkit to make predictions and to place

677
00:28:54,480 --> 00:29:02,159
bets in the markets.

678
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:05,120
So every day, every every trading

679
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:08,159
session, every every observation is an

680
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:10,480
opportunity to bet and to make

681
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:12,559
predictions.

682
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:15,039
And you can understand like the thing

683
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:17,279
about time series is that the history

684
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:19,679
now and the history on the next

685
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:22,000
opportunity to bet is not that

686
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:24,080
different. Like it has one extra data

687
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,760
point maybe like later has an additional

688
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:29,039
data point, but everything else is the

689
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:32,480
same. So there is like there's a slow

690
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:34,720
changing time series of information and

691
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,640
what how we handle that there is a whole

692
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:39,039
time series

693
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:41,520
data science there class that one can

694
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:44,559
take but

695
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:47,520
in especially with regard to PCA

696
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:50,240
it's important to um to understand like

697
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:52,159
how what does what what

698
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:55,120
does impact does that time series aspect

699
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:55,120
of it have on PCA?

700
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:02,159
A couple of things I think are are

701
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:03,919
important. We

702
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:08,720
we generally are going to be interested

703
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:11,039
in in modeling the the changes of var of

704
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:14,080
things of variables like not the levels.

705
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:17,039
Part of that is that the thing I'm I was

706
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:20,480
just talking about which is demeaning.

707
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:23,039
And part of it is that when you make

708
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:26,240
bets in the market, you make money based

709
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:28,159
on how things change after your bet, not

710
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,399
the price, the absolute level of where

711
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:32,880
the price is at. So like returns are

712
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:36,480
what matters, not the price of

713
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:39,679
something, the absolute price.

714
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:42,720
Um then the next thing is like okay so

715
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:45,039
when we do when we model when we have

716
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,919
our data uh in finance like generally

717
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:49,039
the data is the historical returns or

718
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:50,720
histo history history of something

719
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:53,840
history of prices history of returns

720
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,120
history of anything of of whatever

721
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:57,440
you're modeling. It doesn't have to be

722
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:59,520
just prices could be could be any

723
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:02,159
anything that any any technical

724
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:04,799
indicator

725
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:06,640
and that means that every day there is a

726
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:09,679
there is a history that is similar but a

727
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:11,600
little different. So the history changes

728
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:14,640
your your information about what has

729
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:17,760
happened changes slowly

730
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:22,480
and that means that when you're looking

731
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:24,480
at your PCA you have to now define

732
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,399
how am I going to define my data matrix

733
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:29,360
which I'm using to calculate my vectors

734
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:32,399
and values and the one of the main

735
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:37,120
choices are how long of a history I want

736
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:40,480
to use and how much how do I weigh How

737
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:43,760
do I weight history? More recent history

738
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:45,519
versus further away history.

739
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:48,240
And this is these are some of the main

740
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:50,480
hyperparameters of principal component

741
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,480
analysis in finance.

742
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:55,919
How many things I'm I'm including in my

743
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:58,880
obser in my data data set.

744
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:01,919
How far back am I looking? How am I

745
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:04,799
waiting that those observations as I

746
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:07,279
pass through time?

747
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:11,159
And then the last thing is like the

748
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:11,159
robustness of the data.

749
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:18,559
Very often there is a trade-off between

750
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:21,679
including more data points

751
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:23,840
but each each marginal addition of data

752
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:26,720
like each marginal dimension of data

753
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:29,440
that I'm looking at could be less

754
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:32,880
robust. Like there's like and we'll talk

755
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:36,000
about in the examples later on, but

756
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:39,200
there's um we have to think carefully

757
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,519
about how

758
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:44,240
how robust the data we're putting in is

759
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:46,399
because if it's if it's too noisy, if

760
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:49,120
it's not representative of where our

761
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:50,720
bets are going to be, then it becomes

762
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,000
less relevant to our modeling down the

763
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,559
line. On the other hand, if we don't

764
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,200
include enough, we're also going to be

765
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:59,039
missing opportunities to to um

766
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,960
understand the structure, the

767
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:05,279
information. So again, that's part of

768
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:07,279
the art of of um of actually of the

769
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:09,039
practitioner is to actually kind of have

770
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:10,559
some feeling of have some intuition

771
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:12,640
about what I should include and what I

772
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:16,240
should not include. And we'll we'll talk

773
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:17,840
about an example here. The example first

774
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,840
example and the main example I want to

775
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:22,960
go through

776
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:25,360
is um applying principal component

777
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:28,159
analysis to the United States bond

778
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:29,679
market. Yes. I feel like you mentioned

779
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:33,039
that

780
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:36,720
PCA in this case time series

781
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:39,440
like historical historical but is there

782
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:41,840
you kind of play with the like

783
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:45,440
granularity of the time series as well

784
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:48,880
like the different um I guess window

785
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,240
sizes I would say of like how how

786
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,760
granular the date is going to be when

787
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,000
it's like

788
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:55,919
>> Yeah. Yeah. That that's another that's a

789
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
whole other dimension of how granular it

790
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:00,640
is. Absolutely right. It's not just

791
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:04,080
about how long of a history, but how

792
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:06,080
granular it is. Like

793
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:08,159
what like the examples I'm going to show

794
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:12,560
you right now

795
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:14,159
are based on daily observations.

796
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,560
But

797
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:19,040
why why did I decide to use daily

798
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:22,159
observations?

799
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:24,560
The short answer is like and we by the

800
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:27,200
way very often in in my work we use

801
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:29,119
daily observations. The reason is that

802
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:32,159
daily observations

803
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:34,399
are just a more available generally more

804
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:36,720
histories is high quality data history

805
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:40,000
is available for longer periods of time

806
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:43,839
for daily observations. Second

807
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:47,040
yes intraday observations are

808
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:50,320
they represent additional data.

809
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:52,079
However, the quality of

810
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:55,200
the quality of that data, meaning how

811
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:57,760
how much noise there is, can very often

812
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:59,599
in practice be much higher for interday

813
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,440
data than is for end of day data. That

814
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:03,839
might not always be true. There are

815
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:06,240
situations where that's not true, right?

816
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:07,760
But and there's there's entire fields in

817
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,520
finance that deal with high frequency

818
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:12,560
trading.

819
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:14,640
In those fields, end of day data is just

820
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:17,119
like they their whole trading buying,

821
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:19,280
holding and selling happens 10 times for

822
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:21,200
the entire day. So they start and end

823
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,280
the day with like no positions. And for

824
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,920
them daily is like not relevant. It's

825
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:28,000
too too slow. They need to understand

826
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:31,000
how the market moves on a very fast time

827
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
scale.

828
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:37,839
So that how how often like how you

829
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:40,160
sample time is a whole is a whole other

830
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:43,040
story. And basically how we sample time

831
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:45,040
is going to impact the units of

832
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:48,560
volatility because volatility is

833
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:51,280
measured in in units of square of time

834
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:53,760
basically. So it's it's very important

835
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,680
to like to know that and have to to to

836
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:58,160
understand to keep to keep that in mind

837
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:59,599
that whatever the frequency of sampling

838
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:02,160
is that's going to give you effectively

839
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:03,680
the unit of your volatility and then if

840
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,000
you want to annualize it like you need

841
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:07,680
to apply appropriate factors and

842
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,560
comparing volatilities of different

843
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:12,880
units is not going to be meaningful. So

844
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:15,599
that that's important.

845
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:19,359
Okay, going back to this example,

846
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:22,160
the um US bond market.

847
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:24,000
So why why am I like why is this an

848
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:26,320
interesting example? Like I work in

849
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,920
fixed income which is basically where we

850
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,920
trade

851
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,880
of

852
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:34,960
bonds and various derivatives of bonds

853
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:37,200
and those are the the biggest markets in

854
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,560
the world like the most there's huge

855
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,760
amounts of money being transferred.

856
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,359
They're not necessarily the most

857
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:44,960
volatile. Equities are much more

858
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:49,920
volatile, but they are extremely deep,

859
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:51,680
extremely liquid, and they also allow

860
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,599
like people who trade in them to take

861
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:56,240
large amounts of leverage. So even

862
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:58,880
though they're not by themselves that

863
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:00,960
volatile, if once you take leverage, you

864
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:04,560
can increase volatility by taking

865
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:07,040
leverage. So you can actually make um

866
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,560
you can construct portfolios that are

867
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:12,400
that are actually quite quite volatile

868
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:16,320
and deliver substantial um substantial

869
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:18,240
like market volatility and and returns.

870
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:21,520
So there's a lot of there's a lot of

871
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:25,599
huge industry of money managers, hedge

872
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:27,040
funds that trade fixed income and um the

873
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:28,880
US bond market is the kind of

874
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,400
prototypical example of fixed income.

875
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:33,599
It's the most liquid in the world by

876
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:37,599
far, the most well structured. So, it's

877
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:40,960
a great example to to play with.

878
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:43,599
Another reason I'm using it is because

879
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:46,560
there is pricing data from the Federal

880
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:48,480
Reserve that is freely available and

881
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:51,839
that's the data that we're going to use

882
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:53,599
right now to do our analysis.

883
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:58,560
this data is like it's it's actually

884
00:37:53,599 --> 00:38:02,800
quite high quality data and um

885
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:04,400
yeah that like that's I think that um

886
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,160
if you want to do a project like this

887
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:10,880
will be a great great data set to play

888
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:15,040
with because it's real and um it's it's

889
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:16,960
goes on for a very long time and and you

890
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,599
can apply you can apply our PCA

891
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:22,320
techniques to it. So the first question

892
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:24,560
to ask is like is there remember like we

893
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:27,839
have our data set now what does it

894
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:30,320
consist of? Well, in the United States,

895
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:34,000
the US Treasury issues it just it issues

896
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:36,160
a bunch of T bills, short maturity bills

897
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,359
that they raise money. That's that's how

898
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:40,800
they raise money for the debt. But, uh,

899
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:42,800
the part we're going to concern with is

900
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:46,240
going to be the US Treasury notes and

901
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:48,400
bonds, which are kind of the longerdated

902
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:50,640
instruments that US Treasury issues.

903
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:53,280
They issue on a very regular basis.

904
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:55,920
Every month there is a schedule of

905
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,839
auctions that is very well known and

906
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,520
repetitive

907
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:01,440
and they always issue like a two-year

908
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:03,040
bond, a three-year bond, fiveyear bond,

909
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,680
seven-year bond, 10ear bond, and a

910
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:08,320
30-year bond. And there's actually now a

911
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:10,560
20-year bond that started about like

912
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:13,119
three, four years ago, but we're not

913
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:15,040
going to look at that right now because

914
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:16,880
it's it's fairly it's very new and it's

915
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:19,760
not not as liquid. So, we're just going

916
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:22,079
to focus on these.

917
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:24,560
And what are like the other thing about

918
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:26,560
these bonds is that they're

919
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,920
they're all debts of the US Treasury.

920
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:30,560
So, they're they're very in a sense

921
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:33,280
they're very similar. Like if you if you

922
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:34,960
if I give you money for six months and I

923
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:37,040
also give you a separate loan for like

924
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:39,119
three years,

925
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:40,800
I've I've given you two loans. The first

926
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:43,599
thing that these two things are they're

927
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,359
basically you still owe me money, right?

928
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:48,000
Yeah. one is longer in maturity than the

929
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:51,200
other, but like you're still wing money.

930
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,920
So, in terms of the way the price of

931
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:56,160
these of these securities evolves,

932
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:58,640
they're all kind of they all depend on

933
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:00,640
the interest rates, the short-term the

934
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:03,040
path of short-term interest rates of the

935
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:05,040
Federal Reserve and the expectations of

936
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:07,359
that path. So, that it's they're all

937
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:10,640
derivatives of that.

938
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:14,800
The implications of that is that the

939
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:17,839
returns or the um the changes of bond

940
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:20,720
yields are very highly correlated. So

941
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:23,040
here on the bottom right I've shown

942
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:24,880
the um

943
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,160
the the correlation matrix of changes

944
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,800
and you can see this is like these

945
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:32,240
numbers are very very high.

946
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:33,920
So this is a data set where

947
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:36,000
everything is very very highly

948
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:38,560
correlated

949
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,800
prime candidate for PCA. Whenever you

950
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:43,599
see a correlation matrix that has high

951
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:45,839
concentrations of high

952
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:48,240
high correlations prime candidate of

953
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:49,760
PCA. So what are these what are these

954
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:52,160
numbers I'm looking at on the on the

955
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:56,160
left chart I've shown the US yield

956
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:58,720
curve. So on any given day we can

957
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:00,000
observe the prices of two-year bonds,

958
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,520
three-year bonds, five year bond,

959
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,280
sevenyear bond, 10 year bond, 30-year

960
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:08,079
bond. What is the price of that? And I

961
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:12,960
don't know if uh if Peter have you have

962
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:15,839
you um guys done bond math yet?

963
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:17,440
>> A little. So so you we know the prices

964
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:20,000
where these things buy. So they're very

965
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:22,240
transparent prices and we can convert

966
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,560
prices to yields.

967
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:27,119
So basically a yield is like the implied

968
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:29,359
rate of return of the bonds effectively

969
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:31,599
given its price over the course of its

970
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:35,200
maturity. And then when we plot these

971
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:38,319
yields on on this plot here I've plotted

972
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:40,160
the yields the yield is on the y- axis

973
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:42,000
versus the maturity of the bond. And

974
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:44,720
I've sampled

975
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,319
five days from history.

976
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:49,040
And this is what's known as the yield

977
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:52,160
curve. that is a that is the most

978
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:54,319
important input of macroeconomics in the

979
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:56,240
world is the US the shape of the dollar

980
00:41:54,319 --> 00:42:00,240
yield curve.

981
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:02,880
Um sometimes most of the time the yield

982
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:05,680
curve is upward sloping so people people

983
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:07,280
require a bigger return to lend money

984
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:10,079
for longer and the US treasury like

985
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,920
generally requires that. But sometimes

986
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:13,440
that is not true. Like sometimes you can

987
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,440
see this top blue line. Sometimes the

988
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,520
yields actually like is is starts out

989
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,280
downward sloping and then flattens out.

990
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,960
So these yields can have a variety of

991
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:24,000
shapes

992
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:25,599
and this is just the level of yields.

993
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,839
What we're betting on is the changes. So

994
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:31,280
we're betting on how this curve evolves

995
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:34,400
dayto day. And you can see from these

996
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:36,640
from these um yield curves that you can

997
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,160
imagine how if I just if I was to show

998
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:40,000
you a movie of the yield curve, it's

999
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:41,280
going to kind of flop around. It's going

1000
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,720
to be like a little string. It's like

1001
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,720
flop around, but it's going to be like

1002
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:46,800
going up and down. It's going to slope

1003
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:49,119
like this. It's going to have a whole

1004
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:51,839
set of dynamics

1005
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:53,440
and that that dynamics and that kind of

1006
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:57,960
those dynamics is what we're trying to

1007
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:57,960
kind of model with PCA here.

1008
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:03,599
Um

1009
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,119
bonus question is

1010
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:07,440
do you guys know what is the shape of

1011
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:09,920
the yield curve now? What does it look

1012
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,520
like? What are what are the is are

1013
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:15,040
short-term interest rates like higher

1014
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:19,680
than long-term interest rates?

1015
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:22,160
Have you has has anybody like

1016
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:24,880
we had a a very prominent Federal

1017
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:27,680
Reserve meeting recently

1018
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:29,680
and uh they they do do you remember what

1019
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:32,319
they did

1020
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:33,920
the action the Fed took was the action

1021
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:36,640
the Fed took was to cut interest rates

1022
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:38,720
by 50 basis points. So what the Fed is

1023
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:40,480
doing it's cutting the interest rate

1024
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:42,960
that is the leftmost point on this yield

1025
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:45,680
curve that that they're they're setting

1026
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:48,319
that point. Everything else, the rest of

1027
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:50,800
the curve is market expectations of what

1028
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:52,880
that point would do in the future. So

1029
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,880
they moved this point down by 50 basis

1030
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:58,400
points. 50 basis points means half a

1031
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:00,480
percent. So it went it went down by half

1032
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,480
a percent.

1033
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,880
Right now this blue curve, even though

1034
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:08,160
it's from 2023, that's like that's

1035
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:10,160
pretty recent, it's still the curve is

1036
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,680
still downward sloping. It looks a

1037
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:14,319
little bit more like like this right

1038
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:15,599
now. So it's not it it was for a very

1039
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:17,599
long time it was actually like really

1040
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:20,240
inverted. It was going like downward

1041
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:23,280
sloping like that. Now the back now the

1042
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:25,040
back is like starting to flatten out but

1043
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:28,599
it's still quite high in the front end

1044
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:28,599
and downward sloping.

1045
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:35,359
So that that unrelated to what we're

1046
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:38,560
talking about but fun kind of a fun

1047
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:40,560
fact. Okay. So now when we look at yield

1048
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:43,560
changes

1049
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,560
um

1050
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:48,560
when we look at the we take our data we

1051
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:51,920
compute your changes so the changes of

1052
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:54,319
yields on dayto day

1053
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:56,000
we we can we should demean that data set

1054
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:57,359
but generally demeaning it doesn't

1055
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,119
really help that much because the mean

1056
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:00,800
is going to be very close to zero

1057
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:01,920
because changes are sometimes the are

1058
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:05,280
going to go up sometimes they're going

1059
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:08,000
to go down you're not going to have over

1060
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:09,119
the history of of 20 30 years that we're

1061
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,040
talking about here, you're not going to

1062
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:16,319
have a large large mean. Still, it's

1063
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:19,440
always good practice to demean it.

1064
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:21,520
Won't change much the result. But then

1065
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:24,000
we take this

1066
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:26,000
in this example, I didn't actually

1067
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,720
normalize the variance. I think we just

1068
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,800
just left it in there. So we did PCA on

1069
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:33,520
coariance matrix. And the reason is that

1070
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:36,800
the units the yield changes are they're

1071
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:40,000
comparable units and there is

1072
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:42,160
um looking at the PCA without without

1073
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:45,760
normalizing the the variance is actually

1074
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:48,400
like it's a very meaningful output like

1075
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:50,960
it's it's we want to understand how

1076
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:52,560
volatile is going to tell us something

1077
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:55,040
about the relative volatilities of

1078
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:58,640
points.

1079
00:45:55,040 --> 00:46:00,560
So when we do that and we look at the um

1080
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:05,040
what what I what I'm plotting here on

1081
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:07,040
the top are the the igen vectors. So the

1082
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:08,319
the principal component factors the

1083
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:11,440
shapes of the principal component

1084
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:14,400
factors on variance days.

1085
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:15,680
So this plot can be confusing right and

1086
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:19,280
I want to make sure that we're all on

1087
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:22,720
the same page what it is. This was

1088
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:24,640
this is the shape. This is the yields.

1089
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:27,040
Then we take these yields. We look at

1090
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:29,599
the changes of yields. Then we put them

1091
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:32,240
through PCA. And remember the output of

1092
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:35,520
PCA is IGN vectors and values. IN

1093
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:37,520
vectors means every every point like two

1094
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:38,960
year, three year, 5 year, 10 year, 30

1095
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:40,880
year everything has a number. Now a

1096
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:44,079
loading

1097
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:46,160
we call that the number the vector

1098
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:50,560
coefficient. I call that loading. That's

1099
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:53,359
a very a term that we use.

1100
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:55,599
that loading is again there's a time

1101
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:58,880
series of those and I'm plotting here a

1102
00:46:55,599 --> 00:47:00,800
select like five different dates in

1103
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:03,760
history

1104
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:05,760
of what that vector looks like what the

1105
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,359
first principal component looks like

1106
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,720
what the second principal component

1107
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:12,359
looks like what the third principal

1108
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:12,359
component looks like

1109
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:18,800
these are f these are like snapshots

1110
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:22,800
like five snapshots in time

1111
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:24,240
and I'm plotting maturity versus loading

1112
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,520
and there like there's actually three

1113
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:27,680
dimensions here. There's maturity,

1114
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:28,960
loading and time. So I can't like I can

1115
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:32,160
show you a threedimensional plot but

1116
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:33,520
that will just be like confusing. So I'm

1117
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,640
I'm showing here cross-sections. So

1118
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:37,760
these are these are various

1119
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:40,800
cross-sections on time.

1120
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:43,599
And you can see that

1121
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:48,160
there is a clear and persistent pattern

1122
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:52,400
in what the en vectors look like. The

1123
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:54,960
first one PC1 is called the level.

1124
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:57,280
That's basically means that

1125
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:59,040
the that that is like it all the

1126
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:01,440
loadings are positive. So it means when

1127
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:04,160
the yield curves move generally they

1128
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:06,319
move up and down together when in the

1129
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:08,800
same direction. So if 10 year rate is

1130
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:10,319
going up probably two-year rate is going

1131
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:13,520
up as well. Five year rate is going up

1132
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:15,520
as well. And hence the term rates are

1133
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:17,119
going up. rates are going up is like

1134
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:19,680
generally speaking everything is going

1135
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:21,520
up or down and that's the most that is

1136
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:24,880
the the move that that is explains most

1137
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:27,359
of the variance of the yield curve

1138
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:29,599
but on top of that now there's a second

1139
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:31,839
move which is we call this PC2 and we

1140
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:34,800
when we look at the shape of it we can

1141
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:36,640
say oh it starts out negative and the

1142
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:39,359
front end of the curve and it's positive

1143
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:41,040
on the back end of the curve that's the

1144
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:43,119
slope

1145
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:45,200
so that's kind of a steepening of the

1146
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:47,760
curve versus flattening the curve that

1147
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:49,280
is the second PC factor.

1148
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:52,000
So this first PC factor by the way

1149
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:53,680
explains around like 90% of the variance

1150
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,400
maybe like 85 or something and the

1151
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:59,119
second PC factor explains like between

1152
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:01,839
five and 10% of the variance

1153
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:03,680
like very huge difference

1154
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:06,960
and the third PC factor is like the

1155
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:09,200
curvature. So how how curvy what is the

1156
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,720
curvature of the of the like it's it's

1157
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:13,119
positive on the front end positive on

1158
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:16,960
the at the 30-year and negative at the

1159
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:18,480
belly of the curve 10 year point

1160
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,160
and that has the smallest amount of

1161
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:21,839
variance. So what does that mean? If you

1162
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:23,760
think mentally of the movie of what the

1163
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:25,440
yield curve is doing it's mostly going

1164
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:28,400
up and down mostly going up and down

1165
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:30,079
like that but it's also like it's also

1166
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,520
slope a little bit of slope. So it's

1167
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:33,280
mostly up and down but like a little bit

1168
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:36,319
of slope and a little bit of like

1169
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:38,319
curvature like that.

1170
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:39,760
So like that that's that's that's the

1171
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:42,800
that's what this thing tells us is the

1172
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:46,160
dynamics of the curve.

1173
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:47,760
Um now

1174
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,880
some of these things are like super the

1175
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:51,839
structure of this thing actually tells

1176
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:53,599
you a lot. You can see how the the PC1

1177
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:57,000
level

1178
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:57,000
it like

1179
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:02,960
the the u the maturity at which it like

1180
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:05,119
it starts out steep upward sloping and

1181
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:06,800
then it levels out. The maturity at the

1182
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:09,359
maturity in years at which it levels

1183
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:11,839
out. I've plotted here what the maturity

1184
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:13,440
is at which it it kind of levels out

1185
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:16,480
where the short-term rate decoupled from

1186
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:19,440
long-term rates. And if you plot that in

1187
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:23,280
time in time series, you can kind of see

1188
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:27,200
that um it was

1189
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:29,359
very short like monetary policy was was

1190
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:32,880
basically only governing the short end

1191
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:34,559
of the curve up to two years up until

1192
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:36,480
right after the postfinancial crisis.

1193
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:38,800
And then the Fed became very very

1194
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:41,520
powerful. Post financial crisis the Fed

1195
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:43,280
said we're going to keep rates low for a

1196
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:46,079
very long time and all of a sudden this

1197
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:49,040
thing exploded. it became very very very

1198
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:52,720
high. So like basically um the short end

1199
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:56,000
rates were governing effectively the the

1200
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:58,559
the um rates up to up to four or five

1201
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:01,359
years and then up until co they started

1202
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:03,280
to decrease up until co happened. Fed

1203
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:04,640
came in and said we're going to bring

1204
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:07,200
the bazooka so we're going to

1205
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:09,119
everybody's like okay they're going to

1206
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:11,920
keep rates low for a long time as well.

1207
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:15,359
It exploded again and now it's back down

1208
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:16,880
again. So that is like that's that's

1209
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:19,280
already something that is kind of like a

1210
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:20,880
regime indicator. You can see how the

1211
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:23,359
market behavior is reflected in the

1212
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:24,880
shape of these PC factors.

1213
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:26,240
That tells you so much about what's

1214
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,760
going on in the market when you look at

1215
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:29,920
the these in the details of these

1216
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:31,920
factors.

1217
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:34,800
Something like

1218
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:37,440
where is the bottom of PC3 where is the

1219
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:39,280
belly you can see that sometimes is at

1220
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:41,920
at 10 years sometimes it becomes close

1221
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:45,280
to five sometimes close to 15. That's

1222
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:47,680
also a regime indicator

1223
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:50,319
PC loading stability. So here I'm taking

1224
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:53,359
this this graph PC1 graph but instead of

1225
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:56,319
plotting loading versus maturity I'm

1226
00:51:53,359 --> 00:52:00,160
plotting loading versus time and each

1227
00:51:56,319 --> 00:52:01,839
maturity point is line.

1228
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:03,920
So that tells me the stability of my

1229
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:05,920
loadings. you generally you want to look

1230
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:08,319
at that because you want you want

1231
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:10,880
factors that are stable

1232
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:14,480
and PC1 loadings are are pretty stable

1233
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:17,440
but these and the fact where the changes

1234
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:18,800
in PC1 loadings they're very often like

1235
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:22,160
they're quite meaningful like you can

1236
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:23,920
2008 crisis two-year rate this blue line

1237
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:25,520
is a two-year rate the short end the

1238
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:26,800
short end becomes very volatile nobody

1239
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:28,800
knows what the Fed is going to do

1240
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:32,319
there's a lot of volatility and then

1241
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:34,559
collapses post 2012 like the Fed is not

1242
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:36,319
doing anything. So the to your point is

1243
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:37,839
not moving.

1244
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:40,319
Then it goes up. Maybe the Fed is going

1245
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:41,920
to move. And then after CO it also

1246
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:43,520
collapses

1247
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:45,920
and now it's back up again. The Fed is

1248
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:48,880
very active right now. This this ends in

1249
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:50,240
like 2023 this data set. If I make it a

1250
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:52,800
little bit longer, you see this line

1251
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:55,800
actually went very high in the recent

1252
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:55,800
history.

1253
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:01,119
So all of that is um these things are

1254
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:03,359
like they're they're

1255
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:05,760
they all come from this data but they're

1256
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:08,240
they tell you they they they tell you a

1257
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:10,319
lot about the behavior the regime and

1258
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:12,559
the uh dynamics of of interest rate

1259
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:14,800
market.

1260
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:16,800
This is the variance explained. I think

1261
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:19,520
this is like this is a way remember how

1262
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:22,960
I was telling you how we look at values

1263
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:25,440
and we want to make sure that they're

1264
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:28,000
well segregated. Well, this is a good

1265
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:29,680
this is a way to look at it. If you look

1266
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,520
at this chart and the first factor

1267
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:34,240
explains so much variance, it's like

1268
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:35,920
yeah, that that's that's a good factor.

1269
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:40,400
That's a good factor to that like that's

1270
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:41,920
a solid factor and you can um you know

1271
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:44,240
that this thing is persistent. You're

1272
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:46,240
very this thing is likely to continue is

1273
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:48,720
likely to be stable and it's a good part

1274
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:50,240
of your model for the future. If you

1275
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:52,400
look at variance explained by factor,

1276
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:54,240
this is a log plot.

1277
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:56,720
You'll see that how the first and second

1278
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:58,640
and third factor are separated in like

1279
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:01,359
by order of magnitude. So they never

1280
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:04,640
cross. So that means that these factors

1281
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:06,960
are robust and

1282
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:08,559
they they are like yeah they're they're

1283
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:10,480
very useful modeling factors for

1284
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:12,160
modeling. You want to see this kind of

1285
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:14,319
picture. What you don't want to see is

1286
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:15,520
like lines that are all entangled up

1287
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:16,960
with each other. That's you don't want

1288
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:18,559
to see that. You want to see something

1289
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:20,800
like this in general when you're looking

1290
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:22,480
at PCA.

1291
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:26,359
Again this is these are values I'm

1292
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:26,359
looking at variance explained

1293
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:31,280
um

1294
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:34,960
and this out of sample coariance is like

1295
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:38,400
when I'm this is basically when I when I

1296
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:40,559
calibrate my PCA remember my my in my if

1297
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:45,520
I take a single data set however I

1298
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:48,880
choose it and I do run my PCA the PC1

1299
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:50,559
projections and the PC2 projections

1300
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:53,200
are going to be uncorrelated with each

1301
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:56,480
other by construction. But if I take the

1302
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:59,280
same loadings now and I look at the

1303
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:02,000
future returns,

1304
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:03,920
there is nothing that says that

1305
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,920
um if I project my future data, future

1306
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:07,280
returns onto the same loadings, those

1307
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:09,760
might not might actually become

1308
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:11,520
correlated.

1309
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:13,599
So here I'm computing like kind of

1310
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:16,400
future returns

1311
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:20,160
projected onto PC factors using that are

1312
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:22,400
calibrated on like past past history and

1313
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:24,720
and you see that it's not they're not

1314
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:27,440
fully orthogonal. However, they're quite

1315
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:30,160
orthogonal. So it means that like the

1316
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:32,559
dynamics are mostly preserved.

1317
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:35,040
They're the loading the PC factors are

1318
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:36,319
mostly stable. This is not like this is

1319
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:38,160
something you would expect you would

1320
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:39,359
hope to see. You don't want to see you

1321
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:41,599
don't want to see these numbers off

1322
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:42,800
diagonal numbers to become like 30 50%

1323
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:46,160
that will be like that means that your

1324
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:48,640
PCI model is quite unstable but if it's

1325
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:50,400
like if if your our sample correlation

1326
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:53,400
is is pretty small that's that's a good

1327
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:53,400
thing

1328
00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:59,200
and

1329
00:55:55,680 --> 00:56:02,960
now what do we do with this PCA

1330
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:05,280
well one of the key things is like okay

1331
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:09,040
I want to go back to this slide for one

1332
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:12,000
reason suppose you say, well, I really I

1333
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:14,880
want to bet on curve. I want to bet on

1334
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,160
the second factor or I have a model that

1335
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:18,400
on that I want to bet on like curve

1336
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:20,480
stippling or relative value of 10ear

1337
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:23,359
bonds versus fiveyear bonds or 30-year

1338
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:25,920
bonds versus 10ear bonds.

1339
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:28,559
I can use PCA to isolate effects that

1340
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:31,440
are idiosyncratic to particular points

1341
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:34,160
on the curve to particular factors. And

1342
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:37,200
I can basically say well if I if I hedge

1343
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:40,000
out the vast majority of the variance by

1344
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:43,520
hedging out PC1

1345
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:46,640
and I look at like the residual PC1

1346
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:50,640
residuals which is PC2 and above. What

1347
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:53,520
can I say about those uh about those

1348
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:55,760
returns? How can I model those and how

1349
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:56,799
do I and the key thing you can you can

1350
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:58,880
construct these things. You can say,

1351
00:56:56,799 --> 00:57:01,359
"Oh, I want to model these things." But

1352
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:02,640
the key is how do if once you once you

1353
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:05,920
have a good model, how do you trade

1354
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:08,160
them? So being able to construct P to

1355
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:09,760
understand how PC loadings translate to

1356
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:12,240
portfolios is very important because it

1357
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:15,440
it tells you how I can use this

1358
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:17,760
methodology to construct specific

1359
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:20,880
portfolios that are uncorrelated to each

1360
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:24,559
other and

1361
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:27,599
um and give me like a new a new a new

1362
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:30,319
kind of target to model.

1363
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:32,640
If you if I didn't do that, I have I

1364
00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:34,160
still have like eight things I can trade

1365
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:36,079
or six things. Two year, three year,

1366
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:38,240
five year, 10 year, and 30-year bonds,

1367
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:40,000
but they're so correlated where I'm

1368
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:42,079
trading 10-year bond or 30-year bond.

1369
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,839
Like, if I just trade 10-year bond

1370
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:46,640
outright or 30-year bond outright, I'm

1371
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:48,720
mostly getting the same return. So to be

1372
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:51,440
able to increase the diversity of what

1373
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:54,160
I'm of the target I'm capturing, I'm

1374
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:55,680
using PCA to construct more portfolios

1375
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:57,200
that are going to be uncorrelated and

1376
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:59,599
present me with more opportunities to

1377
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:01,760
model to make bets.

1378
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:04,000
That's like that's a key use case for

1379
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:06,079
PCA finance. Like we take these things

1380
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,960
that are very highly correlated and now

1381
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:10,640
I'm going to create out of these six

1382
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:12,960
highly correlated portfolios, I'm going

1383
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:16,079
to create three or four portfolios that

1384
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:17,920
are not highly correlated.

1385
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:19,520
What are like and these portfolios are

1386
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:22,400
going to be my PCA are going to be

1387
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:25,200
defined by my PCA factors.

1388
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:27,520
So remember the factors

1389
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:30,799
on any given day they give me a loading

1390
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:32,640
on every tenor on every maturity.

1391
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:34,319
Yeah. Did you have a question? Okay.

1392
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:37,359
Yeah. They gave me a loading on every

1393
00:58:34,319 --> 00:58:40,160
maturity. So it tells me and I I can

1394
00:58:37,359 --> 00:58:43,599
think of this loading as telling me how

1395
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:48,160
much to own of this particular

1396
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:50,880
bond on on that maturity. So PC1 means

1397
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:55,680
buy every bond in some in some equal

1398
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:57,920
amount. That would be that's PC1. PC2

1399
00:58:55,680 --> 00:59:01,200
is like oh you should like sell some

1400
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:03,280
two-year bonds, buy some 30-year bonds.

1401
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:05,119
Like basically the portfolio is going to

1402
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:06,799
be

1403
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:09,680
the portfolio is going to be defined

1404
00:59:06,799 --> 00:59:13,119
like you're going to you're going to

1405
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:18,079
basically buy bonds according to the

1406
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:20,000
loading on every on every point on PC2.

1407
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:22,720
Why is this portfolio interesting? Well,

1408
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,480
it's interesting because PCA tells us

1409
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:26,880
that if I construct this portfolio like

1410
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:28,880
this, it would have no sensitivity to

1411
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:32,319
PC1.

1412
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:34,000
But PC1 is like 90% of my variance. So

1413
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:37,359
that means that by if I construct the

1414
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:40,640
PC2 portfolio, I have effectively hedged

1415
00:59:37,359 --> 00:59:42,400
out 90% of the variance of individual

1416
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:45,280
bonds and I've constructed something

1417
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:48,960
that's new, less volatile,

1418
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:51,920
but uncorrelated to my original like

1419
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:54,640
outright tenure bond.

1420
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:56,400
Same thing with PC3. I can construct and

1421
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:58,640
I can construct like these PC3

1422
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:00,319
portfolios that are like and these by

1423
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:01,520
the way these things actually trade in

1424
01:00:00,319 --> 01:00:04,000
the market. They're they're they're

1425
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:07,520
called like curves PC2 things are like

1426
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:10,319
they're curves like you you buy two year

1427
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:13,280
you sell 10 year vice versa and then and

1428
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:15,280
there's flies which are like 10 and 30s

1429
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:18,079
where you sell 10 year and you buy two

1430
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:20,160
year and 30 year. Yes. Is there any

1431
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:21,760
application of the higher order PCs or

1432
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:22,960
are they just they explain such little

1433
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:23,520
variance that you don't really bother

1434
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:25,280
with?

1435
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:26,960
>> They are the most interesting thing

1436
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:30,240
because

1437
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:32,640
the PC1 stuff is easy to bet on like you

1438
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:34,720
just bite your bond buy and sell. If you

1439
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:37,280
can model that and predict it that's

1440
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:41,040
awesome

1441
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:42,559
but like first that's hard but also it's

1442
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:45,200
only one thing you can predict whether

1443
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:46,559
are you doing 10 year or 30 years you're

1444
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:49,680
predicting only one thing. So you can

1445
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:51,760
make a model for that.

1446
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:54,640
Being able to construct these portfolios

1447
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:56,319
PC2 and three, you're able to create out

1448
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:58,400
of these

1449
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:59,599
out of these like out of these bounds

1450
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:01,440
that are highly correlated, you're able

1451
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:03,680
to create something that is entirely

1452
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:05,920
different from from the PC1

1453
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:08,799
uncorrelated. So now you have something

1454
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:11,680
else that you can model and you can and

1455
01:01:08,799 --> 01:01:14,160
because of the market is so the market

1456
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:16,160
is is liquid. It needs to be very liquid

1457
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:17,920
because remember this it doesn't explain

1458
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:20,240
a lot of variance. So if you construct

1459
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:22,240
this thing it's not going to move much.

1460
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:25,520
But all that means is I just need to buy

1461
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:28,079
more of it. If I buy enough of it even

1462
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:29,520
though a single unit might not move much

1463
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:31,599
when I buy enough of it is still going

1464
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:34,160
to move enough. And that's the point of

1465
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:36,559
leverage. So if I sell a bunch of

1466
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:38,079
two-year bond, buy a bunch of 30-year

1467
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:39,760
bond.

1468
01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:41,599
Now,

1469
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:44,640
if I buy the same notional, buy and sell

1470
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:46,720
the same notionals as as the PC1, it's

1471
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:48,960
not going to, like you said, it's not

1472
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:50,799
going to move very much. Maybe it's

1473
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:55,280
going to move like only one/ird as much

1474
01:01:50,799 --> 01:01:58,960
as my PC1 portfolio. But if I scale it

1475
01:01:55,280 --> 01:02:02,079
up by by three by by a factor of three,

1476
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:03,920
now my new portfolio PC2 has the same

1477
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:05,440
daily standard deviation as my PC1

1478
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:08,160
portfolio

1479
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:09,760
and it's orthogonal. So you just need

1480
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:11,520
basically so what did I need to do that?

1481
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:13,520
I need to be able to buy three times as

1482
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:15,119
much. So it needs the market needs to be

1483
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:18,400
liquid. I need to have access to

1484
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:20,799
leverage. You can do the same with PC3.

1485
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:22,559
And yes, in in the in the big liquid

1486
01:02:20,799 --> 01:02:24,480
markets like US Treasury, there is

1487
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:26,799
enough access for to leverage where you

1488
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:28,559
can actually do that. You'll see a lot

1489
01:02:26,799 --> 01:02:31,040
of times in the press, it's a very hot

1490
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:32,559
topic now. the CFTC is trying to

1491
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:34,559
regulate like how much leverage exists

1492
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:37,839
in the financial markets especially in

1493
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:39,599
interest rates because because of this

1494
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:41,599
because of the fact that PC1 is so

1495
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:44,240
explained so much people use massive

1496
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:46,720
amounts of leverage to gain access to to

1497
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:51,680
basically enough volatility to make

1498
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:53,440
these bets on on PC2 and three and um

1499
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:55,760
that can create that means you own large

1500
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:58,559
amount you own long and short massive

1501
01:02:55,760 --> 01:03:00,400
amounts of certain bonds that can be

1502
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:02,079
dangerous if it's systemic in a certain

1503
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:04,799
way and like this presents risk but it's

1504
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:07,440
also but it's definitely it's doable

1505
01:03:04,799 --> 01:03:09,520
because there is so much debt there's so

1506
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:12,880
much debt in the world that there is

1507
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:14,960
enough out there where you can where you

1508
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:16,880
can bet um you can gain this leverage

1509
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:20,799
basically and it's it's very accessible

1510
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:23,839
to professional investors

1511
01:03:20,799 --> 01:03:26,799
so yeah the actually the the far from

1512
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:28,799
far from it being irrelevant like that

1513
01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:32,079
is actually where a lot of times the

1514
01:03:28,799 --> 01:03:34,319
money is made but like it is true that

1515
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:36,720
as you go why can't we go to PC4 and

1516
01:03:34,319 --> 01:03:38,960
five the amount of leverage you need to

1517
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:41,680
make this work is become so high it

1518
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:43,440
becomes really expensive to trade

1519
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:45,760
>> yes

1520
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:48,079
that's like as you said before that this

1521
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:50,160
is this allows you where allowing you to

1522
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:52,559
kind of scale it up to get the

1523
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:55,680
volatility that you need is only is

1524
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:59,119
useful for like the fixed income because

1525
01:03:55,680 --> 01:04:01,599
it's more like liquid than like if buy

1526
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:03,200
the same thing like equities for example

1527
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:05,599
like since it's not as likely you

1528
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:09,839
couldn't get like if you were to buy

1529
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:13,920
that many of whatever um security cost

1530
01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:16,640
too much of a shift or stuff like that.

1531
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:21,359
>> Well

1532
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:23,680
it turns out that it's not that is not

1533
01:04:21,359 --> 01:04:25,440
it's it's not actually it's not really

1534
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:28,160
true what you say and and the re the

1535
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:30,240
reason is the following. Yeah, the

1536
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:32,000
volumes in notional volumes of equity

1537
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:35,119
market may be a little bit smaller.

1538
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:36,400
They're still very large and the

1539
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:37,920
variance explained of the first

1540
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:40,960
principal component in equities is not

1541
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:43,280
nearly as high as it is in rates. So you

1542
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:44,880
don't need as much leverage to get like

1543
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:46,880
the second principal components got a

1544
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:50,799
lot of volatility a lot more relative to

1545
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:52,799
the first than in in this example here

1546
01:04:50,799 --> 01:04:54,240
later in the slides which I think we

1547
01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:57,119
might not get to. There's also an

1548
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:59,760
example with equity indices in Europe.

1549
01:04:57,119 --> 01:05:01,280
The same concept there. And by the way,

1550
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:03,119
a lot of equity, there's a whole field

1551
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:05,599
of hedge funds called equities that are

1552
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:08,799
equity long short neutral. They are

1553
01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:11,200
basically betting on equities without

1554
01:05:08,799 --> 01:05:12,799
taking directional risk. So everybody is

1555
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:15,680
trying those all these guys are hedging

1556
01:05:12,799 --> 01:05:18,160
out PC1. They're taking leverage. It

1557
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:19,839
exists. It it's just a little more

1558
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:21,039
expensive to trade, but it gives you

1559
01:05:19,839 --> 01:05:23,839
opportunities that you wouldn't be able

1560
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:25,359
to access otherwise. Yeah.

1561
01:05:23,839 --> 01:05:26,960
>> Yes.

1562
01:05:25,359 --> 01:05:28,079
>> I was curious for like some big

1563
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:31,440
statement products, especially ones that

1564
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:33,760
are more liquid, they might trade like

1565
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:37,440
one rarely and two around specific

1566
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:40,319
events. So like the prices that you see

1567
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:43,359
are necessarily indicative of how the

1568
01:05:40,319 --> 01:05:46,240
prices would have traded like a day or

1569
01:05:43,359 --> 01:05:50,799
two before that. in how do you think

1570
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:53,440
about like how um to like I guess clean

1571
01:05:50,799 --> 01:05:55,119
data in a way or like understand that

1572
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:57,359
there's a lot of idiosyncratic factors

1573
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:59,680
that go on with fixing a product

1574
01:05:57,359 --> 01:06:02,960
especially ones that are more

1575
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:05,760
>> yeah um it's a great question there's a

1576
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:09,119
lot of art that goes a lot of like

1577
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:11,760
domain knowledge that goes into that in

1578
01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:14,319
this example with bonds

1579
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:18,400
um yeah there is certainly events

1580
01:06:14,319 --> 01:06:20,960
that where the market is very volatile

1581
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:23,280
and

1582
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:25,440
when we when we look at daily returns if

1583
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:26,799
I look at like 10 years of daily returns

1584
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:28,640
and I'm going to estimate like a

1585
01:06:26,799 --> 01:06:32,400
standard deviation

1586
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:37,760
and I'm going to say well on average

1587
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:39,839
the I could on average yields move by I

1588
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:41,520
don't know five to six basis points per

1589
01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:44,480
day something but which is that's

1590
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:48,000
roughly how much they

1591
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:49,680
But and then I say like well if I'm

1592
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:53,359
sitting there and tomorrow is like there

1593
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:57,119
wasn't this example in in August that

1594
01:06:53,359 --> 01:06:59,920
there was a huge huge like

1595
01:06:57,119 --> 01:07:02,160
um you know there was a huge number that

1596
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:06,640
comes out a huge print that was related

1597
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:09,359
to um to inflation and

1598
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:11,119
in on that day if you look at the the

1599
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:13,280
price of the day before versus the price

1600
01:07:11,119 --> 01:07:15,359
after that announcement And the

1601
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:18,400
volatility that people expected on this

1602
01:07:15,359 --> 01:07:20,640
on this day was probably twice as high.

1603
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:22,000
So people expected the daily the

1604
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:24,319
standard deviation of daily move that

1605
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:27,359
was priced in was probably like 10 to 12

1606
01:07:24,319 --> 01:07:28,960
basis points per day.

1607
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:30,640
Okay.

1608
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:32,960
What does that does that mean that all

1609
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:34,880
this is irrelevant? No, it's not. It

1610
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:37,599
just means that when you're thinking

1611
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:39,680
about the risk you're taking, you have

1612
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:42,319
to understand that if you take a certain

1613
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:44,559
amount of for the same notional same

1614
01:07:42,319 --> 01:07:47,680
number of bonds or the same number of

1615
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:49,359
like the same investment that you hold,

1616
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:50,960
if you hold it on that kind of a day,

1617
01:07:49,359 --> 01:07:52,480
you would just have a lot more risk. So

1618
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:54,240
if you're when you're doing your risk

1619
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:56,240
management, you have to account for

1620
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:57,520
that. Do you want to do that? Do you

1621
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:59,599
want to hold it? you may want to maybe

1622
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:00,880
shrink your position or if you have a

1623
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:02,720
view maybe you don't want to shrink your

1624
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:04,720
position like but that you have to just

1625
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:07,680
be aware of it the correlations are very

1626
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:10,400
likely to continue to hold sometimes

1627
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:13,440
things happen covid happens for example

1628
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:15,599
covid hit these loadings the curve the

1629
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:18,000
dynamics of the curve changed overnight

1630
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:20,319
like the PC loadings

1631
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:22,480
the that the way the curve started to

1632
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:24,480
behave like the central bank came there

1633
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:27,359
was an emergency cut and things changed

1634
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:27,359
like super quickly

1635
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:31,279
Being able to reflect that in your model

1636
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:34,400
is very important because now if you're

1637
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:37,199
trying to take a PC2 bet, but your PC

1638
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:39,199
loadings are not indicative of how the

1639
01:08:37,199 --> 01:08:42,719
current dynamics are, you're going to be

1640
01:08:39,199 --> 01:08:44,400
ending up taking like massive massive

1641
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:46,080
leverage, but you're not you're not

1642
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:48,239
really PC1 hedge. So all this leverage

1643
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:50,799
is going to produce huge amounts of

1644
01:08:48,239 --> 01:08:52,480
returns and noise in your P&L.

1645
01:08:50,799 --> 01:08:54,960
So that these are the practical

1646
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:56,640
questions of when that you face when

1647
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:58,799
you're actually doing this thing. How do

1648
01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:00,000
you and remember you need history to

1649
01:08:58,799 --> 01:09:02,400
train your model. So you're sitting

1650
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:04,960
there COVID happened. There was a big

1651
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:08,400
cut emergency cut in the central bank.

1652
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:11,679
They cut like 1% in one day and you know

1653
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:14,319
it's a new world but there is no data on

1654
01:09:11,679 --> 01:09:15,839
how the new world is going to behave

1655
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:17,359
because it just happened two days ago.

1656
01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:19,440
You don't have 10 years of history to

1657
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:21,839
calibrate your PCA model. So what are

1658
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:23,359
you going to do? And there's a lot of

1659
01:09:21,839 --> 01:09:24,880
answers to that. You can look at implied

1660
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:27,520
markets. There's a lot of answers to

1661
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:30,400
that. But how you answer a question is

1662
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:32,880
going to is like that's critical. That's

1663
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:35,120
critical. Yeah.

1664
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:37,600
>> Can I follow up to that? Do you think

1665
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:39,920
like it's it's worth in some sense

1666
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:43,600
almost like slicing up your data into

1667
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:45,359
those pieces where you think um like

1668
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:48,319
things will behave in similar fashions

1669
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:49,839
and then like like I guess using or

1670
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:51,600
something some other model to better

1671
01:09:49,839 --> 01:09:54,640
understand how they behave in those

1672
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:56,159
specific like regimes and times.

1673
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:58,080
>> Yeah. Yeah. That that's certainly a

1674
01:09:56,159 --> 01:10:00,960
thing that that is that is a thing that

1675
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:03,199
you can do like regime specific. You can

1676
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:05,040
group together data that are specific to

1677
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:06,880
this regime like oh I'm going to look at

1678
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:09,679
right now the Fed is cutting rates. I'm

1679
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:11,120
going to model my curve behavior not by

1680
01:10:09,679 --> 01:10:14,480
looking at the last five years of

1681
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:16,480
history but I'm going to look at like

1682
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:18,560
join together historical periods where

1683
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:20,800
rate Fed was cutting rates and just look

1684
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:23,520
at that like it's an approach and it's a

1685
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:26,159
sensible approach like for now when you

1686
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:27,440
do that you you're introducing other yes

1687
01:10:26,159 --> 01:10:29,440
the Fed is cutting rates but there are

1688
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:31,760
other things that were not the same so

1689
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:33,440
there's no like perfect answer in that

1690
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:34,960
because again you're you're still trying

1691
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:36,719
to use the past to predict the future

1692
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:38,320
And

1693
01:10:36,719 --> 01:10:42,280
there is no perfect answer but there

1694
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:42,280
there are many valid answers.

1695
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:48,960
Um

1696
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:50,640
yeah I I kind of wanted to like this is

1697
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:53,520
a description of how you construct these

1698
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:55,679
PC portfolios and PC residuals.

1699
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:59,920
We have like some of the pros and cons.

1700
01:10:55,679 --> 01:11:04,239
I already talked about some of these

1701
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:08,960
and I kind of wanted to talk about

1702
01:11:04,239 --> 01:11:10,960
this part of um the output of this. So

1703
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:14,640
here I've created like a little trading

1704
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:18,800
strategy based on the the recent the

1705
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:23,280
returns of um like basically a momentum

1706
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:24,560
mean reversion strategy for PC1 and and

1707
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:26,000
uh look to the performance. So it

1708
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:27,920
doesn't really work great, but it that's

1709
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:30,080
not the point. The point is that it's an

1710
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:32,960
illustration of how this works. All the

1711
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:34,239
code of how this was created and how you

1712
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:36,719
can calculate these things is part of

1713
01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:38,880
that Jupyter notebook that is

1714
01:11:36,719 --> 01:11:41,280
accompanying the slides that you can

1715
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:44,159
download and the data is there is in a

1716
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:47,360
CSV file which you can pull from the fed

1717
01:11:44,159 --> 01:11:50,640
like an updated version of. So if you

1718
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:52,480
are interested in like doing a project

1719
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:54,239
there there's a lot of like a lot of

1720
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:58,640
standard like strategies that you can

1721
01:11:54,239 --> 01:12:01,120
try for example to to write and and um

1722
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:02,640
and and to test out like it's not there

1723
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:04,880
not again the point is not to actually

1724
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:07,920
go and trade it but like to actually

1725
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:09,520
practice a little bit applying PCA to

1726
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:12,320
real data and there's not there's no

1727
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:14,880
substitute to actually doing it because

1728
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:16,560
you you see that in every single step

1729
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:18,880
there's choices to make there's little

1730
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:22,239
details and these details matter and

1731
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:23,679
being able to like to to to understand

1732
01:12:22,239 --> 01:12:26,320
the pros and cons of each of these

1733
01:12:23,679 --> 01:12:28,719
details. One lecture is like not enough

1734
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:30,159
to go over everything. I I've kind of

1735
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:32,080
wanted to give you a little taste of

1736
01:12:30,159 --> 01:12:34,159
what it's like to to deal with this

1737
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:37,600
stuff, but it's a very powerful tool.

1738
01:12:34,159 --> 01:12:41,840
It's used all around the street for for

1739
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:44,080
modeling of things like stocks and bonds

1740
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:45,920
and um

1741
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:48,320
it's a great thing to have in your

1742
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:50,480
toolkit as somebody who is like looking

1743
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:53,480
for a job in finance if you decide to do

1744
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:53,480
that.

1745
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:57,679
So I'm going to stop here down here like

1746
01:12:55,920 --> 01:13:00,000
this. There is another example which is

1747
01:12:57,679 --> 01:13:02,480
European stock market indices. Same

1748
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:04,159
thing tells you about the correlation,

1749
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:07,440
what the various principal components

1750
01:13:04,159 --> 01:13:09,600
are, what they mean and and tells you

1751
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:12,320
about the strategy. So there's like

1752
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:13,920
there's two examples in the slides. We

1753
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:16,400
don't need to go through both of them. I

1754
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:20,719
think I know that in five minutes you

1755
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:24,880
kind of have to leave. So I I wanted to

1756
01:13:20,719 --> 01:13:26,960
give a little bit of time for questions

1757
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:30,960
and and for discussion. I thank you so

1758
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:34,400
much for being so active and

1759
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:35,920
interactive rather. You guys have you

1760
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:39,760
guys have asked more questions in this

1761
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:41,520
class than than it's like definitely top

1762
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:44,239
one of the top like question asking

1763
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:47,199
classes in in my in my experience doing

1764
01:13:44,239 --> 01:13:48,960
this class. So I love that that that

1765
01:13:47,199 --> 01:13:50,320
shows that like the stuff is

1766
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:53,440
interesting. So I'm very happy to hear

1767
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:57,040
that. Um

1768
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:58,560
so like yeah I I definitely wanted to

1769
01:13:57,040 --> 01:14:02,480
ask if you have any questions and in

1770
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:04,159
particular if I if this is clear I

1771
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:06,000
really want to make sure that this this

1772
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:08,719
stuff is clear these top three plots

1773
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,120
what they represent.

1774
01:14:08,719 --> 01:14:10,400
>> Yeah.

1775
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:13,199
>> Is there any chance you could explain

1776
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:18,480
the bottom left plot?

1777
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:21,199
>> Yeah. Yeah. So the bottom left one

1778
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:26,239
um basically

1779
01:14:21,199 --> 01:14:29,679
so if there's two PC1 shapes

1780
01:14:26,239 --> 01:14:35,040
this is date one and there is one that

1781
01:14:29,679 --> 01:14:38,040
is date two. I kind of said, well,

1782
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:38,040
um,

1783
01:14:38,239 --> 01:14:43,440
what I'm looking for is basically

1784
01:14:41,199 --> 01:14:46,239
the

1785
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:50,719
I'm looking for the the point maturity

1786
01:14:46,239 --> 01:14:53,199
point where the loadings cross a certain

1787
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:54,880
threshold because at the end both of

1788
01:14:53,199 --> 01:14:56,800
these are going to be kind of relatively

1789
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:58,480
flat towards the back end. So basically

1790
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:59,679
10-year bonds and 30-year bonds when the

1791
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:01,600
rates move up and down, they're going to

1792
01:14:59,679 --> 01:15:03,199
move like the same amount. But on the

1793
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:05,679
very front end, that's not really true.

1794
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:07,360
And why is that? Well, on the very front

1795
01:15:05,679 --> 01:15:10,320
end, it the rates are governed by the

1796
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:12,480
central bank. So central bank is saying

1797
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:14,320
we're going to set the rate here.

1798
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:16,400
Expectations can vary for what happens

1799
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:18,080
10 years down the line. But expectations

1800
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:20,239
of what's going to happen over the next

1801
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:22,480
couple of months are not going to vary

1802
01:15:20,239 --> 01:15:25,440
very much because that is basically the

1803
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:29,679
Fed sets that the Fed tells you what

1804
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:32,800
what is going to happen. So um the

1805
01:15:29,679 --> 01:15:34,640
loading of this PC1 like that that front

1806
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:36,800
end point is like much less volatile in

1807
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:39,360
general that can change like it could

1808
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:42,080
also be that in the recent in the last

1809
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:44,159
couple of months

1810
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:46,320
that the actual shape of the PC1 factor

1811
01:15:44,159 --> 01:15:48,080
was probably like that and the reason is

1812
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:50,080
that the front end was so uncertain

1813
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:51,440
nobody knew are they going to cut are

1814
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:54,000
they going to hike like we don't really

1815
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:56,159
know what what's going to happen but

1816
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:58,560
generally speaking the front end is

1817
01:15:56,159 --> 01:16:03,840
going to be less volatile than than the

1818
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:06,480
back end because of the fact that the um

1819
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:08,800
the the Federal Reserve like is like

1820
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:10,640
they they control the front end part of

1821
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:13,600
the curve.

1822
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:16,000
So what I'm plotting is effectively

1823
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:20,159
at what point does does the loadings

1824
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:22,480
cross a threshold? Why? And if if the

1825
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:25,040
Fed controls the curve, if if people

1826
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:27,040
believe the Fed is going to have um if

1827
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:29,440
if there's clarity on the Fed's policy

1828
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:32,159
over a longer period of time, we're

1829
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:33,840
going to have lower loadings on the

1830
01:16:32,159 --> 01:16:37,199
front of the curve for longer periods of

1831
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:39,040
time. And if there is less clarity, that

1832
01:16:37,199 --> 01:16:40,480
period is going to shrink. Meaning,

1833
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:43,360
yeah, they're always going to control

1834
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:45,679
the front end, but like how quickly do

1835
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:47,440
we decouple from that? And that's what

1836
01:16:45,679 --> 01:16:49,360
I'm plotting here. I'm I'm taking on

1837
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:51,600
every day I'm I'm taking this point.

1838
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:53,280
This is on day one it's going to be here

1839
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:54,960
on day some other day it's going to be

1840
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:58,159
here and I'm plotting a time series of

1841
01:16:54,960 --> 01:17:01,040
that of that point like at what time in

1842
01:16:58,159 --> 01:17:04,080
in maturity years like at which maturity

1843
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:05,520
do we cross the threshold. Could you

1844
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:08,719
explain the connection between the

1845
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:09,920
curvature and the map situation?

1846
01:17:08,719 --> 01:17:12,320
>> The curvature and what

1847
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:16,159
>> and the map.

1848
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:17,679
>> Ah yeah right. Yeah. Um right. So the

1849
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:19,840
PC3

1850
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:22,800
shape remember was like there is like

1851
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:25,679
it's this is zero

1852
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:29,679
and it's like positive negative

1853
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:32,960
positive. So the short end and the back

1854
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:35,840
end are like basically like there's a

1855
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:40,080
once you hedge out the curvature and and

1856
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:42,159
the levels what remains is like the the

1857
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:43,600
uh once you mention out the once you

1858
01:17:42,159 --> 01:17:45,520
hedge out the slope and levels what

1859
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:49,040
remains is the curvature and the

1860
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:51,840
question is like at that point

1861
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:55,199
how does the curve move and I can give

1862
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:56,800
it give you two examples in dollars you

1863
01:17:55,199 --> 01:17:59,360
can see that most of the time The bottom

1864
01:17:56,800 --> 01:18:01,679
of this graph is at like around 10 years

1865
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:03,520
10 year maturity. So that means that

1866
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:05,520
like once you hedge out slope and

1867
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:07,760
curvature 10-year bonds are going to be

1868
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:09,840
anti-correlated with two-year and

1869
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:12,480
30-year bonds. So it's going to like

1870
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:15,120
move around like that with where the

1871
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:18,320
belly of the curve is 10ear point. Now

1872
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:19,840
if I look at another country that is

1873
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:22,960
like more like an emerging markets

1874
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:26,320
country for example like Mexico

1875
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:27,920
it's going to look like this.

1876
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:30,719
where this is going to be around five

1877
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:33,920
years.

1878
01:18:30,719 --> 01:18:36,400
What is the significance of this? Well,

1879
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:38,719
it tells you like you can think of this

1880
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:41,920
is like the curve has distinct like

1881
01:18:38,719 --> 01:18:43,760
parts that different things drive it.

1882
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:47,440
the the very front end we said a central

1883
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:49,920
bank. Then there's like a period after

1884
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:51,920
that that is really mostly driven by

1885
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:53,840
inflation expectations

1886
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:57,920
and then the very long end is a lot of

1887
01:18:53,840 --> 01:19:00,719
it is about growth growth expectations

1888
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:03,520
and um

1889
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:05,840
this the the point where where this

1890
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:08,239
bottom of the curvature is it really

1891
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:10,080
tells you a lot about like where which

1892
01:19:08,239 --> 01:19:12,560
part where does the what part of the

1893
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:14,480
curve is where does this crossover go

1894
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:16,080
from like inflation expect inflation

1895
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:18,880
being dominant to like growth being

1896
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:21,440
dominant. Different players invest in

1897
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:23,440
different parts of the curve. Certain

1898
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:25,280
like um the back end of the curve

1899
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:26,880
there's a lot of pensions, insurance

1900
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:28,719
companies investing in the very long

1901
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:32,080
end. They have long-term liabilities.

1902
01:19:28,719 --> 01:19:35,040
They invest here. Very front end is like

1903
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:37,760
a lot of like two-year rates, a lot of

1904
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:40,719
speculators, a lot of like like people

1905
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:43,679
who need short-term financing. 10 year

1906
01:19:40,719 --> 01:19:45,520
in the US between five and 10 year is

1907
01:19:43,679 --> 01:19:47,280
where most most corporate bonds most

1908
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:49,679
corporations they issue they raise that

1909
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:53,360
in the five to 10 year maturity. So the

1910
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:55,360
the different players participate in the

1911
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:58,000
different parts of the curve and that

1912
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:59,920
means the dynamics are they that means

1913
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:01,280
the dynamics are are different. Once you

1914
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:02,960
hedge out those two components, you

1915
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:04,880
start to discover those like these

1916
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:07,440
dynamics are small relatively speaking

1917
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:09,679
on the scale of rates going up and down.

1918
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:11,199
But once you remove that, you start to

1919
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:14,000
discover these features. They're they're

1920
01:20:11,199 --> 01:20:16,719
kind of hidden under this this big noise

1921
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:18,000
of like rates going up and down and you

1922
01:20:16,719 --> 01:20:21,400
start to kind of see these things start

1923
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,400
to pop out.

1924
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:26,080
This being longer term, it just it tells

1925
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:28,239
you again something about developed

1926
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:31,920
markets tend to have this belly be

1927
01:20:28,239 --> 01:20:33,360
further out because people have people

1928
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:36,239
people look at like a longer term

1929
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:38,560
horizon essentially for investing. This

1930
01:20:36,239 --> 01:20:40,800
the pension funds invest for longer they

1931
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:43,120
buy longer term bonds

1932
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:45,280
and like generally people invest in

1933
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:47,360
longer term than than in say emerging

1934
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:50,560
market countries.

1935
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:52,159
So these are like when you look at when

1936
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:54,000
you compare these factors across

1937
01:20:52,159 --> 01:20:55,600
countries,

1938
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:57,920
you can actually make sense of some of

1939
01:20:55,600 --> 01:21:00,960
these p these things and you can

1940
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:02,159
quantify those those feature those um

1941
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:05,800
those things and they can become

1942
01:21:02,159 --> 01:21:05,800
features for modeling.

1943
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:13,120
>> One more question perhaps.

1944
01:21:11,679 --> 01:21:14,960
>> Yeah,

1945
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:18,560
>> for a lot of markets you're not going to

1946
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:21,920
get prices easily for like US like is

1947
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:24,080
there a way in which like by um like

1948
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:28,080
trying to ask for like transacts you

1949
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:30,320
like synthetically create data?

1950
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:33,120
>> Yeah, getting getting um getting access

1951
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:35,920
to good data is step one in every

1952
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:38,560
quantitative finance project. I would

1953
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:41,360
say that like

1954
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:43,040
that may be true but it's I you can like

1955
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:45,520
there's ways to get it. First of all, a

1956
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:47,360
lot of there's bond futures which are

1957
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:49,440
effectively futures on bonds. Those

1958
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:51,040
trade on exchanges that data also tends

1959
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:53,040
to be pretty high quality and readily

1960
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:56,560
available. So there's ways to get it,

1961
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:58,159
but like yeah, that's there for every

1962
01:21:56,560 --> 01:22:00,400
particular market you look at, there's

1963
01:21:58,159 --> 01:22:03,040
going to be certain data quality issues

1964
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:06,159
you have to overcome.

1965
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:07,360
US market is the easiest for that. Now,

1966
01:22:06,159 --> 01:22:08,400
it's part of, for example, that's why,

1967
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:09,520
for example, if you're going to do your

1968
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:12,000
project, you're not going to look at

1969
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:14,320
like South African rates because it's

1970
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:16,400
just like hard to get good data. But if

1971
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:18,239
you're in a hedge fund, like maybe, oh,

1972
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:20,400
it's worth getting the data and putting

1973
01:22:18,239 --> 01:22:21,760
some effort because maybe you have less

1974
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:23,440
competition there. You can you can maybe

1975
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:25,360
make some money or maybe you have some

1976
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:26,960
ideas where you could model it, where

1977
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:28,639
you can actually have some predictive

1978
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:31,520
power in South African, right? So, you

1979
01:22:28,639 --> 01:22:35,440
make that investment of time. But it's

1980
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:37,440
it's all part of that. Um the the less

1981
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:39,440
the data the more the harder it is to

1982
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:40,800
get the data usually means that there's

1983
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:43,040
probably going to be more opportunities

1984
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:44,800
for quantitative modeling because it's

1985
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:47,360
hard for everybody. If it's easy then

1986
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:50,880
everybody can do it. So you always have

1987
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:54,800
to be on the edge of of the wave to to

1988
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:56,719
find to make money.

1989
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:58,300
>> Great. Thank you so much.

1990
01:22:56,719 --> 01:23:01,459
>> You're welcome.

1991
01:22:58,300 --> 01:23:01,459
[Applause]
