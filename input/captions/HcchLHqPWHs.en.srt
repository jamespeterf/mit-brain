00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,640
bit about who's in our class I want to

70
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:31,280

self-improvement um this program really

118
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:14,319

120
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,919

that we introduced this year so for

313
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,959
anyone that previously applied to our

315
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:42,600
requirement that wasn't on previous

316
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:44,560
applications and this um is a 60c um

317
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,560
randomly generated open-ended prompt

couple tips as you're completing this

video question first thing to note is

321
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,720
that if you recently opened an

322
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,560

323
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:00,200
appear on the application you have to

324
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:02,160
complete about 80% of your application

325
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:04,920
requirements um in order for this to

326
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,639

one which is the introductory video

329
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,320
statement that you'll provide and so

330
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:15,760
once it does appear you don't have to

331
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,600
record it um immediately but you are

332
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,480

333
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,800
see how it is formatted where your

00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,680
question will show up um you'll be

335
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,000

341
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:40,079

00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:57,279
to um really develop a wellth thought

373
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,519
out letter for you and we ask that you

374
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:01,079
do not write this letter for them um

375
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:04,560
they should be writing it from their

376
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:06,600
perspective on um how they would answer

377
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,040
these specific questions about you

378
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,519
there's no word count on the

379
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,160
recommendation letter and your

380
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,279
recommender will upload their letter

381
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:16,120
directly to your application once you

382
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:19,160
put in their recommendation um your

383
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:20,880
recommenders um contact information and

384
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:23,199
so when you're thinking about who to ask

385
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,639
to be your recommender um really think

386
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:29,160
about who can answer these questions in

387
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:30,920
detail about you um we're looking for

388
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,240
how you stand out from others in a

389
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:36,079
similar capacity um we're looking for

390
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:37,040
examples of your impact on a person

391
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,839
group or

392
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:42,519
organization um examples of how you

393
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,320
interact with others if there's anything

394
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:46,240
else that they want to share with us um

395
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,079
our commanders are welcome to and then

396
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,560
the last piece we're looking for um a

397
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:53,199
piece of constructive feedback that

398
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,480
they've given you and um looking for

399
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:57,839
details on that on the circumstances of

400
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,480
that and your response to it and so

401
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,000
really think critically about who can

402
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:04,279
speak to these best and highlight again

403
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,079
the impact of your work um those

404
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:09,160
leadership skills and your previous

405
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:12,720
successes so that we can see um those

406
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,720
throughout your all of your application

407
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,480
materials the next component are

408
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,920
additional references that you'll

409
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:23,240
provide and these are similar to who you

410
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:25,199
might ask to be a recommender um a

411
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:27,120
couple things to note about this when

412
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:29,519
you go into the application you'll just

413
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,240
list their contact information and these

414
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:34,040
references may or may not be contacted

415
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,680
if we are contacting them we'll figure

416
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:38,880
out a time that works for both parties

417
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,639
um to have this conversation but the

418
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,319
conversation will be similar questions

419
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:45,000
to what we might ask a recommender and

420
00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:47,240
so I'm just

421
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,680
thinking you'll only have one letter of

422
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,399
recommendation but um if you had others

423
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,959
in mind for a letter of recommendation

424
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:54,959
you might list them as one of your

425
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,800
references the next component is the

426
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:03,759
organizational chart um in this you have

427
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:06,959
up to two pages to kind of visually um

428
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:09,240
represent your role in the relationships

429
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,959
that you have and so when you're

430
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,240
thinking back to what we're looking for

431
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:15,480
in an ideal candidate um we are looking

432
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,639
for leadership experience and general

433
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:20,160
management experience and so this could

434
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:21,920
be a really good way to provide a visual

435
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,079
representation specifically of that

436
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:27,240
General management experience who's

437
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:29,319
reporting to you who you're reporting to

438
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,560
um really showcasing who you might be

439
00:16:29,319 --> 00:16:34,880
influencing for decisions who you might

440
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:36,600
be delegating tasks to or developing um

441
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,600
that are reporting to you and so really

442
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,759
showcasing all of those relationships is

443
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,959
really helpful for us to see as we're

444
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:44,279
reviewing your

445
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:45,880
application um so a couple tips as

446
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:47,639
you're completing this organizational

447
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,519
chart we really want to see your role

448
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:51,839
within the greater organization so again

449
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,560
who do you work with how broadly are you

450
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,120
interacting with other group so if you

451
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:57,839
have any dotted lines to folks including

452
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,839
those within your organizational chart

453
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
is helpful for us to

454
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,839
um thinking back to the cover letter we

455
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:08,400
ask for you to be clear in um what

456
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:10,839
you're providing to us um and same with

457
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,640

00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,839
read um easy to find where you are on

460
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:20,400
this organizational chart so highlight

461
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:22,199
yourself um sometimes for folks who have

462
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,880
stayed in their Organization for many

463
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:26,760
years they might be able to provide

464
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,679
their previous showcase their previous

465
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:30,559
roles within their organizational chart

466
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:32,320
that helpful for us to see kind of

467
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:34,440
career growth if it appears within your

468
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:37,000
organizational chart but it's not um

469
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:39,080
required by any means thinking back to

470
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,480
the last two requirements that we talked

471
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:43,000
about the recommendation letter and

472
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,280
additional references sometimes those

473
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,280
folks will also show up on the

474
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:48,960
organizational chart so highlighting

475
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:51,440
those for us to um easily find is

476
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,600
helpful as well um so again this is very

477
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,320
much A visual representation of those

478
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,520
relationships that you have and provides

479
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,919
additional information as we're reading

480
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,600
through things like your resume and and

481
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:02,520
seeing the different results oriented

482
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,240
bullets that you're providing how they

483
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,360
connect to these relationships that

484
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,440
you're showcasing within your

485
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:10,760
organizational chart and the last tip

486
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:12,960
just make sure that your chart matches

487
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:15,480
the resume and the employment section

488
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:18,480
that you complete in your application um

489
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,640
your organizational chart um needs to be

490
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,000
from your current organization so just

491
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,600
keeping that in mind as you complete

492
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,360

493
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,720
application the next component of our

494
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:33,640
application are test scores and these

495
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,120
are completely optional um but we do

496
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,120
often get a lot of questions about test

497
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:40,600
scores so I want to talk just briefly

498
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:42,840

00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,919
lie within those topics but they are not

558
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:00,240
um requirements to be admitted to the

559
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:02,039
program um so you'll complete that

560
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,919
relevant coursework section and many of

561
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:05,480
those courses are quantitative courses

562
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:08,320
that we're looking

563
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:10,080
at when we're looking at these um we

564
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,159
really want to see kind of a sense of

565
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,720
intellectual curiosity so how have you

566
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:17,279
continued to learn and develop um even

567
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,760
if you've graduated a decade ago what

568
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:21,480
have you kind of engaged with since then

569
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,200
um to Showcase your intellectual

570
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:26,320
curiosity if you've taken additional

571
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:29,000
courses trainings certifications um

572
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,960
providing those is helpful for us to see

573
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,919
and this just helps us these materials

574
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:36,880
help us understand your Mastery of any

575
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:38,679
subject area um again thinking about uh

576
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,080
your demonstrated success in leadership

577
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:42,720
skills um seeing if you're able to

578
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:45,520
master a subject that you previously

579
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:48,200
chose to study is helpful for us in our

580
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,200
evaluation

581
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:53,679
process the next component of the

582
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,320
application are professional questions

583
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,320
and so these are two short answer

584
00:21:55,320 --> 00:22:01,559
questions the the responses are limited

585
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:02,880
to 200 words or less um and thinking

586
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:04,720
back to when I was talking about the

587
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,880
cover letter and um not listing your

588
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,520
future goals in your cover letter that's

589
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,520
because you'll list your future goals in

590
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:12,120
one of the professional questions so the

591
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,880
first question is to share your

592
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:16,720
immediate and long-term professional

593
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:18,520
objectives and how this slone fellow MBA

594
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,120
program will help you achieve those so

595
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:24,080
this is the perfect space for you to put

596
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:26,679
your future goals in the second question

597
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,960
um I keep mentioning General management

598
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:29,679
experience throughout many of the

599
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,039
application materials but that's

600
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:33,559
certainly something that we're looking

601
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:35,520
for in candidates and so general

602
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:38,640
managers are often responsible for

603
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,720
strategy budget Andor work output from

604
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,679
individuals and teams for at least one

605
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,480
function of an organization and they

606
00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:47,159
have the ability to see big picture

607
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,960
cross functions general managers are

608
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:51,080
part of short-term and long-term

609
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,840
strategy discussions and work cross

610
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:55,000
functionally to achieve a goal or

611
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,640
specific strategy and so this is the

612
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,039
space that you'll detail the general

613
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:01,320
management experience that you have

614
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,679
um again tying back to the visual

615
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,919
representation that you'll provide

616
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:06,679
through your organizational chart um and

617
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:09,120
other areas that your general management

618
00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:10,799
experience might show up this is a place

619
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,200
specifically to kind of further

620
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:16,480
highlight where um your general

621
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,480
management experience

622
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,559
lies and then the last component that

623
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:24,559
we're going to talk about today is the

624
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:27,720
short answer question um thinking back

625
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:29,919
for anyone who previously applied to uh

626
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,760
the SLO fellows program this was not a

627
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:34,600
requirement in previous year so it is a

628
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:38,640
new requirement and it is a short answer

629
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:40,360
question um 250 words or less and you'll

630
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,960
talk a little bit about how the world

631
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:44,200
you come from has shaped who you are

632
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:47,080
today and so this is really a place for

633
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:49,360
us to learn more about who you are um

634
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:52,039
and an opportunity to expand on your

635
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:54,640
personal background and again how that

636
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:56,760
has shaped you into who you are today it

637
00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:00,240
is limited to just words so please don't

638
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:04,799
include any links or videos um so 250

639
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:06,960
words or less um for the short answer

640
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:09,600
question so as you're thinking about

641
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:12,440
crafting your whole application um a

642
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:15,640
couple kind of tips for all of the

643
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:18,960
materials we're really looking for folks

644
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:21,159
to provide application materials and um

645
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,600
information that complements each other

646
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:24,120
so as you're thinking about what

647
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:26,279
information and what details you're

648
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:29,600
sharing in for instance your cover

649
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:31,600
letter um How can you further showcase

650
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,000
your skill set outside of what's already

651
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,600
demonstrated in your cover letter

652
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,640
through your other application materials

653
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:38,559
is really important we want all of the

654
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,159
materials to be complimentary to one

655
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:42,600
another rather than repetitive so making

656
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:45,080
sure you're really taking the time to

657
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:48,000
think about um where you're showcasing

658
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:49,600
your different skills um and how you can

659
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,240
use the different application materials

660
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,520
to complement one

661
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:56,240
another we're really looking for reasons

662
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:58,919
to admit you so as you again think about

663
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:01,600
these um different components think

664
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:04,399
about what data you're providing us so

665
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,440
that we can admit you um we want to be

666
00:25:04,399 --> 00:25:08,720
advocates for you and we we are looking

667
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:10,919
for reasons to admit you and so as you

668
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,760
craft your application application

669
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:14,559
really think about um what details

670
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:17,360
you're providing the impact of your work

671
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:19,080
that you're showcasing your professional

672
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,360
and personal skill set that you're

673
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:23,440
showcasing all of those materials are

674
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,480
really important as we kind of to gather

675
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,960
different data points on you to ensure

676
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:30,039
that you'll be successful not only in

677
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:32,039
the classroom but also at um working

678
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:33,760
within our community and enhancing the

679
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:37,279
community aspect of

680
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:40,159
Sloan our biggest tip is also to apply

681
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:41,919
early um with that being said if your

682
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:46,159
application is not ready to go by round

683
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:48,000
one um definitely wait until round two

684
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,840
and like I mentioned before we begin

685
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,520
reviewing applications the day after the

686
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,840
deadline and so if you aren't applying

687
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:57,360
for round one um there's no need to

688
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:59,000
apply on say October 2nd for round two

689
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,760
we won't start reviewing applications

690
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,840
for round two until the day after the

691
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:05,399
Round Two deadline in January um so just

692
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,320
apply when you feel that your

693
00:26:05,399 --> 00:26:10,919
application best represents your skill

694
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:12,840
set um but also apply as early as that

695
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:14,880
um application is ready to

696
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:17,440
go make sure you're following the

697
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:20,120
directions um you might have noticed

698
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:23,159
that a lot of our materials were were

699
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:24,840
requesting specific word counts or um

700
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:26,720
Links of videos and that's very

701
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:28,799
intentional we want you to be succinct

702
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,320
in the information you're telling us and

703
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:33,520
the story that you're kind of showcasing

704
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:35,520
and so make sure you follow those

705
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,840
directions if we're asking for 60

706
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:40,679
seconds in a video provide 60 seconds of

707
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:43,240
your video we're asking for 200 words in

708
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:46,320
your professional question um keep it to

709
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:48,120

like the introductory video statement to

719
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,720
show a little bit more of your

720
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:12,760
personality outside of what we might

721
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,279
already see through your application

722
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:18,320
materials um and try to have as much fun

723
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:20,520
with the application process as possible

724
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,120
so that's kind of it for the tips that

725
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:24,679
we have I know we've had a lot of

726
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:27,640
questions um throughout today's session

727

so I am going to invite my colleague Sam

728
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:31,960
um to come off mute and ask some of the

729
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:33,520
additional questions that we've seen in

730
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:36,440

said we've reserved to answer live

735
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,799

00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:50,799
everyone to hear so uh let's just get

737
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:53,039
into it um the first question that we

have is is there a possibility for

739
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:58,679

00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:03,840
waor yeah that's a great question um

742
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:06,440
since test scores for this admission

743
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,720

744
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:11,080

00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,960
program um it's up to you whether you

would like to provide a test score or

747
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,640
not and there's no negative inference if

748
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:18,919
you don't provide a test score you'll

749
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,559

leadership or management role when

755
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:37,760
applying for an MBA or SF MBA yeah so

756
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:39,840
our slan fellows program is really

757
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,559
looking for mid-career professionals who

758
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,440
have that leadership experience and

759
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:46,120
general management experience it's the

760
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:48,559
program and the structure of the

761
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:50,399
curriculum is really geared to folks who

762
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:52,640
have been leading teams and

763
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:55,279
organizations um specifically if you're

764
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,960
leading teams thinking about um the

765
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:59,799
strategy that you might be involved in

766
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:02,120
and cross functionality across teams and

767
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:04,480
so we are really looking for those

768
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:05,960
experiences um students need them to be

769
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:09,880
successful in the classroom and to be

770
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:12,000
able to contribute in um in the space of

771
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:15,279
the slone fellows program and so if you

772
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,760
don't yet have those experiences and say

773
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:19,279
you you might be on the cus maybe you're

774
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:21,519
at 10 years of experience but you um

775
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:23,799
have fewer direct reports and you're not

776
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:26,000
U necessarily involved in Big Picture

777
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:28,919
strategy and things like that you might

778
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,760
want to consider our 2-year MBA deg ree

779
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:32,799
um that does not require General

780
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:34,679
management experience and so really

781
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:36,200
thinking about what the experiences are

782
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:37,679
that you've had if you have that

783
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:40,320
leadership experience in general

784
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:42,679
management experience loone fellows is a

785
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,440
great opportunity but if you don't um

786
00:29:42,679 --> 00:29:46,360
there are other degree offerings within

787
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:47,960
our portfolio that U might be better

788
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:52,320
suited to

789
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:54,919
you aesome um can you share some tips

790
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:58,120
for sfba

791
00:29:54,919 --> 00:30:01,200
reapplicants yeah um that is one thing

792
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:03,360
we didn't cover too much of but um when

793
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:06,000
anyone goes into our application and is

794
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:08,960
a reapplicant there are specific

795
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,679
questions for you as a reapplicant and

796
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:13,760
so there is I believe it's 200 words or

797
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,799
less where you'll highlight or provide a

798
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:18,480
summary of what has changed since the

799
00:30:15,799 --> 00:30:19,880
last time you applied and so this is a

800
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,760
good place to start as you're thinking

801
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:24,519
about your application materials really

802
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:26,159
providing those highlevel um details

803
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:27,679
about what has changed since the last

804
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,840
time you applied and providing them in

805
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:31,320
that specific space as you're thinking

806
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,440
about all of your other application

807
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:35,880
materials you should also consider that

808
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,320
question we do not want to see the same

809
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:39,720
application that you previously

810
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:42,080

811
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:44,279
and new data points what have you done

812
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:46,960
since the last time you applied where

813
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:48,840
are those achievements um results or

814
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,080
oriented bullets within your resume of

815
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,960

last application we have your last

817
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,200

to provide as much new information as

819
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,240
you can through the application

820
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:02,919
requirements um so that we can see how

821

things have kind of evolved and changed

822
00:31:02,919 --> 00:31:06,960
since your last application and we'll

823
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:10,840

00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:16,440
review you for this loone fellows

825
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:19,399

done grow with a customer base kind of

834
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:44,279
things like that yeah I would say we

835
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:46,480
want to see both types of quantifiable

836
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:48,240
um accomplishments within your resume

837
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,919

00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:53,399
application thinking back to kind of My

839
00:31:50,919 --> 00:31:55,760
overall tip for all application

840
00:31:53,399 --> 00:31:58,159
materials we really want everything to

841
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:00,039
be complimentary to one another and so

842
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:01,840
making sure that if you're providing

843
00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:03,760
more detail about one specific

844
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:05,320
accomplishment in one section if you're

845
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,320
able to Showcase a different

846
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:09,399
accomplishment or um piece of impact of

847
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:11,279
your work through other applications

848
00:32:09,399 --> 00:32:13,919
materials it's really helpful for us to

849
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:16,440
see we want to see as much as you're

850
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:18,600
able to share within um our application

851
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:21,120
materials and so providing all of those

852
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:22,679
quantifiable accomplishments and impacts

853
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:26,679
is really helpful for

854
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:30,639
us great um and then there's also a

855
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:33,519
question about someone who has two jobs

856
00:32:30,639 --> 00:32:37,039
right now um one takes up a lot more

857
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:39,159
time than the other but the other um is

858
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:42,200
one they're hoping to Pivot

859
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:44,120
to um what should the organizational

860
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:47,919
chart cover in that

861
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:49,639
situation there's two jobs yeah so your

862
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:51,919
organizational chart if you do have two

863
00:32:49,639 --> 00:32:54,519
jobs um the one that takes up the most

864
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:56,639
time um that you list as your primary

865
00:32:54,519 --> 00:32:58,679
under the employment section of the

866
00:32:56,639 --> 00:33:00,840
application again thinking about how

867
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:02,960
you're showcasing your work experience

868
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:04,639
in the employment section resume and

869
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:08,159
organizational chart should all match

870
00:33:04,639 --> 00:33:10,399
for your primary um work currently and

871
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:13,679
so showcasing that where you're spending

872
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:16,600
the most time um and we'll see the other

873
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:19,279
work experiences um that you have going

874
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:21,679
on concurrently through your resume and

875
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:23,360
employment section as

876
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:27,039
well

877
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:28,960
great um another organizational tart

878
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:30,919
question if someone's held different

879
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,279
roles and functions within the same

880
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:35,279
organization should they include that in

881
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:36,360
their organizational chart or should

882
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:40,159
they just stick to what they're

883
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:42,639
currently doing yeah if you are able to

884
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:44,519
demonstrate kind of your career growth

885
00:33:42,639 --> 00:33:46,639
through your organizational chart that's

886
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:50,039
helpful it's just another um kind of

887
00:33:46,639 --> 00:33:51,679
visual representation of that and so um

888
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:53,519
finding a way to kind of detail if this

889
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:56,440
was a position you previously had that

890
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:58,279
now reports to you um showcasing that so

891
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:59,720
certainly we encourage you if your

892
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:01,639
previous roles fall within your

893
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:04,760
organizational chart it's helpful to

894
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:07,679
highlight that for us as well

895
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:09,800
great um all right and now for

896
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:13,520
Consulting people how should they tackle

897
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:14,879
the organizational chart yeah um so we

898
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:17,399
understand folks that come from

899
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:20,280
Consulting backgrounds even folks from

900
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:21,760
military backgrounds um they might

901
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:25,240
approach the organizational chart

902
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:27,399
slightly differently than um most folks

903
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:29,879
um and so for Consulting thinking about

904
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:32,399
your most recent project or engagement

905
00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:35,399
in highlighting that um organizational

906
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:39,280
chart is helpful for us and again if you

907
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:41,159
pull results oriented bullets from this

908
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,879
project or engagement it can showcase

909
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:44,679
that visual representation of those

910
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:48,119
relationships and so it's your most

911
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:50,119
recent um if you've had multiple recent

912
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:52,280
projects and engagements I would pick um

913
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:54,839
one of the larger ones but it's a recent

914
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:56,639
project or engagement in showcasing that

915
00:34:54,839 --> 00:34:58,680
um organizational chart and often times

916
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:01,680
you'll showcase kind of lines to your

917
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:04,280
clients as well and for folks that um

918
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:08,720
aren't able to provide specific details

919
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:10,720

920
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,119
pieces um please provide as much

921
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,200
information as you are able to within

922
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:17,720
the organizational chart and we have an

923
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:19,720
FAQ section on our um website to kind of

924
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:21,480
detail how exactly to approach that if

925
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:23,119
you're coming from a consulting or

926
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:25,240
military background and aren't able to

927
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:28,640
provide some

928
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:33,839
information great um

929
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:36,160
um okay for the general management essay

930
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:38,720
should you be describing what your

931
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:41,160
management style is or do you need to

932
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:43,000
give examples of demonstrating your

933
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:45,960
general management

934
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:48,079
skills yeah we're looking for kind of

935
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:50,520
your general management skills and

936
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:52,599
experiences um so not necessarily

937
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:55,520
providing how you manage people but

938
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:57,640
talking about what those experiences are

939
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,920
um and kind of the respons

940
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:01,599
responsibilities within those

941
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:03,880
experiences this is a short answer so

942
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:05,839
there is not a ton of real estate to

943
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:07,640
provide every single detail of your

944
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:09,440
general management experience and so

945
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:10,839
really um making sure that you're

946
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,359
succinct in the information you're

947
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:14,920
providing and really getting to what

948
00:36:12,359 --> 00:36:16,440
those experiences are that it focused on

949
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,960
your um General management and

950
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:22,480
Leadership

951
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:25,960
skills great um and then can you share

952
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:31,079
some general tips on tackling video

953
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:32,920
question two yeah um I think as you're

954
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:34,800
going into this video question I know

955
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:38,920
we've we've received a lot of questions

956
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:40,880
about it and um just because there is

957
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:43,800
you only have one shot at recording it

958
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:46,560
so it does seem um stressful for some

959
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:48,599
folks to complete it but I think the

960
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:51,680
mindset you can go in when you're

961
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:53,960
recording this is um how you might be

962
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:56,440
answering an interview question or

963
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:58,119
having a conversation with someone um so

964
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:00,079
the questions aren't tricked questions

965
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:01,800
they're not meant to have a right or

966
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:03,760
wrong answer there are no right or wrong

967
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,040
answers it's really just seeing how you

968
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,359
think on your feet and how you would

969
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:09,160
have a conversation we want to ensure

970
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:12,280
that folks who are joining our community

971
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:15,000
are able to contribute um effectively

972
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:16,839
and communicate effectively and so this

973
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,359
kind of showcases some of those skills

974
00:37:16,839 --> 00:37:20,319
and how you might interact in the

975
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:22,319
classroom some of the questions that you

976
00:37:20,319 --> 00:37:24,560
might get asked again they are randomly

977
00:37:22,319 --> 00:37:26,640
generated but this is just um an example

978
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:29,160
of a couple you might be asked what's

979
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,480
your proudest accomplishment um so

980
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:32,480
that's something you should be able to

981
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:35,640
answer again you have 10 seconds to

982
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:37,119
prepare and 60 seconds to record um and

983
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:39,000
so how if you were just having a

984
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:42,040
conversation with someone how you would

985
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:44,160
respond to that question um there are

986
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:46,200
some questions like tell me about a time

987
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:48,319
that you failed and how you bounced back

988
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:51,040
things like that and so it's not meant

989
00:37:48,319 --> 00:37:52,880
to trip you up it's really like to see

990
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:55,800
how you think on your feet and how you

991
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:58,119
would have a conversation and so really

992
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,640
utilize the software and make sure you

993
00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:02,280
feel comfortable test out your

994
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:04,160
microphone test out your video make sure

995
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,880
you know where the question's going to

996
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,680
appear on the screen where it shows that

997
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:09,200
it's recording all of the different

998
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,920
pieces before you click that you're

999
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:14,160
ready um so you there shouldn't be any

1000
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,440
reason that you feel unprepared for it

1001
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:18,240
going into it because you'll be able to

1002
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:20,319
see all of the the different pieces of

1003
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:22,480
the video question to before you say

1004
00:38:20,319 --> 00:38:25,200
that you're ready to begin recording and

1005
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,760
just try to have fun with it um and just

1006
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:29,560
approach it kind of like a conversation

1007
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:33,960
or how you might approach an interview

1008
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:37,119
question great um and can you talk a

1009
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:40,200
little bit about some ways that um the

1010
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:43,040
son fellows program supports or support

1011
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:45,920
students with Healthcare

1012
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:49,760
backgrounds yeah um with specifically

1013
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:51,720
within the program yeah yeah um so there

1014
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,960
are a few different ways for folks who

1015
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:55,560
have Healthcare backgrounds or are

1016
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:58,480
looking to get into the healthcare space

1017
00:38:55,560 --> 00:39:00,760
um within the program that that that's

1018
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,440
um an opportunity and so the way the

1019
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:04,680
sloon fellows program is structured

1020
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:06,960
students start in June and their whole

1021
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:09,359
summer term is spent with other SLO

1022
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:11,079
fellow students you're all in a cohort

1023
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:12,880
um taking core classes and really

1024
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:15,000
setting those foundations creating

1025
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:18,520
learning groups and things like that and

1026
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:20,680
so there's not um a lot of formal

1027
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:22,800
curriculum specialization in that first

1028
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:24,319
semester once you get into the spr the

1029
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,040
fall and spring semesters that's when

1030
00:39:24,319 --> 00:39:28,079
you have a mix of core classes and

1031
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,400
elective courses and so this is where

1032
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:31,560
you can start if you're really

1033
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:33,280
interested in healthcare there are a lot

1034
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:35,839
of healthc care electives that you can

1035
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:38,200
take um through Sloan but you can also

1036
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:40,119
take um cross-registered courses outside

1037
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:42,359
of Sloan in the broader MIT Community or

1038
00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:44,640
even at Harvard and so you can kind of

1039
00:39:42,359 --> 00:39:46,319
develop um your curriculum to match what

1040
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:49,400
you need in terms of your healthare

1041
00:39:46,319 --> 00:39:52,800
needs there is a health care certificate

1042
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:55,800
and so that requires um at least half of

1043
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,880
your elective credits to be focused on

1044
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:00,079
um Healthcare and it has a few specific

1045
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:01,920
requirements you have a couple required

1046
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:03,640
Healthcare elective courses and then um

1047
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,680
you choose from a list of approved

1048
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:07,240
electives and so this is another way

1049
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:09,880
that you can kind of specialize the

1050
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:12,480
degree specifically to healthcare um

1051
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:14,680
that is true also for other six C

1052
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:17,079
certificates so if anyone's interested

1053
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:19,079
in business analytics Finance

1054
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:20,359
sustainability product management

1055
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:22,839
Enterprise management or

1056
00:40:20,359 --> 00:40:24,560
entrepreneurship and Innovation um those

1057
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:26,319
certificates work the same and slone

1058
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:28,920
fellows are able to pursue one of those

1059
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:31,040
certificates in their time of the degree

1060
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:32,280
outside of that um kind of more

1061
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,599
informally there are a lot of

1062
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:36,800
opportunities through clubs and

1063
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:39,599
organizations um again thinking about

1064
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:41,440
health care um opportunities through the

1065
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:45,000
health systems initiative as well which

1066
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:46,720
is um the health care certificate is

1067
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,599
taught and administered in conjunction

1068
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,160
with Health Systems initiative and so

1069
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:52,280
there are a lot of opportunities if you

1070
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:54,839
want to kind of have a more specialized

1071
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:57,319
degree in healthcare um there are ways

1072
00:40:54,839 --> 00:40:59,359
to do that and a lot of resources as you

1073
00:40:57,319 --> 00:41:01,520
think about that there's also the

1074
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:03,200
healthcare um action learning lab which

1075
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:05,680
goes along with the health certificate

1076
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:07,240
Healthcare certificate and so plenty of

1077
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,480
opportunities if you're either in

1078
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:11,240
healthcare and looking to stay in

1079
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,520
healthcare or in another industry and

1080
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:16,520
looking to get into Healthcare there are

1081
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:19,040
plenty of ways to kind of make that um a

1082
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:21,599
focus of the Sloan fellows degree and I

1083
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:23,760
would say no to Sloan fellows get the

1084
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:26,400
same MBA degree because there is so much

1085
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:30,160
opportunity for customization of the

1086
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:32,319
degree and really catering the electives

1087
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,839
um to what you need

1088
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:36,359
personally

1089
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:38,520
awesome and then there's also another

1090
00:41:36,359 --> 00:41:40,240
question about individuals who have

1091
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:42,119
worked for the same company but their

1092
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:44,160
company has different locations in

1093
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:46,680
different countries so if you've kind of

1094
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:49,240
bounced around will you list this all

1095
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:50,760
under the same um employment in the

1096
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:53,079
employment section or would you separate

1097
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:54,480
it to say into like three separate

1098
00:41:53,079 --> 00:41:58,280
locations if you worked in three

1099
00:41:54,480 --> 00:42:00,480
separate cities across the globe yeah um

1100
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:02,119
within the employment section when

1101
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:05,160
you're filling out each of the

1102
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:08,200
employment section entries you will put

1103
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:11,400
the location um and

1104
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:12,800
so if you have more than three entries

1105
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,880
if your whole career has been at the

1106
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,240
same company just in different locations

1107
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:19,400
I would list them separately as

1108
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:22,440
employment um entries if you have worked

1109
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:24,599
at other companies as well um I would

1110
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:26,119
list them all in the same employment

1111
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:29,079
section so that you can list your other

1112
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:31,520
companies but um you'll also showcase

1113
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:34,599
the locations through your resume and so

1114
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:36,400
we'll have that information um hopefully

1115
00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:37,839
in both spots but if not in both spots

1116
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,760
then at least in the resume of the

1117
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:40,319
different

1118
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:43,960
locations

1119
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:47,559
awesome okay um and then here's another

1120
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:50,319
one um about someone who might be just

1121
00:42:47,559 --> 00:42:53,359
missing you know the 10year fulltime

1122
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:56,119
experience Mark but they can supplement

1123
00:42:53,359 --> 00:43:00,040
it with time that they've spent

1124
00:42:56,119 --> 00:43:02,640
freelancing how do we view that yeah so

1125
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:04,960
we're really looking for 10 years of

1126
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:07,480
experience and that would be 10 years of

1127
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:09,559
fulltime post-bachelor's degree

1128
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:12,160
experience up until the start of the

1129
00:43:09,559 --> 00:43:15,720
program so say you're at nine years

1130
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:19,040
right now or a little over nine years um

1131
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:23,400
and would be at 10 years by June of

1132
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:27,559
2025 then that meets the 10year minimum

1133
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:29,240
um there are always um like we'll review

1134
00:43:27,559 --> 00:43:32,400
every application and see what those

1135
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:34,359
experiences are and so sometimes there

1136
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:36,440
are on a case-by casee basis if they're

1137
00:43:34,359 --> 00:43:38,599
right on the cusp of 10 years but we

1138
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:40,680
really are looking for that 10 years of

1139
00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:43,160
experience in addition to General

1140
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:45,000
management experience because that's

1141
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:46,480
what makes students successful in this

1142
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,680
program and that's who this program is

1143
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:51,599
really geared towards and so it's not

1144
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:53,800
just the years of experience that we're

1145
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:55,280
looking for um but also the general

1146
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,720
management experience so making sure

1147
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,960
that you have both of those and if you

1148
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,720
don't have especially the general

1149
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,960
management experience but also not the

1150
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:07,599
10 years maybe considering our 2-year

1151
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:09,520
MBA degree as a better option great um

1152
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:12,480
and then can you provide some more

1153
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:14,480
details on what we're expecting to see

1154
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:17,200
from the first video

1155
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:18,760
question where they should record how

1156
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:22,440
deep they should go into their personal

1157
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:26,280
life kind of just a little bit more that

1158
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:29,520
yeah um so you as an applicant have kind

1159
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:31,319
of total creative freedom to provide

1160
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:34,160
whatever information you want in the

1161
00:44:31,319 --> 00:44:35,599
introductory video The Prompt is to

1162
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:38,559
introduce yourself to your future

1163
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:40,119
classmates so I think thinking about how

1164
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:43,119
you might do that what information you

1165
00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:46,200
would share with them um there is no

1166
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:48,839
right or wrong way to take the video

1167
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:50,760
statement and so you are welcome to

1168
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:53,040
provide only professional details you're

1169
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:54,880
welcome to provide only personal details

1170
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:56,520
it's really up to you to decide what

1171
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:58,880
information you want to share and how

1172
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:02,680
you want to sh showcase your personality

1173
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:05,000
I will say the most memorable um TP

1174
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:08,720
videos that we've seen are the more

1175
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:12,240
creative ones so um a couple examples

1176
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:14,800
that I can think of we had someone who

1177
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:16,640
was an avid hiker and they hiked a

1178
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:19,880
mountain and recorded their video at the

1179
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:23,640
top of a mountain um someone that is

1180
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:25,119
really into um cooking and showcase some

1181
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:27,640
um foods that they were cooking from

1182
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:29,160
their home country those are some of the

1183
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:31,480
more creative ones where people are

1184
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:34,119
showing kind of more personal aspects

1185
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:36,559
than professional you're welcome to do a

1186
00:45:34,119 --> 00:45:38,200
mix you can kind of take it however you

1187
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:40,480
want and showcase whatever you would

1188
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:41,839
like but I think really let who you are

1189
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:43,800
as a person shine through and your

1190
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:47,760
personality shine through and have fun

1191
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:49,440
with that video um and so total creative

1192
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:52,400
freedom that you have with that one to

1193
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:54,359
provide um just an introduction of who

1194
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:58,000
you are and um what you might bring to

1195
00:45:54,359 --> 00:46:01,240
the Sloan community

1196
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,760
great um and then we also have a

1197
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:07,800
question about management experience

1198
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:11,240
again um if would we consider management

1199
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:14,880
con experience um if it's through

1200
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:16,599
individual contributions so for example

1201
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:20,079
um if someone as an individual

1202
00:46:16,599 --> 00:46:23,160
contributor was helping manage a program

1203
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:26,960
outside of their full-time experience or

1204
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:30,119
full-time um employment how would we

1205
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:31,800
view that yeah um when we're looking at

1206
00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:34,839
General management experience we're

1207
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:38,640
really looking for folks who are leading

1208
00:46:34,839 --> 00:46:40,599
others um that have direct reports or

1209
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:43,880
dotted lines to people that they're

1210
00:46:40,599 --> 00:46:47,000
delegating tasks to um helping develop

1211
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:49,079
them as professionals but also people

1212
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,880
who are at a position where they're

1213
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:53,319
influencing decisions that are being

1214
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:55,359
made for teams or

1215
00:46:53,319 --> 00:46:57,520
organizations um that they're leading

1216
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:59,200
kind of big picture strategy

1217
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:01,480
they might be overseeing budgets or

1218
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:04,559
cross functional teams and so we're

1219
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:07,400
really looking for like all of those

1220
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:10,280
experiences within General management um

1221
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:12,119
we want to see that you have kind of

1222
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:14,240
what that sphere of influence is that

1223
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:17,160
you have and

1224
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:19,319
so we are not necessarily looking for

1225
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:21,920
individual contributors for this loone

1226
00:47:19,319 --> 00:47:23,480
fellow's degree um to be successful in

1227
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:26,040
the classroom you have to have these

1228
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:27,760
General management experiences and so

1229
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:30,640
really thinking about that sphere of

1230
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:32,440
influences who you're delegating to who

1231
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:34,440
you're influencing who you're

1232
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:36,200
collaborating with we want to see all

1233
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:38,440
those relationships and those

1234
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:40,599
relationships need to be there um so if

1235
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:42,119
you are an individual contributor who

1236
00:47:40,599 --> 00:47:43,839
doesn't have all of those aspects of

1237
00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:45,599
General management then the spone

1238
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:46,760
fellow's degree might not be the right

1239
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:50,079
degree for

1240
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:53,000
you great um and then can you also just

1241
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:57,040
talk a little bit more about the CDO and

1242
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:59,559
support for employment after graduation

1243
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:02,040
yeah um I'll talk a little bit about it

1244
00:47:59,559 --> 00:48:04,319
during the program too but um the CDO is

1245
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:05,960
our career development office and

1246
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:08,520
they're very involved with the slone

1247
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:10,960
fellows curriculum from the start of it

1248
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:13,040
um even prior to getting to campus our

1249
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:16,160
students work on a 360 leadership

1250
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:17,800
assessment um survey and then work kind

1251
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:20,880
of work through that to see where their

1252
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:22,440
leadership skills are um and where are

1253
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,880
areas for improvement and they work

1254
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:27,160
directly with um executive coaches as

1255
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:28,800
well as they think about kind of further

1256
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:30,760
developing their leadership skills in

1257
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:33,559
their time and that's through the career

1258
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:35,440
development office as well um the career

1259
00:48:33,559 --> 00:48:38,680
development office also has specific

1260
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:42,520
Sloan fellows advisors to really think

1261
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:44,760
about um career trajectory oftentimes um

1262
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:48,559
SLO fellow students might be looking to

1263
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:50,319
Pivot Industries functional area or um

1264
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:52,240
geographic location and so there are a

1265
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:54,040
lot of resources as you're thinking

1266
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:56,920
about which one of those categories you

1267
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:59,839
might fall into um how to kind of

1268
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:01,599
navigate that career trajectory and um

1269
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:04,760
Career Development and exploration and

1270
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:07,960
so there are a lot of um workshops put

1271
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:10,440
on through the CDO during students time

1272
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:11,880
um so they begin thinking about where

1273
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:13,880
they want to be after graduation from

1274
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:16,520
the start of the program and working

1275
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:19,880
towards that um and then there are also

1276
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:21,839
within the CDO alumni experts across 17

1277
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:24,160
Industries right now um and there are

1278
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:26,240
multiple experts per industry that can

1279
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:27,760
provide guidance so that's a really

1280
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:30,359
valuable resource for folks who are

1281
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:32,839
looking to Pivot Industries um and then

1282
00:49:30,359 --> 00:49:36,480
after graduation students have access to

1283
00:49:32,839 --> 00:49:38,640
the CDO but also um the Alumni network

1284
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:40,319
is a really valuable Resource as things

1285
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:43,559
as students think about their career

1286
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:47,040
trajectories and there are over 31,000

1287
00:49:43,559 --> 00:49:49,880
um MIT SLO alums worldwide and so a lot

1288
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:51,640
of kind of human capital to tap into and

1289
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:53,760
um utilize as you think about your

1290
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:59,119

forward great um Let's see we also have

1292
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:06,119
some questions on if you're able to

apply to um the sfba and the regular MBA

1294
00:50:06,119 --> 00:50:09,960

00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:13,799
time yep yeah you can submit an

1296
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:16,319
application to both um I think also

1297
00:50:13,799 --> 00:50:18,319
attending events for both programs to

1298
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:19,839
see if you're able to kind of figure out

1299
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:22,160
which one might be a better fit for you

1300
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:23,599
having conversations with us but you are

1301
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:27,280
more than welcome to apply to both our

1302
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:29,160
slone fellows MBA and our 2-year MBA

1303
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:33,040
um in the same admission

1304
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:35,599
cycle great um and can you also talk a

1305
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:36,680
little bit about family supports for

1306
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:40,960
slone

1307
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:43,480
fellows yeah um a lot of our students um

1308
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:45,400
come to the slone fellows programs with

1309
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:48,119
their significant others which at SL we

1310
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:50,760
call SOS or families and so there's a

1311
00:50:48,119 --> 00:50:53,720
lot of support built intentionally into

1312
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:55,960
the program for that um thinking about

1313
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:59,200
this past weekend uh they did a welcome

1314
00:50:55,960 --> 00:51:01,640
back to camp us for the fall and it was

1315
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:03,119
a day that families were invited to so

1316
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:05,599
they had a lunch that was put on by the

1317
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:07,240
slone fellows program office and then

1318
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:09,359
they had the opportunity to go to the

1319
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:12,160
museum of science with their families

1320
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:15,200
and so that's just one example of how

1321
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:17,440
families and SOS are um really thought

1322
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:19,760
of through the co-curricular offerings

1323
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:21,640
for our Sloan fellow students um there

1324
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:23,920
are certainly opportunities that are

1325
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:26,240
just for students as well or just for

1326
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:29,760
students in their SOS um there was a

1327
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:32,079
welcome back at a bar in downtown Boston

1328
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:35,520
um which required all attendees to be

1329
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:37,920
over 21 so that was just open to SOS and

1330
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:39,880
students but um there are a lot of

1331
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:41,960
opportunities for family engagement

1332
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:44,240
through the Sloan fellows program many

1333
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:46,160
students do come with families and SOS

1334
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:49,640
and even outside of the Sloan fellows

1335
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:53,280
program at Sloan there's ano Club um so

1336
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:56,119
SOS are able to join that and um get

1337
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:58,400
involved with other SOS that are beyond

1338
00:51:56,119 --> 00:52:01,200
the SL fellows program as

1339
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:03,760
well great and then we have a few

1340
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:05,880
questions about um people who are

1341
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:08,400
entrepreneurs are pivoting into

1342
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:11,960
entrepreneurship and what resources are

1343
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:14,680
available at slan for them yeah um I

1344
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:17,920
would say a lot of folks who join the

1345
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:21,079
Sloan fellows degree have some sort of

1346
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:22,880
um entrepreneurial Endeavor either

1347
00:52:21,079 --> 00:52:24,960
immediately after graduation or a little

1348
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:27,680
further down the line and so there are a

1349
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:29,440
lot of resources um within the Salone

1350
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:32,559
fellows program specifically for that

1351
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:34,160
but then also the broader MIT community

1352
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:35,760
and so thinking back to the seven

1353
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:38,040
certificates that I mentioned one of

1354
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:39,559
those is entrepreneurship and Innovation

1355
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:41,119
which is administered in conjunction

1356
00:52:39,559 --> 00:52:44,160
with the Martin trust Center which is

1357
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:46,079
MIT Center for entrepreneurship and so

1358
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,960
that is a really valuable resource for

1359
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:50,920
folks who are looking to get into

1360
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:52,880
entrepreneurship um getting involved

1361
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:54,920
with entrepreneurship ecosystem from the

1362
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:56,720
start is really helpful they put on

1363
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:59,680
different Accel accelerator and

1364
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:01,599
incubator programs um once a semester

1365
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:04,319
they do a a pitch night where you can go

1366
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:06,680
and Pitch yourself to maybe find another

1367
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:10,559
um your future co-founder or just hear

1368
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:13,839
ideas of others um they do events like

1369
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:16,760
the MIT 100K which was recently um this

1370
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:19,680
past year was won by um one of our MBA

1371
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:21,680
students um and to gain funding for

1372
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:24,040
their um entrepreneurial Endeavors and

1373
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:25,440
so there are a lot of opportunities as

1374
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:28,040
you kind of think about how you're

1375
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:31,040
developing your ideas and um getting it

1376
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:32,359
from ideation into a reality and so

1377
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:34,240
really engaging in the Martin trust

1378
00:53:32,359 --> 00:53:36,200
Center is I would say the number one

1379
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:38,000
resource um for folks who are interested

1380
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:39,599
in entrepreneurship there are also clubs

1381
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,319
and organizations within the Sloan

1382
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:44,839
Community um to get involved there and

1383
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:46,640
then the broader MIT community so a

1384
00:53:44,839 --> 00:53:49,040
wealth of resources for folks who are

1385
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:51,920
interested in entrepreneurship um and

1386
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:53,960
even opportunities to formally kind of

1387
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:56,160
um signify to Future co-founders that

1388
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:58,480
you're dedicated to that area through

1389
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:01,559
the entrepreneurship and Innovation

1390
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:02,920
certificate great and then what kind of

1391
00:54:01,559 --> 00:54:06,760
General guidance would you give to

1392
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:10,200
applicants who are involved in family

1393
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:12,160
business yeah um So within the

1394
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:15,920
application materials um in the

1395
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:17,640
employment section um you will signify

1396
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:20,160
that it's a family business in

1397
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:23,240
employment um as you're completing an

1398
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:25,040
application we are not looking for like

1399
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:26,920
letters of recommendation from family

1400
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:29,200
members and that's true for any of our

1401
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:31,520
applicants and so thinking about who

1402
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:34,040
you're asking to be a recommender um

1403
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:36,319
should really be a professional contact

1404
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:38,920
supervisor or manager and if if you're

1405
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:40,599
not able to provide one of those um that

1406
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:42,760
is not a family member thinking about

1407
00:54:40,599 --> 00:54:45,960
clients that might be able to speak to

1408
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:48,079
your um the impact of your work and so

1409
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:50,880
um There Are Places to provide those

1410
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:52,400
details of family business but um please

1411
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:55,400
make sure that you're providing a letter

1412
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:57,680
of recommendation that is not um from a

1413
00:54:55,400 --> 00:55:02,920
family member

1414
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:05,839
great and then um can you share

1415
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:08,559
some insight about what it's like for

1416
00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:10,079
people pivoting more specifically people

1417
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:11,359
pivoting from maybe a more traditional

1418
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:13,559
background to

1419
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:16,799
something like entrepreneurship that's a

1420
00:55:13,559 --> 00:55:21,039
little less um

1421
00:55:16,799 --> 00:55:22,640
cleancut yeah um I think depending on

1422
00:55:21,039 --> 00:55:23,520
like where someone's permitting to if it

1423
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:25,960
is

1424
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:27,839
entrepreneurship um utilizing the eni

1425
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:29,680
certific certificate is really helpful

1426
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:32,720
engaging with the Martin trust Center is

1427
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:34,480
helpful um if you are looking to Pivot I

1428
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:35,960
think knowing that before you start the

1429
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:38,039
program so you can very intentionally

1430
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:40,160
seek out those opportunities to help

1431
00:55:38,039 --> 00:55:42,200
with that pivot if you had a specific

1432
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:44,680
industry that you're looking to start an

1433
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:46,920
Endeavor in um maybe connecting with the

1434
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:49,200
industry the alumni experts from that

1435
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:51,520
industry to kind of get their guidance

1436
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:53,680
on it um there are a lot of

1437
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:55,720
opportunities for networking through the

1438
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:58,839
Martin trust Center so thinking about

1439
00:55:55,720 --> 00:56:00,440
how you're engaging with those folks um

1440
00:55:58,839 --> 00:56:02,480
but there are plenty of opportunities

1441
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:05,960
and a lot of folks in the SLO fellow's

1442
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:08,319
degree are pivoting in some way and so

1443
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:09,960
it's kind of thought of throughout the

1444
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:11,720
curriculum and what's being administered

1445
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:13,760
to students but also the opportunities

1446
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:15,240
outside the classroom and just making

1447
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:16,960
sure that you're thinking very

1448
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:18,599
intentionally about what you're engaging

1449
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:19,960
with to ensure that you can be

1450
00:56:18,599 --> 00:56:23,319
successful in that

1451
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:25,400
pivot great um I think this is probably

1452
00:56:23,319 --> 00:56:26,680
a good final question to leave with

1453
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:28,599
because it has a little bit more to do

1454
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:31,200
with actually submitting your

1455
00:56:28,599 --> 00:56:33,160
application but if your application is

1456
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:37,920
mostly ready but you might be a little

1457
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:40,920
bit concerned about um not having as

1458
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:43,640
many advanced cours work like calculus

1459
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:45,400
on your academic record should you wait

1460
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:48,799
and try and take those classes on your

1461
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:53,000
own or should you go ahead and submit

1462
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:55,359
your application in round one yeah um I

1463
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:57,119
do want to reiterate that those classes

1464
00:56:55,359 --> 00:56:59,640
the coursework that we ask you to detail

1465
00:56:57,119 --> 00:57:02,400
in the relevant coursework section is

1466
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:04,200
not a requirement by any means and so

1467
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:07,359
folks are admitted to the program even

1468
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:10,400
if they don't have any of that um and so

1469
00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:12,680
just thinking about that aspect but also

1470
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:14,160
thinking back to the ideal candidate

1471
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:16,720
profile that I shared at the beginning

1472
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:20,119
of today's session um we are looking for

1473
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:22,480
people who have Quant comfort and so if

1474
00:57:20,119 --> 00:57:24,480
you don't think that it's showcased

1475
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:25,839
through the foror that you've taken

1476
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:27,880
thinking about the other application

1477
00:57:25,839 --> 00:57:30,559
material that you are providing and if

1478
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:32,559
you feel that that is um sufficient to

1479
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:36,039
Showcase your skill set with

1480
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:38,480
quantitative um aspects and topics and

1481
00:57:36,039 --> 00:57:40,640
so it really is up to you to kind of

1482
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:43,039
figure out if you feel that all of your

1483
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:44,760
application materials best showcase um

1484
00:57:43,039 --> 00:57:46,599
your skill set and ability to be

1485
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:48,720
successful in the program or if you

1486
00:57:46,599 --> 00:57:51,799
would feel more comfortable um waiting

1487
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:53,680
and providing an additional um piece of

1488
00:57:51,799 --> 00:57:55,880
data through like a certificate or an

1489
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:58,119
online course or something like that so

1490
00:57:55,880 --> 00:58:00,200
it's up to you to kind of figure out if

1491
00:57:58,119 --> 00:58:02,799
that if you feel that your application

1492
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:04,960
showcases th those skills but again it

1493
00:58:02,799 --> 00:58:08,160
is not a requirement to have any of the

1494
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:09,799
relevant coursework um topics completed

1495
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:11,440
prior to the

1496
00:58:09,799 --> 00:58:15,200
program

1497
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:16,920
