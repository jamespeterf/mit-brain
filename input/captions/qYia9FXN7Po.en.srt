1
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:16,600
all right welcome back to 61200 today we

2
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,560
continue our theme of probability as we

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:23,279
will continue to do for the next few

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:26,400
lectures um first uh recap from last

5
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:28,000
class and last recitation uh key concept

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,679
we'll be using today is conditional

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,920
probability remember this notation is

8
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,879
the probability of event a occurring

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,360
given that you already know that b

10
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:39,399
occurred which is like if you imagine

11
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,160
this entire Blackboard as the space as

12
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:43,600
the sample space all the possibilities

13
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:46,000
of what could happen and we have events

14
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,480
a is some subset of that space b is some

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,520
subset of that space what the vertical

16
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,760
Bar B means restricting to conditioning

17
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:56,199
on b means focusing on just this red

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,879
subset of where B is and just think

19
00:00:56,199 --> 00:00:59,719
about the probability of a happening

20
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:01,480
relative to those events instead of

21
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:03,559
think the probability of a happening

22
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,680
relative to all events and you can

23
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:07,560
compute that as the probability of this

24
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,040
intersection uh divided by the

25
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,960
probability of B so we're just focusing

26
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,720
in assuming B already happened then this

27
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:17,400
is becomes our entire sample space that

28
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,759
we can restrict to okay and then we can

29
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,240
use that for example to compute

30
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,479
probabilities of events so this was law

31
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,759
of total probability probability of an

32
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:30,040
event a is uh if you pick your favorite

33
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,880
event e sort of like a proof by cases

34
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,280
you get to choose any event e you want

35
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,479
that's whatever's most convenient then

36
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:38,799
you can compute compute probability of a

37
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,640
using by splitting into two cases one

38
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,320
where e occurs and one where e does not

39
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,040
occur so you take the probability that

40
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,200
the E occurs you multiply it by the

41
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:51,079
probability that a occurs given e and

42
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:53,240
you do the same for not e and because uh

43
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:56,520
e and not e are by definition disjoint

44
00:01:53,240 --> 00:02:00,439
events exactly one of them happens this

45
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:02,960
uh works out you have the uh the product

46
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:05,240
rule here between these events and the

47
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,239
sum rule between these events I think

48
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:09,879
easiest to see in this tree um I tend to

49
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:13,440
draw my trees vertically you can draw

50
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:15,400
them horizontally whatever uh we have uh

51
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,080
event e occurring or not occurring and

52
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,000
then separately we have event a or not a

53
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,519
occurring and any of these could happen

54
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,680
in any combination when we write down a

55
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:25,080
tree usually we write on the edges

56
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,480
conditional probabilities at the

57
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,800
beginning there's no condition so it's

58
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,920
just probability of e on one side and

59
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,879
probability of not e on the other

60
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,920
side uh but then usually on this Branch

61
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:40,360
we write what's the probability of a

62
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:41,800
given that e occurred and on this Branch

63
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,040
what's the probability that not a

64
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,760
occurred given that e occurred this

65
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,879
whole branch is that e occurred and then

66
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,159
we care about given that we got here

67
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:50,440
what's the probability of a happening

68
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:52,200
what's the probability of not a

69
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,560
happening and similarly on the other

70
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:57,280
side what's the probability of a and not

71
00:02:53,560 --> 00:03:00,040
a happening given that e didn't happen

72
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,800
that's those are all the cases um and

73
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,200
then you can compute the probability of

74
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,680
each of these individual situations by

75
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:09,560
taking the product of these

76
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:11,319
probabilities down the path um that's

77
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,400
what we have shown in the past and so in

78
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:15,200
particular if you want to compute the

79
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:18,000
probability of a a is these two nodes

80
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:21,280
together these are the two a branches

81
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,239
and so that is this product plus this

82
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,760
product by construction everything here

83
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:27,360
is disjoint and so you can just add the

84
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:30,760
probabilities up and you get get this

85
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,400
law okay we may use it today

86
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:36,040
uh today I want to talk about a related

87
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:38,400
concept which is Independence so today

88
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:41,760
is Independence Day not starring Will

89
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:45,319
Smith or any other modern versions of

90
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,280
Independence Day um and the the tagline

91
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:49,519
for Independence Day back in the 90s I

92
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,879
was alive back then uh it says the

93
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,120
question of whether or not we are alone

94
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:55,879
in the universe has been answered you

95
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,439
know are we are we independent from the

96
00:03:55,879 --> 00:04:00,159
rest of the universe or are we dependent

97
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,519
it turns out the answer is uh we're

98
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,760
independent if and only if probability

99
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,760
of a given a b is probability of a

100
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,159
that's sorry spoilers for the movie but

101
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:12,040
that's that's what you get by the end so

102
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:13,640
that's our mathematical definition of a

103
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:16,879
is

104
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,879
independent of

105
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:29,560
B if probability of a given

106
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:31,800
B uh probability of a conditioned on B

107
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,720
is is just the probability of a again so

108
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,280
in other words conditioning on B does

109
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,520
not affect the probability of a with the

110
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:42,160
condition without the condition you get

111
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:44,520
the same thing um we have to also say or

112
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,880
the probability of b equals

113
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,800
zero uh for this annoying technical

114
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,199
reason which I forgot to mention up here

115
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,800
probability of a given B is not defined

116
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,840
when probability of B is zero because

117
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:59,039
then you get a division by zero error we

118
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,639
don't like those so uh I don't even know

119
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:02,759
what this means

120
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,080
when B when the probability of B is zero

121
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:06,919
so we need to say whether we're

122
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,520
independent in that case and we

123
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:11,199
are so it turns out the empty event

124
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,360
where no which never happens is

125
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,080
independent of everything also the full

126
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,759
event which always happens is

127
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:20,400
independent of

128
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:23,000
everything uh so this is a way to

129
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:26,720
measure uh whether two things are

130
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,759
independent uh meaning whether the

131
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,800
outcome or like whether a happened

132
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,360
whether B happened has any impact on

133
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,080
whether a will happen that's intuitively

134
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:40,639
what this means and it's a useful

135
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:43,199
concept here isong page an example uh

136
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,400
that gives you some intuition about why

137
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,639
the Monty Hall problem comes out the way

138
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:51,120
it does so let's

139
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:51,120
do Monty

140
00:05:52,960 --> 00:06:00,919
Hall um I'm G to Define two

141
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:04,600
events one is door one

142
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:04,600
uh has a

143
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,400
prize so I forget the door names that uh

144
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,960
brinmore used so I'm just going to call

145
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,720
them door number one two and three just

146
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,800
like in the game

147
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:23,000
show uh

148
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:23,000
and I don't have fancy colored boxes

149
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:44,400
okay I'm I'm not going to repeat the

150
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:46,199
whole analysis of Monty Hall but I just

151
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,080
want you to think about these two events

152
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:52,080
so event a is that door one has the

153
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:54,800
price we know without anything else this

154
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:58,160
happens with onethird probability uh

155
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:01,240
event B is that door two is revealed to

156
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:04,280
not have the prize after player after

157
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:06,440
the player chooses door one okay this is

158
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:10,360
a bit of a mouthful but let's just

159
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:12,800
suppose uh that the player starts by

160
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:14,639
choosing door number one uh in the

161
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,879
analysis we did we had a uniform random

162
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,080
choice of choosing all three doors it

163
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:18,919
doesn't actually matter which door you

164
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,800
choose because everything else is random

165
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:22,280
it's fine if you always choose door one

166
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,080
but whe whether it's random whether it's

167
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:26,560
deterministic let's just suppose the

168
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:30,560
player the player chooses door

169
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,639
one and event B is Will door number two

170
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,039
be

171
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:36,479
revealed uh to not have the

172
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:40,280
press okay and now my question is is

173
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:43,120
event a and event B uh are they

174
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:45,240
independent from each other and I claim

175
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,240
that they

176
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,240
are

177
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:54,159
uh and the way we can determine that is

178
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,199
by Computing these two probabilities

179
00:07:54,159 --> 00:08:01,039
probability of a and probability of a

180
00:07:56,199 --> 00:08:04,280
given B now probability of a we know

181
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,280
is uh

182
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,840
1/3 right with that this is just does

183
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:12,199
door one half prize that's uniform

184
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:14,479
random so uh oneir for that and so for

185
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:17,120
this to be independent it better be the

186
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,400
case that uh probability of a given B is

187
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,639
also

188
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:24,280
1/3 and if you think about it uh that is

189
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:26,080
one of the things we computed um because

190
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,560
what we computed was what's the

191
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,240
probability of

192
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:32,399
switching uh the switching rule winning

193
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,440
so we're supposing here the player chose

194
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,760
door

195
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:41,800
one and so if in the switching strategy

196
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:44,159
they will switch to uh in in conditioned

197
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:46,120
on b means that player the player chose

198
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,800
door one and door two was revealed not

199
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:50,399
to have the prize and so we would switch

200
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,800
to door three and we worked out that the

201
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,640
winning probability if you in the

202
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:56,519
switching strategy was 2/3 so that means

203
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,200
the probability that door one has the

204
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:59,760
prize must be 1/3 because the

205
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:04,079
probability that door three three has

206
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:06,200
the priz is 2/3 and 1 - 2/3 is 1/3 so

207
00:09:04,079 --> 00:09:08,680
indeed these are equal and the events

208
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:12,880
are independent and while I don't claim

209
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:14,680
this is super intuitive yet um I mean if

210
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,519
you stare it's like you stare at it for

211
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:19,399
an hour and then it's intuitive so it's

212
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,240
not especially intuitive but I think

213
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:23,320
while before we saw you can just compute

214
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,240
everything and find the answer um I

215
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:28,440
think this does give a little intuition

216
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:30,480
the idea is that revealing door two to

217
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,720
not have the prize doesn't tell you

218
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,519
anything about whether door one has the

219
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:38,240
price and that's intuitively why

220
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:41,560
switching is good because you've reduced

221
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:44,320
down to two uh possibilities instead of

222
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:46,040
just instead of three if you stick to a

223
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,160
uh it will be as if you were no doors

224
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:50,120
were revealed right if you suppose you

225
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,640
pick door number one at the beginning

226
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,760
and you uh decide I'm just going to stay

227
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,160
no matter what then whatever information

228
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,640
they show you doesn't tell you anything

229
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,160
about uh uh whether door one will have

230
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,640
the price and that's that's what this is

231
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:05,279
confirming that that vague feeling that

232
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,120
might be true uh this shows that indeed

233
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,480
this information being revealed tells

234
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,000
you nothing about whether a will happen

235
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,800
or whether a happened I guess uh the

236
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,240
probabilities are the same either way

237
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,480
and so this gives you some intuition for

238
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,760
why uh the monteal problem came out the

239
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,760
way it

240
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,440
did still you should compute things but

241
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,760
the goal by the end of this class is

242
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,279
you'll have at least some intuition

243
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:31,320
about probability and hopefully it will

244
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:31,320
be the correct one

245
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,560
here's another situation to think about

246
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:39,639
suppose you have two events A and B

247
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,120
which are disjoint so they're two

248
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:43,000
subsets of the sample space and they

249
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,839
don't have any elements in common so we

250
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,160
normally write this as a intersect B is

251
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:53,000
the empty

252
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:55,360
set then are they independent well uh

253
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,600
let's just compute these probabilities

254
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,200
probability of a I don't know how to

255
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:03,200
compute but probability of a given B

256
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:05,000
that I know how to compute I zoom into B

257
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,560
and I see how many A's are in there and

258
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,760
zero there's no a inside B uh in other

259
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,519
words the

260
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,720
probability here probability of a

261
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:16,600
intersect B is zero because there's no

262
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:21,720
intersection so whatever the denominator

263
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:23,519
is is zero okay and uh so this means

264
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:27,519
they are not

265
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,519
independent typically

266
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,720
uh unless uh some exceptional cases

267
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,160
happen

268
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:39,160
namely uh I guess it could be that a is

269
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:42,920
also the empty set there's nothing in a

270
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:45,639
then probability of a um equals this

271
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:48,880
thing probability of a given

272
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:51,320
B uh and the other situation is uh

273
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,959
probability of B is

274
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:56,519
zero because that's another situation

275
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:59,880
where we just have independence by

276
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:02,800
definition okay so disjoint events are

277
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:05,279
not independent uh the intuition here is

278
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,600
if I tell you that b happened you know

279
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:10,079
very well a did not happen because we

280
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:14,440
assume these are disjoint events okay

281
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:16,880
another example is uh

282
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:19,959
subsets let's suppose which way is

283
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:26,279
easier B is a subset of

284
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:29,440
a so a is the big thing and B is nestled

285
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:33,160
inside then I want to know uh what is

286
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:37,160
the probability of a given

287
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:40,760
B well if I zoom into B it looks in

288
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:45,079
completely a all of this is included

289
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:47,760
inside a and so this probability is

290
00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:51,600
one and so this is another situation

291
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,600
where uh A and B are not

292
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:56,240
independent unless some very special

293
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:00,000
cases

294
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:03,519
happen uh namely

295
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:07,000
it could be uh a is everything a always

296
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,560
occurs probability of a equals 1 um or

297
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,839
again it could be probability of b

298
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:14,360
equals

299
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:16,160
zero so if B is just nothing then uh

300
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:19,800
they're independent just by definition

301
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:24,519
if a is everything then uh yeah

302
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:24,519
restricting to B it's still everything

303
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:33,320
question why don't we say dependent it's

304
00:13:30,199 --> 00:13:36,279
a good question uh I believe

305
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:39,040
traditionally not not independent we

306
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:41,519
could just say dependent uh I guess I

307
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,680
don't know what dependent means I guess

308
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,399
you could try to Define dependence like

309
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,839
amount of dependence and maybe

310
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:49,839
statisticians do that but in our worlds

311
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:51,959
we generally just Define independent and

312
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,759
then there's the converse and we call it

313
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:56,880
non-independent I agree it's weird you

314
00:13:53,759 --> 00:14:01,040
could maybe think of it as dependent

315
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:05,000
but pretty sure it's not standard

316
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:07,800
all right uh let me tell you some more

317
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,720
ways of course the in you take two

318
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,959
events they're probably dependent in

319
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:15,959
some sense uh Independence is kind of

320
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:18,079
the special thing and it's what we are

321
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:19,279
going to focus on is detecting when when

322
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:21,600
an event is

323
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:24,959
independent so let me tell you some ways

324
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:27,160
to other ways to compute it so we can

325
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:29,240
use this definition and compute it uh

326
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,720
but it's It's oddly asymmetric right we

327
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,279
talked about the probability of a given

328
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,240
B what if it's easier to compute the

329
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:39,600
probability of B given a for example or

330
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:41,600
something else uh there's another nice

331
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,199
characterization which I'm going to call

332
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,440
the product rule we've already seen a

333
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:49,399
product rule with inclusion exclusion

334
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,399
but

335
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,839
um here's another one

336
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:06,360
so an event a is independent of another

337
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:11,600
event B if and only if probability of a

338
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:11,600
intersect B is the product of the

339
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:23,000
probabilities okay this is what

340
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,839
you this is what makes sense I guess in

341
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,880
some sense if uh naively if you try to

342
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,959
if you want to think about the

343
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,680
probability of of an intersection what's

344
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,399
in other words the probability of one

345
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,480
event happening and another event

346
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,800
happening naively that would be the

347
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,639
product and Independence is exactly when

348
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,480
you can do this if you're independent

349
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,880
this is true if you're not independent

350
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,360
this is false so it this is some sense

351
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:49,160
why we care about

352
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:51,959
independence uh and yeah let me get

353
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,959
another chalk

354
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:57,959
here and it's effectively what we're

355
00:15:55,079 --> 00:16:00,240
using in when I was saying oh uh the

356
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:02,800
probability of this event happening is

357
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,800
the probability of this thing happening

358
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,920
times the the probability of this thing

359
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:11,480
happening conditioned on this one that

360
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:13,720
that multiplication is is okay partly

361
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:19,480
because I mean in particular because

362
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:21,480
event e is independent of a given e in

363
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:23,680
some sense I guess this is not properly

364
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:28,560
an event but you can think of it that

365
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,560
way all right let's prove this theorem

366
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,680
uh by

367
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,959
cases so

368
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:40,040
case

369
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:44,639
one what I'd like to branch on is is the

370
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:46,000
probability of b equal to zero because

371
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,120
it's just annoying to work with this

372
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,240
definition there's a special case b

373
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:53,120
equals zero okay so that turns out to be

374
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:58,160
the natural case breakdown case two is

375
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,160
going to be probability B is not zero

376
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:07,600
okay so uh when B probability of b

377
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:10,240
equals z we know uh that a is

378
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:13,000
independent of

379
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:16,439
B that's part of the

380
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,640
definition so now uh so this part is

381
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:20,640
true so for this if and only if to be

382
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,400
true we better make sure the probability

383
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:26,439
of a intersect B is equal to that

384
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:29,360
product okay but then this number is

385
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:30,960
zero so this product is zero so what we

386
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,840
really want is that the probability of a

387
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:38,679
intersect B is zero and indeed

388
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:40,520
probability of a intersect B is at most

389
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:44,000
probability of

390
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:46,799
B why because this set is contained in

391
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,360
this set and probability is monotone if

392
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,000
you take a smaller set it contains all

393
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:52,240
the elements of this set then this

394
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,640
probability will be less than equal to

395
00:17:52,240 --> 00:18:00,360
that uh and probability B is zero by

396
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:05,400
assumption uh and so it's also equal to

397
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:06,919
probability of a Time probability of B I

398
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,240
guess I'm also using that uh

399
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:11,000
probabilities are non- negative and so

400
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,520
I've sandwiched this probability between

401
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,240
Z and zero which means it equals

402
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:18,400
zero uh it's both less than or greater

403
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:21,320
than or equal to zero so equal zero and

404
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,280
so we're done with that case Okay

405
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,480
probability be not equal to zero is the

406
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,640
more interesting case because that's

407
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:29,400
when we get to work with this formula

408
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,799
probability of a given B is equal to

409
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:34,799
probability of a so that's the

410
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:38,320
definition of independence so write

411
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:44,679
Independence if and only if probability

412
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:44,679
of a given b equals probability of

413
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:53,159
a okay so now we have

414
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:56,400
some uh computation to

415
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:59,039
do let's see we also have a formula for

416
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,320
probability of a given B up here that's

417
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:03,559
the definition so let's plug that in

418
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:06,159
probability of a intersect B divided by

419
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,159
probability of

420
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,480
B okay so this is equal to that this is

421
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,200
equal to that so these two things are

422
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,720
equal and now on this equation I'd just

423
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,600
like I see probability of a here I see

424
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,440
probability of B on the denominator here

425
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,799
I'd like to multiply both sides by

426
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:31,919
probability of B and I get uh this is a

427
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:33,240
equivalent to probability of a Time

428
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:37,360
probability of

429
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:40,360
b equals probability of a intercept

430
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:42,360
B which is exactly what I wanted to

431
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:45,120
prove that's so I'm

432
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,799
done uh crucially here though I'm using

433
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,080
in order to multiply both sides by

434
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:50,880
probability of B and to get an if and

435
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:53,400
only if it's crucial that this is not

436
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,080
zero if you multiply both sides of a

437
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,679
formula by zero you don't get a very

438
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:59,480
interesting formula and you don't get an

439
00:19:56,679 --> 00:20:00,960
if and only if so but once I assume that

440
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:04,480
probability is not zero then I can

441
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:06,360
actually do the multiplication and uh

442
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,960
and I get a useful statement and this is

443
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:12,919
true so I get the cancellation I wanted

444
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:15,600
otherwise I get zero over zero okay so

445
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:17,240
uh this tells us a different way to

446
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:21,440
determine Independence right we could

447
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:25,679
compute this thing and this thing uh or

448
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:27,840
we can compute this thing and this thing

449
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:30,280
uh and if they're equal it's the same

450
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:33,280
thing as that condition being true

451
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:34,480
notably uh this definition or this

452
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,000
condition sometimes this is the

453
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,000
definition of independence you might see

454
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,760
both uh they're they're equivalent so

455
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,200
you could use either one this definition

456
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:44,799
is symmetric in A and B if I swap A and

457
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,039
B I get exactly the same thing right a

458
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:48,720
intersect B is the same as B intersect a

459
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,039
probability of a times probability of B

460
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,559
is the same thing as probability of B

461
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:56,000
times probability of a so uh I no longer

462
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:57,720
have to say a is independent of B I can

463
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,280
just say A and B are independent without

464
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:02,679
worrying about

465
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:05,679
uh which one's first so

466
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:05,679
corollary

467
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,360
uh independent

468
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:16,320
of is a symmetric

469
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,320
relation a is independent of B if and

470
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,600
only if B is independent of a so I'll

471
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,360
just talk about A and B being

472
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,960
independent for from now on this

473
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,919
definition is not obviously symmetric

474
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,679
but now that you know that these are

475
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:36,919
interchangeable if it's easier to

476
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:38,799
compute probability of B given a you can

477
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:41,440
do that as well you can do probability

478
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:43,799
of B given a equals probability of B

479
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,440
that's just as good as checking this

480
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:48,960
one not obvious from that definition but

481
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:52,120
through this transformation it becomes

482
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,120
obvious all

483
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:58,559
right let's uh let's do some more

484
00:21:55,159 --> 00:21:58,559
interesting examples

485
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:18,080
and let's start

486
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:18,080
with flipping to Independent Fair

487
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:22,640
coins okay now that you know what

488
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:25,799
Independence means we're going to be

489
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,880
using it a lot uh in particular just as

490
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:29,200
an

491
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,919
assumption uh a lot of probability

492
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:35,240
problems are not well defined unless you

493
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:37,159
specify as part of the statement that uh

494
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,919
two random events are independent from

495
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:41,480
each other you already saw this in your

496
00:22:38,919 --> 00:22:43,960
problem set we wanted all of the errors

497
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:47,400
that the bots made to be independent

498
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:49,080
from each other meaning uh whether one

499
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,919
thing happens does not influence the

500
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,400
outcome of the other so a simple example

501
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:55,320
of this where you this is a reasonable

502
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,400
assumption is you have two coins uh I

503
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,440
don't use physical money anymore but

504
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,039
imagine you have two coins and you flip

505
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,400
them whether this one comes out heads

506
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,720
and whether this one comes out heads

507
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,440
should be independent of each other

508
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:07,559
unless you I don't know glue the two

509
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,760
coins together then they're very

510
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:12,640
dependent I used it

511
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,840
dependent um so usually when we're

512
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,840
saying we're going to flip a bunch of

513
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:18,039
coins we need to specify are they

514
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,279
somehow linked together maybe I don't

515
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:21,640
know they have some quantum entanglement

516
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:23,360
and whether one comes out heads

517
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,960
influences the other or they're

518
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,520
physically attached or something like

519
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,679
that but normally we think of the case

520
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,440
where the coins are all dependent okay

521
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:33,240
so we're going to use Independence also

522
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,360
as an assumption in the problem

523
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:37,600
statement and that

524
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,559
specifies uh in some sense what your

525
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,039
sample space should be then there's

526
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:43,400
another assumption here which is fair

527
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,520
that means that they come out 50% heads

528
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:48,159
50%

529
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:51,600
Tails so

530
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,600
um sample

531
00:23:53,400 --> 00:24:02,919
space is uh heads and tails squared so

532
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:04,840
heads and tails cross heads and tails uh

533
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:06,559
the the set of pairs heads Tails heads

534
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:13,000
Tails

535
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:14,880
um or X Y where X and Y are in H or T I

536
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,360
forget whether we've squared sets before

537
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,520
but that's the

538
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:21,760
meaning just like the cross product of

539
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:23,120
two of them um and so there's like a

540
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,120
there's the first coin and the second

541
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,919
coin this is an ordered pair and they're

542
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,039
each equally likely the assumption that

543
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,600
they're independent

544
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:35,440
tells us they should be uh all all of

545
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,720
these outcomes are equally likely or the

546
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,480
assumption that they're independent and

547
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,559
fair makes them all equally likely I

548
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,159
guess all right so let's do this more

549
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:47,600
precisely let's say a is the

550
00:24:43,159 --> 00:24:51,799
event uh that the first

551
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,799
coin uh comes out

552
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:58,919
heads El

553
00:24:54,520 --> 00:25:02,240
is uh and let's let B be the event

554
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:02,240
that the second coin comes out

555
00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:12,520
hits okay

556
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,760
um I would like to claim that these two

557
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:17,440
events are independent from each other

558
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:20,000
not just by assumption but by Computing

559
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:22,760
according to either of these formulas

560
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,200
okay so let's let's do that so we fully

561
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:26,240
understand situation I'm going to draw

562
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,039
tree

563
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:32,760
here so this is the first first

564
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:36,960
coin and this is the second

565
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:36,960
coin each one can be heads or

566
00:25:41,399 --> 00:25:45,880
tails okay and because we're assuming

567
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:47,799
fair this should be probability half

568
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:50,440
this should be probability half also

569
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:52,840
here the probability of each of these

570
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:55,039
coin flips being header taals given the

571
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:57,080
previous one uh it doesn't matter that

572
00:25:55,039 --> 00:26:01,000
the first one happen so uh we just write

573
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:04,640
a half half on all of these

574
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:06,679
edges okay so now I want to

575
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,480
say let's

576
00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:10,960
say

577
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,360
probability of B given a this is going

578
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,880
to be a little bit circular because

579
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:15,840
we're using Independence both as an

580
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:17,200
assumption and the thing we're Computing

581
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,080
but we should be used to drawing these

582
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:22,279
kinds of diagrams under this implicit

583
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:24,360
Independence assumption by now we are

584
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:26,279
told this the number we write here is

585
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:28,880
the probability of this thing happening

586
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:32,159
given that this one happened okay so

587
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:34,480
probability of B given a uh so this this

588
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:38,960
was um a

589
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:41,919
is this Edge right I guess this node is

590
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:44,320
event a in some sense a is that the

591
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:47,919
first coin flip was a heads so

592
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:50,559
probability of B given a is exactly the

593
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:54,799
probability written on this Edge because

594
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:59,480
this would be uh B given a that

595
00:26:54,799 --> 00:27:02,799
event a happened and then B happened

596
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:04,240
or I guess the maybe the edge is more is

597
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:07,039
thought of this way this is more like a

598
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,880
intersect B that they both happened okay

599
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:12,880
but however you slice it probability of

600
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:14,320
B given a is a half that's what we

601
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,919
defined the probability of the second

602
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,120
coin being a heads given that the first

603
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:20,520
one is also a heads shouldn't matter is

604
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:22,200
a half and on the other hand the

605
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:25,720
probability

606
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:28,480
of second coin being heads by itself is

607
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:33,000
a half so yes it's independent I may say

608
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:38,080
okay not a very exciting example let's

609
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:41,480
uh slightly more exciting is that uh

610
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:45,159
let's say first

611
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:45,159
coin uh heads

612
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:51,840
probability is

613
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:53,440
p and

614
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:56,320
second

615
00:27:53,440 --> 00:28:00,039
coin uh heads

616
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:03,120
probability is q

617
00:28:00,039 --> 00:28:04,519
so I invest in some weighted coins it's

618
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,960
probability of P that the first one

619
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:08,080
comes up heads probability of Q the

620
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,399
second one comes up heads maybe p and Q

621
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,840
are equal to half or maybe there's

622
00:28:09,399 --> 00:28:16,919
something

623
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:19,159
else uh then still I get for example uh

624
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:23,679
I don't know the probability that A and

625
00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:25,799
B happens is going to be P *

626
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:27,519
Q it's hard to do this without

627
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:28,480
assumption that these are independent

628
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:30,720
events but this is this is how we've

629
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:33,080
been Computing things and that's also

630
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:36,399
probability of

631
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:40,120
a product with probability B

632
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:42,279
okay not very exciting let's make this

633
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:46,799
interesting and Define some events that

634
00:28:42,279 --> 00:28:50,120
are not just a function of one coin but

635
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:52,240
in fact depend on the entire sample

636
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:59,760
space so I'm going to go back to this

637
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:59,760
example and define s to be the event

638
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,519
that uh I guess I should write a and b

639
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:10,840
are

640
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:13,799
independent here and a and b are

641
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:16,000
independent

642
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:20,279
here okay but now I'm going to write an

643
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,279
event that's not so obvious

644
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:28,720
uh the S event is going to be that the

645
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:31,880
coin flips come out the same either both

646
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,880
heads or both

647
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:42,679
Tails okay this clearly involves both

648
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:46,360
coin flips so you might think that s and

649
00:29:42,679 --> 00:29:49,720
a say are dependent on each other

650
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:53,200
intuitively they are but according to

651
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:53,200
this definition they are

652
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:59,880
independent that's the claim so let's

653
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:03,399
compute it um I claim the easy one is to

654
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:08,679
compute probability of s given

655
00:30:03,399 --> 00:30:12,760
a so in this diagram a is that we're

656
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:15,279
here uh that we flipped ahead so far and

657
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:16,799
now I want to know the probability that

658
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:18,240
the coins come out the same well

659
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:21,840
condition on a being a heads that's the

660
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:23,000
same as the probability of uh the second

661
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:26,559
coin being

662
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,600
heads right so this is just uh the

663
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:30,840
probability of B

664
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:33,840
which is not quite what I wanted we

665
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:36,760
wanted it to be probability of s I guess

666
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:38,320
but it is equal to the probability of b

667
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:40,240
um which is a

668
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,640
half by

669
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:46,120
assumption on the other hand we want to

670
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:49,279
know is the probability of s the same

671
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:50,799
thing well probability of s is uh

672
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:54,120
corresponds to this

673
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:56,840
node and this

674
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:58,679
node right this is the head's heads case

675
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:01,080
this is the Tail's tails

676
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:04,880
case uh we know the probability of this

677
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:06,639
is a quarter because it's 12 * 1/2 and

678
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,799
the probability of this is also a

679
00:31:06,639 --> 00:31:11,519
quarter 12 * 1/2 we know all of these

680
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:13,840
are equally likely a quarter and so

681
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:18,720
probability of s is the sum of those

682
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:21,279
two uh this is quarter plus a quarter

683
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,799
also known as a half and so these two

684
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:25,039
things are

685
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:28,960
equal so you can think of this as a

686
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:32,440
betting game suppose uh I ask you to bet

687
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:34,799
on whether uh two coins are are going to

688
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:36,320
come out the same or different and

689
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:37,960
they're Fair independent coins so I'm

690
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,360
going to flip them and you get a dollar

691
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,679
if they're the same and you lose a

692
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:44,360
dollar if they're different or something

693
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:46,519
like that um if I flip the first coin

694
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:48,720
and it comes out heads that doesn't tell

695
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:51,159
you anything uh you're still going to

696
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:53,799
have a half half probability of winning

697
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:56,240
when the second flip happens right uh

698
00:31:53,799 --> 00:31:58,080
doing the first flip does not tell you

699
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,880
anything about whether the second flip

700
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:02,480
is going to be the same as the first one

701
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:04,679
because it's still equally likely to be

702
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,799
equal or not equal that's what this is

703
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:10,039
formalizing okay but until you compute

704
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:13,200
it I would say this is not exactly

705
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:15,679
obvious all right let's do the same

706
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:20,679
thing so here

707
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:22,519
uh A and S are

708
00:32:20,679 --> 00:32:24,279
independent let's try the same thing

709
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:28,960
with unfair

710
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:31,600
coins suppose we have uh parties p and Q

711
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,559
and we have S is the event that the

712
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,760
coins come out the same now things are

713
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:37,760
not so

714
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,760
easy

715
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:44,480
uh

716
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:46,159
so what's the probability that they come

717
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:49,120
out the

718
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:53,760
same maybe I should draw this tree again

719
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:57,360
for the not same ca for the unfair case

720
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:58,519
so we've got heads tails for the first

721
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,760
coin

722
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:04,080
so this is probability P this is

723
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:09,080
probability 1 minus p and then we've got

724
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:09,080
heads and tails for the second

725
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:16,320
coin which we're assuming now is

726
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:16,320
probability q and one minus

727
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:21,519
Q independent of what happened

728
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:28,440
before okay and still s is this plus

729
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,200
this

730
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:32,960
and so we just take these products and

731
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:35,480
add them up so probability of s

732
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,760
probability of heads Heads maybe I'll

733
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:41,440
write it out uh probability of heads

734
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:46,399
Heads plus the probability of Tails

735
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:48,279
Tails uh the first one is p * Q so the

736
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:49,760
probability of getting the first heads

737
00:33:48,279 --> 00:33:51,799
is p the probability of getting second

738
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,720
heads is q and by assumption these are

739
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:59,519
independent so I can take their

740
00:33:53,720 --> 00:34:03,679
product uh and the other one is 1 P * 1

741
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:11,679
- q and now I just get some ugly algebra

742
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:15,079
this is like 2 p q minus P minus Q + 1 I

743
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:18,599
think Check

744
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:21,919
Yes okay uh on the other hand let's try

745
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:25,839
uh probability of s given a this one is

746
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:28,639
actually easy because uh this is saying

747
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:31,320
okay we condition here's a we condition

748
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:32,839
on there being a heads in the first step

749
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:34,560
what's the probability that the same

750
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:36,399
well that's the same as the probability

751
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:40,480
that the second coin comes up heads as

752
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:40,480
well and so that's exactly

753
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:53,000
Q so uh these things are going to be

754
00:34:46,359 --> 00:34:58,599
independent so I guess uh s and a are

755
00:34:53,000 --> 00:35:05,520
independent if and only if uh 2 PQ

756
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:12,760
Min - P - Q + 1 = Q in other words uh 2

757
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:15,560
p q - P - 2 Q + 1 =

758
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:18,119
0 and this happens to factor I don't

759
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:19,839
claim this is obvious but it is the same

760
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:27,800
as uh

761
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:27,800
2 Q minus 1 pus 1 = 0

762
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:35,920
and so uh there's two there's two ways

763
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:39,440
to for this to be true one is that P

764
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:42,160
equals one in other words the first coin

765
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:46,119
always comes up heads I would call that

766
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:47,680
a one-sided coin or you can make them by

767
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:50,440
manufacturing coin that's heads on both

768
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:55,280
sides that's a two-sided coin but really

769
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:59,119
only one side or uh Q is a

770
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:00,920
half so if Q is a Fair coin

771
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:03,800
sorry if if the second coin is a Fair

772
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:08,400
coin then s and a are independent of

773
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:10,880
each other and so uh this tells us that

774
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,760
uh what we found here which was that s

775
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,240
and a were independent of each other

776
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:17,599
really needs that the coins are fair

777
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:21,960
fair coins and one-sided coins are the

778
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:24,760
only situation where uh this s event uh

779
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:27,200
here that the coins come out the same is

780
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:29,240
independent of the first or second coin

781
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:31,480
so if we were playing this gambling game

782
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:32,880
with unfair coins and you knew p andq

783
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:35,280
and I told you that the first one came

784
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,800
out heads that actually uh tells you

785
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,960
something about whether you're more or

786
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:41,760
less likely to uh for the next coin to

787
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:46,280
match it because then matching is no

788
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:49,520
longer uh symmetric all right so lots of

789
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:50,880
examples of coin flipping um maybe it

790
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,200
gives you some intuition for some

791
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,079
examples that are independent and some

792
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:59,200
that are dependent why do we care about

793
00:36:54,079 --> 00:37:02,400
nfir coins uh well one fun uh fact is

794
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:04,079
that normal coins are not fair they're

795
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,839
more likely to come up the same

796
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:09,119
orientation that you flip that you

797
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:11,480
started in then they are to flip over

798
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:15,400
and there's a nice physics model by perc

799
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:19,160
diaconus and others uh from back in 2007

800
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:22,440
that uh computes that for normal coin

801
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:25,160
flips uh you should get uh about 51%

802
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:26,960
chance of staying on the same side so if

803
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,119
you play this game with somebody and you

804
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:32,040
make money

805
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:34,079
uh please thank us um there's there's

806
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:36,640
this thing called procession coins when

807
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:38,720
you flip them vigorously as they say uh

808
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,839
they tend to also spin in this way which

809
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:43,800
does not cause them to flip over and so

810
00:37:40,839 --> 00:37:47,319
they spend more time a little more time

811
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:48,960
uh face original versus face upside down

812
00:37:47,319 --> 00:37:51,319
and that gives you a slightly higher

813
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:53,400
chance uh on the right is a is a machine

814
00:37:51,319 --> 00:37:55,680
that always flips the coin the same

815
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:58,359
number of flips and so it always

816
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:00,480
produces the same result that's cheating

817
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:02,839
uh this theoretical model was recently

818
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:06,839
verified experimentally for

819
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:09,079
350,000 real coin flips uh by these 50

820
00:38:06,839 --> 00:38:11,359
authors this was like an online Internet

821
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:15,640
collaboration uh just completed last

822
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:18,200
late last year um and uh they compute

823
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:21,040
maybe not 51% but

824
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:23,480
50.8% is the thing that they get or

825
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:25,640
somewhere between 50.6 and 50.9 so it

826
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:27,599
confirms this this intuition although it

827
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:30,640
does depend somewhat which currency you

828
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:32,720
use and uh who you are different

829
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:34,119
flippers have a different style in

830
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,480
flipping and so your personal

831
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:37,760
probability may be different from this

832
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:40,040
one so keep that in mind uh there are a

833
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:42,720
zillion videos uh online of these like

834
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:44,680
12-hour marathons just so you know for

835
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,280
verifiable science where you can watch

836
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:47,839
people flipping coins and typing in the

837
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:50,880
result and flipping coin type in the

838
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:53,720
result and anyway that

839
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:56,599
is uh you can watch this for the next 12

840
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:58,720
hours or we could go back to lecture um

841
00:38:56,599 --> 00:39:02,839
all right

842
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:05,200
so some more Concepts uh Independence

843
00:39:02,839 --> 00:39:07,240
between two events is kind of cool but

844
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,440
what if we have more than two

845
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:11,560
events we do this all the time in this

846
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:14,560
class we talk about uh I don't know

847
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:16,640
whether two vertices in a graph are

848
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:18,359
connected and then we want to know well

849
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,720
what about what if the we want the whole

850
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:21,640
graph to be connected what if we want

851
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:24,319
all the the vertices in the graph to be

852
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:26,800
connected for that it was enough to do

853
00:39:24,319 --> 00:39:29,599
things pairwise we said well if every

854
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,920
pair vertic sees there's a path then

855
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:32,280
then that's a connected graph that

856
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:35,119
turned out to be the right answer for

857
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:38,720
graph connectivity with probability it's

858
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:42,920
much more annoying so uh one thing you

859
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:42,920
might Define is what we call pairwise

860
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:52,720
Independence so uh I guess let's suppose

861
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:57,680
I have

862
00:39:52,720 --> 00:40:00,560
events um E1

863
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:03,240
through en n then I'll call them

864
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:07,200
pairwise independent if

865
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:07,200
uh for all I and

866
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:14,680
J uh between one and

867
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:17,160
N uh

868
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:19,760
with I not equal to

869
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:21,520
J um

870
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:25,480
EI

871
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:25,480
and EJ are

872
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:31,520
independent okay of course EI and EI are

873
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:35,359
not independent that's the it's one of

874
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:36,520
the overlapping cases uh so EI is not

875
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:38,280
going to be independent from itself but

876
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:40,440
it should be independent from all the

877
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:42,520
others okay this would be the natural

878
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:44,760
pairwise

879
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:48,720
definition on the other hand we have a

880
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:48,720
stronger notion called Mutual

881
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:57,560
Independence this is more annoying to

882
00:40:55,240 --> 00:41:00,240
verify but it's probably what you

883
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:02,280
actually want and it says not only if I

884
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:04,920
take any two events they're independent

885
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:08,000
from each other but if I take any subset

886
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:10,079
of of events it's independent from any

887
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,520
one event you could also compare subsets

888
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:15,640
to subsets that doesn't turn out to

889
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:19,000
matter so what matters is uh if you fix

890
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:20,680
any event EI so e uh I is between one

891
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:25,400
and

892
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:29,119
n and I take another set set J it's a

893
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:33,280
subset of the elements from one to

894
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:35,160
n uh except it should not have I because

895
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:38,040
we don't want to compare EI to

896
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:41,520
itself then we want

897
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:41,520
EI to be

898
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:45,040
independent

899
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:47,800
from

900
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:51,119
uh the

901
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:51,119
intersection of the

902
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:55,680
ejs so I forget whether you've seen this

903
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:57,920
notation you've seen big Sigma for sums

904
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:01,359
you've seen big Pi for products

905
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,839
this is big uh big intersection for

906
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:05,480
intersection I guess we ran out of

907
00:42:02,839 --> 00:42:08,119
clever idea clever Greek letters uh so

908
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:11,640
this is just the intersection of EJ uh

909
00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:14,880
for all Little J and Big

910
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:16,720
J so we want each event EI to be

911
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:20,480
independent from the intersection of any

912
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:22,880
subset of the other events this is uh a

913
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,400
pain to verify for lots of events let's

914
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,240
just think about it for three events for

915
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,760
a little bit so there's on the one hand

916
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:31,000
we have pair wise Pence where you just

917
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:34,280
compare E1 versus E2 E2 versus E3 and E1

918
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:37,280
versus E3 and here uh you do that but

919
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:39,440
then you also compare like E1 versus the

920
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:42,599
intersection of E2 and E3 and you

921
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:45,200
compare uh E2 versus the intersection of

922
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:46,680
E1 and E3 and you compare E3 with the

923
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:50,200
intersection of E1 and

924
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:51,920
E2 okay so twice as much work uh you

925
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:59,680
check this Independence definition and

926
00:42:51,920 --> 00:43:03,319
you get your answer uh let us do uh an

927
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:03,319
example maybe first some

928
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:12,200
motivation let's do some

929
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:19,760
forensics okay suppose you are at a

930
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:21,640
murder scene and you find nine pieces of

931
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:24,000
evidence that's a lot of evidence it's

932
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:26,680
probably not realistic but let's uh for

933
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,119
sake of example uh say you find nine

934
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:31,160
markers

935
00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:33,440
that a uh that are consistent with a

936
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:38,400
particular suspect being at the scene of

937
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:43,839
the crime uh DNA

938
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:48,640
whatever uh and let's say Mi is the

939
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:53,800
event that a randomly chosen

940
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:53,800
human matches marker I

941
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:04,800
oh yeah I should tell you another

942
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:09,000
version of mutual Independence which is

943
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:09,000
useful uh so

944
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:20,359
equivalently this is the product rule

945
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:22,160
form uh for any J that's a subset of one

946
00:44:20,359 --> 00:44:26,559
up to

947
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:28,559
n uh the probability of the intersection

948
00:44:26,559 --> 00:44:33,559
of EJ

949
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:37,359
for J in Big J is equal to the product

950
00:44:33,559 --> 00:44:41,240
of the probabilities of the individual

951
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:44,760
events J and Big J okay this is the

952
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:46,920
natural generalization of

953
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:49,160
uh what we had for the product rule for

954
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:52,640
Independence between two

955
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:54,079
events okay so back to forensics we have

956
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:56,319
uh suppose we have a bunch of these

957
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:58,400
events and for each one we compute we

958
00:44:56,319 --> 00:45:00,440
know their probabil because we know

959
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:02,800
taken lots of surveys or whatever let's

960
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:08,000
say the probability of each

961
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:10,160
Mi uh is equal to 10% 10% chance that

962
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,000
you match this particular marker for

963
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:14,319
each marker just for Simplicity so say

964
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,880
it's the same for all of them in reality

965
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:20,800
it would be different so uh You' now

966
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:22,520
what we care about uh supposing that so

967
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:26,079
this is just assuming like sampling a

968
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:29,440
random human uh maybe in the area I

969
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:31,800
don't know let's say All Humans we're

970
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:35,000
fair or something we have no prior

971
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:37,359
assumption then um what we care about is

972
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,280
the probability that all of these come

973
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:41,599
out as matching our particular human

974
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:43,880
that we have in mind so we have a

975
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:46,599
suspect and now we want to take the

976
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:48,559
intersection of all those events we want

977
00:45:46,599 --> 00:45:50,000
to and suppose that human matches all of

978
00:45:48,559 --> 00:45:51,400
those markers now we want to know what's

979
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,520
the probability that that happen for a

980
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:58,640
random human and you would like to say

981
00:45:54,520 --> 00:46:00,960
this is 1 10 9 one and billion chance so

982
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:05,440
there's only like six people who could

983
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:08,280
match uh but that's only true if these

984
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,280
events are mutually

985
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:13,079
independent it's actually true if and

986
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:14,839
only if the events are mutually

987
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:17,880
independent this is the definition a

988
00:46:14,839 --> 00:46:19,440
definition of mutual Independence well

989
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:20,440
okay so mutual Independence is a little

990
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:23,119
stronger it says not only the

991
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:25,119
intersection of all nine events uh is

992
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:27,319
the product probability is the product

993
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:29,200
of the probabilities but also for any

994
00:46:27,319 --> 00:46:31,119
subset of those nine events so that's

995
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:33,160
crucial uh we don't need that for this

996
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:35,079
example this example we only care about

997
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:37,160
the intersection of all nine but if you

998
00:46:35,079 --> 00:46:39,680
want to prove that something is mutually

999
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:41,400
independent you need to check all of the

1000
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:42,960
events intersected together and also

1001
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:45,400
different subsets of them intersected

1002
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:49,440
together so keep that in mind on problem

1003
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:54,599
sets let's do uh a more interesting

1004
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:54,599
example uh where this matters

1005
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:12,280
okay back to coin

1006
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:15,000
flipping the source of all examples

1007
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:18,119
today uh let's say we

1008
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:20,079
flip three

1009
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:22,319
mutually

1010
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:26,680
independent

1011
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:26,680
coins Fair coins

1012
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:31,280
so we're going to State Independence as

1013
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,640
an assumption this is again this is now

1014
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,280
saying that the coins are not related

1015
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:36,839
any way they're each flipped completely

1016
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:37,960
separately from each other no impact uh

1017
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:41,240
from one to the

1018
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:42,599
other according to that definition say

1019
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:46,000
but now I'm going to Define some events

1020
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:49,079
that are interesting so a is going to be

1021
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:52,559
uh the event that uh the

1022
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:57,119
first and second

1023
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:57,119
coins come out the same

1024
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:03,000
when you flip

1025
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:05,319
them uh event B is going to be the event

1026
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,440
that the second and third coins come out

1027
00:48:05,319 --> 00:48:07,440
the

1028
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:14,680
same and event C is going to be the

1029
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:17,160
event that the third and first coins

1030
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:17,160
come out the

1031
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:27,280
same are these events

1032
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:31,000
independent I don't think it's

1033
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:31,000
obvious so we

1034
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,000
compute all right let's start with par

1035
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:51,319
wise

1036
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:55,760
Independence let's think about uh say

1037
00:48:51,319 --> 00:48:58,599
the probability of a intersect B versus

1038
00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:01,359
the product of the probab ities of A and

1039
00:48:58,599 --> 00:49:03,240
B so we I mean we did this if you were

1040
00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:06,200
strict to just a for example let's let's

1041
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:06,200
start with probability of

1042
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:11,640
a probability of a only depends on the

1043
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:14,359
first and second coins so this is

1044
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:17,520
exactly an example we saw before where

1045
00:49:14,359 --> 00:49:20,079
we just flipped two independent coins

1046
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:22,280
and we had this s was the event that the

1047
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:24,119
coins are the same so that's probability

1048
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:28,079
of s that's going to

1049
00:49:24,119 --> 00:49:30,400
be2 okay so probability of a a over here

1050
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:33,839
sorry for the relabeling this is just

1051
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:36,079
like probability of s before and so it's

1052
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:38,760
12 okay probability of each of these

1053
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:40,440
events is individually 1/2 so what we

1054
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:43,200
would like is for the intersection of

1055
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:44,599
two of them to be probability a quarter

1056
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:47,880
right 1 half

1057
00:49:44,599 --> 00:49:50,160
times2 so let's see if it

1058
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:54,319
is all right now we have to actually

1059
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:55,960
look at the problem so a is the event

1060
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:58,480
that the first and second coins are the

1061
00:49:55,960 --> 00:50:01,200
same B is the event that the second and

1062
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:04,559
third coins are the same so this is like

1063
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:08,599
uh this is like coin 1 equals coin 2 and

1064
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:11,160
this is like coin 2 equals coin 3 so if

1065
00:50:08,599 --> 00:50:15,520
they're if both of those things happen

1066
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:22,440
if C1 equals C2 and C2 equal C3 uh the

1067
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:22,440
the intersection here is um C1 = C2 =

1068
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:27,119
C3 right

1069
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:35,880
so uh in other words this is the

1070
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:40,040
probability of heads heads

1071
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:41,599
Heads uh I guess I'll WR as a set oh boy

1072
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:44,160
too many too many brackets I'm gonna

1073
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:46,240
have all three types of brackets this is

1074
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:49,040
exciting probability gets square

1075
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:52,520
brackets then set gets curly braces then

1076
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:54,960
an ordered pair gets round parentheses

1077
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:57,160
I'm happy they're all distinct makes it

1078
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:58,599
so much clearer

1079
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:01,640
all right so

1080
00:50:58,599 --> 00:51:04,640
this this braced quantity in the middle

1081
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:06,920
here is an event remember events are

1082
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:09,000
just sets over the S subsets of the

1083
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:12,440
sample space so it's a set of possible

1084
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:14,000
samples so uh a intersect B is the same

1085
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:16,200
thing as all the coins being the same

1086
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,440
that means headsets heads or tails Tails

1087
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:20,799
Tails okay so that probability we could

1088
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:22,520
rewrite this of course as the

1089
00:51:20,799 --> 00:51:24,760
probability of headsets heads I'm going

1090
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:27,359
to Omit some parents here just for

1091
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:29,359
Simplicity plus the prob of tals tals

1092
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:31,000
tals because these are different samples

1093
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:33,839
they are dint from each other and so we

1094
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:36,200
can use the sum rule uh and the

1095
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:38,480
probability of each of those events is

1096
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:40,599
1/8 right it's 1/ half to the power

1097
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:43,359
three it's 1 12 * 1 12 * 1/2 because

1098
00:51:40,599 --> 00:51:45,440
each of them is uh independent so this

1099
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:48,079
is 1/8 plus

1100
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:52,839
1/8 which is

1101
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:52,839
one4 and that's what we uh not we

1102
00:51:53,319 --> 00:52:01,040
wanted that's funny I make a mistake I

1103
00:51:57,799 --> 00:52:01,040
did I

1104
00:52:01,799 --> 00:52:07,160
did oh no that's what I wanted right

1105
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:09,119
sorry this probability is a what I

1106
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:11,640
wanted was this for to equal not

1107
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:13,839
probability of a but probability of a

1108
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:16,240
times probability of

1109
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:19,000
B uh these were each a

1110
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:21,680
half and so their product is a quarter

1111
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:25,200
and so that matches so these are

1112
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:25,200
pairwise independent

1113
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:33,440
okay I only computed it for a intersect

1114
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:35,720
B but you should also in principle do it

1115
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:38,760
for B intersect C and A intersect C all

1116
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:40,280
the pairs uh but by symmetry if you

1117
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:42,520
think about this the right way those

1118
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:45,359
will all come out the same okay I'll

1119
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:48,000
just wave my hands at that uh but what

1120
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:50,480
about Mutual Independence so these three

1121
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,319
events are mutually in or pairwise

1122
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:54,680
independent but they are not mutually

1123
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:58,119
independent let's prove that or let's

1124
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:58,119
compute that

1125
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:09,880
for that we care

1126
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:11,880
about

1127
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:13,359
uh we could do probability of

1128
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:16,520
intersection I claim it's a little

1129
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:19,599
easier to think about this probability

1130
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:20,960
the probability of C given a intersect B

1131
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:23,480
because we just thought a lot about what

1132
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:24,720
a intersect b means it turns out to be

1133
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:26,920
equivalent to saying that the three

1134
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:30,280
coins are the same

1135
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:33,200
so now what is the probability of C

1136
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:36,640
given that the three coins are the

1137
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:40,400
same prob C says the third coin and the

1138
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:40,400
first coin are the

1139
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:44,200
same so what's this

1140
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:49,240
probability one

1141
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:55,160
yeah remember this this notation means

1142
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:56,920
compute the probability of this event

1143
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:59,640
zooming in the special case where a

1144
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:01,559
intersect B is true so that in the S the

1145
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:05,000
sample space has eight possible spots

1146
00:54:01,559 --> 00:54:09,599
it's like a it's like a

1147
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:12,040
cube I guess each axis is heads or tails

1148
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:15,799
there's also a back back face

1149
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:18,559
here uh and what we're saying here is um

1150
00:54:15,799 --> 00:54:20,559
a intersect B is just the two extremes

1151
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:21,880
heads heads Heads Tails Tails Tails

1152
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:23,079
maybe you're used to the cube and this

1153
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:25,720
is familiar that they're opposite

1154
00:54:23,079 --> 00:54:27,520
Corners like this maybe not um and so if

1155
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:29,480
we zoom into just those two places and

1156
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:32,520
we want to evaluate well what's the CH

1157
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:35,359
what are the chances that coin 2 equals

1158
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:37,720
coin 3 or actually what was it no third

1159
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:39,119
first and third coins it doesn't matter

1160
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:40,440
right what are the chances that the

1161
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:42,680
first coin and the third coin are the

1162
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:44,280
same in these two scenarios well 100%

1163
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:46,119
it's guaranteed if you already know that

1164
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:48,599
all three coins are the same which is

1165
00:54:46,119 --> 00:54:50,079
what we figured out a intersect b means

1166
00:54:48,599 --> 00:54:50,880
then of course the first and third coins

1167
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:55,319
are the

1168
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:59,720
same okay uh whereas the probability of

1169
00:54:55,319 --> 00:55:01,400
C from the without any condition is

1170
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:02,920
1/4

1171
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:06,240
one

1172
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:08,200
half sorry uh just like probability of a

1173
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:12,119
here that was the s that we computed

1174
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:12,119
before so these are different from each

1175
00:55:12,599 --> 00:55:18,440
other uh so uh not mutually

1176
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:22,039
independent so this is kind of an

1177
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:23,559
interesting example where you have

1178
00:55:22,039 --> 00:55:26,640
pairwise

1179
00:55:23,559 --> 00:55:29,400
Independence but not full Independence

1180
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:30,839
not not triple wise Independence and

1181
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:33,240
there's only three events so that's the

1182
00:55:30,839 --> 00:55:34,680
most you could hope for uh in computer

1183
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:36,599
science these things actually matter

1184
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:38,400
when you do algorithms and like hashing

1185
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:39,720
in particular it matters how much

1186
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:41,440
Independence you have some hash

1187
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:43,280
functions are pawise independent or

1188
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:44,680
maybe three wise independent or five

1189
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:47,520
wise independent all these things are

1190
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:50,680
important Concepts in hashing for

1191
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:56,319
example but we won't we talking about

1192
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:56,319
that here that's the next class six 121

1193
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:04,799
all

1194
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:08,039
right finally we have well one or two

1195
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:08,039
more interesting

1196
00:56:10,039 --> 00:56:18,559
examples okay um big one is the birthday

1197
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:23,480
Paradox or you might call it the

1198
00:56:20,599 --> 00:56:25,079
birthday principle but I like I like

1199
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:26,760
living in a contradiction so we'll keep

1200
00:56:25,079 --> 00:56:29,200
it as a paradox

1201
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:32,240
it's not a paradox it's just a a

1202
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:33,920
surprising fun fact something where

1203
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:38,200
intuition

1204
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:38,200
and uh does not match

1205
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:53,280
mathematics uh so the the Paradox is

1206
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:55,640
that if you sample a bunch of people and

1207
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:58,000
measure their birthdays you're a lot

1208
00:56:55,640 --> 00:57:00,799
more likely that you might expect to get

1209
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:03,640
them to uh to have two people with the

1210
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:05,799
same birthday okay let's call them

1211
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:07,799
Birthday Twins okay if you're actually

1212
00:57:05,799 --> 00:57:09,599
Twins then you have the same birthday

1213
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:12,520
pretty almost certainly unless you span

1214
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:14,440
midnight uh but uh are there any twins

1215
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:16,799
in the audience or like both of you are

1216
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:18,200
here okay I didn't think so so then I'm

1217
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:20,760
going to assume that your birthdays are

1218
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:22,200
all independent from each other I think

1219
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:25,559
twins are pretty much the only way to

1220
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:26,839
get dependence um and I'm going to

1221
00:57:25,559 --> 00:57:28,760
assume

1222
00:57:26,839 --> 00:57:32,319
that you're equally likely to be on all

1223
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:33,559
days and uh that's less true in reality

1224
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:35,280
uh but the the effect of the birthday

1225
00:57:33,559 --> 00:57:37,599
Paradox will only be stronger if you

1226
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:38,720
have a non-uniform distribution like we

1227
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:41,720
do in

1228
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:43,559
reality uh

1229
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:46,359
so

1230
00:57:43,559 --> 00:57:47,720
um given what you already know in this

1231
00:57:46,359 --> 00:57:50,480
class in

1232
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:52,079
particular uh the pigeon hole principle

1233
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:56,200
or the Pidgey hole principle if you're a

1234
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:58,319
Pokemon fan um what how how many how

1235
00:57:56,200 --> 00:58:00,760
many people do I need to take in order

1236
00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:04,119
to guarantee that I have a duplicate

1237
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:04,119
birthday some Birthday

1238
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:10,559
Twins you remember all the way back to

1239
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:15,599
the pige and H principle

1240
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:19,119
yeah 366 for a 365 day year which is

1241
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:20,280
which uh so D here let for example could

1242
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:21,880
be

1243
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:27,079
365

1244
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:28,359
365 325 how many days are in a year

1245
00:58:27,079 --> 00:58:33,039
all right

1246
00:58:28,359 --> 00:58:37,760
um so in general if Nal D +

1247
00:58:33,039 --> 00:58:42,000
1 uh then we get guaranteed

1248
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:42,000
duplicate and of course if it's bigger

1249
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:50,680
also and the surprising thing is that

1250
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:53,359
probabilistically so this is for worst

1251
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:54,799
case Behavior I mean if I had n equals D

1252
00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:57,079
could be each of you has their own

1253
00:58:54,799 --> 00:59:00,920
birthday each person in their own

1254
00:58:57,079 --> 00:59:03,839
birthday uh pigeon hole um but that's

1255
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:05,720
very unlikely it turns out and we're

1256
00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:10,680
going to about to compute How likely it

1257
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:14,319
is so maybe we can do uh an

1258
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:16,559
experiment uh which is I'm going to see

1259
00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:17,920
whether anyone here has the same any two

1260
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:20,240
people have the same birthday if you're

1261
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:21,640
willing to raise your hand so please pay

1262
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:25,119
attention because I want to go through

1263
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:26,720
days really fast so let's start with

1264
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:29,839
August

1265
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:33,119
the most common month so okay among the

1266
00:59:29,839 --> 00:59:35,520
August people how many on August

1267
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:37,680
1 August

1268
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:43,119
2nd August

1269
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:45,039
3rd August 4th August 5th August

1270
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:46,880
6th August

1271
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:48,760
7th August

1272
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:55,440
8th August

1273
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:56,680
9 August 10 10 just one August 11 1

1274
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:59,400
August 12th

1275
00:59:56,680 --> 01:00:02,400
oh two all right August 11th two August

1276
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:05,160
11th yay we did it didn't even have to

1277
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:08,280
get through August it's because we have

1278
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:13,680
quite a few people here um I don't know

1279
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:13,680
maybe a 100 so uh turns

1280
01:00:14,359 --> 01:00:21,240
out for D equals 365 let's assume no

1281
01:00:18,119 --> 01:00:23,960
leap years uh

1282
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:26,839
if okay so we had like a 100 people I'm

1283
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:29,720
going to going to warm you up with 23

1284
01:00:26,839 --> 01:00:33,880
people 23 people is where the

1285
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:37,599
probability is just barely greater than

1286
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:38,960
50% that there's uh two people so big

1287
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:43,480
difference from

1288
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:46,079
365 uh n equal 30 the probability goes

1289
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:48,839
up to

1290
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:52,920
70% n equal

1291
01:00:48,839 --> 01:00:52,920
60 the probability goes up

1292
01:00:54,039 --> 01:00:57,920
to 97

1293
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:03,880
% oh

1294
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:03,880
99%

1295
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:13,359
99.4% okay very high uh n equals

1296
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:13,359
100 and he guesses how many

1297
01:01:13,559 --> 01:01:17,960
nines

1298
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:26,240
five

1299
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:26,240
six six nines a holy grail of 6 69 97%

1300
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:31,359
it's a lot of nines okay so uh the

1301
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:33,400
probability grows

1302
01:01:31,359 --> 01:01:36,640
exponentially uh but in particular this

1303
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:39,839
break even point is surprisingly low uh

1304
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:43,039
23 versus 365 it's a little bigger than

1305
01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:46,119
the square root it's like 1.2 time the

1306
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:50,280
square root of 365 is about

1307
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:53,839
23 uh so that's the surprise the Paradox

1308
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:53,839
let's compute it

1309
01:01:56,319 --> 01:02:00,359
it's actually similar to something we

1310
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:04,720
computed before in a combinatoric

1311
01:02:00,359 --> 01:02:07,599
setting which was the uh how many dollar

1312
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:09,279
bills where uh there are how many dollar

1313
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:12,240
bills are there where none of the digits

1314
01:02:09,279 --> 01:02:14,240
in the serial number uh were duplicate

1315
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:16,200
right so we computed that way back when

1316
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:19,000
I'm going to do a similar thing here

1317
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:21,400
similar trick uh let me first set up the

1318
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,400
sample

1319
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:27,839
space this is like coin flipping but

1320
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:31,000
more like rolling I suppose you have n

1321
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:33,400
people each of them rolls a desided die

1322
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:36,000
so that means the sample space is just

1323
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:39,079
the set of tpls uh do I want to call it

1324
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:40,839
D no let's call it B for birthday B1 up

1325
01:02:39,079 --> 01:02:42,839
to

1326
01:02:40,839 --> 01:02:47,200
BN uh

1327
01:02:42,839 --> 01:02:50,480
where each bi is between one and D let's

1328
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:53,599
say let's number our days one to D and

1329
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:53,599
this is a curly

1330
01:02:54,160 --> 01:03:01,240
brace uh the event that we care

1331
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:05,279
about is getting duplicate birthdays so

1332
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:07,960
this is uh so I'm going to call this s

1333
01:03:05,279 --> 01:03:09,960
so what we are interested in is uh the

1334
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:13,760
set of tupal

1335
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:18,640
birthdays where

1336
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:22,039
um there are some two indices I and J

1337
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:24,400
where b i equals

1338
01:03:22,039 --> 01:03:27,760
BJ right that's the duplicate birthday

1339
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:27,760
that's the Birthday Twins

1340
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:32,680
this happens with high probability and

1341
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:35,640
is very annoying to compute the

1342
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:38,599
probability of uh but there's this one

1343
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:41,000
trick which you may recall from the uh

1344
01:03:38,599 --> 01:03:43,839
when we were looking at serial numbers

1345
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:47,640
on dollar bills let's think about the

1346
01:03:43,839 --> 01:03:51,520
complement event so if we look at e

1347
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:52,799
bar this is the set of birthday tupal

1348
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:55,839
where there are no

1349
01:03:52,799 --> 01:03:59,000
duplicates that's easier to figure out

1350
01:03:55,839 --> 01:04:03,079
so we want to say for all I not equal to

1351
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:06,160
J bi does not equal

1352
01:04:03,079 --> 01:04:08,559
BJ okay this is easier to think about as

1353
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:11,400
a process if we think of this going back

1354
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:12,680
to like generalized product rule uh how

1355
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:15,039
we want to know how many different ways

1356
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:17,160
are there to do this where the first

1357
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:19,599
birthday that I choose it could be

1358
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:20,839
anyone I don't care there's D different

1359
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:24,599
possibilities for the birth first

1360
01:04:20,839 --> 01:04:26,839
birthday that I choose then uh the next

1361
01:04:24,599 --> 01:04:29,240
birthday I choose there's D minus one

1362
01:04:26,839 --> 01:04:31,880
options if I want to avoid

1363
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:34,440
duplication okay then the next birthday

1364
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:36,079
there's D minus two options hope play

1365
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:38,520
this is old hat by now you're used to

1366
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:39,880
generalized product rule and uh hard

1367
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:42,640
part is knowing when to stop this is

1368
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:47,200
going to be D

1369
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:51,520
minus n + one I think should be the

1370
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:55,880
right sure yeah this is

1371
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:55,880
generalized product rule

1372
01:04:56,640 --> 01:05:02,599
this is the number of

1373
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:05,119
ways and we're assuming that each Tuple

1374
01:05:02,599 --> 01:05:06,920
of birthdays is equally likely this was

1375
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:08,200
our assumption everything is independent

1376
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:10,359
and

1377
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:11,880
uniform uh so what we need to do is take

1378
01:05:10,359 --> 01:05:13,640
the number of ways this happens and

1379
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:16,799
divide it by the entire size of the

1380
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:18,640
sample space divide it by the size of s

1381
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:20,559
okay so I'm going to divide

1382
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:23,640
this

1383
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:27,039
by uh and this is going to give me the

1384
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:29,839
probability of e bar

1385
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:32,559
here the probability of getting no

1386
01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:34,200
duplicate birthdays is the number of

1387
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:35,720
ways to get no duplicate birthdays

1388
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:40,279
divided by the number of different ways

1389
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:40,279
to get birthdays period and that is

1390
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:47,480
just this is the non-generalized product

1391
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:47,480
role how many what is the size of s

1392
01:05:52,599 --> 01:05:57,799
here yeah D to the N thank you it's

1393
01:05:56,359 --> 01:05:59,520
either n to the D or D to the N you got

1394
01:05:57,799 --> 01:06:01,720
to think for a while it's like yeah D to

1395
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:03,920
the N there's D ways for this D ways for

1396
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:08,319
this D ways so it's just the product of

1397
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:12,720
n D's the product of D * D * d n * so

1398
01:06:08,319 --> 01:06:15,839
I'm going to write that as D * D * D

1399
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:19,359
times uh D there's exactly n terms

1400
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:23,880
upstairs and there's also n terms

1401
01:06:19,359 --> 01:06:27,240
downstairs okay so now I have this

1402
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:29,760
crazy ratio between into products I just

1403
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:34,000
just need to compute it okay this is a

1404
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:35,960
bit annoying um but one big Insight so

1405
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:39,640
this thing is equal

1406
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:42,279
to uh instead of taking this product and

1407
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:45,599
this product separately and dividing

1408
01:06:42,279 --> 01:06:47,480
them I could instead take this ratio and

1409
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:50,680
multiply it by this ratio and multiply

1410
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:53,000
it by this ratio and so on right that's

1411
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:55,799
that's why I wrote out this D to the n

1412
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:57,839
as a bunch of D's so I could take them

1413
01:06:55,799 --> 01:07:03,880
uh element by element so this is going

1414
01:06:57,839 --> 01:07:05,760
to be equal to the product from IAL 1 to

1415
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:09,839
d

1416
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:09,839
d uh of n

1417
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:16,880
sorry there's n different terms each of

1418
01:07:12,799 --> 01:07:18,799
them is of the form D minus I over D and

1419
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:22,720
I have an index error so I need to start

1420
01:07:18,799 --> 01:07:25,079
at zero and end at n minus

1421
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:27,200
one okay that will give me the right

1422
01:07:25,079 --> 01:07:29,720
thing on top top I start with D minus 0

1423
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:33,240
I end with d minus

1424
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:34,400
nus1 okay so this ugly formula actually

1425
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:37,680
gets pretty

1426
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:42,119
clean okay now is when uh it's hard to

1427
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:43,920
evaluate but there's this great fact uh

1428
01:07:42,119 --> 01:07:47,960
okay so first I'm going to rewrite this

1429
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:47,960
as uh

1430
01:07:48,319 --> 01:07:56,880
product as one this D over D is one and

1431
01:07:52,760 --> 01:08:01,599
then we have an i over d in the second

1432
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:07,680
half okay this um turns out to be nice

1433
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:10,720
because uh one - x is less than e to the

1434
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:13,240
minus x e here is Oilers

1435
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:16,440
constant two

1436
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:18,440
roughly and a little bigger than two and

1437
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:20,319
uh if you look at the tailor expansion

1438
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:22,600
of e to the minus X which is something

1439
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:25,080
you may know from calculus it starts

1440
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:27,199
with 1 - x and it's like plus x^2 - x

1441
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:31,400
cub whatever maybe some denominators

1442
01:08:27,199 --> 01:08:35,839
there too but 1 - x is actually um well

1443
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:39,719
approximated by eus x uh and it so it's

1444
01:08:35,839 --> 01:08:42,080
approximately equal for X

1445
01:08:39,719 --> 01:08:44,239
small and if you think about what x is

1446
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:46,799
here uh it's a probability it's less

1447
01:08:44,239 --> 01:08:48,480
than one so that's pretty small and so

1448
01:08:46,799 --> 01:08:50,279
this will actually be a pretty good

1449
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:53,000
approximation we're going to replace 1 -

1450
01:08:50,279 --> 01:08:57,440
x with eus X and then this product will

1451
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:57,440
be easy to evaluate easier

1452
01:08:58,239 --> 01:09:05,679
so this going to be

1453
01:09:00,199 --> 01:09:05,679
e to the minus I over

1454
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:12,560
D

1455
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:15,359
okay uh sorry not equal this is going to

1456
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:17,080
be less than so it's a good

1457
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:19,799
approximation when X is small but it's

1458
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:22,560
always less than because the next term

1459
01:09:19,799 --> 01:09:24,799
is positive at least for x non-

1460
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:27,679
negative it's going to be less than and

1461
01:09:24,799 --> 01:09:29,239
so if we get an upper bound remember uh

1462
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:32,199
we're evaluating here the probability of

1463
01:09:29,239 --> 01:09:34,279
ebar ebar is like our error case the bad

1464
01:09:32,199 --> 01:09:35,920
case we want to show is unlikely so if

1465
01:09:34,279 --> 01:09:37,480
we can upper bound the probability of

1466
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:39,920
the bad thing happening that gives us a

1467
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:44,120
lower bound on the good thing happening

1468
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:44,120
uh good thing being uh Birthday

1469
01:09:45,799 --> 01:09:49,400
Twins okay we're almost

1470
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:55,920
done with briday

1471
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:58,840
Paradox so uh the cool thing here is we

1472
01:09:55,920 --> 01:10:01,920
have a product of

1473
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:05,320
exponentials you may recall that if you

1474
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:10,239
have I don't know e to the X time e to

1475
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:13,199
the Y this is equal to e to x +

1476
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:15,040
y right so if we're this is taking a

1477
01:10:13,199 --> 01:10:17,280
product of two exponentials is the

1478
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:19,840
exponential of the sum and more

1479
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:22,239
generally if you take n the product of n

1480
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:24,600
exponentials that will be the same as

1481
01:10:22,239 --> 01:10:29,320
the exponential of the sum of those N

1482
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:32,960
Things so this is equal to e to the

1483
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:37,199
sum I didn't leave myself in a room e to

1484
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:39,880
the sum i = 0 to n minus

1485
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:42,679
one

1486
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:45,199
ofus I overd I

1487
01:10:42,679 --> 01:10:47,760
guess maybe I should put the minus out

1488
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:47,760
here it's a little

1489
01:10:51,159 --> 01:11:00,280
cleaner okay uh and I can

1490
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:00,280
parenthesize like

1491
01:11:00,679 --> 01:11:06,920
this over

1492
01:11:03,719 --> 01:11:09,440
D because this D does not depend on I so

1493
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:11,679
the sum of I over D is the of is the

1494
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:15,520
same as the sum of I all over D I've

1495
01:11:11,679 --> 01:11:17,920
still got this minus F front and this is

1496
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:20,239
our good friend arithmetic sum the

1497
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:22,400
Triangular numbers it's indexed a little

1498
01:11:20,239 --> 01:11:26,679
funny usually we think one up to n which

1499
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:28,719
is n * n plus 1 over two uh this is 0 up

1500
01:11:26,679 --> 01:11:31,199
to n minus one zero of course doesn't

1501
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:35,920
matter uh so it's really one up to n

1502
01:11:31,199 --> 01:11:39,159
minus one so this is going to be e to

1503
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:40,920
Theus uh n * n

1504
01:11:39,159 --> 01:11:43,639
-1/

1505
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:46,080
2 and then the whole thing's over D so

1506
01:11:43,639 --> 01:11:48,040
we end up with a D in the

1507
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:49,920
denominator okay so this was the

1508
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:52,960
probability that there are no duplicate

1509
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:55,320
birthday and you can see uh it goes down

1510
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:59,600
exponentially this is remember e to the

1511
01:11:55,320 --> 01:12:02,639
X is one e to the minus X is 1 over e to

1512
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:05,679
the X

1513
01:12:02,639 --> 01:12:08,719
so so the denominator here is increasing

1514
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:11,920
exponentially as we increase

1515
01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:14,600
n and the big thing is and so that's why

1516
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:16,719
you get so many nines very quickly out

1517
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:19,400
here but if we're interested in this

1518
01:12:16,719 --> 01:12:20,760
crossover point where we get 50/50

1519
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:24,080
chance that there's a duplicate birthday

1520
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:26,040
versus not which is interesting the big

1521
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:28,639
thing that matters is that we have n squ

1522
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:31,639
up here there's a minus n but the big

1523
01:12:28,639 --> 01:12:32,480
part is n s and this if we invert it

1524
01:12:31,639 --> 01:12:36,560
this is where we're going to get a

1525
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:39,280
square root Behavior so uh let's

1526
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:42,280
suppose uh that this

1527
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:45,560
probability is equal to a half or

1528
01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:48,000
roughly equal to a half when does that

1529
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:49,360
happen uh we did some approximation here

1530
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:53,120
with this less than so this isn't going

1531
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:55,719
to be exactly right but it's close uh we

1532
01:12:53,120 --> 01:13:00,920
want this exponential

1533
01:12:55,719 --> 01:13:05,000
to equal two right so we want e to the N

1534
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:07,159
nus1 over 2D sorry move the E down here

1535
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:10,760
this is all in the

1536
01:13:07,159 --> 01:13:12,960
exponent we want this to be equal to two

1537
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:16,320
that's when one over it will equal a

1538
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:19,120
half okay so we take logs of both sides

1539
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:23,199
that's like n * nus1 over

1540
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:27,480
2D equals lwn 2 natural

1541
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:28,760
log uh so we maybe move this over we get

1542
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:30,800
n *

1543
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:34,920
nus1 =

1544
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:36,239
2D L 2 and at this point I'm going to

1545
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:39,040
wave my hands a little bit and say this

1546
01:13:36,239 --> 01:13:40,560
minus one doesn't matter too much and so

1547
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:43,760
basically this is a square root so it's

1548
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:48,639
going to be n is roughly the square root

1549
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:50,639
of 2D lwn 2 and so there's this there's

1550
01:13:48,639 --> 01:13:56,920
this constant term which is square < TK

1551
01:13:50,639 --> 01:13:56,920
of 2 L 2 this is about 1.1

1552
01:13:58,199 --> 01:14:04,880
77 so this is about

1553
01:14:01,239 --> 01:14:07,239
1.2 to the square root of D this is what

1554
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:10,280
I claimed before if you take 1.2 * the

1555
01:14:07,239 --> 01:14:13,679
sare OT of 365 you get approximately

1556
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:17,719
23 if you compute it exactly you get

1557
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:19,600
23 so kind of neat uh in general if you

1558
01:14:17,719 --> 01:14:22,400
have D days you need about square root

1559
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:24,679
of D people to get a duplicate this has

1560
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:25,679
all sorts of implications in computer

1561
01:14:24,679 --> 01:14:28,320
science

1562
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:30,080
usually in the context of hash tables if

1563
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:33,679
you're trying to if you're randomly

1564
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:36,719
placing people into uh locations pigeon

1565
01:14:33,679 --> 01:14:38,520
holes I suppose uh it's once you have

1566
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:39,840
square root of n or square root of D

1567
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:44,000
different people you're likely to get

1568
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:45,480
two that happen to cohabitate unless uh

1569
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:48,440
you know if you choose them

1570
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:51,120
uniformly uh so for example if

1571
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:53,080
you're if you're a cryptographer and

1572
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:55,760
you're signing your

1573
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:57,520
emails uh you would

1574
01:14:55,760 --> 01:15:00,239
you want to guarantee that you don't

1575
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:03,080
have uh two emails that have the same

1576
01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:04,360
signature because if you did uh someone

1577
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:05,960
who's receiving them and checking the

1578
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:08,520
signatures can't distinguish between the

1579
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:10,400
two emails so that tells you You' like

1580
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:13,320
the set of possible signatures on your

1581
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:14,719
emails to be at least the square of the

1582
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:16,600
number of possible emails you could

1583
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:19,159
write so this gives you a lower bound on

1584
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:21,480
how big cryptographic signatures need to

1585
01:15:19,159 --> 01:15:22,880
be in order to be safe just in terms of

1586
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:25,560
whether they're

1587
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:27,199
duplications uh or your

1588
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:29,080
Dropbox and you're trying to sync files

1589
01:15:27,199 --> 01:15:33,560
from one computer to another and you

1590
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:35,120
want to compute some hash on the files

1591
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:36,760
on both sides to see do I need to

1592
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:39,400
retransfer this file did it change on

1593
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:41,120
either side it better be that the space

1594
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:42,760
of possible hashes is at least the

1595
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:45,040
square of the number of possible files

1596
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:47,000
otherwise uh you're going to get

1597
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:49,080
accidental uh hash

1598
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:51,560
matches all

1599
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:53,080
right a little more time so let me tell

1600
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:57,880
you about

1601
01:15:53,080 --> 01:16:00,800
one uh independent concept um not

1602
01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:03,560
particularly related to Independence but

1603
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:05,679
related to conditional

1604
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:09,199
probability which

1605
01:16:05,679 --> 01:16:09,199
is gambler's

1606
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:24,000
fallacy gambler's fallacy is it can be

1607
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:25,080
phrased many ways uh but let's talk

1608
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,400
about coins because that's that's what

1609
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:31,480
we're doing uh let's

1610
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:31,480
say you do 10 coin

1611
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:36,040
flips and they all come out

1612
01:16:38,639 --> 01:16:43,040
heads and I want to

1613
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:45,880
know what's the

1614
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:50,480
probability that the next coin

1615
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:50,480
flip is also heads

1616
01:16:56,800 --> 01:17:02,440
what's the

1617
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:06,040
answer uh sorry Fair coin I should

1618
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:07,480
say give you a Fair coin each flip is

1619
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:09,880
independent from the other

1620
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:12,280
flips what are the chances that the 11th

1621
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:16,040
flip is

1622
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:19,719
heads a half I should hope

1623
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:22,960
so uh if you're a

1624
01:17:19,719 --> 01:17:26,360
probabilist or if you're a student in

1625
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:28,600
61200 uh the answer is one

1626
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:32,159
half if you're a

1627
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:33,760
gambler probably an addicted Gambler I

1628
01:17:32,159 --> 01:17:37,040
mean this is a statement

1629
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:38,800
about human psychology who knows they

1630
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:42,480
say

1631
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:44,040
uh less than a half because I'm due for

1632
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:46,520
a tals don't you

1633
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:48,639
think right you imagine they imagine

1634
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:50,440
that uh hyp hypothetical Gambler

1635
01:17:48,639 --> 01:17:52,159
imagines that the coin has memory it

1636
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:54,159
remembers all those heads it got and

1637
01:17:52,159 --> 01:17:57,280
when you flip it the next time now

1638
01:17:54,159 --> 01:18:00,120
finally it's going to be tals but no

1639
01:17:57,280 --> 01:18:02,000
probability is actually a half Gambler

1640
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:04,000
the F this this is something that's

1641
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:05,920
actually false Gambler believes oh

1642
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:07,840
finally I'm due for taals very unlikely

1643
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:09,400
that the next coin is Tails you know I

1644
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:11,280
haven't seen an earthquake in the last

1645
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:14,159
100 years very unlikely I'll see one

1646
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:16,719
this year I mean that may be true but it

1647
01:18:14,159 --> 01:18:18,440
also may not be true depends on your

1648
01:18:16,719 --> 01:18:21,000
prior probabilities about earthquake

1649
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:23,199
models all right uh and if I tell you

1650
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:25,000
it's a fair coin then you know it's not

1651
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:27,080
true it has to be exactly a half every

1652
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,520
single time it's actually pretty likely

1653
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:30,159
to get a bunch of heads in a row now

1654
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:32,480
it's not that likely to get 10 coin

1655
01:18:30,159 --> 01:18:36,080
flips in a row that's one in a thousand

1656
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:38,320
roughly um so probabilist just just says

1657
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:42,159
wow one in a thousand cool well probably

1658
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:46,080
the next one is a half okay uh there's a

1659
01:18:42,159 --> 01:18:49,199
third type of person which I'll call the

1660
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:51,600
basian and they would say uh maybe it's

1661
01:18:49,199 --> 01:18:53,760
bigger than a half maybe you lied to me

1662
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:55,800
and the coin is not fair that's the

1663
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:58,000
other interpretation and if this if you

1664
01:18:55,800 --> 01:19:00,560
if you flipped a coin 10 coin 10 flips

1665
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:03,920
maybe it's not enough but 11 or 12 then

1666
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:05,280
you start thinking hm I think there's

1667
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:06,440
something weird about this coin then you

1668
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:09,560
want to inspect the coin see if it's

1669
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:11,239
heads on both sides or whatever so uh

1670
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:13,600
you can formalize this a little bit

1671
01:19:11,239 --> 01:19:16,679
using the law of total probability

1672
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:18,440
combined with Bas rule uh in the

1673
01:19:16,679 --> 01:19:20,360
following

1674
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:23,040
way I'm going to write this a little

1675
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:25,920
informally but uh the probability of a

1676
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:28,560
head conditioned on getting 10 heads

1677
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:31,639
previously you can split it into two

1678
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:33,760
parts and say uh I'm just going to think

1679
01:19:31,639 --> 01:19:36,960
of a simple model either the coin is

1680
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:38,800
really fair or you're cheater and the

1681
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:40,199
coin is heads on both sides those are

1682
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:41,880
the only two possibilities for this

1683
01:19:40,199 --> 01:19:43,199
model of course you could consider a

1684
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:46,320
more General model and there's a whole

1685
01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:46,320
world about

1686
01:19:48,639 --> 01:19:52,800
this so

1687
01:19:53,199 --> 01:19:57,960
uh I'm going to call these two scenarios

1688
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:01,639
cheat and

1689
01:19:57,960 --> 01:20:03,320
fair and hopefully this equation is

1690
01:20:01,639 --> 01:20:08,239
relatively

1691
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:08,239
uh obvious just it's a

1692
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:17,679
mouthful okay everything here is

1693
01:20:15,159 --> 01:20:19,480
conditioned on H to the 10 so you can

1694
01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:21,560
kind of ignore that part because that's

1695
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:24,199
we're assuming throughout that we have

1696
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:26,280
10 coin flips starting as heads okay and

1697
01:20:24,199 --> 01:20:27,880
now two scenarios it could be your

1698
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:30,880
cheating or it could be your fair and

1699
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:33,679
these are disjoint scenarios uh so I can

1700
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:35,199
split things up according to law of

1701
01:20:33,679 --> 01:20:38,199
total probability is the probability of

1702
01:20:35,199 --> 01:20:41,320
cheat times uh the same thing

1703
01:20:38,199 --> 01:20:43,159
conditioned on cheating in addition or

1704
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:45,400
probability of Fair times the

1705
01:20:43,159 --> 01:20:47,199
probability of the same thing

1706
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:48,840
conditioning on Fair in addition to what

1707
01:20:47,199 --> 01:20:50,880
I conditioned on before so everything's

1708
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:53,639
conditioned on H 10 so you can write

1709
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:55,320
this out and we actually know what these

1710
01:20:53,639 --> 01:20:57,400
are they look ugly

1711
01:20:55,320 --> 01:21:00,679
the probability of heads with a cheating

1712
01:20:57,400 --> 01:21:03,639
coin that is heads on both sides that's

1713
01:21:00,679 --> 01:21:05,520
one okay so it's one times the

1714
01:21:03,639 --> 01:21:08,159
probability of

1715
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:10,880
cheating of there being a cheat here uh

1716
01:21:08,159 --> 01:21:13,199
given H to the 10

1717
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:14,960
plus this probability probability of

1718
01:21:13,199 --> 01:21:16,159
heads on with a Fair coin that we know

1719
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:20,440
is a

1720
01:21:16,159 --> 01:21:23,960
half times probability of you're using a

1721
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:26,480
Fair coin given that I've seen 10 heads

1722
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:28,639
now these two coin quantities that's you

1723
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:30,800
need more modeling to understand what it

1724
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:34,239
what the chances are to that I'm using a

1725
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:37,159
cheating coin uh given that I saw H 10

1726
01:21:34,239 --> 01:21:38,760
heads but you can compute it and so now

1727
01:21:37,159 --> 01:21:40,679
you can actually quantify how much

1728
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:43,080
bigger than a half in this particular

1729
01:21:40,679 --> 01:21:46,400
model of cheating uh what's the chances

1730
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:49,199
that the next coin flip will be hits but

1731
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:54,199
so fun example and that's all for

1732
01:21:49,199 --> 01:21:54,199
today enjoy your Independence Day
