00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,760
with a blue and black robot about the

00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:35,879
the robot was a remotely operated

to collect water samples from beneath a

17
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,399
working and its intake line was clogged

Rick Shaws in Bahar India the thread

73
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,360
that runs through hitz's projects is

74
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,120
user- centered design that creates a

75
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:51,040
more Equitable Society in the transition

76
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,959
to sustainable energy we want our

77
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,920
technology to adapt to the society that

78
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,959
we live in they said something I've

79
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,800
learned from the dlab projects and also

80
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,080
from the ROV project is that when you're

81
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,959
an engineer you need to understand the

82
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,000
societal and political implications of

83
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,159
your work because all of that should get

84
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,760
factored into the design Horowitz

85
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:10,879
describes their personal mission as

86
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:13,000
creating Systems and Technology that

87
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,120
serve the well-being and longevity of

88
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,200
communities and the ecosystems We Exist

89
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,959
within I want to relate mechanical

90
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,959
engineering to sustainability and

91
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,480
environmental justice they said

92
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,040
Engineers need to think about how

93
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,040
technology fits into the greater

94
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,400
societal context of people in the

95
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:30,480
environment we want our technology to

96
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,280
adapt to the society we live in and for

97
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,040
people to be able based on their needs

98
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,879
to interface with the

99
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:39,480
technology imagination and

100
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:42,080
inspiration in dicks Hills New York a

therapist the family hike together but

104
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:51,040
horo doesn't tie their love for the

105
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:53,280
natural world to any one experience I

106
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,239
like to play in the dirt they said I've

107
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,680
always had a connection to Nature it was

108
00:03:55,239 --> 00:04:00,040
a kind of childlike Wonder seeing

109
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,760
footage of the massive 2010 oil SP in

110
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,680
the Gulf of Mexico caused by an

111
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,760
explosion on the deep water Horizon oil

112
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,280
rig which occurred when Horowitz was

113
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,360
around 10 was a jarring introduction to

114
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,799
how human activity can impact the health

115
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:15,599
of the planet their first interest was

116
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:18,440
art painting and drawing portraits album

117
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:20,199
covers and more recently digital images

118
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:22,120
such as a figure watering a house plant

119
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:24,880
at a window while lightning flashes

120
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:28,080
outside a neon pink jellyfish in a deep

121
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,680
blue sea and for an MIT wide Co

122
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,800
quarantine project two figures washing

123
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,160
the sunset over a Greenline subway

124
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,080
platform art dovetailed into a

125
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,680
fascination with architecture then

126
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:41,639
shifted to engineering in high school

127
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,120
Horowitz and a friend were co- captains

128
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:45,720
of an all girls robotics team it was

129
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,680
just really wonderful having this

130
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,840
community and being able to build stuff

131
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,440
they said Horowitz and another friend on

132
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,280
the team learned they were accepted to

133
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:57,120
MIT on Pi Day

134
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:59,960
2018 art architecture engineering it's

135
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,000
all kind of the same horo said I like

136
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:04,199
the creative aspect of design being able

137
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
to create things out of

138
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:10,080
imagination sustaining political

139
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,600
awareness at MIT horo connected with a

140
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,400
like-minded community of makers they

141
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,880
also launched themselves into taking

142
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,960
action against environmental Injustice

143
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,960
in 2022 through the student

144
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,240
sustainability Coalition SSC they

145
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,919
encouraged MIT students to get involved

146
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,520
in advocating for the Cambridge Green

147
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,240
New Deal legislation aimed at reducing

148
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:33,120
emissions from new large commercial

149
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,800
buildings such as those owned by MIT and

150
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:39,000
creating a green jobs training program

151
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:41,319
in February 2022 horis took part in a

152
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,039
sit in in building 3 as part of MIT

153
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:46,319
divest a student-led initiative urging

154
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:48,759
the MIT Administration to divest his

155
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:50,720
endowment of fossil fuel companies I

156
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:52,199
want to see MIT students more locally

157
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,319
involved in politics around

158
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:56,639
sustainability not just the technology

159
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:58,960
side Horwitz said I think there's a lot

160
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,639
of power from students coming together

161
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:04,319
they could be really

162
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:06,520
influential user oriented design the

163
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,280
Arctic underwater ROV had to be

164
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:11,639
waterproof and with stand water

165
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:14,840
temperatures as low as 5° f it was

166
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:17,560
Tethered to a computer by a 150 M long

167
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:19,880
cable that had to spool and unspool

168
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,800
without tangling the pump and tubing

169
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,400
that collected water samples had to work

170
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,919
without kinking it was cool throughout

171
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,520
the project to think okay what kind of

172
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:29,960
needs will these scientists have when

173
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,840
they're out in these really harsh

174
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,440
conditions in the Arctic how can I make

175
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,960
a machine that will make their field

176
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,000
work easier I really like being able to

177
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,639
design things directly with the users

178
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,120
working within their design constraints

179
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:45,039
they said inevitably snafus occurred but

180
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,840
in photos and videos taken the day of

181
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:50,280
the F of field tests Horowitz is smiling

182
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,960
here's a fun unexpected or maybe quite

183
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:54,919
expected occurrence they reported later

184
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,720
the plastic mount for the shaft collar

185
00:06:54,919 --> 00:06:59,680
used in the motor's power transmission

186
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,280
