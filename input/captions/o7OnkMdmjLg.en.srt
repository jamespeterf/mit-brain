1
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:22,080
So today we'll be uh talking about the

2
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:25,920
portfolio management as one of the

3
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:29,760
application lectures. Um so I will share

4
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:32,320
some of my uh research work uh from a

5
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,120
practitioner's point of view. So rather

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:38,079
one rather than from pure theoretical or

7
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:41,040
mass point of view. So as we mentioned

8
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:43,840
at the beginning of the term uh we've

9
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:49,120
been uh teaching this class since uh

10
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:53,039
2012 and in 2013 this class was recorded

11
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:56,879
uh for MIT open courseware. Uh the link

12
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,760
I put it here is uh the lecture from

13
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:02,239
2013. Uh some of you may have watched

14
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,519
that lecture. It was actually turned out

15
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:07,520
to be one of the top most viewed uh uh

16
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,880
courses. Our course is one of the top

17
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:13,520
five actually on open courseware. Uh so

18
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,479
I want to promise you uh in today's

19
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:22,159
lecture I will give you a lot of new

20
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:24,080
content. uh so you you will uh make your

21
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,960
you know showing up the presence here

22
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:29,759
worthwhile so we can also make it uh

23
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,560
interactive.

24
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:35,360
So this is the outline of what I will be

25
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:38,159
uh talking about today. So first I'll

26
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,240
talk about what is really all this uh

27
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,040
portfolio construction is about coming

28
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:46,079
from very basic level then I'll talk

29
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:49,600
about what is the endowment model how do

30
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:52,159
we manage a endowment fund then I'll

31
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,560
talk about the portfolio theory and

32
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:57,040
illustrate in some really special and

33
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:01,520
simple cases for you to understand the

34
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:04,399
math then I will really switch gear and

35
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,799
talk about the limitations of these

36
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:10,080
theory right the theory was proposed in

37
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:12,560
the 1950s I mean of course a lot of

38
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,760
people have worked in the field try to

39
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:19,680
overcome the shortcomings of these

40
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,280
theories so I myself has been uh

41
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,720
spending a lot of time thinking about

42
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,599
these problems so I will talk about my

43
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,000
own research work uh in terms of how to

44
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:33,680
improve uh the portfolio construction

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
theory for example how to improve the

46
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:40,000
risk measurement using volatility and

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,800
sharp ratio and to and how to model uh

48
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,840
crowding behavior and also you probably

49
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:49,440
heard the power law also power law uh

50
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:52,319
how this behavior actually originated uh

51
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,879
from the crowding behavior. Now I will

52
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:58,080
summarize.

53
00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:00,319
So before we start the lecture uh I want

54
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,760
to do an exercise with all of you. I'm

55
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:06,319
going to hand over a piece of paper to

56
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,000
all of you. Yeah, please pass it down.

57
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:12,159
Make sure everyone gets one piece of

58
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:16,560
paper. What I want you to do is to write

59
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:20,080
down your own investment portfolio.

60
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:23,599
Just hypothetically think about you have

61
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:26,800
$10,000 to manage

62
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:29,760
and uh put down investments you like to

63
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:32,640
have in the portfolio. put down the

64
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:36,159
percentage of each investment.

65
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:39,599
And uh I also want you not to think too

66
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:42,080
hard and also too long on this. Just use

67
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:44,080
your intuition. Imagine you are now a

68
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,440
fund manager, right? Sitting at a

69
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,920
pension fund or endowment fund or hedge

70
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:54,239
fund, right? Just ask you to pick a few

71
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:57,200
investment and uh then just hand it back

72
00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:00,720
to me. uh after you finish then we will

73
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:04,599
talk about from where you started how to

74
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,599
do the portfolio management.

75
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:11,840
So just spend a couple minutes don't

76
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:15,599
overspend your time. So why I'm talking

77
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:18,639
so you can write down your choices.

78
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:21,759
So when you receive that blank sheet of

79
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:24,080
paper so you must be thinking what are

80
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,479
the criteria for me to do this right?

81
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:30,000
what are the considerations?

82
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:32,800
So this is exactly I want to lead you

83
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,080
into how to think about these problems.

84
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,840
First of all you need to think about

85
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,040
what's the objective of doing this

86
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,800
exercise right? So always say oh I want

87
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,520
to get a great return for the

88
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,000
investment. Sure. So you have a return

89
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:51,120
objective but is that what is the great

90
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,040
return? Is that 10% 50% or 100%.

91
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,560
What is the time horizon we're are

92
00:04:53,040 --> 00:05:00,000
talking about, right? And because

93
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:02,479
investment is highly uncertain,

94
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,759
what's your loss tolerance, right? You

95
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:10,240
think about you have $10,000, how much

96
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:12,639
can you afford to lose, right? So that

97
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,800
those are the questions. Then when you

98
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,800
pick those investments, you should also

99
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,120
ask yourself

100
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,919
what's your own ability of picking a

101
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:25,199
winner, right? Why do you think you have

102
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:27,280
an edge in predicting that market or

103
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,440
investment?

104
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,520
Then of course, how many investments you

105
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:37,840
should have in the portfolio? Is that

106
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:42,080
one, five or 50 or 100? Right? how

107
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:45,440
diversified or how well mixed that

108
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,440
investment portfolio should be. Right?

109
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,720
Then ultimately the most important

110
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:53,120
question is how do you size each of the

111
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:56,240
investment?

112
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:59,039
It comes all down to sizing. Okay. So

113
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:02,160
portfolio construction I will show you

114
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:05,120
later. It's really about when you have a

115
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:09,280
list of investment you like, how do you

116
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:11,840
size them accordingly in rel you know

117
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,319
relative amounts to each other to the

118
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,840
whole portfolio. So now please hand it

119
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:19,199
back

120
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:21,919
uh because uh you I I want you to listen

121
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:25,880
to me not uh just spending the time on

122
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,880
writing down your portfolio.

123
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:32,880
Okay. Uh you can uh it's your choice.

124
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,120
Name or no name is fine. Yes, I'm I'm

125
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,440
not going to call you names but I will

126
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,560
probably use some of uh your answers as

127
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:43,440
examples uh to talk about uh

128
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:47,919
investments.

129
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:51,840
So uh as we are collecting uh these uh

130
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:56,479
uh uh portfolio choices

131
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:59,360
so I'm also uh going to talk about in

132
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:01,280
your decision making process.

133
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,199
So when you choose investments, you

134
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,160
probably were thinking about what

135
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:10,639
markets right first of all you will be

136
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:12,880
selecting your investments from and uh

137
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,880
what are the instruments?

138
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,880
>> So

139
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:23,520
are we mostly finished? Uh so by the way

140
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,759
uh for you uh we are doing an exercise.

141
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,840
We ask you to put down uh your

142
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:31,520
investment portfolio. just put on the

143
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:37,560
percentage whatever you can do. Okay. Um

144
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:37,560
so anyway um you're done. Okay.

145
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,080
Okay. Uh for the rest of you if you want

146
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,919
to take a longer time that's fine. I'm

147
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:48,560
just going to use some of the examples.

148
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:50,319
Okay. So uh the decision making process

149
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,880
I was talking about you need to decide

150
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,639
which market to pick your investment.

151
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,800
Then you need to think about what data

152
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,440
to collect right? what kind of signals

153
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,599
you can derive and what the models you

154
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,840
need to build, what factors you need to

155
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:05,840
take into consideration,

156
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,160
what predictions you need to make,

157
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,960
right? Then assemble them into

158
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,199
strategies, then we're talking about

159
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,599
sizing and allocate your capital

160
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:18,319
portfolio construction, then optimize

161
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:20,000
it. Then at the end really to manage the

162
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,759
risk.

163
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,720
So

164
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:27,039
now you can see what we really come down

165
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,120
to is how to compare different

166
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:31,520
investments to understand the

167
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,919
relationship between different

168
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,240
investments is to understand the return

169
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:40,320
and risk profiles of all the

170
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:42,240
investments. So what is risk? So in the

171
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,600
in this chart we are talking about here

172
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:48,800
I'm using volatility for the time being

173
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:53,920
which uh represents uncertainty right of

174
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:56,399
the outcome. Um later on I will kind of

175
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:59,120
come back and is telling you volatility

176
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:02,560
is not really the best measure for risk.

177
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:05,040
Uh but let's save that for later. But

178
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,360
before we talk about the investment

179
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:11,279
choices, let me look at some of uh what

180
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:13,760
you uh have written down. So one

181
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:17,360
portfolio here has

182
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:20,160
uh half in S&P

183
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:25,519
uh straddle. So this is actually option

184
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:30,000
strategy and uh then 30% in VIX related

185
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:34,160
ETFs then 20% in uh dollar index

186
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,399
futures. So sounds like someone has uh

187
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,320
done an internship somewhere knowing

188
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,160
option strategies.

189
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,920
Uh

190
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:47,200
so this portfolio has about uh eight

191
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:52,399
investments. The largest one in it is

192
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:56,440
cash 20% and uh 20% in QQQ which is

193
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,440
NASDAQ uh ETF.

194
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:04,399
Let me see.

195
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:07,360
This one is uh 70% bonds, 30% stocks.

196
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:10,320
This one is quite interesting because

197
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:14,640
when we normally talk about 60 40 or

198
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:16,720
7030 portfolio, the

199
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:20,640
the bigger piece tends to be the equity

200
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:24,079
piece. Uh but this one probably has more

201
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:28,000
uh risk neutral or risk uh parody type

202
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:31,279
of construction. So we'll get to that.

203
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:35,600
Uh this has many single name stocks.

204
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:40,000
Microsoft being on the top and uh this

205
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:43,680
is a 50% S&P 50% Vanguard

206
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,160
Pale uh fund. Uh

207
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,880
probably that's what is written. And

208
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:51,760
this one 100% S&P.

209
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:57,160
Yeah. Very uh much representing the

210
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:57,160
average market. And uh

211
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:04,320
so this one probably

212
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:09,839
has five stocks, 20% cash. Yeah. 50% US

213
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:13,279
Treasury bonds, 25% S&P. Okay. So fairly

214
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:15,920
uh similar. So now you got the idea. uh

215
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:18,800
and Peter and I used to uh kind of

216
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:22,000
reveal uh over the years year-to-year

217
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:25,600
change of the investment selection only

218
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:29,120
three years ago in 2021

219
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:31,519
most of the class chose some

220
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,560
crypto currencies

221
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:36,880
and uh dogecoins being the top one being

222
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,720
selected by everyone. I haven't seen any

223
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,640
crypto

224
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:44,720
investments today. So that just tells

225
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:47,519
you the index investing ETF seems to be

226
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,959
the theme of this year. You know, I

227
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,680
don't blame you. I think it's I think

228
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:55,360
it's pretty good idea. You know, S&P if

229
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:58,160
you don't have particular uh edge you

230
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:02,320
feel you like to have investing in index

231
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:04,959
is pretty good choice. So on this graph

232
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:07,760
I'm showing you here return versus

233
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:11,120
volatility. So we already touched upon a

234
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:13,760
lot of people choose chose cash right

235
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:18,000
cash basically you can view it as a zero

236
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:21,680
volatility as some minimum return you

237
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:25,680
know Fed just cut interest rate is still

238
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:28,880
over 4% um you know close to 5% and they

239
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,720
may cut more but uh compared to the

240
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,200
interest rate where it has been in the

241
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,880
last 10 years this is actually not bad

242
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:39,519
place uh to park your capital. Bonds

243
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:43,680
have slightly higher return, a little

244
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:46,079
more uncertainty of uh return. Um stocks

245
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:49,200
definitely have more but the index has

246
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:53,600
less volatility and the index

247
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:56,880
return wise it may not be uh lagging uh

248
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:59,680
the broad uh stock market. I mean as you

249
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:03,760
know the index now is heavily weighted

250
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:06,399
towards large tech large cap tech stocks

251
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,320
and uh lately those large cap tech

252
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:12,399
stocks has been have been doing really

253
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:14,399
well. So if you long QQQ or S&P, you

254
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:18,240
essentially long the magnificent seven

255
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:20,800
stocks, right? And uh so the ETF uh

256
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,519
investment choice here is a not a bad

257
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:26,720
choice or index investment.

258
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:29,600
Further up on the right is the private

259
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:32,399
equity and venture capital choice. Uh

260
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:36,480
which I haven't seen anyone put it down.

261
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:39,120
So uh you you may be more thinking about

262
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,279
the public markets but private equity

263
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,680
and the venture capital are basically

264
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:46,800
investing in private companies not

265
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:49,760
publicly listed on stock exchanges. So

266
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:52,079
those companies tends to be illquid. You

267
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,000
cannot get your money out easily. You

268
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:57,440
have to stay with them for a very long

269
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:01,120
time. But a lot of times you have more

270
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:05,040
influence on the company's operation and

271
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:08,720
uh venture uh for example you invest in

272
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:12,959
startup companies those companies can

273
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:16,079
grow very fast can also fail very fast

274
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:19,680
uh so the outcome the uncertainty range

275
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:23,120
is very big but overall over the years

276
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:25,839
they tend to produce higher returns to

277
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:31,040
justify the uncert uncertainty or risk

278
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:33,839
premium you are uh dealing with.

279
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:36,880
So coming back to the return objective

280
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:39,600
and loss tolerance. So we should think

281
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:42,000
about uh when you write down your

282
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,959
portfolio right so you try to maximize

283
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,040
your return for sure right is anyone

284
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:50,160
here disagree with you should maximize

285
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:53,680
your return probably not right at the

286
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:56,399
same time you should minimize your risk

287
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,320
in this case minimize your uncertainty

288
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:01,199
right so you want to maximize the ratio

289
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,519
of return over volatility right that's

290
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:06,000
one of the objectives

291
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:08,079
but you may have constraints as well,

292
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,320
right? There are certain investment you

293
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:15,440
may not want to uh participate in. Uh

294
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:18,079
for example, uh many universities

295
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,560
declared uh we don't want to invest in

296
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:24,000
fossil fuels right for the environmental

297
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:26,560
concerns. And in the past like tobacco

298
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,519
companies or you know some kind of

299
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:34,240
weapon companies you know people have in

300
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:36,639
principle uh reasons to go against them

301
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:40,959
and uh so there are constraints of what

302
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:44,160
you uh investment universe should be.

303
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:46,079
Then there's liquidity, right? Uh you

304
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:49,519
know how much you need to use the money,

305
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:52,959
the $10,000 you you had in the

306
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:54,720
portfolio, you may not want to use it in

307
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:58,160
all in the investment or your liquidity

308
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:01,920
investment all the time. So you may want

309
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:03,600
spend 5% a year for example, right? Uh

310
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,600
so you need to take into account your

311
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:09,759
spending needs

312
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:11,680
and uh also on the downside how much you

313
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:14,480
can afford to lose is really a very

314
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:17,759
important question. So if your $10,000

315
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:20,720
becomes $5,000 do you will you feel

316
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:23,839
really bad? you would just say I'm gonna

317
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:26,240
stop investing alto together right so

318
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,800
that's I cannot afford to lose maybe

319
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,199
that's situation I saved uh for next

320
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:33,199
year right I put aside just want to earn

321
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:37,600
some return I don't want to lose it so

322
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:39,680
then your risk tolerance is very low is

323
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:43,199
very different

324
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:46,639
so for many asset owners uh inflation is

325
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:50,560
also a important concern because wealth

326
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:53,360
represents relative purchasing in power.

327
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:55,360
So how much wealth you have is not

328
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,880
really just a dollar amount you have in

329
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:01,839
your bank account is how much you can

330
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:04,640
buy, right? So when the price of goods,

331
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:06,640
services are going up, your purchasing

332
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,439
power is going down, right? So that's

333
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:13,520
inflation and it's also relative to the

334
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:16,640
next group and people or person how much

335
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:19,760
they can buy, right? So for universities

336
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:22,079
that means you want to hire a professor

337
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,959
you know if there are competing offers

338
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:28,559
how much more you can offer to the

339
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:31,280
professor to uh get them to come to your

340
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:33,600
university.

341
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:36,320
So uh so there's definitely absolute

342
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:39,600
return angle for the requirement of the

343
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:42,000
portfolio right and there's also a lot

344
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,960
of people nowadays talk about beating a

345
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,799
benchmark beating a index you know you

346
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:51,440
many of you have chosen S&P as an index

347
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:54,720
but if you can produce more return on

348
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:57,760
top of S&P return so that's called the

349
00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:00,160
alpha right so relative return that's

350
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,640
also often being used as a measurement

351
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,440
of investment skills. So you don't

352
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:08,320
justly just put in a beta or broad

353
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,880
market investment. You actually can

354
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,480
extract more return.

355
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,880
So

356
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,440
asset liability matching cash flow is

357
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:21,520
very important. Right? So 2008 taught

358
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:25,360
many asset owners uh a big lesson. When

359
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:28,480
you don't have the right asset liability

360
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:32,240
uh match when your portfolio has a draw

361
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:34,400
down your liability side will basically

362
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,960
dominant uh dominant on your balance

363
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:40,799
sheet you need to cut your spending

364
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:42,960
budget you know stop your uh uh building

365
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:46,559
projects and the layoff people right so

366
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,320
that those are painful uh uh lessons uh

367
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:51,120
you need to have the cash flow well

368
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,559
planned so time horizon I mentioned is

369
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,640
very important. When I gave you that

370
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:57,440
piece of paper, I didn't say time

371
00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:00,240
horizon on purpose. I want you think

372
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,320
about you should ask the question this

373
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:06,799
portfolio is for how long is that? For

374
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:08,720
one day or for a year or for 10 years,

375
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:11,520
right?

376
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:14,640
So in the investment world, people

377
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,559
always compare returns like year to

378
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:19,760
years, sometimes even quarter to

379
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:23,360
quarter. like peers try to say oh I

380
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:26,720
outperformed A outperformed B so

381
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:29,679
therefore A is better than B so this is

382
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:33,120
actually lot lot of times unhealthy

383
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:34,799
exercise because for long-term investors

384
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:38,320
you should really focus on long-term

385
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:41,440
return but inevitably in the real world

386
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:44,400
people look at uh short-term returns so

387
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,400
you cannot ignore it but that's the the

388
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,400
uh the peer pressure for a lot of

389
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,960
investment managers is that's the career

390
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,640
risk because they bored may think in the

391
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,760
short term they are not good and try to

392
00:19:52,640 --> 00:20:00,559
replace them.

393
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:04,799
So coming back more on why investing

394
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:08,240
right. So on the on the left if on on

395
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:13,039
your left if you look at the um personal

396
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:16,320
income and spending as one person's age

397
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:20,080
uh as age as a function.

398
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:24,799
So your income level kind of peak

399
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:27,919
somewhere in your mid career. Okay. So

400
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:29,919
let's call it around age of 50, right?

401
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:33,679
So you're earning the most, you probably

402
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:35,120
also spending the most. But as you as

403
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:37,440
you as a student, you probably don't

404
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,919
earn that much. You don't spend uh that

405
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:44,240
much either, right? I mean, same is true

406
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:46,720
when you uh over the peak point. You're

407
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,080
getting into the retirement stage. So

408
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,120
you don't earn that much, you don't

409
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:54,080
spend that much. So you need to plan

410
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,520
accordingly of your personal portfolio.

411
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,720
So that's related to the question of

412
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:01,840
time horizon and also the marginal

413
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:06,159
benefit of having more wealth and money

414
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:08,960
starts to diminish when you have had

415
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:11,760
certain minimum amount. So that's the

416
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:16,000
bottom curve. uh your benefit is start

417
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:18,240
to uh uh kind of a plateau and uh so

418
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,120
also do you want to take more risk or

419
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,760
not at that point right but for

420
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,840
organization or endowment on the right

421
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:30,159
is a little different because it's a

422
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:34,000
perpetual uh portfolio is a very long

423
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:37,200
long time horizon and the spending uh

424
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:41,679
keeps going up uh as uh inflation goes

425
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:44,320
up so you cannot not basically be

426
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:46,799
complacent and say I just put all the

427
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:49,919
portfolio into some conservative uh

428
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:52,720
investments. You have to keep producing

429
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,640
those kind of returns.

430
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:59,679
So the endowment is set up for a

431
00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:03,520
university typically they spend 5%

432
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:07,440
uh of the portfolio and on top of that

433
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:12,960
there's expected 3% inflation. So the

434
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:16,320
nominal return target is 8%. Right? Uh

435
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:19,600
so as you know it's probably not always

436
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:22,559
easy to make 8% consistently uh year

437
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:25,360
over year and especially when interest

438
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:28,799
rate is low. Uh you don't have a bonds

439
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:32,799
or safety bond you can put in.

440
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:35,520
Also endowment tends to have long time

441
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:39,120
horizon definitely more than 10 years.

442
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:41,200
That's what the people always say you

443
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,760
know universities have hundreds of years

444
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,880
history right and looking to have

445
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:48,640
another you know many more hundreds of

446
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,440
years

447
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:56,000
and uh on the university spending budget

448
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:58,880
operating budget now roughly about 40%

449
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,240
of the budget uh is coming from

450
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:04,960
endowment uh spending so you can see

451
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:09,280
universities are now more and more uh

452
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:13,039
reli relying on endowment returns and uh

453
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:15,200
that's uh because uh the you know the

454
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:17,760
research grants from federal agencies

455
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,520
and the uh industries are coming down.

456
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,720
So this has to be made up from the

457
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:26,400
investment portfolio

458
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:29,600
and uh so this is just a list of the

459
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:32,480
strategies endowments tend to invest in.

460
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,559
I mentioned cash, government bonds, uh

461
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:38,000
corporate bonds and credit products

462
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:40,400
meaning the issuer unlike US government

463
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,039
it has the risk of defaulting so

464
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:46,559
therefore will pay you higher uh

465
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:48,880
interest. Uh so they are hedge funds

466
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:51,200
betting on the macro markets right

467
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:54,240
betting on the Fed uh or stock market

468
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:57,039
the general uh direction they're also

469
00:23:54,240 --> 00:24:00,080
quantitative funds doing the trend

470
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:02,960
following people usually call it CTA

471
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:08,240
yeah commodity trading advisors or stat

472
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:11,520
up which is to capture the relative uh

473
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:14,480
value uh between a pair of stocks or

474
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:17,279
actually many pairs of stocks. So it's a

475
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:21,120
statistical arbitrage they call it. So

476
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:23,279
which is really to uh find uh

477
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,840
statistical patterns to generate

478
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:28,720
returns. So this is heavily

479
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:31,679
computer-driven strategies. Many big

480
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:34,960
quantitative shops still doing a lot of

481
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:38,400
these. So there are fundamental equity

482
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:41,120
hedge funds. They buy stocks and also

483
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:44,240
sell short stocks.

484
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,760
And uh there are also the platforms you

485
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,480
probably heard you know the big

486
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:50,480
platforms they call it multistrat or

487
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:54,000
multi multi-pm

488
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:57,520
uh portfolio manager platforms they hire

489
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:01,279
hundreds of different uh teams uh

490
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:03,279
trading uh on the same platform you know

491
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:06,880
very different a wide range of

492
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:10,000
strategies but achieve a high degree of

493
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:13,520
diversification and they can level up uh

494
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,720
the portfolio IO quite a bit

495
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:19,919
and uh so I mentioned private equity uh

496
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:22,720
earlier there also real asset investment

497
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:25,200
real estate natural resources farmland

498
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:28,240
timberland those type of uh uh

499
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:31,039
investments and the new assets such as

500
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:34,320
you know crypto or intellectual uh

501
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:36,640
properties or legal claims and so on. So

502
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:39,120
basically anything you can think of can

503
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,960
generate return it can also be

504
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,480
considered.

505
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,640
Uh

506
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:47,360
at the first lecture I already

507
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:50,559
highlighted some of the uh features of

508
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:53,520
the endowment model. So endowment model

509
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:56,880
nowadays tend to focus on hiring

510
00:25:53,520 --> 00:26:00,960
external managers and doing both public

511
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:03,520
and private uh investing and uh we hire

512
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,520
both uh generalists you know look at

513
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:09,200
everything and also specialists in

514
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:12,159
certain domains such as biotech you know

515
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:15,120
uh AI and so on.

516
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:18,960
uh we focus on both absolute return and

517
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:22,320
also relative return to the benchmark.

518
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:26,480
uh so we are mostly active managers. So

519
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:29,120
we uh we have some passive beta index

520
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:32,080
investment but it's a minority of the

521
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:34,960
investment is also u not always

522
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:37,919
permanent. So whenever we can find an

523
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:40,880
active strategy or a manager to beat a

524
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:45,039
benchmark or index we will always go for

525
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:49,760
the active uh uh investment.

526
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:52,799
Um yeah so as you can see this

527
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:56,159
investment process is centered around

528
00:26:52,799 --> 00:27:00,960
manager selection right uh selecting the

529
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:03,679
good investing uh uh fund managers and

530
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:06,880
Harvard actually in the old days used to

531
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:09,120
have lot of internal uh fund managers

532
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,360
but that model has changed from uh seven

533
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:15,480
years ago. Yeah. To focus more on

534
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,480
external managers.

535
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:21,840
So now I'm going to shift gear a little

536
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:24,080
bit to talk about uh portfolio

537
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,000
construction problem. So shifting

538
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:29,200
towards the math part of uh the

539
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,520
discussion a little bit. So the classic

540
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:34,799
portfolio construction problem is stated

541
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:38,240
as such. Assume you you know your return

542
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:40,880
objectives. You have a loss tolerance

543
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:44,320
and you can predict each investment's

544
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,840
return volatility which is the standard

545
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:49,520
deviation

546
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:51,360
and also the correlation matrix of these

547
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:54,559
investments.

548
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:57,120
The question is what percentage you

549
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:58,880
should put in in each of the investment.

550
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:03,279
So that's the portfolio construction

551
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:06,559
problem right and the objective of that

552
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:09,600
as we mentioned earlier is to maximize

553
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:13,520
the return for the whole portfolio while

554
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:16,480
minimizing the portfolio risk in this uh

555
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:19,200
classic uh problem is to minimize the

556
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:22,200
uncertainty or volatility of the whole

557
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,200
portfolio.

558
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:28,240
So as you can see the portfolio

559
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:31,440
construction problem really is a sizing

560
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:34,640
problem of uh investments at all

561
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,880
different levels. You can relate that to

562
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:39,520
asset allocation problem. So what is the

563
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:42,240
asset allocation problem? So you group

564
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:46,480
those investments into different asset

565
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:48,320
classes. So as I showed you earlier, so

566
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,520
the list of these strategies, you can

567
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:55,679
also think of them as list of different

568
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:57,760
asset classes. So from top down

569
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:00,159
the discussion needs to be had is how

570
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:03,200
much you want to be in each category or

571
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:06,240
each asset class.

572
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:09,279
And uh sometimes people will say well

573
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:11,919
that's still way too many asset classes,

574
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:14,559
right? you if you have 10 to 15 asset

575
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:17,600
classes that makes the optimization

576
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:21,840
problem very hard. So people tend to

577
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:24,559
reduce them to uh big uh risk factors.

578
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:28,880
So sometimes you know say three to five

579
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:32,320
risk factors usually equity, bonds and

580
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:36,080
plus uh one of the other things could be

581
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:40,640
uh uh you know inflation, it could be

582
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:44,480
currency, it could be uh uh credit and

583
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:47,919
other uh dimensions. But the factor

584
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:50,960
analysis or can also expand into many

585
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:53,679
detailed levels. You can have you know

586
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:56,399
50 factors or even hundreds

587
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:59,679
uh factors but it's just a different

588
00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:02,320
ways of grouping the investments to make

589
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:06,480
the optimization uh problem little

590
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:09,039
easier. Okay. So then what is the risk

591
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:13,279
management problem of a portfolio? So

592
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:15,039
risk management problem in many ways is

593
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:18,880
actually the same problem as portfolio

594
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:21,440
construction. is the sizing problem. But

595
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:24,000
in addition, you need to think about how

596
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:26,080
to avoid concentration, right?

597
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,360
Concentration of course is also a sizing

598
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:32,720
problem and also ili liquidity and

599
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:36,320
what's unaccept unacceptable losses and

600
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:39,320
unwanted risks to constrain uh the

601
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,320
portfolio.

602
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:47,440
So I'm going to spend a few minutes on

603
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:51,520
the portfolio theory which is

604
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:55,120
illustrated in two assets.

605
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:58,240
Asset one has a return R1 volatility

606
00:30:55,120 --> 00:31:01,760
sigma 1 and will have a weight in the

607
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:04,799
portfolio of W1. Uh similarly for asset

608
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:08,320
2. So the sum of the two weights should

609
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:10,880
equal to one. W1 plus W2

610
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:14,720
and the portfolio return which is

611
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:20,720
denoted here as R subp is the weighted

612
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:24,159
return of R1 and R2 right and the

613
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:27,679
variance or in this here is the sigma P

614
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:31,679
squared the volatility squared can be

615
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:34,159
expressed in terms of the weights and

616
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,360
the volatility of each of the two

617
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:38,559
investments.

618
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:41,120
as well as the correlation row between

619
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:43,200
the two investments. So this is a very

620
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:49,200
uh common equation you probably have

621
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:51,120
seen uh many times uh in uh in any uh

622
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:55,200
you know probability or stat uh

623
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:58,240
statistics class classes.

624
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,799
So let's look at the

625
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:04,399
some special cases.

626
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:09,840
So when the correlation row is positive

627
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:12,960
one meaning the two assets are perfectly

628
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:16,000
correlated one moves up the other moves

629
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:17,760
up at the same time one goes down the

630
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,640
other one goes down at the same time

631
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:22,399
right so that's called perfect

632
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:26,559
correlation

633
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:31,039
so if row equals to one

634
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:33,039
and we can simplify the uh sigma Sigma P

635
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:35,279
which is the portfolio volatility

636
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:39,600
becomes the weighted sum of the two

637
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:44,880
volatilities W1 * sigma 1 plus W2 *

638
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:48,480
sigma 2 or you can also express the W1

639
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:52,320
in terms of Y minus W2 right so

640
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:56,480
therefore solving for W2 in terms of

641
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:58,159
sigma P and the sigma 1 and sigma 2

642
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,240
so

643
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:03,600
then you can derive

644
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:10,399
the overall return of the portfolio R

645
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:13,840
subp in terms of W2 because W2 above is

646
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:17,679
a function is a linear function of sigma

647
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:22,240
P. So you know in this case the return

648
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:24,640
of the portfolio RP is a linear function

649
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:28,640
of

650
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:31,600
sigma P. Okay. So this is on this chart

651
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:34,960
you can see that straight line when row

652
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:38,480
equals to one that's the special case

653
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:41,200
when row equal to minus1

654
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:44,480
that means they are perfectly

655
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:46,880
uh negatively correlated. So one goes up

656
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:49,760
the other one goes down.

657
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:54,399
So when that is the case you will

658
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:57,039
actually easily derive that this sigma P

659
00:33:54,399 --> 00:34:01,600
is actually you have two branches of

660
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:06,080
solutions. So depends on the value W1

661
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:11,040
sigma 1 compared to W2 sigma 2. So

662
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:14,240
that's the two uh separate lines on the

663
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:17,440
left. That's the other solution. In the

664
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:19,520
middle is the other values of uh the

665
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,960
correlation between negative one and

666
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:28,359
plus one and including

667
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:28,359
uh zero correlation row equal to zero.

668
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:36,480
So what if the first asset has zero

669
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:39,280
volatility sigma 1 equals to zero. So

670
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:42,320
then from the equation earlier we can

671
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:46,159
derive sigma p the portfolio volatility

672
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:50,320
is simply w2 * sigma 2 right because

673
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:54,079
sigma 1 is zero and therefore w2 the

674
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:58,000
waiting on the asset 2 is sigma p

675
00:34:54,079 --> 00:35:01,440
divided by sigma 2 right that's a

676
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:06,720
straightforward uh result

677
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:09,440
and uh the portfolio return r subp P now

678
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:13,200
can be written as

679
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:16,480
R1 which is the first asset with zero

680
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:18,560
volatility which you can think as a cash

681
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:21,599
right we mentioned earlier cash has zero

682
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:24,800
volatility so this cash or riskless

683
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:26,640
asset has a return R1

684
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:31,760
while

685
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:36,320
it's RP is still a linear function of uh

686
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:39,359
sigma P right but it's a straight line.

687
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:42,720
In this case, you can see the slope of

688
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:47,200
that line is determined by the

689
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:50,680
difference of R2 minus R1 and divided by

690
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,680
sigma 2.

691
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:58,320
So by the way, so this is so-called

692
00:35:54,640 --> 00:36:01,920
capital allocation line in the uh

693
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:04,240
portfolio theory. Okay. So we can uh

694
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,240
look at let's say constructed the

695
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:08,960
portfolio you already have a sigma P

696
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:13,440
which has many assets in it right and

697
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:20,960
also RP by adding one riskless

698
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:24,320
asset or cash which returns RF RF is

699
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:28,480
basically like a risk-free return you

700
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:32,880
can draw a tangent line over

701
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:35,520
uh the sigma P point you pick the uh one

702
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:37,280
point on that efficient frontier I

703
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,760
should explain efficient frontier

704
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:42,320
meaning that on that return versus

705
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:44,960
volatility chart because you have

706
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:48,800
different waitings right so let's come

707
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:53,520
back to this uh let's look at the uh

708
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:56,400
this curve here so for different W1 and

709
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:58,160
W2s you can have different resulting

710
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:02,000
portfolio return and portfolio

711
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:03,680
volatility Right. So this line

712
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,599
the upper part of this is called

713
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:11,520
efficient frontier because by lowering

714
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:13,760
your risk and moving your return up

715
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:17,599
that's your objective. You are improving

716
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:20,079
the portfolio. So any point on this line

717
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:22,640
is a potential solution of that

718
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:27,680
portfolio construction.

719
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:34,000
So why when we add the risk-free asset

720
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:36,480
uh on this RF point so we can basically

721
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,640
combine that risk-free asset with the

722
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:42,960
existing portfolio

723
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:46,079
to uh further improve the risk uh the

724
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:48,160
efficient frontier to move up to that uh

725
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:52,000
straight line.

726
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:55,040
So that slope R P minus RF divided by

727
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,359
sigma P is so-called sharp ratio in

728
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:59,839
simple terms think about your return

729
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:04,320
over volatility right so that's kind of

730
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:07,680
a uh the sharp ratio definition

731
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:10,560
um sometimes you also hear the term

732
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:13,440
alpha and the beta that's compared with

733
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:17,200
a benchmark right so in this case you

734
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:18,960
can uh write down the portfolio return

735
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:22,640
minus the risk risk-f free asset in

736
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:26,960
terms of alpha plus beta times benchmark

737
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:30,800
minus the risk-free return and uh uh the

738
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:33,280
beta is a function of correlation of the

739
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:36,599
portfolio to the benchmark and the ratio

740
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,599
of the volatility.

741
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:44,400
Um what if

742
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:47,359
you want to lever up the portfolio and

743
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:50,640
uh borrow more? So meaning make the

744
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:54,560
weight of the first uh risk-free asset

745
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:59,200
to be minus 100%. And make the other

746
00:38:54,560 --> 00:39:02,240
asset be 200%. So still sum up to one.

747
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:06,880
So that means you're borrowing money uh

748
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:10,000
in in cash. You're putting the proceeds

749
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:16,240
into the risky asset. So, you're moving

750
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:19,599
the volatility up to this point

751
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:22,079
by investing more into the second asset.

752
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:25,839
So, that's also possible. That's a

753
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:28,400
typical exercise people do in risk

754
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:31,119
parody portfolios. By the way, if you

755
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:33,119
don't follow uh any of those, that's

756
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:36,079
fine. The reason I want to talk about

757
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:40,240
this is really give you some flavors of

758
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:43,119
what the portfolio theory uh is about

759
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:45,520
because then I'm going to tell you uh in

760
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:48,520
practice a lot of these needs to be

761
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,520
improved.

762
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:54,079
So the example of portfolio with two

763
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:56,800
assets we talk about the 6040 uh equity

764
00:39:54,079 --> 00:40:01,680
bonds right some of you wrote down 70

765
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:04,800
bonds 30 uh% stocks uh that's very much

766
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:07,839
similar to the risk parody uh portfolio

767
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:10,079
which they try to make equal risk

768
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:15,119
contribution coming from the bonds and

769
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:17,839
equity by borrowing uh more to invest in

770
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:20,160
the bonds because bonds typically have

771
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:23,040
lower volatility than equity. So you

772
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:25,680
need to have more to make them have

773
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:28,320
equal risk or contribution. So that's

774
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:31,359
the idea. Again today I'm not going into

775
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:33,599
the uh math. Uh in the previous years

776
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:36,800
sometimes I spend more time on that but

777
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:40,160
I feel I want to uh uh talk about other

778
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:42,720
things bit more today.

779
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:46,000
But before we move away, I want to talk

780
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:47,520
about the importance of rebalancing.

781
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,359
Um

782
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:54,240
uh because we had this uh 2013 uh OCW

783
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:57,760
video just uh two weeks ago. I think

784
00:40:54,240 --> 00:41:01,359
somebody uh made a a clip out of that

785
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:05,839
class uh speed it sped it up to 1.5

786
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:09,760
times and made a three minute uh uh

787
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:12,480
video of uh the only free lunch of uh uh

788
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:15,200
diversification which is exactly this

789
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:17,920
example. So, I'm going to go through it

790
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:23,280
uh with you quickly. Just think about

791
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:25,920
you have two assets or two uh assets in

792
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:29,680
a two-year period. In year one, the

793
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:32,400
first one doubles and then year two it

794
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:35,839
has. So, I think it's a little easier to

795
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:38,079
uh to show on the on the blackboard, but

796
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:42,760
the other one

797
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:42,760
does the opposite, right?

798
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:51,839
So they both started here. The first

799
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:56,319
asset doubles

800
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:59,760
then halves. So this is a year one.

801
00:41:56,319 --> 00:42:03,760
This is year two. The second asset

802
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:08,319
halves first then doubles.

803
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:12,560
So those were the R1 and R2s. So if you

804
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:15,680
start as equal weight of the two and

805
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:19,200
after year one you can calculate the

806
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:21,280
portfolio is up 25%.

807
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:23,520
So this is just a simple math you know

808
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:26,319
the first

809
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:29,440
asset one is 50% weight asset two is

810
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:34,400
also 50% weight one doubles one halves

811
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:37,200
so total you made 25%. Okay. But if you

812
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:39,920
don't do anything at this point, so

813
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:42,880
asset one will be dominating the

814
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:46,079
portfolio. Asset two will be just a

815
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:48,400
small portion. Right? Then because asset

816
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:51,119
two then doubles, you're coming back to

817
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:55,359
the same point. After two years, your

818
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:56,960
portfolio's return is exactly 0%.

819
00:42:55,359 --> 00:43:00,240
Okay? Even though you had a divers

820
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:03,520
diversified portfolio with perfectly

821
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:07,680
negatively correlated assets,

822
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:10,000
but if you rebalance at this point

823
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:12,400
to equal weight,

824
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:16,880
then your portfolio in year two will

825
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:20,079
make another 25% return in year two.

826
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:21,599
So you're making compounded return of

827
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:24,720
25%

828
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:27,839
two years in a row, right? So, some of

829
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:30,560
you may point out that isn't this just

830
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:34,720
uh betting on mean reversion, you know,

831
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:37,680
uh and uh if if you think it's a trend

832
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:40,800
uh trade, you shouldn't do this. That's

833
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:44,160
right. Uh the question you should ask

834
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:48,079
yourself, what is the basis of your

835
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:50,480
sizing or waiting of the two assets?

836
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:53,040
Right? So you started with the equal

837
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:57,200
waiting meaning that you think the two

838
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:59,440
asset have the same likelihood of

839
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:02,640
performing and the same amount of risk.

840
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:05,359
That's that's why you size them equally

841
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:07,599
and of course uh you also know they are

842
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:10,079
negatively correlated.

843
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:13,280
So at the year at the end of year one do

844
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:16,160
you maintain that view or not? If you

845
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:19,359
think is that still the same projection

846
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:21,520
of risk and return then you should

847
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:25,040
maintain the equal weight. You should

848
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:27,599
not change the waiting unless at the

849
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:31,359
year one your projection has totally

850
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:34,640
changed. You think asset one will

851
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:37,440
continue to outperform asset two. Yes,

852
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:40,079
in that case you can change to a

853
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:43,119
non-equal waiting. So that's the point.

854
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:44,800
If you believe they are

855
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:48,160
they have the same probability

856
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:50,800
distribution and uh there's no reason

857
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:52,880
for you not to rebalance. So people say

858
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:55,040
this a free lunch the only free lunch is

859
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:59,520
diversification but you have to

860
00:44:55,040 --> 00:45:02,240
rebalance to uh to eat it. So that's on

861
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:06,160
that. So then I'm going to shift the

862
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:08,960
gear uh to talk about the limitations of

863
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:10,960
so-called modern portfolio theory in

864
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:13,359
short MPT.

865
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:15,200
I mentioned this was mostly developed in

866
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:19,040
the 1950s

867
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:21,599
and uh Harry Marquiz pioneered uh in

868
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:25,280
this area. He actually got a Nobel Prize

869
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:29,760
in the I think early 90s uh for his

870
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:32,640
work. Uh so all I have just described uh

871
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:36,640
to you so far the mathematical part has

872
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:40,400
a lot to do with his work. Okay. Uh but

873
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:44,079
you can tell already right. So a lot of

874
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:46,560
these depend on your confidence in the

875
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:49,760
capital market assumptions

876
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:52,079
which is the projections of return

877
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:55,839
volatility and the correlation matrix of

878
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:59,200
these investments. Right? And uh the

879
00:45:55,839 --> 00:46:01,040
mean variance optimization problem

880
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:04,480
of often has unlimited number of

881
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:07,839
solutions and you have to put artificial

882
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:11,599
constraints to bound the solutions. They

883
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:15,520
are very sensitive to uh small change of

884
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:18,400
these capital market assumptions.

885
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:22,240
So in practice is very hard to use.

886
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:24,160
Probably not many people use it.

887
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:27,440
So

888
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:29,599
with those questions I myself have

889
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:33,280
always been curious about this and have

890
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:36,160
done uh various uh research work uh in

891
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:39,920
this. So today I'm going to highlight a

892
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:43,520
few uh the first one is more related to

893
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:46,560
the sizing question using a different uh

894
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:50,560
approach. Um

895
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:53,520
I call it you know a gain loss ratio. Uh

896
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:56,240
the second part I will talk a bit about

897
00:46:53,520 --> 00:47:00,240
you know the effect of crowding behavior

898
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:02,160
and how to model it. And uh lastly I

899
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:05,359
will talk about

900
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:07,280
uh you know the power law distribution

901
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:10,319
uh coming out of these crowd

902
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:14,359
interactions why these are all relevant

903
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:14,359
to a portfolio construction.

904
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:21,440
So issue number one uh for the MPT. So

905
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:23,680
volatility is a poor measure of risk.

906
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:25,280
Why do I say that? You know because

907
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:28,720
volatility

908
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:31,599
is just the standard deviation or the

909
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:35,599
range of uh uncertainties.

910
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:38,000
So if I am long uh out of money call

911
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:40,960
option, think about it, right? You have

912
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:43,119
one investment. Um Stephen, you uh

913
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:46,720
studied you worked on options. You

914
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:49,200
probably can get this uh easily.

915
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:52,240
If I've long out of the money option, do

916
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:55,240
I wish my the volatility to go up or

917
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:55,240
down?

918
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:01,839
Do I want my portfolio have a high V or

919
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:02,480
low V? Right. I want my portfolio Yes.

920
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:03,280
Yeah.

921
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,599
>> Higher volume.

922
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:08,960
>> Yes. Right. The higher V, the better.

923
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:12,079
Right. So on the other hand, if I'm

924
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:13,760
short uh all the money option, I

925
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:15,520
probably want to have lower V, right?

926
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:17,599
The better. So because I don't want to

927
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:21,359
uh get exercised.

928
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:24,319
So really depends on, you know, your

929
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:26,720
gain situation, your payout or your

930
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:29,760
potential loss.

931
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:32,240
And the shop ratio is derived from

932
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:35,440
volatility. So basically suffers from

933
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:38,960
the same uh issue. So over the years

934
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:43,119
there are methods like a sautino ratio

935
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:46,400
uh try to uh differentiate the upside

936
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:50,480
range and the downside range. Uh I think

937
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:54,319
it's a good measurement but it uh it

938
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:56,000
doesn't give you uh direct link to

939
00:48:54,319 --> 00:49:00,280
sizing. You know the ultimate question

940
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,280
we need to answer is sizing.

941
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:07,920
So the new way to compare different

942
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:11,359
investments uh uh I'm basically uh uh

943
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:14,319
using or I came up with is to use

944
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:18,000
expected gain and expected loss. I call

945
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:19,920
the G and L. Uh here I both use positive

946
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,480
numbers. So when I say loss, these are

947
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:26,640
absolute uh numbers.

948
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:30,800
So we are looking for the best skill

949
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:32,960
which is gain much bigger than expect

950
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:36,480
much bigger expected gain than much

951
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:40,079
bigger than the than the expected loss

952
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:43,440
or written in different forms in the G

953
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:47,920
minus L which is the return divided by G

954
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:52,880
+ L. Okay. and you change the format a

955
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:55,040
little bit, it becomes 1 - 2 L / G + L.

956
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:58,160
This is really

957
00:49:55,040 --> 00:50:02,000
exactly the sizing percentage

958
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:04,880
uh from uh Kelly's criteria in the

959
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:08,240
binary uh bedding.

960
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:12,559
So this number is bounded from minus1 to

961
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:18,240
+ one. So it can be directly translated

962
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:20,800
uh into uh sizing and uh so let me give

963
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:23,760
you a few examples to help uh you

964
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:28,319
understand this. So if you are flipping

965
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:31,119
flipping a a coin, right? You know the

966
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:33,760
head has a certain probability and the

967
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:36,720
tail has certain probability and when

968
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:38,960
it's a head it has a payout you will get

969
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:41,920
or lose and when it's tail you have a

970
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:43,680
payout or lose. So expected gain is the

971
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:46,000
probability of the head times the

972
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:49,040
payout. Right? If you bet on head,

973
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:53,200
expected loss is the probability of the

974
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:55,599
tail times the payout on that side. So

975
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:58,160
in that discrete example is fairly easy

976
00:50:55,599 --> 00:51:02,160
to understand. But in the continuous

977
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:05,680
example is the terminal distribution.

978
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:08,240
Let's say you have a probability

979
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:09,920
uh density function describing all the

980
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:12,160
outcomes.

981
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:15,200
Then you need to use that probability

982
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:18,640
density function times the payout,

983
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:21,839
right? Integrated over all the losing

984
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:24,480
part and integrated over all the gaining

985
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:29,359
part to get the expected loss and the

986
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:33,040
expected gain. So it doesn't have to be

987
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:36,240
always separated by zero. Right? If you

988
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:40,480
have a target return, so you integrate

989
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:43,119
over say from minus infinity to the

990
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:46,240
target return. That's your expected

991
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:48,160
loss. That is what needs to be included

992
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:50,720
in L.

993
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:54,720
So when you do this

994
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:58,160
your optimization problem is no longer

995
00:51:54,720 --> 00:52:01,440
return versus volatility but in the

996
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:05,760
vertical axis is gain in the horizontal

997
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:11,839
axis is L is loss. So you need to

998
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:16,000
basically maximize G while minimizing L.

999
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:18,640
So this is all relevant because as I

1000
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:21,440
just explained earlier minimizing

1001
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:23,280
volatility is not not always for your

1002
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:24,960
benefit right when you are long option

1003
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:28,000
you need to you need to have higher

1004
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:31,200
volatility but in this case when you

1005
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:35,200
specify expected loss that's what you

1006
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:36,880
need to budget and control your uh

1007
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:40,480
investment.

1008
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:42,880
So in the investment game we gave you at

1009
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:46,000
the beginning, I hope you have all of

1010
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:49,839
your submitted uh your choices uh in

1011
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:52,160
September and some of you rebalanced

1012
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:56,240
uh in October.

1013
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:59,599
I wanted you to track the daily gain and

1014
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:03,280
loss in dollar amount.

1015
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:07,920
And uh at the end of the game which is

1016
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:11,599
mid November, I want you to summarize

1017
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:15,119
all the daily gains and also summarize

1018
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:18,400
the daily losses to derive the G and the

1019
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:20,000
L. So some of you said you know in order

1020
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:23,760
to win this game why don't I just pick

1021
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:26,559
the highest volatility stock right uh to

1022
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:32,079
have the best potential

1023
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:34,880
uh to produce highest return yes but

1024
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:38,720
your higher volatility investment will

1025
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:43,760
suffer on the denominator which the G

1026
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:45,760
plus L uh this ratio will indicate the

1027
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:48,079
quality of your investment even Though

1028
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:50,559
your G minus L which is the return may

1029
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:54,480
be good but the denominator will

1030
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:57,599
normalize it right to make it basically

1031
00:53:54,480 --> 00:54:00,240
uh comparable to other investments.

1032
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:01,839
So the optimization problem. Yes,

1033
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:04,000
please.

1034
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:06,720
>> In practice, what like do you use to

1035
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:09,839
estimate the expected gain?

1036
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:12,240
That's difficult to like estimate like

1037
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:16,960
the distribution of the pricing.

1038
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:18,960
>> Uh yes. Uh but no more uh difficult than

1039
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:20,800
getting the return and the standard

1040
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:23,440
deviation.

1041
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:24,880
Yeah. So it's the same amount of work.

1042
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:27,040
It's just that you are separating the

1043
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:28,640
numbers. uh you're calculating half

1044
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:30,800
distribution instead of the whole

1045
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:33,359
distribution.

1046
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:36,880
So it is uh so especially when you do

1047
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:40,880
the optimization problem as I'm uh about

1048
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:44,640
to explain uh these lines basically for

1049
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:47,200
example the 45 degree line indicates g

1050
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:51,520
minus l equal to zero so zero return

1051
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:55,280
line so you don't want to uh pick any

1052
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:57,839
investments below that 45 degree line

1053
00:54:55,280 --> 00:55:00,720
you want the lines have higher slope

1054
00:54:57,839 --> 00:55:04,559
right so indicating higher g over L

1055
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:08,880
ratio but when you combine them combine

1056
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:11,440
let's say two uh assets into one uh

1057
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:15,200
calculating the combined portfolio G and

1058
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:17,839
L which is actually pass dependent uh

1059
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:21,440
which actually should be because when

1060
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:23,599
you have two investments the final

1061
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:27,680
outcome of the expected gain and the

1062
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:29,119
loss uh indeed will be pass dependent

1063
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:30,400
that means you probably need to do a lot

1064
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:33,839
of Monte Carlo

1065
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:37,599
uh simulation uh to derive that. Yeah.

1066
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:40,319
But it's no more work amount than the uh

1067
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:42,559
traditional uh distribution uh

1068
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:45,040
calculation.

1069
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:49,760
>> Yeah.

1070
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:51,680
Okay. Um let's move on to uh

1071
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:54,640
modern portfolio theory issue number

1072
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:59,920
two. How do we predict future based on

1073
00:55:54,640 --> 00:56:02,079
the past? How confident can we be in the

1074
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:05,200
capital market assumptions return

1075
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:08,720
volatility and correlation?

1076
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:11,040
So because we human thinking uh process

1077
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:14,400
right our thinking process always

1078
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:15,920
extracting patterns from the data. So we

1079
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:18,559
have observations this I'm just

1080
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:20,880
outlining the typical thinking process.

1081
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:23,040
You have observation.

1082
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:26,640
You have measurable data. Try to

1083
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:29,280
quantify them. Then you try to extract

1084
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:30,960
useful information or recognize

1085
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:33,760
patterns.

1086
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:36,720
Then you try to build models having

1087
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:40,160
inputs, outputs and the conditions. Then

1088
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:43,040
you predict output from the inputs and

1089
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:44,640
the conditions. Then you repeat your

1090
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:47,359
observation.

1091
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:49,440
Then you iterate try to calibrate your

1092
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:51,040
model parameters.

1093
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:53,119
When you are very good at it, you can

1094
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:57,119
actually control conditions and inputs

1095
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:59,040
to get the desired outcome. Right? So

1096
00:56:57,119 --> 00:57:02,799
that's

1097
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:06,720
that's true for any subject, physics,

1098
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:10,160
engineering, finance, right? But finance

1099
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:12,880
involves uh uh human behaviors which is

1100
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:15,680
much more complicated.

1101
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:18,640
So the historical patterns may not be

1102
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:21,839
repeatable, right? And also the crowding

1103
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:24,319
behavior and also adaptive behavior of

1104
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:26,240
human players will make the process much

1105
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:30,520
more complicated.

1106
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:30,520
So I want to show you a video.

1107
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:34,760
Let's see if this works.

1108
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:08,799
So what are you watching is a video of

1109
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:13,119
birds or bats

1110
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:15,520
in a totally selforganized way

1111
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:18,480
to form

1112
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:18,480
a group behavior.

1113
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:23,119
What they do is they watch the

1114
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:27,280
neighbors.

1115
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:29,520
They adjust their actions

1116
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:33,359
and uh

1117
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:36,359
the group as whole displays certain

1118
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:36,359
patterns.

1119
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:43,839
The financial markets is very similar to

1120
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:47,440
this.

1121
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:48,960
So uh except there's a central

1122
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:51,520
observation

1123
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:55,760
you can actually see which is the stock

1124
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:57,760
price you know you can also look at your

1125
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:59,680
neighbors too but nowadays it's much

1126
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:02,680
easier to look at the central

1127
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:02,680
observation.

1128
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:12,400
Okay. Um in the past I've also shown the

1129
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:13,760
uh London Bridge video. You probably How

1130
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:17,440
many of you have heard the the

1131
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:20,480
Millennium Bridge of London? Uh yes.

1132
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:24,079
Okay. It opened is a Millennium Bridge

1133
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:27,599
around 2000 on the you know first day

1134
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:29,200
when people walk on it starts to sway

1135
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:31,839
and then people try to keep their

1136
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:34,799
balance they all sync they become

1137
00:59:31,839 --> 00:59:38,880
synchronized in steps that made this

1138
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:42,880
sway even bigger. So market does the

1139
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:46,000
same thing. When panic feeds into panic

1140
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:49,440
or greed feeds into greed, market can

1141
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:54,559
form bubbles and crashing and these kind

1142
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:58,079
of behaviors are not uh easily uh

1143
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:59,920
predictable but it's a part of crowding

1144
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:03,760
uh behavior.

1145
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:06,400
So how to how to understand and model

1146
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:10,160
this kind of behavior? So we can look at

1147
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:15,040
as a a feedback loop, right? Uh so S

1148
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:17,040
here is uh the agent's action. Uh O is

1149
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:20,960
the observation.

1150
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:24,319
A is kind of a amplifier or agent's

1151
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:26,720
action feed through into the uh

1152
01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:30,000
observation. As you can see the change

1153
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:34,079
of their observation is the sum of the

1154
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:38,960
agents action times the uh power they

1155
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:42,400
have which is a then agent's action the

1156
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:45,680
change of agent's action ds is

1157
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:48,960
influenced by external force as well as

1158
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:52,400
the feedback loop of the observation and

1159
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:57,599
plus some random noise. So that's the

1160
01:00:52,400 --> 01:01:01,599
basic uh framework of crowd uh modeling.

1161
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:04,559
When the agents behave in the normal

1162
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:07,520
conditions, they are more rational. So

1163
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:09,520
they are less reactive to the

1164
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:12,240
observations or you can call it the

1165
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:14,720
feedback loop parameter B is actually

1166
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:18,319
taking a lower value. But when

1167
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:21,280
observation changes more volatile uh in

1168
01:01:18,319 --> 01:01:25,200
a more volatile fashion the agents tend

1169
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:28,640
to react more they get into a reactive

1170
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:31,599
state. So more agents in the crowd get

1171
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:33,119
into reactive state

1172
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:36,119
the crowd actually becomes more

1173
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:36,119
synchronized.

1174
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:42,799
So if we look at the the order parameter

1175
01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:45,839
which I defined as

1176
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:48,240
uh the ratio of the sum of all the

1177
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:51,760
actions together divided by the sum of

1178
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:54,720
the absolute uh number of the actions.

1179
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:58,160
So if they are all synchronized so that

1180
01:01:54,720 --> 01:02:01,200
number should be one right? If they are

1181
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:04,559
not synchronized at all that number can

1182
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:07,920
be very close to zero. So what the first

1183
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:10,559
chart on the left shows is

1184
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:13,599
the order parameter as a function of

1185
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:18,240
number of agents in the crowd in the

1186
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:21,440
reactive state. So then when more agents

1187
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:25,920
become reactive to the observation the

1188
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:28,960
order parameter can become very high.

1189
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:32,000
the crowd gets synchronized

1190
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:34,720
and on the right you can see the order

1191
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:39,520
parameter is also a function of the

1192
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:42,960
random noise term in the previous page.

1193
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:45,359
The higher the noise the less likely the

1194
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:46,880
agents uh the crowd will be

1195
01:02:45,359 --> 01:02:49,920
synchronized.

1196
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:54,240
So this type of behavior by the way is

1197
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:56,559
not new in physics uh in

1198
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:59,280
in some of the you know circuit uh

1199
01:02:56,559 --> 01:03:01,839
engineering circuit systems when you

1200
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:04,720
inject a noise you can also reduce the

1201
01:03:01,839 --> 01:03:08,880
order parameter synchronization but in

1202
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:12,319
social science this actually uh is a

1203
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:15,920
also a similar behavior.

1204
01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:18,640
So I further simulated uh the bubble

1205
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:21,680
process. So when you have a external

1206
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:25,760
force showing on the up left it's kind

1207
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:28,000
of ramping up then come down then

1208
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:32,160
oscillate.

1209
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:35,440
The number of agents in reactive state

1210
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:39,520
starts to peak up then also drop when

1211
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:43,839
the external shock uh diminishes.

1212
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:47,920
The observation as a result also follows

1213
01:03:43,839 --> 01:03:51,119
but then comes down. But if the external

1214
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:54,480
shock on the other end maintains at a

1215
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:58,319
higher level forever

1216
01:03:54,480 --> 01:04:00,880
eventually all the members of the crowd,

1217
01:03:58,319 --> 01:04:04,799
all the agents

1218
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:07,119
get into the reactive state. So they the

1219
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:10,160
whole crowd become synchronized. the

1220
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:12,799
observation basically goes uh shoots

1221
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:16,240
through the roof. So it becomes a very

1222
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:18,000
unstable uh system. So that's the bubble

1223
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:22,359
at that point. When the system becomes

1224
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:22,359
unstable your bubble will burst.

1225
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:30,000
Uh so that's the part of the crowding

1226
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:34,079
behavior. So the purpose of showing that

1227
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:36,319
is when we look at portfolio management

1228
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:39,520
these type of bubble forming and

1229
01:04:36,319 --> 01:04:43,200
bursting process is a very important

1230
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:45,760
aspect of our understanding beyond the

1231
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:51,520
fundamental uh analysis right this is

1232
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:53,039
all about behavioral uh uh finance right

1233
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:54,799
um

1234
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:58,559
has nothing to do with the fundamental

1235
01:04:54,799 --> 01:05:01,680
of the economy or the fundamental of a

1236
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:04,000
But then you probably also have heard

1237
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:06,880
power law distribution, right? So what

1238
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:09,839
is power law distribution is the winner

1239
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:13,760
take all the 8020 rule or the Matthews

1240
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:17,599
effect. many different terms describing

1241
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:20,319
essentially a social phenomena that

1242
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:24,400
uh the

1243
01:05:20,319 --> 01:05:28,240
small number or percentage of the Asians

1244
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:31,760
taking a majority share of something in

1245
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:35,520
the in the group. So let's think about a

1246
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:37,359
wealth distribution, right? So 20% of

1247
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:41,760
the people probably have 80% of the

1248
01:05:37,359 --> 01:05:44,400
wealth and uh this is also true. You

1249
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:48,640
look at the top 20%

1250
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:52,160
within that 20% the top 20% has 80%

1251
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:54,880
wealth. Then within that is still true.

1252
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:56,480
This is so-called scale free or scale

1253
01:05:54,880 --> 01:06:00,160
invariance.

1254
01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:04,079
This is the unique property of power law

1255
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:08,240
distribution. So in mathematical terms,

1256
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:11,440
so the probability of B * X, X is the

1257
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:14,559
random variable, B is a scaling factor

1258
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:18,240
equal to some function of G of B times

1259
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:20,640
the probability of X. So this you can

1260
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:25,039
prove mathematically

1261
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:26,960
if and only if this P of X is a power

1262
01:06:25,039 --> 01:06:30,480
law distribution that scale-free

1263
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:33,599
property uh maintains.

1264
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:36,160
So example of power law distribution

1265
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:39,119
I mentioned the wealth distribution

1266
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:42,400
venture capital funds returns the top

1267
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:46,559
tier funds tend to get you know majority

1268
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:48,880
of the profit of the startup companies

1269
01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:52,480
there's a book published two years ago

1270
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:56,240
is called power law so by uh uh

1271
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:58,720
Sebastian uh Manaby uh you you should

1272
01:06:56,240 --> 01:07:02,720
check it out very interesting it's not

1273
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:06,400
mathematical but It talks about how the

1274
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:08,160
top tier VC firms winner take all uh

1275
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:11,760
phenomenon.

1276
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:15,760
City sizes same thing big cities gets

1277
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:18,640
bigger right why in the network theory

1278
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:21,200
because all the nodes want to connect to

1279
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:25,119
a more popular node to attract more

1280
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:28,799
traffic. So the in network space

1281
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:32,079
internet connections web pages or social

1282
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:37,440
uh media posts this type of power law is

1283
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:40,880
very common but in nature we've observed

1284
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:44,480
a lot of uh normal distributions

1285
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:48,240
such as height right so a lot of people

1286
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:51,920
probably centered around uh you know

1287
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:54,960
call it between five to around six uh uh

1288
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:58,720
feet, right? Maybe just under six feet.

1289
01:07:54,960 --> 01:08:01,680
Uh this the majority of the population.

1290
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:04,400
Uh it's not like most people are very

1291
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:07,119
short, but there are few giants really

1292
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:10,000
just much taller. So that's power law.

1293
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:12,799
Power law does not exist in the height

1294
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:15,920
distribution.

1295
01:08:12,799 --> 01:08:17,920
So now we comment on social many social

1296
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:19,920
phenomena obey power law distribution.

1297
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:25,120
But why? Right? This is the question

1298
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:27,600
always uh make me very curious.

1299
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:32,719
So what's the cause

1300
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:36,000
of such a skilled wealth distribution?

1301
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:37,759
So eventually I realized this actually

1302
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:41,920
has a lot to do with the crowd

1303
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:45,520
interaction. So the same mechanism we

1304
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:48,239
looked at earlier the agents

1305
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:52,080
have the feedback loop that's the reason

1306
01:08:48,239 --> 01:08:54,239
of the cost of this type of power law in

1307
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:57,520
nature you don't have that kind of a

1308
01:08:54,239 --> 01:08:59,839
feedback mechanism once you are born you

1309
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:03,199
grew to certain height your height

1310
01:08:59,839 --> 01:09:07,759
doesn't change but in social phenomenas

1311
01:09:03,199 --> 01:09:09,520
that is that's keep changing

1312
01:09:07,759 --> 01:09:12,400
So agents have different powers

1313
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:16,159
influencing the market in financial

1314
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:19,199
market. It can rich can get richer. So

1315
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:24,199
we need to model each agent differently.

1316
01:09:19,199 --> 01:09:24,199
So we call heterogeneous agents.

1317
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:30,960
So for a random variable uh x the normal

1318
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:34,719
distribution we're all familiar with

1319
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:39,199
right is the e to the x minus the mean /

1320
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:41,520
2 sigma square. But for power law people

1321
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:43,199
a lot of times get confused about the

1322
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:46,000
terminologies.

1323
01:09:43,199 --> 01:09:50,880
The parados's law talks about the

1324
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:53,040
cumulative uh uh density uh function uh

1325
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:57,840
of the probability

1326
01:09:53,040 --> 01:10:02,800
uh and uh zip zip zip's law talk about

1327
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:05,520
the rank of that uh uh outcome. So

1328
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:09,280
basically the random variable X versus

1329
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:11,840
the rank of X which is more displayed in

1330
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:15,199
this chart

1331
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:17,440
but they all related when we normally

1332
01:10:15,199 --> 01:10:20,239
look at the power uh power law in

1333
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:23,760
probability density function.

1334
01:10:20,239 --> 01:10:26,000
So that behaves like this versus the

1335
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:28,560
normal distribution. So even

1336
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:30,880
distribution of course is a you know

1337
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:33,840
delta function.

1338
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:36,719
So the parameters of these uh three

1339
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:40,400
different ways of representing power law

1340
01:10:36,719 --> 01:10:43,360
they are all linked by that formula. So

1341
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:47,360
power law probability density function

1342
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:51,280
is c overx to the power of a. A is

1343
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:56,400
related to uh the cumulative density

1344
01:10:51,280 --> 01:11:01,080
function power K as well as the zips zip

1345
01:10:56,400 --> 01:11:01,080
law of parameter B.

1346
01:11:01,199 --> 01:11:05,360
So if we look at the the feedback

1347
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:07,360
mechanism

1348
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:11,840
we can

1349
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:13,840
derive that the agents with more power

1350
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:17,199
in this case

1351
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:20,960
which is represented by a varying over

1352
01:11:17,199 --> 01:11:22,800
time can gain more power when they bet

1353
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:24,960
in the right direction that when the

1354
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:27,120
observation shows their betting is in

1355
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:29,199
the right direction.

1356
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:33,360
So that's how rich get richer. So that's

1357
01:11:29,199 --> 01:11:36,560
how concentration of power uh is formed.

1358
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:40,880
The super agents will be uh born in this

1359
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:44,080
case a system may may not become stable

1360
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:46,320
when that happens and uh I mean this

1361
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:49,199
actually can be expanded into a

1362
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:52,560
discussion of entropy you know what is

1363
01:11:49,199 --> 01:11:55,520
order what is stable but this is beyond

1364
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:58,400
the scope of uh this lecture.

1365
01:11:55,520 --> 01:12:01,520
uh just to come back why this is all

1366
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:04,480
relevant to portfolio uh management. So

1367
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:06,960
I want to summarize uh in this page of

1368
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:09,920
what we learned today.

1369
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:12,560
Um so portfolio management is about how

1370
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:15,280
to size each investment.

1371
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:18,480
You need to clarify your objectives. You

1372
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:20,640
need to know your loss to tolerance.

1373
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:22,800
Diversification helps but you need to

1374
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:25,440
rebalance.

1375
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:27,679
Volatility is not risk. Shop ratio

1376
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:31,120
doesn't capture skill nor provide

1377
01:12:27,679 --> 01:12:33,840
sizing. We should use the new ratio I

1378
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:36,320
presented to you. Capital market

1379
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:38,480
assumptions are not reliable and the

1380
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:40,400
crowding behavior can be pushed markets

1381
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:42,640
to extremes.

1382
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:47,280
You should pay attention to powerful

1383
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:49,840
super agents. Who are the most powerful

1384
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:53,600
super agents you can think about?

1385
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:56,960
Anybody has any idea in the market?

1386
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:59,040
Yes. Yeah. The Fed.

1387
01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:00,800
>> So when you invest in the market, you

1388
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:03,199
have to pay attention because they have

1389
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:06,080
such a big power to change the direction

1390
01:13:03,199 --> 01:13:08,159
of markets. Yeah.

1391
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:09,679
And uh in the old days, some hedge funds

1392
01:13:08,159 --> 01:13:11,440
have more power, but I would say

1393
01:13:09,679 --> 01:13:14,400
nowadays definitely the governments.

1394
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:18,480
Yeah. So you need to understand the key

1395
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:21,760
drivers of your portfolio. Um so I want

1396
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:25,199
to stop the lecture here. Uh I want to

1397
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:26,640
take some questions then I will save a

1398
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:29,440
couple of minutes talk about the

1399
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:33,040
investment game. But before I get there

1400
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:35,280
uh let's open up uh for questions.

1401
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:40,800
I packed in a lot of content for today.

1402
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:44,880
I know uh the idea is not necessary to

1403
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:46,400
uh ask you to follow in details because

1404
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:49,440
some of the math you probably need to

1405
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:51,760
derive it yourself to get a feel. But I

1406
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:54,000
want to give you the concepts what the

1407
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:55,840
portfolio construction is all about.

1408
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:58,880
It's about sizing, right? Of

1409
01:13:55,840 --> 01:14:01,440
investments. Sizing is about comparison

1410
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:04,719
about investments. So how to compare

1411
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:09,520
them? That's that's what it really comes

1412
01:14:04,719 --> 01:14:12,640
down to. Uh so for that

1413
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:16,000
please questions.

1414
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:17,600
>> Yes. questions about like so I know

1415
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,679
another thing that can influence

1416
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:22,159
investments is taxes that you have to

1417
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:24,480
pay on like the capital gains or how

1418
01:14:22,159 --> 01:14:26,719
long you hold something can vary like

1419
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:29,840
how much taxes you might pay or certain

1420
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:32,560
types of investments might be more tax

1421
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:35,840
sensitive than others is that something

1422
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:39,840
that is considered like

1423
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:42,400
in terms of like investment decisions

1424
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:45,520
>> yeah so that's a that's a great question

1425
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:47,199
you Endowments are taxfree, right?

1426
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:49,600
Right. So, don't consider that. But if

1427
01:14:47,199 --> 01:14:53,440
you run a family office, you have to be

1428
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:56,560
very uh careful to plan your capital

1429
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:58,960
gains, right? So, the family offices or

1430
01:14:56,560 --> 01:15:01,120
private investors tend to invest more in

1431
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:03,199
long-term private equity because they

1432
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:06,159
don't have to realize those gains. They

1433
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:08,400
invest less in public uh equity for the

1434
01:15:06,159 --> 01:15:10,159
tax reason. So, it is a very important

1435
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:13,280
uh parameter.

1436
01:15:10,159 --> 01:15:14,800
Yeah. Any

1437
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:17,840
other questions? Yes.

1438
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:19,280
>> What is the best risk measure?

1439
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:22,480
How should you measure risk?

1440
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:25,679
>> Uh so I I still think uh we should try

1441
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:29,280
to understand the uh potential loss or

1442
01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:34,000
expected loss. So that's the L I I

1443
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:36,560
discussed earlier. uh you know because

1444
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:39,280
people tend to think you know gain and

1445
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:41,360
loss are symmetrical but normally it's

1446
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:43,600
not the case right because you can

1447
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:46,480
construct your positions have a very

1448
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:48,480
asymmetrical payouts so you need to

1449
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:51,120
understand when when you buy an option

1450
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:52,960
of course your maximum loss is the

1451
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:56,560
option premium you're paid right it's

1452
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:58,560
very clear but when you buy a stock that

1453
01:15:56,560 --> 01:16:01,199
may not be so clear right so you need to

1454
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:03,920
understand how much the stock can lose

1455
01:16:01,199 --> 01:16:06,960
it can move down and the com what's

1456
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:09,440
likely range it can move down to and

1457
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:11,679
those kind of things so you need to I

1458
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:14,080
think the risk measurement should be

1459
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:16,719
shifted or focused more on the downside

1460
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:19,760
uh protection understand your downside

1461
01:16:16,719 --> 01:16:22,159
so which is really expected loss

1462
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:26,400
>> nice yeah the question of like expected

1463
01:16:22,159 --> 01:16:28,239
loss versus case loss how do you

1464
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:30,960
>> yeah those are two different things

1465
01:16:28,239 --> 01:16:33,120
right so roughly you can Think about

1466
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:36,480
worst loss maybe a you know few standard

1467
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:40,400
deviations away I mean expected loss

1468
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:44,080
probably is really the uh weighted

1469
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:48,400
average of outcome times the payout that

1470
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:51,120
kind of a thing uh so you cannot

1471
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:53,199
construct your portfolio all based on

1472
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:55,360
worst case then you will not be doing

1473
01:16:53,199 --> 01:16:58,640
anything right so but so that's why

1474
01:16:55,360 --> 01:17:00,239
expected loss is a probably a better way

1475
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:03,040
to uh measure

1476
01:17:00,239 --> 01:17:05,440
and for sizing your investments, but you

1477
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:07,840
need to be aware of your worst loss.

1478
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:08,719
Yeah. In in case something happens.

1479
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:10,080
Yeah. Yes.

1480
01:17:08,719 --> 01:17:11,760
>> I was going to say going off the worst

1481
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:13,679
case loss kind of like when would you

1482
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:15,840
implement stop losses? How effective

1483
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:18,320
have you found those? Um just kind of

1484
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:21,760
like a little bit more on that as well.

1485
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:23,679
>> Yeah. So, uh yeah, you you I think this

1486
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:26,640
is a very good question both of you uh

1487
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:29,520
brought up. Uh stop-loss is an

1488
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:31,520
interesting concept, right? So stop loss

1489
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:33,760
uh typically is not set at the worst

1490
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:36,960
loss, right? It's kind of set usually

1491
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:39,920
quite close uh probably even closer than

1492
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:42,560
the expected loss. They uh if you're

1493
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:45,280
trading at the hedge fund platforms,

1494
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:48,960
they give you a very tight stop-loss uh

1495
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:52,560
for the reason that they try to

1496
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:54,320
artificially construct asymmetric payout

1497
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:56,560
for the portfolio managers or the

1498
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:58,880
traders. When you lose a little bit,

1499
01:17:56,560 --> 01:18:01,199
they cut your position in half, then you

1500
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:03,440
lose another few percentage points, cut

1501
01:18:01,199 --> 01:18:06,640
another half, then get you out. So when

1502
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:09,440
you make money, they try to uh let you

1503
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:14,080
ride on the wins to create that kind of

1504
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:17,679
a asymmetric optionality. But uh uh that

1505
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:19,840
forces you to pick investment has that

1506
01:18:17,679 --> 01:18:22,239
kind of a probability distribution,

1507
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:26,000
right? So if you think a investment has

1508
01:18:22,239 --> 01:18:28,800
a worst case loss which is uh very bad

1509
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:31,600
but has a very low probability let's

1510
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:34,159
just say right and uh so you need to you

1511
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:36,480
need to think about you know if that

1512
01:18:34,159 --> 01:18:39,280
almost like uh the firm that takes that

1513
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:41,679
risk for you right because they they are

1514
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:44,159
responsible to cut you out right but if

1515
01:18:41,679 --> 01:18:47,280
you think the upside is very big then

1516
01:18:44,159 --> 01:18:49,360
you should take that bet right you get

1517
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:50,880
it Yeah.

1518
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:51,679
>> Worst case scenario, you get fired, but

1519
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:52,560
for them

1520
01:18:51,679 --> 01:18:53,520
>> Yeah.

1521
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:54,880
>> Right.

1522
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:57,360
>> Right. That's kind of that's Yeah.

1523
01:18:54,880 --> 01:19:00,000
That's the kind of the the you know, a

1524
01:18:57,360 --> 01:19:02,239
lot of the issues with uh uh hedge

1525
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:05,440
funds, right? They get a cut on the

1526
01:19:02,239 --> 01:19:08,000
profit, but they don't bear the downside

1527
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:11,440
responsibilities, right? So, they long

1528
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:13,199
they are long a free call option. So,

1529
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:17,080
yeah. So, that's why a lot of people

1530
01:19:13,199 --> 01:19:17,080
want to be a hedge fund manager.

1531
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:22,719
So I I will just touch upon the

1532
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:25,520
investment game. Okay. Uh we already uh

1533
01:19:22,719 --> 01:19:28,960
talk about it. When we pass November

1534
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:31,679
15th, we can you know look you you

1535
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:34,719
should keep track of G and L numbers and

1536
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:38,159
uh uh let us know how you performed and

1537
01:19:34,719 --> 01:19:39,760
I I will try to verify. But last slide I

1538
01:19:38,159 --> 01:19:41,920
want just you know coming back to the

1539
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:45,520
point a lot of people ask how to become

1540
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:47,600
a hedge fund manager right? So I wonder

1541
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:52,080
I maybe I want to pull you the audience

1542
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:54,159
here a little bit. Uh is there a value

1543
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:56,800
you know you think from that trading or

1544
01:19:54,159 --> 01:19:59,440
investment game to do some paper trading

1545
01:19:56,800 --> 01:20:02,719
games or do you think you want more

1546
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:05,679
lectures on the research process how to

1547
01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:08,320
do data collection signal generation the

1548
01:20:05,679 --> 01:20:10,239
know back testing all the all the things

1549
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:13,679
and the portfolio optimization as we

1550
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:16,800
talk about today or some people say I

1551
01:20:13,679 --> 01:20:19,120
just want to uh learn more about how to

1552
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:21,280
become a manager how to do fundraising

1553
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:25,120
how to build a team, how to negotiate

1554
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:28,800
the terms and how to uh assemble systems

1555
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:33,199
and back office legal taxes and so on.

1556
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:36,159
Uh so I'm actually thinking maybe

1557
01:20:33,199 --> 01:20:39,520
there's something you know we as an

1558
01:20:36,159 --> 01:20:42,239
organization or some other people should

1559
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:46,239
really just help the younger uh

1560
01:20:42,239 --> 01:20:49,360
potential PMs a little more uh to

1561
01:20:46,239 --> 01:20:52,159
incubate them to become a a better found

1562
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:56,000
manager. Uh if anyone of you think

1563
01:20:52,159 --> 01:20:59,199
that's something uh valid this this idea

1564
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:02,320
you can talk to me you know email me or

1565
01:20:59,199 --> 01:21:06,719
just come to me after class uh maybe

1566
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:09,760
this something in beyond what we talk in

1567
01:21:06,719 --> 01:21:11,679
this class could be useful to any one of

1568
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:16,000
you.

1569
01:21:11,679 --> 01:21:16,000
So with that uh thank you very
