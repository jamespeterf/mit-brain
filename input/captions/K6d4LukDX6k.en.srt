1
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:08,320
All right, I think we are ready for this

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,960
first session. My name is Dontis. I'm

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:16,080
from Mos University and I'm also a part

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:17,840
of the NF NF um center and uh I'm

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,880
chairing this session and I have been

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:24,000
really looking forward to uh to hearing

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:27,680
uh these three speakers and the session

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,000
is on scaling variant interpretation and

9
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:34,480
the first speaker is Ruth Lo and Ruth is

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,239
um professor at the Novonics Foundation

11
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,960
Center for Metabolic uh re research at

12
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,800
the University of Copenhagen and the No

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,280
Foundation Center for Genomic Mechanisms

14
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,760
of Disease at Broad Institute. So,

15
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,520
welcome Ruth.

16
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,640
>> Uh good morning. Thank you so much for

17
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,199
having me and thank you for the

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,960
introduction Dita. My talk is on the

19
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,480
genetics of obesity and more

20
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,199
specifically and how we actually

21
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,760
shouldn't curate uh our phenotype in

22
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:05,280
this case obesity to to get to the next

23
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:07,680
level of uh of uh variant to function

24
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,159
translation.

25
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,760
So very briefly, my disclosures have no

26
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:16,320
effect on anything I tell you. So no no

27
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,240
secrets here. Obesity is a traditional

28
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,080
common disease just like type 2

29
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,560
diabetes, cardiovascular disease. The

30
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,439
environment has an important impact over

31
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,320
the past 30 40 years. Uh the prevalence

32
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,560
of obesity has doubled, tripled. Uh and

33
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,520
that's definitely driven by a changing

34
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,840
environment. We eat more, we move less.

35
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,000
Um but it's in particular people who are

36
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,000
genetically susceptible who will respond

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,479
to this environment and who will gain me

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,960
more more than people who are not so

39
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,439
much uh uh uh susceptible. So the

40
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,640
heritability has been estimated to be 40

41
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:53,280
to 70%. Which is considered and again

42
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,799
very similar to other complex diseases.

43
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,520
Maybe different from other complex

44
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,360
diseases is that obesity is a very

45
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,280
visible public disease but I'm not going

46
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,320
to talk about that today. But it's also

47
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,479
a very early onset disease unlike type

48
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,560
two diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

49
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,000
So that's when we think about um

50
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,080
prevention. That's something we need to

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,400
take into account. Furthermore, it's

52
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,920
also a disease that involves a lot of

53
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,920
organs uh or tissues, not just the

54
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,160
brain, not just the fat cell, but when

55
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,000
it comes to like connecting obesity with

56
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,080
coorbidities, many other tissues and

57
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,080
organs are involved.

58
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:32,480
Um when it comes to gene discovery, it's

59
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:34,160
been actually um a very successful um uh

60
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,640
pathway I would say is that we started

61
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,360
in 2007 with a discovery of FTO with

62
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:42,640
only a sample size of 5,000 individuals

63
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,040
and then over time we've identified more

64
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,040
and more variance mostly because we

65
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,840
increase the sample size more and more

66
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,560
and many of these efforts have been uh

67
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,519
like uh driven by the giant consortium

68
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,720
like headed by Joel Joel Hershorn

69
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,800
And uh by now we have more than 1,700

70
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,959
variants that have been identified

71
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,440
mostly associated with body mass index

72
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,319
or first identified for body mass index.

73
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,959
A few have been identified uh for other

74
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,720
adepositi related phenotypes.

75
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:16,159
And what we've learned in the context of

76
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:18,239
the biology is that uh the brain is a

77
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:22,400
central is a central organ probably

78
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:25,040
affecting um uh like our um hunger,

79
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,519
satiety, reward systems uh in the brain.

80
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,280
The hypocampus lyic systems like are are

81
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:33,040
driving this whole process. You see here

82
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,840
this is a uh a nice figure from from

83
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:39,599
2015 but it is still the case. Not much

84
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:41,920
has changed uh since then. Um but the

85
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:44,159
variant to function translation has been

86
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,560
very slow.

87
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:49,440
FDO was the first discovered uh

88
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,080
phenotype almost 20 years or 18 years

89
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,680
now. You see very nice signal disease

90
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,599
again from an older paper where the p

91
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,239
value is 10 to the minus 60. Now we're

92
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:00,319
at like 10 to the minus 200. And

93
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,000
initially we thought that FDO was the

94
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:05,280
causal gene and there was quite a few

95
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,280
papers in cell in nature nature genetics

96
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,560
that showed very credible results for

97
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:14,000
FDO as a causal gene within uh within

98
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,560
the context of obesity but soon after uh

99
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,639
the discovery others researchers started

100
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,440
to venture out like some thought it was

101
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:24,080
RPG group 1L uh that was the causal gene

102
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,000
because it's encodes the the basil body

103
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,240
of the primary celia which we know from

104
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,800
the barbeetle syndrome because of

105
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,280
obesity but like others including

106
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,440
Molina's team thought it was more IRX3

107
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,600
or even further down IRX 5 that was the

108
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,320
causal gene so there was a little bit of

109
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:43,440
um discussion in the field but then over

110
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,680
time things got clearer and maybe uh

111
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:50,320
this story got concluded with the paper

112
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:52,560
in science by uh uh the Marcela nogo and

113
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,720
Molina's team where they in indeed

114
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,759
concluded that the signal here in FDO

115
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:01,040
within neurons and preadiposytes seem to

116
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,720
reach to IRX3 and IRX5 and that may be

117
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,360
sort of the causal genes within these

118
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,039
locus and this is just an example to

119
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,520
tell you it's like it took them quite a

120
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:12,880
few like took them about 14 years to

121
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,560
come to that conclusion and there's,700

122
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,240
variants actually that are waiting to be

123
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,240
translated. Maybe there's like a dozen

124
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,759
of variants that have been translated

125
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,240
from variant to function within the

126
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:25,039
context of obesity but that's about it.

127
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:28,160
within my team we've tried to approach

128
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,840
the variant of function in a more uh

129
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,840
it's like bionirmatic ways like a

130
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:37,039
statistical way because I don't do

131
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:39,199
actually lab work uh so Diane um used I

132
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,880
think about eight approaches that were

133
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,600
were at the time that she was doing

134
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:46,800
these analyses to to do the gene

135
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:49,120
prioritization and then uh she counted

136
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,000
how much the same gene was prioritized

137
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,720
by the by the different approaches

138
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,960
Uh so here summarized in this upset

139
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,639
plot. For example, here you see that

140
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,960
here are the different approaches that

141
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:04,240
she considered for the gene

142
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:06,960
prioritization and you see that uh 86

143
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,360
genes were were prioritized by four

144
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:14,639
approaches and could be any combination.

145
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:17,759
Um 34 genes by five and uh six gene by

146
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:20,400
uh six. So that's not all approaches but

147
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,639
uh these are these six genes and I won't

148
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,120
go into the detail but some of them are

149
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,880
indeed like confirmed uh or not

150
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,440
necessarily confirmed but also supported

151
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:32,080
by animal studies that they may play a

152
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,479
role in in obesity context and not

153
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:38,000
always uh they do not always point to

154
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:40,639
the brain but often also like a deep

155
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,199
side biology and then another project

156
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,360
that is in process and this also is like

157
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,520
a collaboration with Molina's team like

158
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,759
is Virginia. She's doing using a more

159
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:54,240
multi-omics approach where we go from

160
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:56,960
snip to BMI uh through uh maybe gene

161
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:00,319
expression and proteomics data. So what

162
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:04,240
she did is she combined uh all the uh

163
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:05,919
publicly available EQL data uh across

164
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,240
multiple tissues. Sometimes she did a

165
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:10,800
meta meta analysis. She did the same for

166
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:14,800
the proteomics data and used that in her

167
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,479
analysis to um basically uh align all

168
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,800
the variants that we have and I should

169
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,400
have emphasized these are the the 500

170
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,639
variants that have been reported in the

171
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:26,160
Yangoidal paper which is the latest

172
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:29,599
giant paper. uh she prioritized 413

173
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:32,000
genes in 189 lowi. Again an upset plot

174
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:35,039
but the main message here is that again

175
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,800
the brain remains the most uh the tissue

176
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,039
in which the most genes are being

177
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,919
prioritized or seem to be playing a role

178
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:43,680
but other tissues are now also popping

179
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,160
up.

180
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,840
She then overlated so here are her

181
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,560
results uh based on the

182
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,160
collocicalization with EQL and PQL QTL

183
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,039
data. She overlaid that with the data

184
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:57,039
from from Diane right here and then

185
00:07:55,039 --> 00:08:00,319
overlay that also with the results from

186
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:02,639
CS2G and you see there's 37 genes that

187
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:05,599
are prioritized by all three methods and

188
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:08,479
now she focuses on these 37. Uh here are

189
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:10,319
some of them to to really summarize the

190
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,000
data in a paper that will be coming out

191
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,000
soon. So this is a plot that we use

192
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,160
where we have a variant the genes that

193
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,720
are prioritized in which tissue. So it's

194
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:22,960
just a lot of data to really summarize

195
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:25,120
into uh one uh nice uh story but that's

196
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,879
coming up because what's next is

197
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,720
actually is like the giant consortium

198
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,440
has been working so I haven't updated

199
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,360
this plot uh since 2021 and that's not

200
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,760
because I've been lazy but it's mostly

201
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,760
because there haven't been that many new

202
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,760
discovery uh studies. The giant

203
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,959
consortium has been working on a meta

204
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:45,680
analysis. uh giant itself combined the

205
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:48,240
data of 2.1 million individuals and then

206
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:51,040
collaborate with 23 ME. So now we have a

207
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:55,360
meta analysis 5.6 million people and

208
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:57,360
this is um so now we have uh really

209
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,600
9,000 LOSA actually that we have

210
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,160
identified and the Manhattan plot looks

211
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,959
like this.

212
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,440
It's funny. Um

213
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:11,120
so the the the the significance

214
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:14,240
threshold is right here and you ask like

215
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:17,120
uh sometimes is it's like uh too much

216
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,360
data not not necessarily helpful. So

217
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,519
what can we do with this kind of data?

218
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,200
We we thought like let's start with the

219
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,440
easy things instead of varant to

220
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,760
function let's just do make a new

221
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,519
genetic score and we published that like

222
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,519
uh in the in the summer it's a rule of

223
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:35,440
let this effort. So now we made a

224
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:37,519
polygenic score um uh that that works

225
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,760
actually really well like better than

226
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,760
than the previously reported genetic

227
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,839
scores. You see here the results in the

228
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,519
European ancestry like let's focus on

229
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,000
the blue dot here like the explained

230
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,920
variance is now 17.5%

231
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,120
and we see actually it does pretty well

232
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:55,680
in other um ancestries

233
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,640
in central south Asian east Asian middle

234
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:01,120
eastern at mixed American but not still

235
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,360
not uh in in populations of African

236
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,760
ancestry. So that's definitely needs

237
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,839
more work and maybe starting point of of

238
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,399
predominantly European data is is not

239
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,480
the way to go. uh the prediction of

240
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:16,079
obesity has gotten better. So here are

241
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:19,279
the results in biomeds bio bank veterans

242
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:21,760
program UK bio bank for obesity class

243
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:26,160
one which is BMI over 30 then class 2

244
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:29,440
over 35 and class 3 is over 40 and um

245
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:31,360
focus on these results here then you see

246
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,720
that the the area under the receiver

247
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:37,120
operating curve is is getting pretty

248
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,120
good so it's like 7 for just your

249
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,920
regular obesity and you have to keep in

250
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:45,440
mind like that obesity is still 50% %

251
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:47,360
heritable, 50% or 50% genetic, 50%

252
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,519
environment. So we'll we'll never be

253
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,560
perfect in predicting uh regular or

254
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:54,959
common obesity. So 72 is is pretty good.

255
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,560
And as we go to more extreme obesity, we

256
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,959
get better. And maybe that is because

257
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,959
more extreme obesity is maybe even more

258
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:03,680
genetic than just your common forms of

259
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:05,519
obesity. And we see this already at a

260
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,279
very young age. You see, it's like from

261
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:10,959
this is data from the Alps study from

262
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:13,200
zero to 25 years. And we have three

263
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:16,399
curves with the the people who are in

264
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:19,200
the lower desile of the uh the polygenic

265
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:22,000
score in red, the people in the top

266
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,880
desile in blue and then the average in

267
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,880
yellow. And you see already at age five

268
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,120
that genetic predisposition is coming

269
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,440
through. Um and it puts you on the track

270
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,760
throughout life uh to be heavier or

271
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,880
leaner than than the average depending

272
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:39,200
on where you are. Another thing we're

273
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:43,200
doing right now is is led by Victor

274
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:46,480
who's also here um is just building on

275
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:49,279
on the uh the the idea that genetics can

276
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:52,399
support uh drug development. We using

277
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:54,720
the giant data to to look in how how

278
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:58,079
many of the lossi indeed provide support

279
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:00,320
for uh gene uh for drug discovery. So

280
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:04,240
this is very preliminary preliminary

281
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:08,639
data. Um so out of the 9,000 LOSI we

282
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:11,600
prioritize 7,000 genes and 700 of these

283
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:14,320
genes actually are already the target of

284
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,639
either approved drugs or drugs that are

285
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,279
close to get on to the market but not

286
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:21,760
for weight loss. Um so the question is

287
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:24,079
here that how many of these drugs that

288
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:27,519
are approved or in in in the in the

289
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:30,240
process of of approval could be used to

290
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:34,240
for repurposing in the context of uh

291
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:37,519
weight loss. And then among the uh new

292
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,279
targets that are not currently um or

293
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,320
among the the new genes that are

294
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:45,680
currently not target for uh uh current

295
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,600
drugs, how many could be new targets?

296
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,519
And there we use the data from the uh

297
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,760
illuminating drugable genome initiative.

298
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,800
And here we see that again about 800

299
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:57,120
genes are predicted to be druggable with

300
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:00,000
high confidence. So maybe among those

301
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,639
there's maybe new anti-obesity targets.

302
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,079
Uh of those 700 so most of them are

303
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:09,279
anti- antibbody druggable and 100 of

304
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:12,079
those are small molecule drugable. Again

305
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:14,160
very preliminary data. uh but this these

306
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:16,240
are projects basically to avoid the real

307
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,040
task which is the variant to function

308
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,959
right so because uh remember I told this

309
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,399
maybe a dozen of variants associated

310
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,959
with body mass index that have been

311
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,680
translated into function but now we have

312
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:29,519
9,000 uh it's a little overwhelming it's

313
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,320
been taken a long time for us to really

314
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:34,560
write up the story into a a concise and

315
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,880
meaningful paper

316
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,480
um and maybe the real problem is is is

317
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,200
is

318
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,440
not just um the amount of data but is

319
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:47,120
also the phenotype. Some people have

320
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:49,519
tried to um shortcut the the variant to

321
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,839
function by uh focusing on rare

322
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,839
variants. Uh here you see a few

323
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,079
initiatives. Uh the giant consortium

324
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,680
here used the exone chip quite a while

325
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,360
ago. It was a cheap way to get to the

326
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,160
rare variants. We had 700,000

327
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,959
individuals find actually three variants

328
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,959
that are truly rare uh below the 1%

329
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:09,680
level including the two variants in the

330
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:12,160
JIP receptor. These are coding variants.

331
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:15,360
um a paper by Regeneron that combined

332
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:17,519
data of 600,000 people identified 16

333
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,519
genes mostly focusing their paper on

334
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,120
GPR75.

335
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,560
We don't know yet whether that's a real

336
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,720
drug target but they are definitely

337
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,120
working on that and then there's a

338
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,279
recent paper by the Cambridge group

339
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,839
combining data of 400,000 individuals

340
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:34,480
and their paper mostly focused on

341
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:38,240
bassoon. This is just to say that this

342
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:40,000
seems an an efficient way to to go from

343
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:43,360
varant to function within the obesity

344
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:47,760
field. Um but you still need a lot of

345
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:50,720
data uh for a few targets. Um so maybe

346
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,480
the problem is not so much uh with with

347
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,880
the amount of data. It seems that we

348
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,720
have a lot of data but maybe it's the

349
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,199
problem is really with the phenotype

350
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,360
body mass index. Everyone agrees that

351
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:03,199
it's actually not a very good uh

352
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,959
phenotype.

353
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:07,120
um because it's pretty crude and it's

354
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:09,600
far from the real biology. So in my

355
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:12,320
group we've really been focusing on

356
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:15,920
curating the phenotypes uh focusing on

357
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:19,360
more refined adiposity traits. Um, one

358
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:21,440
study is is focused on um, body

359
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,800
composition really and and tomorrow

360
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,480
Victor will uh, talk about this this I

361
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,480
think it's like an exciting study where

362
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,800
we look at variance associated with

363
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,399
muscle mass and fat mass in the same

364
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,240
direction or in the opposite direction.

365
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,000
He'll tell you more about that. I'll

366
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,240
tell you a little more about the

367
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
uncoupling of obesity from its

368
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,399
coorbidities and that that's coming

369
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,360
next. But we're also focusing on using

370
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:49,600
PETCT scan data from medical records of

371
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:51,600
Copenhagen Hospital um to to quantify

372
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,720
brown adapost tissue activity but also

373
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,959
other uh other depositive phenotypes and

374
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,639
that's uh very much in in development as

375
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,320
well. So we use AI to do the

376
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,519
quantification

377
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:06,639
and um we also focusing on fat

378
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:09,680
distribution. So obesity is is it's not

379
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:12,959
only about too much um adiposity but

380
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:15,279
also where exactly you will store it and

381
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:17,279
uh we also increasingly focusing on

382
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:19,360
biomarkers particularly with the

383
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:21,199
proteomics uh becoming increasingly

384
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,759
available. This this promises to be an

385
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:26,000
exciting field as well. So today I want

386
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,759
to focus on on this story and actually

387
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,399
just got published last week in nature

388
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:33,199
medicine and is led by Natalie Shami

389
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:36,399
who's here as well today and uh by JJ

390
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:38,399
Wang. So what we did is we did not do a

391
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,160
case control analysis of healthy obese

392
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,360
individuals versus unhealthy obese

393
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,600
individuals because there's a lot of

394
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:46,399
discussion about that but we we looked

395
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,079
at uh these phenotypes body mass index

396
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:51,680
body fat percentage and waist hip ratio

397
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:54,000
on one hand and uh these cardabolic risk

398
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,800
factors on the other hand. So lipids

399
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,519
blood pressure and glucose and insulin

400
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,279
and what we did is uh so this story

401
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,279
actually builds on a previous story

402
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:05,679
where where we use summary statistics.

403
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:08,079
So here we use individual level data of

404
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,839
mostly of the UK bio bank. So what we

405
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:13,439
did is we take a distribution of body

406
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:16,640
mass indexes. It's it's right skewed but

407
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:18,240
we made a standard normal a normal dist

408
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,799
a normal distribution with a mean of

409
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:24,079
zero standard deviation of one. And we

410
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:25,919
did the same for all the traits um and

411
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:28,240
also for the card metabolic trait. So

412
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:32,240
each phenotype is now on the same

413
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:34,480
distribution and um we made a new

414
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,520
phenotype by subtracting one from the

415
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:40,559
other. Say my body mass index is plus

416
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,799
three on the BMI side but minus3 on the

417
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,320
LDL side. So the if you subtract one

418
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:46,000
from the other depending on which one

419
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,799
you extract. Now I'm all of a sudden

420
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,360
plus six. So that becomes a whole new

421
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:53,760
distribution and now we did the G was on

422
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:56,480
that new distribution. So if I'm plus

423
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,000
six, it means that I'm a healthy obese.

424
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,600
I'm a person with healthy obesity

425
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,280
because I have a high BMI and low LDL.

426
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,440
If you're minus 6, you're the opposite.

427
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,000
You have may have a low poly index, but

428
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,160
you have a high LDL. And we did that for

429
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,559
BMI and LDL, but we did that for all

430
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:15,440
these possible combinations. So we did

431
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:19,120
uh created 24 new phenotypes. We did a G

432
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,640
G was across these 24 um new phenotypes.

433
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,200
We made sure that the signals we

434
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:27,919
observed are collocicalized and we ended

435
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:31,520
up with 205 new lossi in 206 with 206

436
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:35,200
independent association signals.

437
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:41,120
So just to confirm uh we then made uh a

438
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:43,600
score of these 206 uh loi or 266 loi. So

439
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,840
we have the uncoupling score because we

440
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,160
really look at how adiposity is

441
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,400
uncoupled from these cardabolic risk

442
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:53,840
factors and we compare it with your

443
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:56,880
typical um unhealthy obesity score you

444
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:59,280
could say it. So red is is the healthy

445
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,360
score. Uh blue is the unhealthy score.

446
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,200
And you indeed see like if you do the

447
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,120
association within the UK bio bank

448
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,799
there's no effect on height but you

449
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:11,120
quickly see that um the um the

450
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:13,760
difference is particularly visible in

451
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:16,240
the VAT SAT ratio where if you have an

452
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,080
unhealthy score there's not so much an

453
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,919
effect and I should here's the null line

454
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,520
but if you have a healthy score you

455
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:25,200
actually have a favorable fat

456
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:27,840
distribution and you see the same for um

457
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,440
waist to hip ratio uh where the

458
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,120
unhealthy score is a source with a

459
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,960
higher waist ratio where the healthy

460
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:36,160
score does not have too much an effect

461
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:38,480
on fat distribution. Um it's more

462
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,960
visible if you look at the uh risk

463
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,799
factors where here is the null line and

464
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,679
you see that the healthy score lies

465
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:48,160
mostly on the inside uh on the negative

466
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:50,400
side. So the protective side of this uh

467
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,480
radar plot meaning is it's associated

468
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,600
with lower blood pressure, lower glucose

469
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:58,080
levels um lower HBO and C triglycerate

470
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:00,559
and of course higher HCL as expected

471
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:03,760
whereas the unhealthy score is also as

472
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:05,840
expected uh lies on the the outside. So

473
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,880
this is just for confirming that what we

474
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:11,039
find is indeed healthy obesity versus

475
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,280
unhealthy obesity.

476
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:15,520
uh we do a FI was we did a FI was within

477
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:18,240
UK bio bank and indeed we see like a

478
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:21,120
nice confirmation that both scores are

479
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,440
associated with increased obesity but

480
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:26,960
the unhealthy score is indeed associated

481
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:30,080
with higher risk of um type 2 diabetes

482
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:32,480
hypertension and the uh healthy score is

483
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:35,200
has a protective effect of interest is

484
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:38,960
of course that the or the association

485
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,720
with other diseases um not the non-card

486
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:44,320
metabolic diseases that seem to be

487
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:47,760
associated with um weightbearing

488
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:50,799
diseases such as cellulitis um uh

489
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:52,400
varicose veins and so much. So it's of

490
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:54,559
course a bit tricky to call it healthy

491
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:57,039
and unhealthy because in the end uh the

492
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:59,039
risks of the people with a high healthy

493
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:01,120
obesity score uh they're still

494
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:05,120
associated with these these diseases in

495
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:07,520
the same way as unhealthy score. uh we

496
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:10,240
also confirm these results in uh

497
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:12,400
children uh focus on the cardioidabolic

498
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,000
risk factors. If children with a healthy

499
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,799
score and they're at around the age of

500
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,679
11 and 12 they already at that age you

501
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:21,760
see that they have a protective profile

502
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:25,120
compared to children with a high score

503
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:27,200
on the unhealthy score. If you look at

504
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,280
the card metabolic uh of if you look at

505
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,159
tissue enrichment analyses with the

506
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:34,400
healthy uh variance the it's

507
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,640
particularly the peripheral tissues that

508
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:39,760
show up adipos tissue abdominal fat and

509
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:43,120
so on but also cartilage adrenal stomach

510
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:45,520
uh whereas the unhealthy score uh in in

511
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:48,720
similar to the BMI score is associated

512
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,480
with um uh the central nervous systems

513
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,559
because clearly different biology that

514
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,720
is being observed. We also look at the

515
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,880
proteins. We know from the UK bio bank

516
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,640
data that high body mass index is

517
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,559
associated with high protein levels

518
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,000
probably because this the bigger you are

519
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:04,159
the higher the levels. That makes sense

520
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,440
and that's shown in this data from from

521
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:10,240
Sunidal. So when we looked at at the

522
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:13,600
scores and their association with um the

523
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:15,440
the the UK bio bank proteins um the

524
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,120
unhealthy score which has some more

525
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,960
power is associated with more proteins.

526
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:23,200
The unhealthy score is also associated

527
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:26,080
with 337 proteins. 28 are associated in

528
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:30,559
in uh are overlapping.

529
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:32,400
Um of the overlapping proteins 85% are

530
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:34,720
in the same direction and this what you

531
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,919
see here. This is somewhat like there's

532
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,760
three dimensions to this plot. Um on the

533
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,679
right hand side means higher adiposity,

534
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,080
higher cardabolic disease for the red

535
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:46,240
dots. Uh but for the yellow dots it

536
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,960
means like a higher adiposity lower card

537
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,120
metabolic risk and on the left hand side

538
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,919
lower adiposity lower card metabolic

539
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:56,640
risk for the for the red dots again and

540
00:22:53,919 --> 00:23:01,520
for uh the yellow dots lower adiposity

541
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:03,520
higher card metabolic risk. Um so these

542
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,600
176 proteins are they're actually

543
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:08,320
consistent your the traditional

544
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:11,280
adiposity proteins leptin fatty acid

545
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:13,679
binding proteins uh you see them pop up

546
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,520
uh in both uh at both plots on the same

547
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:18,240
time and the same like with with some

548
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:20,640
others on on this side. So these we call

549
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:23,760
these proteins are adipositely driven.

550
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:26,240
What about the 15% others? There's about

551
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,080
32 proteins that are actually going in

552
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:31,039
the opposite direction. So they will

553
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:34,000
show up here in the red dots but here on

554
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:35,600
the on the yellow dots and on this side

555
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,000
on the red dots and here on the yellow

556
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:46,400
dots. So for example um growth hormone

557
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:48,720
receptor LDL receptor apo um F uh FGF-21

558
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:52,080
um like too much data to really go into

559
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:54,000
the detail right now. Um but for us it

560
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,240
it suggests that they're they're not

561
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
driven by adiposity as such because then

562
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,760
they would lie on the same side but now

563
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,200
they lie on the other side and what

564
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,600
could explain here is that they're

565
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,520
driven by uh the health status the card

566
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,159
metabolic health status and then there's

567
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:11,360
another and then go a little faster.

568
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:13,120
There's 129 proteins that only show up

569
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,520
for the uncoupling even though this

570
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:19,039
uncoupling score has less power than the

571
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:21,440
uh unhealthy score. uh we see adipoq as

572
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:24,640
expected to show up uh lipoprotein

573
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,480
lipase myostatin so there's a lot of

574
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:29,279
interesting proteins that are showing up

575
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:32,159
to be associated with uh either score

576
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:35,840
telling us more about the biology

577
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:39,600
going a little faster um I showed you

578
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:42,159
like that we have one uh set of 206 uh

579
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,240
prote um genes that are associated or

580
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,559
variants that are associated with this

581
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:50,080
unh this healthy profile but actually

582
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:52,799
they also cluster within uh multiple um

583
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:55,840
subclusters. For example, here these are

584
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:57,679
the it's a heat plot. These are the 266

585
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,559
variants associate body fat percentage

586
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:02,080
and body mass index and by definition

587
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:04,400
because that's how we discovered them

588
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:06,320
with a protective profile with any of

589
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,640
these cardabolic risk factors. But you

590
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:11,120
see they clusters this cluster three is

591
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:14,080
a source with lower body fat uh lower

592
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:17,919
blood pressure. Cluster five with lower

593
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:20,240
glycemic traits. Cluster six uh with a

594
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:22,000
healthier lipid profile. Cluster one is

595
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,480
pretty complicated because it has a

596
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,799
healthy profile for triglycerides but

597
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,559
unhealthy for glycemic traits. And then

598
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:30,240
four, seven, and eight, they're actually

599
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:33,360
more globally associated with a

600
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,640
healthier profile. So combining u oh

601
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,039
yeah and then we did a variant to

602
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:39,120
function prioritization binatically

603
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:41,120
overlay with GTEx data and then in

604
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,720
collaboration with Molina also using

605
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,200
CS2G

606
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,679
and uh combining all that data and

607
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,919
knowing the the clusters in which these

608
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:52,559
variants fall and sort of having that

609
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:55,039
more refined phenotype for each of these

610
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:57,840
variants we were able to prioritize some

611
00:25:55,039 --> 00:26:00,240
of these genes um better than we we

612
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:02,320
could without that information. So here

613
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,919
I'm just going through it highlighting

614
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,760
some of these genes. If any of these

615
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:08,080
genes are familiar like please let me

616
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:10,400
know because we're now working on like

617
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:12,320
the v the real variant of function. So

618
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,320
even though this study was published the

619
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:17,039
study is not complete and we're working

620
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:22,000
with Molina's team uh and one posted in

621
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:25,120
my group Molina um um uh uh Elonor

622
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,279
Manita is is here uh doing this real

623
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,600
variant of function in the lab with with

624
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:32,159
Molina's team.

625
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:35,279
Um this is just to say and maybe to

626
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:37,120
conclude that it's like uh gene

627
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:39,120
discovery is maybe complete but we

628
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:41,360
really need to work more on curating the

629
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:43,840
phenotype to get the phenotypes closer

630
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,600
to the biology to to facilitate and make

631
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,200
it make it much easier to do the variant

632
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,360
to function translation. So it's

633
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,200
important to just not forget about the

634
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:54,559
phenotype.

635
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:58,400
So uh just to point out that the biology

636
00:26:54,559 --> 00:27:00,000
that we implicated with uh the the the

637
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,400
genes that we have identified are the

638
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,480
ones that we've identified before. Uh

639
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,320
but actually now with the with the more

640
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,640
data we we've we strengthened these

641
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,640
observations and we actually identified

642
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,880
a few new pathways that seem important

643
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:16,720
in the variant to function translation.

644
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:19,120
Just to say like identifying uh variance

645
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:22,159
is not hard but genetics may help

646
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:25,679
elucidate the the heterogeneity within

647
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:28,159
obesity or any complex trait. Uh we see

648
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:30,799
multiple loi that couple uncouple

649
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:32,320
adiposity from its coorbidities. uh

650
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:35,840
multiple mechanisms seem to be

651
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:38,320
underlying and by combining this like

652
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,640
better description of the phenotype with

653
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:43,679
uh the the variant to function

654
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:47,039
translation I think we may like expedite

655
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:48,640
uh the actual uh variant to biology uh

656
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:51,679
observations

657
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:54,080
very grateful to my team at CBMR at the

658
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:56,480
icon institute as well uh working with

659
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,559
Molina has been a a blessing like really

660
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,080
has pushed me to the next level of the

661
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:02,559
variant to function translation and

662
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,080
going beyond the bionformatics uh and of

663
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:06,080
course also the oops the giant

664
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:09,840
consortium

665
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:13,440
um with Joel uh hers leading it and of

666
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:16,760
course uh the funding for this work I'll

667
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,760
finish here

668
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,919
thank you Ruth for a very very

669
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:29,520
interesting presentation so are there

670
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,520
any questions from the audience

671
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:37,440
So, so a couple questions R. So, one, if

672
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:39,360
if you were to filter genes um by just

673
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,080
the number of genes that definitively

674
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:44,880
have multiple variants uh that can can

675
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:47,760
be linked to um the phenotypes of

676
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,360
interest. Does that help um narrow the

677
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,640
list? So, I'll ask three quick

678
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,600
questions. That that's question number

679
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,399
one.

680
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:57,200
>> Question number two is I never saw GLP1

681
00:28:54,399 --> 00:29:00,159
come up on any of your gene lists. So if

682
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,760
you were to do a retrospective on GLP1,

683
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:04,320
where would it have fallen out kind of

684
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:07,279
in in this list? And then the the final

685
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:09,279
question is on on FGF-21,

686
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,799
it looks like it goes in one direction

687
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:12,960
and then the other direction. So

688
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:15,840
increases risk of atyposity and and then

689
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,360
decreases risk of cardioabolic disease

690
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,520
or or cardiovascular disease. So if you

691
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:22,880
were to you perturb that, would you

692
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:26,640
expect uh differential effects across

693
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:28,799
those two phenotypes? Right. Actually, I

694
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,799
did uh the first question about

695
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:32,080
filtering genes. What was exactly what

696
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:35,600
you mean?

697
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:37,200
>> Multiple alals at a locus to help

698
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,559
whittle those down for

699
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,200
>> That's a good question. Actually, we

700
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:42,799
haven't looked into that. Um but indeed,

701
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,279
we are working on the variant of

702
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:46,880
function in the lab with Molina. Um

703
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:49,650
don't know what the process the stage is

704
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,679
at the moment but uh

705
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:54,399
[Laughter]

706
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:58,799
>> uh yeah.

707
00:29:54,399 --> 00:30:01,360
Yeah, waiting for the data. Um, for GLP1

708
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:03,919
receptor varants, um, it's very

709
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:06,880
interesting with the 9 million uh, with

710
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:09,360
the 5 million meta analysis. It's it's

711
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:12,399
it's starting to show up. It's a very

712
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:14,480
nice peak on GLP-1 receptors. uh but

713
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:17,360
this is the first time we see it uh in a

714
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:20,320
meta analysis show up in adults is very

715
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:23,919
intriguing but uh a small well small

716
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:27,440
28,000 um individuals meta analyses in

717
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:30,000
children but but um in children before

718
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,919
the age of three GLP-1 receptor variants

719
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,640
are showing up there and that's actually

720
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:36,880
a phenotype BMI before the age of three

721
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:39,360
is not correlated with your adult

722
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,799
phenotype so it's very intriguing we

723
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,559
don't quite know what's happening so but

724
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:45,360
then we need 5 million people to find it

725
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:48,080
in adults. Um and then your third

726
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:50,000
question I already forgot.

727
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,760
>> Yeah, it's true. It's like and I didn't

728
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,279
mention it here, but these are plasma

729
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:57,360
proteins and um these are still very

730
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:58,960
correlated phenotypes or correlated

731
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:02,880
observations. We haven't looked really

732
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:05,520
at the causality. Is FGF-21 up uh as a

733
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,120
causal uh or as a consequence or as a

734
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:10,320
compensatory? Like there's a few other

735
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:12,000
of these proteins like LPL um and

736
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,760
myostatin that are in the direction that

737
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,360
we didn't really hypothesize would be

738
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:18,480
but that maybe have to do with with the

739
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,480
fact that these plasma proteins
