1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:06,720
Good morning everybody. Welcome to the

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:11,280
MPG primer. You probably missed us over

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:13,840
the last two weeks. Um we're back. Um we

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,240
have Kirk Smith who is thankfully

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,960
presenting online. He's saving us all

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:22,199
from some flu germs. So thank you Kirk

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,960
for for doing this remotely.

8
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:28,320
Um let's see. Kirk graduated from

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,480
Virginia Tech in 2015 with a bachelor of

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,239
science in mechanical engineering. And

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,399
then after working as a mechanical

12
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:36,160
engineer for several years, he pursued

13
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,399
graduate studies at the University of

14
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,840
Michigan, go blue, where he received a

15
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:44,000
master's of science in medical

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:46,640
engineering in 2019. In 2021, Kirk

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,640
joined Dr. Udler's lab, um, where he

18
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,800
focuses on using genetic clustering to

19
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,239
study complex genetics diseases. Um, I

20
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,079
just talked to him and he actually ran

21
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,320
this on one of uh, my favorite

22
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,559
phenotypes, nefertic syndrome and this

23
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,719
is what he's going to talk about today.

24
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,879
Um, if you have questions, he obviously

25
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,520
might not see you. Um, so just come up

26
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,119
to these microphones and cut in at the

27
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,600
appropriate time or raise your hand and

28
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,360
I can bring you a microphone. Um, but

29
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,080
yeah, let's have some conversations and

30
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,560
thank you Kirk. Thank you for the intro

31
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,159
and um, thanks everyone for joining and

32
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,040
uh, yeah, for for those in person.

33
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,720
Sorry, sorry I couldn't be there. Um, as

34
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,720
was mentioned, I'm recovering from being

35
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,000
a little sick all week. So, uh, thought

36
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:32,960
I'd be cautious and present virtually.

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,439
Um, so yeah, uh, today I'll be talking

38
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,600
to you about our lab's research

39
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:40,200
regarding the clustering of genetic

40
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,880
lossi to study complex

41
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,040
diseases. Um, in today's presentation,

42
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,119
I'll start with our motivation for

43
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,079
performing soft clustering analysis on

44
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:52,159
genetic lossi. I'll then describe the

45
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,720
actual soft clustering method that we're

46
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:58,240
using which is called basian non-gative

47
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:01,200
matrix factorization or BNMF and we'll

48
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,799
go over some of its primary benefits. Um

49
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,119
and then lastly I'll go through a number

50
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,399
of potential applications and downstream

51
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:10,319
analyses that can be done with these

52
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:11,920
clusters. And um before I move on I just

53
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,319
wanted to mention that I'll be

54
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,920
referencing type 2 diabetes a lot in

55
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,239
these slides since that's the primary

56
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,680
focus of our lab's research. Um,

57
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,680
however, pretty much everything that

58
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,200
we're going over today is applicable to

59
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,000
any complex disease. Um, so just keep

60
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,760
that in

61
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,840
mind. All right. So, when most people

62
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,000
think of genetic diseases, they think of

63
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,879
a monogenic disease such as cystic

64
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,599
fibrosis where a single dysfunctional

65
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:42,000
gene is the primary issue. And we can

66
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,959
picture this as a single pipe rupture

67
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
which produces a massive but uniform

68
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,640
puddle. And then by contrast, complex

69
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,800
diseases such as type two diabetes arise

70
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,760
from dozens or hundreds of variants in

71
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,959
different biological pathways. So each

72
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:01,519
variant is only a small leak on its own,

73
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:04,480
but together they pull into a shared

74
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,560
disease risk. And because these leaks

75
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,640
are coming from various different piping

76
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,319
systems, our puddle can be very

77
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,720
heterogeneous.

78
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:15,440
And so this metaphor demonstrates why

79
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:18,879
monogenic diseases are relatively

80
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:21,680
speaking um easier to diagnose and find

81
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:24,159
drug targets for and while complex

82
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,440
genetic diseases can be much more

83
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,440
difficult in that same

84
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:33,360
regard. So this same concept was

85
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:37,640
captured in the pallet model proposed by

86
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:40,480
Mark McCarthy in 2017 to illustrate T2-D

87
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:42,560
heterogeneity. Um on the far left we

88
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,720
have several pathways associated with

89
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,760
type two diabetes such as beta cell

90
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:50,799
function uh insulin action and atapose

91
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:53,040
distribution. Then to the right of that

92
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,120
we have patients A through D which each

93
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,840
have a varying degree of disregulation

94
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,159
in these pathways. The amount each

95
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,400
pathway is contributing to their overall

96
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,480
disease risk will determine their final

97
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,200
location on the pallet or their final

98
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,120
color shade. So this also means that

99
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,959
each patient might show different

100
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,000
symptoms in the clinical setting or

101
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:16,079
respond better to certain

102
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,239
medications. So until we start to

103
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,400
untangle this heterogeneity, it'll be

104
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,560
very difficult to make strides in

105
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:26,400
personalized medicine. So the question

106
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,400
is how do we how do we begin to do

107
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:30,960
that? There are a number of different

108
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,040
approaches that um one can use for

109
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,280
studying disease heterogeneity, but each

110
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,880
has its own challenges. The most

111
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,880
straightforward method might be to

112
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,880
perform phenotypic clustering where

113
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,720
patients are grouped together based on

114
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,080
the traits they have in common such as

115
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,560
BMI or fasting glucose. The issue here

116
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,360
is that this clustering is looking at a

117
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,360
single snapshot in time. A patient's

118
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,360
phenotype will vary depending on where

119
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,840
they are in disease pro disease

120
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,840
progression or treatment. So this means

121
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,720
that a patient might change clusters

122
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,720
after a few weeks on medication or had

123
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,320
they come into the clinic at a different

124
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,960
time point, they could have been grouped

125
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,919
into a completely different

126
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,919
cluster. Additionally, with this

127
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:13,479
approach, we don't learn much about the

128
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,840
disease-causing

129
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:18,240
mechanisms. So that brings us to

130
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,320
genetics, which is a much more constant

131
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,520
data type, and we can assume it has a

132
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,440
one-way causality with the disease.

133
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,520
Now the first step in connecting

134
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,919
genetics to disease is often doing

135
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:33,199
variant discovery using genomewide

136
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:35,680
association studies or G-W was. G-W was

137
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,919
involve looking at the genetic data of

138
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,120
thousands of people and finding variants

139
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:42,400
associated with your phenotype of

140
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:45,199
interest. Going back to our piping

141
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:48,880
metaphor, a G-W was can help us locate

142
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:51,039
all of those tiny leaks, but it doesn't

143
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,199
tell us how they're contributing to the

144
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,400
disease risk. For one thing, the

145
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,400
majority of variants are found in

146
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,280
non-coding regions. So we may not even

147
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,680
know what gene a variant is affecting.

148
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,840
This means that after conducting a G-W

149
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,240
was, we still need to figure out which

150
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:09,440
genetic loi are acting together in

151
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,440
distinct mechanistic

152
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:15,600
modules. So to do this, our lab's

153
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:18,720
approach is to leverage genetic genetics

154
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,479
informed by physiology. So rather than

155
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,560
clustering patients based on their

156
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,600
genetics, we cluster the snips

157
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,199
themselves based on their trait

158
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:29,600
signatures. This starts by extracting

159
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:32,400
the T2D associated variants from one or

160
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:35,440
more G-W was ideally using the largest

161
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,759
publicly available studies. Next, we

162
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,960
look up those snips in G-W was of key

163
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:44,120
metabolic traits such as BMI, glycemic

164
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:47,199
measures, lipids, etc. to get their

165
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:49,759
zcores. Finally, we align everything to

166
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:52,199
the T2-D riskinccreasing alals and put

167
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:55,759
it all together in this variant by trait

168
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:58,319
matrix. This matrix encapsulates encap

169
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,319
encapsulates how each genetic variant

170
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,240
affects each trait. And at this point,

171
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,800
it's ready to be thrown into some type

172
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,400
of clustering algorithm. Um, what you're

173
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,280
seeing here on this slide is essentially

174
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,880
a very high-level overview of our entire

175
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,560
workflow. Um, and it shows you how we go

176
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:17,680
from variants associated to the disease

177
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,680
of interest to looking at the traits

178
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,639
that they those variants are associated

179
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:25,120
with to putting that information into a

180
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,120
clustering

181
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:31,120
algorithm. So now the the next question

182
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,120
is what clustering approach do we use?

183
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,120
There are a ton of different clustering

184
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,479
algorithms out there which can generally

185
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,000
be categorized as either hard or soft

186
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:41,759
clustering. The hard clustering label

187
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,479
simply means that each data point is

188
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,880
assigned to a single cluster. Some uh

189
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,199
common examples of this are K means and

190
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,319
hierarchical

191
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:53,199
clustering. Determining the true number

192
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,960
of clusters which we call K can be very

193
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,199
difficult with some of these uh hard

194
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,280
clustering techniques. There are many

195
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,720
different um cluster quality metrics

196
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,080
that can be looked at to pick the

197
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:06,319
optimal K. Um but anyone who has uh done

198
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,800
clustering before knows that often these

199
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,599
metrics will point to different values

200
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,280
and the user end is uh ends up being

201
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,680
required to make some type of gut

202
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,800
decision on on what metric to use and

203
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,800
what final K value to

204
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,720
use. So in addition to that um after the

205
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,599
clustering is done the user is also

206
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:28,120
required to um determine which traits

207
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:32,000
are driving each cluster. Um so this

208
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:36,080
could uh involve doing some type of post

209
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,800
hawk um trait association testing or um

210
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,560
some other type of analysis. But um

211
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,880
essentially the takeaway is that what

212
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,880
your clusters are forming around isn't

213
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,519
um apparent right away when you use most

214
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,800
of these hard clustering

215
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:51,279
techniques. Soft clustering on the other

216
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,880
hand uses weighted assignments. This

217
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:55,120
means that variants can belong to

218
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:58,080
multiple clusters which is more in line

219
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,399
with how biological systems overlap. Um

220
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,800
this is demonstrated in the the panel on

221
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,640
the right here by these um by the stars

222
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,880
which you can see are in the kind of

223
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:10,480
overlapping regions of these different

224
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:12,560
clusters. Um clearly these data points

225
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,760
are kind of in between the clusters. So

226
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,519
it's it's can be expected and that these

227
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,080
data points are kind of contributing to

228
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,240
multiple signals.

229
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,480
So um from here on out I'll be focusing

230
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,480
on our specific soft clustering method

231
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,600
which is called basian non- negative

232
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,000
matrix factorization or

233
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:34,720
B&MF. Now with BNMF the optimal clusters

234
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,440
are um given as an output of the model.

235
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,200
So that takes away any or most of the

236
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,320
user bias in terms of picking the

237
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,080
optimal K and then in addition to that

238
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,240
we get the trait loadings for each

239
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,240
cluster as an output of the model. So

240
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,519
that gives us immediate insight into

241
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,519
what is driving each

242
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,839
cluster. All right. So um I'll now give

243
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,320
a a relatively quick overview on how

244
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,839
B&MF actually works and I'll mention a

245
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:06,000
few more specific um benefits of this

246
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:08,560
method. So um to start the user does

247
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,320
have to input a maximum number of

248
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,680
clusters to consider which we'll call

249
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:16,000
KAX. Um, so typically this would just be

250
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,760
a number that would be way above the

251
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,480
number of clusters you expect. So you

252
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:23,440
would just kind of pick a safe K value.

253
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,200
Um, so perhaps you think there might be

254
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,560
10 clusters in your data, you could

255
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,720
input a K max of 20. Um, and then the

256
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,600
BMF algorithm will consider anything

257
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,920
below

258
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:39,120
20. So um, we then initialize two random

259
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:41,360
matrices which are called W and H. W

260
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,760
will contain the variant weights. So its

261
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,880
dimensions are the number of snips by K

262
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:49,519
max and H will contain the TRO the trait

263
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:52,880
loadings. Its dimensions are actually K

264
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:55,200
max by the number of traits times two.

265
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,360
Now this is because of the non- negative

266
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,000
requirement of BMF. We're actually

267
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,079
forced to split each trait into a

268
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
positive and negative column and then

269
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:06,399
multiply the negative column by minus

270
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,640
one. So you can see this reflected in

271
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:11,120
the um the H matrix on the right. how

272
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:14,600
each trait now has a a positive and

273
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,880
negative such as BMI plus and BMI

274
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:19,600
negative. So once we have these random

275
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,680
matrices W and H, we begin alternating

276
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,079
fitting and pruning. The fitting

277
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,800
involves minimizing the error between

278
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:30,720
our original matrix X and the matrix

279
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:32,560
product of W * H. There's also a comp

280
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,240
complexity penalty involved to avoid

281
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,320
overfitting.

282
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,640
Now the pruning is a very important part

283
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,560
because it shrinks clusters that are not

284
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,360
contributing to the approximate

285
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,360
approximation of X. Um I've tried to

286
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,920
highlight that in this example with the

287
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,800
color coding. Um so you can see how the

288
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:54,320
first column of W is tied to the first

289
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:57,760
row of H and so on. So in this example

290
00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:00,399
we started with a K max of five. Um

291
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:03,360
however all the elements of the fifth

292
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:05,760
cluster were pruned to zero. So we ended

293
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,560
up with just four clusters. So this is

294
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:11,040
kind of a a

295
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:14,160
um simple example to show how we go from

296
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:17,440
kmax to the optimal number of clusters.

297
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:20,880
Um the BMF pruning essentially gets rid

298
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:23,519
of all of the unimportant factors. Um so

299
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,600
we end up with the true number of

300
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,240
clusters in our data set rather than the

301
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,320
k that we started

302
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:33,200
at. Now this um shrinkage is encouraged

303
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:36,880
by the gamma prior and it also makes our

304
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:40,480
um final weights quite sparse. So um in

305
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:43,120
an actual clustering run you would see a

306
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:46,399
lot of zeros or very very small weights

307
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,560
in the final um matrices that you get.

308
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,880
And so this makes interpretation much

309
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,680
easier because you don't have to look at

310
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,360
um weights uh you know weights for

311
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,360
hundreds of variants and traits for each

312
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,360
cluster.

313
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,560
So, how do we define the clusters once

314
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:08,399
we get these final um W and H matrices

315
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:10,399
from B&MF? Yep. Oh, sorry, I was muted.

316
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,880
Can I ask a quick question? Is there an

317
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,639
upper bound on the number of traits you

318
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,399
could put in? Because I would imagine

319
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,320
with type two diabetes, you have some

320
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,320
ideas of where to look, but if you're

321
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,720
unsure what's driving your phenotype,

322
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,839
you might want to include a lot more GWS

323
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,360
traits. And I don't know if there's an

324
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,800
upper bound to the number that you could

325
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,200
put in.

326
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,440
Yeah. Um, okay. So, I have a uh in two

327
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,240
slides I'll go over that. Oh, great. I

328
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,639
think it's set up. Yes. Uh, maybe three

329
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,560
slides, two or three slides. Um, I'll

330
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:42,399
cover that. Um, so I'll hold off on

331
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:45,519
answering till then. Um, okay. So, um,

332
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:47,519
in terms of defining the final clusters,

333
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:50,399
um, one approach would be to consider

334
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,240
all snips and weights with a non zero

335
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,720
weight or sorry, all snips and traits

336
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,000
with a non-zero weight. Um there's

337
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,399
nothing wrong with that approach.

338
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,560
However, our lab's approach has been to

339
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,760
focus more on the components that are

340
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:06,959
most heavily driving each cluster. So to

341
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:09,600
do this, we compute a cluster specific

342
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:12,440
um or sorry, we compute a weight

343
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:15,120
threshold to maximize a signal to noise

344
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:17,519
ratio. So from there, all the snips and

345
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,480
traits with weights above that cutoff

346
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:22,320
are assigned to a cluster. Um I've

347
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,240
demonstrated that here by highlighting

348
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,040
in yellow the variance in traits that

349
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,600
are above um the cutoff in each cluster

350
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,360
for this

351
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:34,720
example. So then um if we wanted to zoom

352
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:37,839
in on cluster one for example um we

353
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,680
would see that uh snips one through four

354
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,920
are above the cutoff. So those are

355
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,880
included in the cluster. And then we can

356
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,800
see right away that um we also have

357
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:50,800
increased BMI and glucose in this

358
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:52,560
cluster and decreased height. So um you

359
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,120
can see right away how having these

360
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,959
trait loadings makes it super easy to

361
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,279
begin interpreting these clusters

362
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:00,680
immediately rather than having to do

363
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:04,000
some post hawk

364
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:07,199
testing. Um and then for anyone uh that

365
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,000
ends up reading any of our um papers um

366
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:12,240
you might see uh you'll see these circle

367
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,320
plots which are sometimes we get asked

368
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,800
about but these are just essentially

369
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:19,040
showing the same information as the bar

370
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:22,560
plots to the left. um just showing the

371
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:24,160
weights um the weights of the variance

372
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,160
and traits that are driving each

373
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,760
cluster. So, same information that I

374
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,160
just described here just in a kind of

375
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,160
nicer

376
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:37,920
format. So, um a few more quick notes on

377
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:40,079
BNMF. Um certain inputs and traits might

378
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,720
not end up in any cluster which you

379
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,560
might have noticed on the last slide. Um

380
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,720
so this will depend on several things

381
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:49,040
such as the B&MF pruning or whatever

382
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,600
approach you take for the weight cutoff.

383
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,920
Um with our method we often see around

384
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:57,360
50% of snips contributing to one or more

385
00:15:54,920 --> 00:16:00,560
clusters. And in line with that same

386
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,720
idea um one kind of nice benefit of this

387
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:05,680
method is we're not forcing snips into

388
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,199
clusters that they don't belong. So say

389
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,040
there's a snip associated with your

390
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:11,920
disease that doesn't end up in any of

391
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:14,480
the clusters. um this, you know, maybe

392
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,079
is disappointing at first, but um in

393
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,160
reality it could be very informative

394
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:20,639
because it tells you that that snip is

395
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,360
not acting through a mechanism that's

396
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,839
captured by the traits you're using. So

397
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,800
looking at this example in um sub panel

398
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,800
2, um if we were using a method like K

399
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:33,360
means, we essentially would have had to

400
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:36,880
stretch um some of these clusters to

401
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:39,720
encapsulate these outlier data points.

402
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:42,720
So um not only would we kind of

403
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:46,560
be maybe wrongly classifying these data

404
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:48,800
those data points but we um could be

405
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,199
skewing the cluster centroidids which

406
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,920
are later used for some other um

407
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:55,519
downstream

408
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:57,279
analyses. And then um lastly it's

409
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,440
important to remember that your results

410
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:02,560
will depend on the quality and quantity

411
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,720
of your genetic inputs. So the more

412
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,959
powerful G-W was that you have means the

413
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,959
more snips you have as inputs and also

414
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,280
the more reliable your variant trait

415
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,880
associations will be. And then

416
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,720
additionally the number of traits you

417
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,720
input will have a big impact on the

418
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,039
number of clusters that you get.

419
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,280
However, a big caveat there is that it's

420
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:25,799
not necessarily the number of traits but

421
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,799
the number of relevant traits.

422
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:33,200
So um now getting kind of into that uh

423
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:35,280
trait selection question um our our

424
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,160
group's approach has been to take a

425
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:40,480
datadriven um approach for deciding on

426
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,919
what um traits to include. And this is

427
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,960
probably actually the most common

428
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:47,360
question that we get for running um B&MF

429
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,960
is how do we go about um deciding on

430
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:52,480
what traits to include in this variant

431
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:54,799
trait matrix. So um there there is no

432
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,360
correct answer for for this. Um some

433
00:17:54,799 --> 00:18:00,000
people prefer to handp pick traits but

434
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:03,919
our method has been to include as many

435
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,640
trait G-W was as feasible. And um the

436
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:09,600
thing to keep in mind there is that that

437
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:12,080
involves um downloading and formatting

438
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,360
all these trait G-W was uh which is

439
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,080
actually probably the most time

440
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,400
consuming part of this entire workflow.

441
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:21,200
Um, and also the more traits that you

442
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:24,720
include in the pipeline, the longer it's

443
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:26,480
going to take to run. Um, so it's just

444
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,960
something to keep in mind. It's, you

445
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,919
know, a limitation that can be overcome,

446
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:34,400
but it's um, to give you an idea, in our

447
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:39,600
most recent paper, I think we included

448
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:42,799
about 160 traits um, initially and then

449
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:46,320
um, the final clust matrix ended up at

450
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:48,400
around 110 traits. Um and then so uh

451
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,600
this slide kind of goes over how we get

452
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,760
from that 160 to that

453
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:56,720
110. So once the initial variant trait

454
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:59,520
matrix is formed, we've we have our T2D

455
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:02,160
snips on the Y-axis and we've pulled all

456
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:05,039
the Zcores for these initial traits that

457
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:07,360
are on the X-axis. Um now we start

458
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:09,760
pruning the traits. So the first thing

459
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:12,160
we do is we remove traits that have low

460
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:14,720
sample sizes. Um this sounds like

461
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:17,280
something that could be done prior to

462
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:20,400
running the pipeline. How however often

463
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:23,679
GWA studies will report a maximum N. So

464
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:26,880
um they might say that um they took the

465
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:29,039
uh genetic data for up to 15,000 people.

466
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,520
However, once you start um actually

467
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:33,679
pulling um snips and data from the

468
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,360
summary statistics file, you might find

469
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,960
that a lot of the variants that you're

470
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,440
interested in, they actually only

471
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,679
measured in a few hundred. Um, and we

472
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:44,559
typically look for a median sample size

473
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:47,440
of at least 10,000. Um, so sometimes we

474
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:49,720
do lose traits due to a lot of the snips

475
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:52,720
um, not having enough sample

476
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:54,799
size. Um, so next we remove traits

477
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,039
without at least one bonfrron

478
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:58,640
significant snip. This is probably the

479
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,480
most important filter because this is

480
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:03,360
kind of what allows us to throw traits

481
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,039
into the pipeline that maybe we suspect

482
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,520
are associated with our disease, but we

483
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:09,919
aren't entirely sure. And then if it

484
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:12,559
turns out that none of our T2D snips are

485
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,559
associated with that trait, um we simply

486
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:17,440
remove the trait and therefore we're not

487
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:18,280
add any adding any unnecessary noise to

488
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,640
the

489
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:22,559
clustering. And then finally, if we have

490
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,240
two traits that are highly correlated,

491
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,240
we just keep the one with the strongest

492
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,480
signal. This is to make sure that the

493
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:31,600
traits are representing um independent

494
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:33,760
signals when the clustering is done. Um,

495
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,480
and kind of an a common example for this

496
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:39,520
is we often will include um two versions

497
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,760
of a trait, one adjusted for BM BMI and

498
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:45,000
one unadjusted, and then we can let the

499
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:48,159
pipeline figure out which one um to

500
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,640
keep. Um so hopefully that answers the

501
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:52,440
question about um kind of picking traits

502
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,960
to

503
00:20:52,440 --> 00:21:00,960
include. Um now as I mentioned

504
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:02,799
um this whole process can be uh very um

505
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,720
there's a lot of steps to it from

506
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:07,280
formatting the G-W was pulling the

507
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,520
summary statistics and everything. Um

508
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:13,520
and for the original paper that Dr.

509
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:15,440
Udler published on this topic in 2018

510
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,679
um all of this summary statistics

511
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:21,039
wrangling had to be done by hand um

512
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:23,840
which I I can't imagine. Um fortunately

513
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:25,840
uh right before I joined the lab in 2021

514
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,760
a few members of our team created this

515
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,799
high throughput R pipeline which

516
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,799
automates almost the entire process. Um

517
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:35,679
essentially the only requirement from

518
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:38,960
the user is a list of file paths for the

519
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:41,520
input G-W was. Um so at this point

520
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,120
pretty much the main work for someone

521
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,440
that wanted to start a new project would

522
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:48,080
be to figure out what traits they want

523
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,400
to include. Um, and if we don't have

524
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,880
those trait G-W was already available

525
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,520
somewhere on our server, um, they would

526
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,360
have to download and, um, do some

527
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:00,720
formatting to the summary statistics

528
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:02,720
files. Um, and then they input those

529
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,600
paths to the pipeline and pretty much

530
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,280
everything else runs on its

531
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:09,840
own. So this means that we can now apply

532
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:12,559
our method very efficiently to any

533
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,480
complex disease of interest. Um, as you

534
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:16,400
can see in this list, we've already

535
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,480
published several papers on diseases and

536
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:21,840
traits outside of type two diabetes, and

537
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,840
we have several more in the

538
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:29,840
works. All right. So, um, I'll now get

539
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,840
into applications of the genetic

540
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:34,880
clusters. So, probably the most useful

541
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,360
downstream analysis we can do with these

542
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,200
clusters is generating cluster specific

543
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:42,080
partition polygenic risk scores or

544
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,840
cluster PPS. The steps for doing this

545
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,919
are very similar to what would be done

546
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:49,520
for a full disease risk score such as

547
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:51,440
the a T2D PRS. As we discussed earlier,

548
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,280
we start by defining each cluster's

549
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,400
variant set shown here with the blue

550
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:59,039
bars for cluster one. So this includes

551
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:01,240
any snip that was above the weight cut

552
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:03,679
off um for that

553
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:05,760
cluster for a given patient. We then

554
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,919
pull their genotype dosages at those

555
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,159
snips. uh these are shown in the blue

556
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:12,240
circles and so these will be either a

557
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:14,440
zero, one or two depending how many

558
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,360
alals that patient has for the given

559
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:20,400
snip. We then compute the dot product to

560
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:22,960
get a partition PS for the cluster. This

561
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,240
is repeated for each cluster to build a

562
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,840
PPS profile for that

563
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:29,919
patient. We can then determine each

564
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:33,440
patient's dominant genetic pathways and

565
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:35,200
compare PPS profiles across patients. So

566
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,919
as you can see um looking at this

567
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,159
example of patient one we can see that

568
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:43,360
much more of their T2D risk is coming

569
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:47,760
from cluster one than from cluster 12.

570
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:50,400
Um and this is tied to the um their alil

571
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:52,640
dosages for the um snips in each of

572
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,640
those

573
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:59,840
clusters. Sorry.

574
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:03,440
Um all right. So um once we have a

575
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,960
cluster PPS um generated for a cohort we

576
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,760
want to see how those clusters are

577
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:10,480
associated with various

578
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:12,480
phenotypes. So clinical data can be or

579
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,640
is typically very noisy. So these

580
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,640
patterns are often not visible at the

581
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,960
individual level or from a simple

582
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,200
correlation test. However, once we

583
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,600
employ more powerful regression models

584
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,200
and account for covariants such as age,

585
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,919
sex, and race, we start seeing some

586
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:31,360
really nice signals for these clusters.

587
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:33,039
In cases where we are um testing traits

588
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,880
that we used in the clustering, we

589
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:38,559
typically think of these as validation

590
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:40,240
tests as the clusters. So for example um

591
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:42,720
confirm as you can see here in the kind

592
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:45,279
of the top plot um confirming that the

593
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,919
obesity cluster has a strong association

594
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:49,440
with

595
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:52,000
BMI. Now when it's a new continuous

596
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,520
trait um we consider an exploratory

597
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,520
test.

598
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,679
Now we can of course also do the same

599
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,840
analysis with discrete outcomes such as

600
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:03,039
shown in um figure two. So we can look

601
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:06,480
at how clusters are um cluster PPS are

602
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:10,080
associated with um other diseases such

603
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:12,400
as CAD or CKD. Um and in the same manner

604
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,240
we can account for things such as um

605
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,640
age, sex, and race so that we're only

606
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,799
looking at the effect of the cluster on

607
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,320
that outcome.

608
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,159
Um, and then while I won't go into

609
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,559
detail on this today, I wanted to note

610
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:27,600
that we're also able to generate cluster

611
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:29,520
PPS at the G-W was level. Um, and this

612
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,440
is a really can be a really helpful

613
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,919
analysis because that means we can run

614
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,799
this for traits that aren't available at

615
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:39,440
the indivi individual level or perhaps

616
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:41,919
if um we want to take advantage of a

617
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:45,120
larger sample size that a G-W was might

618
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:48,440
have over um an individual level cohort

619
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,440
data set.

620
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:54,080
So it's also of interest to determine um

621
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:58,240
which tissues and cell types of clusters

622
00:25:54,080 --> 00:26:00,640
are active in. To do this um in our uh

623
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,799
recent paper published in 2024, we

624
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,520
created credible sets for the variants

625
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:07,360
in our clusters and we then over

626
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,840
overlapped the credible set variants

627
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:12,640
with cell type and tissue type genomic

628
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:15,440
annotations. Um this was done in these

629
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:18,320
uh two epigenomic data sets catlas and

630
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:21,000
road map. And then finally we used uh

631
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:23,200
permutation testing to determine the

632
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,400
cumulative post posterior probability

633
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:30,159
for each annotation. Um the the results

634
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:32,720
you see on the right um show the

635
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:35,120
significant um tissues and cell types

636
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,039
for each cluster. And um we saw some

637
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,440
really cool results here that supported

638
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:41,520
our interpretation of these clusters

639
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,720
such as the beta cell clusters being

640
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:46,400
enriched for pancreatic eyelet

641
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:48,039
annotations and the liver lipid cluster

642
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,559
for hpatoblast

643
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:52,559
annotations. So um this is kind of

644
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:54,480
confirming that these genetic clusters

645
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:56,960
are capturing variants with distinct

646
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:59,960
effects in specific tissue and cell

647
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,960
types.

648
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:05,120
Now, in addition to studying how the

649
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:07,559
clusters behave across tissues, we can

650
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:10,080
also look at how they differ across

651
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:13,279
populations. Um, in these figures from

652
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:16,080
our 2024 paper on the left, we see the

653
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:19,760
proportion of total T2T risk coming from

654
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:22,400
each cluster broken down by population.

655
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:24,559
For example, um we see in East Asians in

656
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:26,880
blue, the two lipidrophy clusters

657
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:30,520
account for a notably large larger

658
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:33,279
fraction of total PPS than Europeans or

659
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:35,440
Africans. Um now just a quick note,

660
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:38,080
you'll you'll notice that um for each of

661
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:42,720
these clusters, the kind of maximum

662
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:46,159
value is um very different um across

663
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:49,799
each cluster. And that's based off of

664
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:53,360
the total um sum of weights for each

665
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:55,120
cluster. And so for this analysis um I

666
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:58,399
would it's important to note that we're

667
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:01,360
not comparing um risk across clusters so

668
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:04,080
much as we are looking at um populations

669
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:06,559
within a cluster. if if you wanted to

670
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,960
somehow try to look at um the risk

671
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:11,200
coming from each cluster, you would have

672
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:14,159
to probably normalize

673
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,240
um normalize the weights or the the PPS

674
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:19,200
across clusters before doing that type

675
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:21,679
of analysis. So um kind of the takeaway

676
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,320
here is that we're looking at population

677
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:26,159
differences within a cluster.

678
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:29,760
So um kind of going back to this

679
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:33,080
difference that we see in um in the East

680
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:37,360
Asian population in the lipid clusters.

681
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:40,159
Um we um in figure two we modeled T2D

682
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:42,320
risk versus BMI um and plotted these as

683
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:45,520
curves for each ancestry group and we

684
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:47,279
adjusted for age, sex and PCs. So you

685
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:51,200
can see that the Europeans in orange

686
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:54,000
have a TTD risk of about um 9% at a BMI

687
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,960
of 30, which is kind of the standard um

688
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,840
threshold for obesity, while East Asians

689
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:04,240
have the same risk at a BMI of only

690
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:06,880
24. Next, we adjusted these models for

691
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,880
the lipid 1 and 2 PPS and we saw that

692
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,039
this difference in risk decreased by

693
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,440
about 67%.

694
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:15,520
So um this is essentially quantif

695
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,960
quantifying how the genetic differences

696
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:20,480
in this these atapost dysfunction

697
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:23,279
pathways um are explaining part of the

698
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:25,919
well-known lower BMI threshold for T2D

699
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:27,440
in East Asians. Um, so this was actually

700
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:31,000
probably the coolest result from our

701
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:34,559
2024 paper. Um, since this

702
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,799
um this tendency for East Asians to

703
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:39,039
develop TTD at lower BMI has kind of is

704
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:40,679
a well-known phenomena, but it hasn't

705
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:44,480
been

706
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:46,880
um uh studied to a large degree or

707
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,200
figured out. So um the fact that these

708
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:53,640
clusters are capturing this difference

709
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,640
um was a really interesting finding.

710
00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:00,000
Um finally I wanted to highlight some um

711
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:02,880
really exciting work from Dr. Molina um

712
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,760
Clausnisser's lab. Um so from

713
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:08,720
subcutaneous and visceral fat biopsies

714
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:10,399
um Dr. Clauser's team derived meenymal

715
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:13,279
stem cells. The cells were

716
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:15,520
differentiated over 14 days into mature

717
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:20,000
adiposytes with imaging and molecular

718
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:22,679
profiling at days 03 8 and 14.

719
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,120
Now um when they stratified by total

720
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:28,440
T2DPRS there was really no difference in

721
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:31,760
lipid accumulation or mitochondrial

722
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:34,720
markers. However once they stratified by

723
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:38,919
high versus low lipidary PPS there was a

724
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:42,000
huge signal in the subcutaneous day 14

725
00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:44,720
adiposytes. This included differences in

726
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,120
um lipid droplet size and mitochondria

727
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:49,360
activity. Um so this analysis was really

728
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:52,000
cool in that it demonstrated how these

729
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:56,240
genetic clusters are actually capturing

730
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,240
um functional differences in cellular

731
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:01,600
biology. Um now before wrapping up I

732
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:04,240
wanted to mention that these genetic

733
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:06,480
clusters are constantly evolving as G-W

734
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:09,360
was and computational methods become

735
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:12,120
more powerful. Um as I mentioned earlier

736
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:14,799
Dr. Uler first published this work in

737
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:17,200
2018 and then the development of our

738
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:20,240
high throughput pipeline allowed us to

739
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,880
um expand that analysis in 22. So that

740
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,880
included

741
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:27,200
um increasing our number of snips by

742
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:30,320
over threefold in addition to adding

743
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:32,880
more traits and then uh more recently in

744
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:36,000
2024 we published a new set of clusters

745
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,240
that expanded from Europeanon uh G-W was

746
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,760
to

747
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:42,080
multi-anccestry. So, in addition to G-W

748
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:44,320
was becoming more powerful and diverse,

749
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:47,679
we're also constantly working on ways to

750
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:49,120
improve our BMF pipeline. Um, and I just

751
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:51,440
wanted to kind of mention this because

752
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:53,919
it goes to show that, um, even if

753
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,519
genetic clustering has been done on a

754
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:57,600
disease or phenotype that you're

755
00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:00,799
interested in, uh, there's almost always

756
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,880
room for improvement.

757
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:05,120
Um, and kind of in line with that, for

758
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,120
anyone that's interested in applying our

759
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:09,760
workflow to their own research, um, we

760
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:11,679
do have a GitHub page, um, that, as I

761
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,760
mentioned, we we are constantly trying

762
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:16,480
to, um, update it and make improvements

763
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:18,320
to our workflow. Um, so you're welcome

764
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:21,200
to check this out and try running the

765
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:23,519
clustering yourself. Or if that seems a

766
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:26,080
bit um, overwhelming to you, um, feel

767
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:27,760
free to reach out to Miriam um, if you

768
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:30,320
have any ideas for a collaboration

769
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:32,880
project.

770
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:36,640
Um and then I lastly I wanted to touch

771
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:39,039
on the limitations. Um I I know I've

772
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,799
kind of painted this uh approach as some

773
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:42,880
magic clustering tool today that's

774
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:45,480
perfect but as with any clustering

775
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:49,200
method there are um some limitations

776
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:51,440
involved. Um so number one uh the trait

777
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,840
inclusion um as I touched on this a bit

778
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,519
earlier but um we're still at this stage

779
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,600
where we have to manually download and

780
00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:01,039
format each trait G-W was before we can

781
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:03,919
include it in the pipeline. Um so this

782
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:05,200
is actually um again as I mentioned

783
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:08,399
probably the most timeconuming part of

784
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:10,559
the workflow. Um for example the UK biio

785
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:12,159
bank has several thousand brain imaging

786
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:13,279
related traits and it would be great if

787
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:15,679
we could throw them all into the

788
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:18,880
pipeline for our Alzheimer's project and

789
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:20,880
see what sticks but the data processing

790
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,880
um is a lot of work and the more traits

791
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:26,480
you include the pipeline can also take

792
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:30,000
expens exponentially longer to run. Um

793
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:32,120
and then another one also kind of uh

794
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,399
related to the trait inclusion is data

795
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:36,559
availability. Um I think this mostly

796
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:39,919
applies to projects focused on

797
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:41,760
non-European populations. Um while the

798
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:44,000
population you're interested in might

799
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,159
have a powerful enough G-W was for the

800
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,240
main disease you want to study. If there

801
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:50,720
aren't enough trait G-W was for that

802
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:53,600
population then you might be a bit

803
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:56,480
stuck. Um, you can always fall back to

804
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:58,679
using multi- ancestry G-W was, but this

805
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:01,120
is just kind of a limitation to

806
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:02,799
consider. And then finally, something

807
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,720
that we're looking into a bit more now

808
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:07,440
is tuning the hyperparameters of the

809
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:09,679
BNMF algorithm. Um, there are things you

810
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:12,240
can adjust such as the tolerance

811
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:13,839
threshold or the gamma prior that will

812
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:16,560
affect the clusters that you end up

813
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:18,480
getting. Um so I think for future papers

814
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,720
it might be important to do some type of

815
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,119
hyper um some type of sensitivity

816
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:24,159
analysis on these

817
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:25,919
hyperparameters and I think this could

818
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:28,800
actually be a really useful analysis

819
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:31,679
because it might help us um identify the

820
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,679
most robust

821
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:38,800
clusters. So um in conclusion um complex

822
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:41,679
genetics diseases lead to heterogeneous

823
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:43,679
heterogeneous phenotypes. Um soft

824
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:46,320
clustering of genetic lossi by

825
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:48,760
associated traits using BNMF is a unique

826
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:51,119
approach for untangling this

827
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:53,200
heterogeneity. And then variant trait

828
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:55,520
groupings provide mechanistic pathway

829
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:57,920
insights while cluster PPS are useful

830
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:01,119
for patient stratification.

831
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,960
And um kind of takeaway for anyone um

832
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:06,240
interested in applying this to other

833
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:08,880
diseases is that this method is very um

834
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:10,720
uh flexible and you we can apply to

835
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:13,720
essentially any complex genetic disease

836
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:16,079
as long as the data is

837
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:19,839
available. And lastly, I just want to

838
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:23,359
say um thank you to everyone um in my uh

839
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:25,119
lab and in Dr. Uler's group and also to

840
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:27,359
um the many other collaborator

841
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:30,480
collaborators have helped on uh this

842
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:30,480
project over the last few

843
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:38,000
years. Um yeah, and that's it. Let's

844
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,000
think Kirk

845
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:45,520
again. And uh next two weeks we'll be in

846
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:48,000
here. So see you soon and please join us

847
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:51,560
across the hall for Steve Parker um also

848
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,560
from U of M.
