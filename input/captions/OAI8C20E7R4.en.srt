1
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:17,520
Okay everyone. Um so so today uh we're

2
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,760
going to learn some of the fundamental

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,199
estimates of projection theory for balls

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,680
in the plane for the setting of real

5
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,080
analysis. Um there are kind of two goals

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,680
of the class. The first goal is to adapt

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,000
the techniques that we learned last time

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,480
in finite fields. So the double counting

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,440
technique and the forier technique to

10
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,280
uklitian space. Um and the second goal

11
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,640
is to start to explore. So there's a

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,800
difference between uklidian space and

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,200
finite fields is that in uklidian space

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,200
we have to pay attention to how the how

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,960
our sets are clustered. And so the

16
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,640
second goal of the class is to start to

17
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,640
explore uh clustering can cl information

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,920
about how the sets are clustered and and

19
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,920
how that comes into the store.

20
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,920
Okay,

21
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,640
so here's our setup.

22
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:16,200
We'll have X will be a set

23
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,200
of disjoint

24
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:24,080
unit balls

25
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,400
in um in the ball of radius R in the

26
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:29,759
plane.

27
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,119
Okay, so that's our set of points, set

28
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,640
of balls. And then we're going to have a

29
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:38,880
set of directions called D. So D is a

30
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:41,439
finite subset of S1. It's 1 / R

31
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:45,439
separated. So the distance between any

32
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:50,799
two points of D is at least one / R

33
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:52,960
D. Um and then S which depends on X and

34
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,759
D

35
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,719
is the maximum size of the projection.

36
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:01,360
So I look at all the ang all the

37
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,759
directions in D and I project the set X

38
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,880
in that direction and I take its measure

39
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:09,200
and the maximum of that is called S.

40
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,560
Okay. So projection theory we try to

41
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,640
understand how these things are related

42
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,280
to each other and in this uklidian

43
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:18,000
setting we also need to care about how

44
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,680
this set X and how the set D are

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,720
clustered.

46
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:26,080
So that's measured by I guess call them

47
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:30,319
clustering functions. So n subx of

48
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:33,599
little r is the measures the most amount

49
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:35,680
of x in any ball of radius little r. So

50
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:41,360
this is the maximum

51
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:43,519
over c in r2 or um of the size of x

52
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,840
intersected with the ball around c of

53
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,160
radius r.

54
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,760
So this measures how x is clustered and

55
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:54,239
we're also going to measure how d is

56
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:56,560
cluster clustered. So n subd of row

57
00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:02,640
is the maximum

58
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:09,640
over any uh so sigma in s1 and arc

59
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:09,640
of length row of d intersect zip.

60
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,400
Okay.

61
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,959
Okay. So our big goal is in terms of

62
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,959
this information and and how big d is

63
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,280
and how big x is. What can we say about

64
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:28,280
S?

65
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,280
Okay.

66
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:35,720
Okay. So, we're first going to do the

67
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,720
double counting approach.

68
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,360
And the argument is in in spirit the

69
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,720
same as last time. But we'll see that

70
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,120
when we try to do the double counting

71
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,879
that we did last time that the n subx

72
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,280
function and the n subd function will

73
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:55,200
come into the store and it leads to the

74
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,560
following bound. So theorem one I'll

75
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,239
call it theorem 1 r r r r r r r r r r r

76
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,319
r r r r r r r r r r for the real case.

77
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,640
Uh whereas last time we had something

78
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,080
called theorem one which when I do it

79
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,680
again it'll be theorem 1 f for the

80
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,519
finite field case and eventually we'll

81
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:13,000
compare them.

82
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:13,000
Okay. So if we have this setup

83
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:20,079
then

84
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:23,320
the number of directions is bounded by

85
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,320
let's see

86
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,520
okay so you'll notice that this is not a

87
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,919
formula that I have memorized

88
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:37,199
[Music]

89
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:40,520
s overx times the sum over different

90
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,520
scales else.

91
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,040
Cool. Okay. So, it's a sum over

92
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,040
different scales and we often in this

93
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:06,560
class will sum over a diadic sequence of

94
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:10,000
scales, powers of two or whatever. Um uh

95
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,680
okay and um and the so the formula

96
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,840
doesn't yet look that similar but the

97
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,360
the idea is the same as last time and

98
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,440
then eventually we'll compare the

99
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,039
formulas and see that under certain

100
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,000
assumptions on this it's actually very

101
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:25,000
similar to last time.

102
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Okay.

103
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,440
So the proof is to double count a

104
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,840
certain quantity which which we which we

105
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,560
called coincidences last time. So the

106
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,600
key quantity called star

107
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:44,160
is the number of

108
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:46,880
b1 and b2 in x. So these are these are

109
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,440
unit balls.

110
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:53,600
So remember x is a set of unit balls. So

111
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:57,199
these are two of the unit balls. Um and

112
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,560
um theta and d I guess we'll say they're

113
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:02,560
not equal to each other although that

114
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:07,280
won't matter as much this time. um

115
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:11,680
uh so that pi theta of b1 and pi theta

116
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:13,520
of b2 are similar to each other and in

117
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,039
this setting we won't count they don't

118
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,880
have to be exactly the same I would just

119
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,880
like them to overlap so my condition

120
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:24,520
will be that the intersection of these

121
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,520
is non empty so that's my key quantity

122
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:32,240
[Music]

123
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,000
actually in this setup. I'm going to I'm

124
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,880
going to allow them to be equal to each

125
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,720
other. Um that makes the double counting

126
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,319
a little easier and in a sense it's

127
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,560
we'll see it's it's part of what's up

128
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:47,199
here.

129
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:50,680
Okay. So um so there's a lower bound

130
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,680
which is straightforward.

131
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:58,800
The lower bound says that this this star

132
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,440
is at least the number of directions

133
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,680
times in each direction

134
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,520
x over s^2

135
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,400
* s.

136
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:11,120
So in each direction these x different

137
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:14,319
balls have been projected into only s

138
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:17,440
slots. So a typical slot has x over s

139
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:20,800
balls in its fiber. And so we have this

140
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:23,199
many squared choices for to pick B1 and

141
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,080
B2 in the same five

142
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:28,960
s times. So lower bound is is really the

143
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:33,880
same as last time.

144
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,880
Same as last time, same as the homework.

145
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,919
Okay. So now let's look at the upper

146
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,919
bound.

147
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:58,879
So I will uh for now I'll fix B1 B2 and

148
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:02,960
I'll say that the distance between B1

149
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:06,800
and B2 is around R.

150
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:10,400
Um so here's my picture

151
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,720
B1 and B2 and the distance between them

152
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,960
is around R.

153
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,120
Okay. So now I'm interested in

154
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:20,400
projections where the projection of B1

155
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:24,720
and the projection of B2 overlap. And so

156
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:27,520
the angles for those projections are in

157
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,199
a little angular range. The angle of the

158
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,520
projection must be somewhere in this

159
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,520
range here.

160
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:40,080
So what um what I'll say is let's say

161
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:46,720
that V is the direction from B1 to to to

162
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:48,399
B2. So v is um center of b2 minus center

163
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:52,360
of b1

164
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,360
over the norm of that.

165
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,720
And

166
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:02,880
if pi theta of b1 intersect pi theta b2

167
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,120
is not empty

168
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,839
um then

169
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,959
theta must be pretty close to v. What

170
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:14,399
I'll say is that the angle

171
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:18,200
between theta and v is smaller than

172
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,200
around 1 / r.

173
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,640
Okay.

174
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,560
Um so now

175
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:40,279
the number of theta so that pi theta of

176
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:40,279
b1 intersect pi theta of b2 is not empty

177
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,480
that would be bounded by well the number

178
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:50,640
of directions in this little arc. So

179
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:53,519
that would be nd of 1 / r. So we see the

180
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:58,120
spacing uh the spacing function of the

181
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:58,120
set d comes into play here.

182
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,880
Okay, so that's what happens when we fix

183
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,760
B1 and B2.

184
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,120
And the case B1 equals B2 is allowed.

185
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,279
And I'll make the slightly funny

186
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,880
convention that then R is one. They're

187
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:14,079
unit ball. So the distance between them

188
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:16,320
is sort of one. And this is true. Then I

189
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,720
mean V is not well defined, but this

190
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:22,839
condition includes the whole range of

191
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,839
angles. So it's it's true.

192
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:31,760
Okay.

193
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:35,120
So look if B1 equals B2 we take little R

194
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:39,640
equals 1 and it's slightly exceptional

195
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,640
but but all the bounds are true.

196
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:49,839
Okay.

197
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:51,920
So if we want to upper bound star now we

198
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:55,560
need to count the number of choices for

199
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,560
B1 and B2.

200
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,519
So now I'm interested in the number of

201
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,480
pairs

202
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:10,079
B1, B2, and X with the property that the

203
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:14,480
distance from B1 to B2 is at most R.

204
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:17,600
Okay, how big is that? Well, I have norm

205
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,680
of X choices for B1.

206
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,480
But once I choose B1, I don't have all

207
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,880
that many choices for B2 because B2 has

208
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,959
to be close to B1. It has to be in a

209
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,600
little R ball.

210
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:32,560
So the number of choices for B2 is at

211
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:37,240
most nx of R. So at this moment the

212
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,240
spacing function of X comes into play.

213
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,160
Okay. So now we can combine these to to

214
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:50,560
upper bound star.

215
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:58,079
So star is um is now upper bounded by

216
00:11:50,560 --> 00:12:01,760
x * nx of r time n d of 1 / r

217
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:04,480
uh ah sorry so star

218
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:08,040
is upperbounded by the sum over the

219
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,040
diatic r

220
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,200
of this quantity.

221
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:22,720
Okay, so let me say why. So star is this

222
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:26,079
set of coincidences.

223
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:28,320
It's a B1 and B2 and a theta. And for

224
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:30,320
each coincidence, I know I I sort these

225
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,760
coincidences by the distance from B1 to

226
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,200
B2, which I call R. So I take the the

227
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,040
coincidences where the distance is

228
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:41,680
around R, and I sum over the possible

229
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:45,600
Rs. Once I fixed R, um, I have this many

230
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:47,519
choices for the pair B1 B2. And once I

231
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:51,160
fixed B1 and B2, I have this many

232
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,160
choices for theta.

233
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,320
So that's that.

234
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,760
Okay.

235
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,279
Uh, the rest is algebra. I'll sketch it

236
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,120
quickly on the board and that'll be the

237
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:05,600
end of the proof and then we'll pause to

238
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:08,399
digest and check it.

239
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:13,760
Okay. So al together

240
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:17,040
we have x^2 s inverse d is bounded by

241
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:20,000
star which is bounded by

242
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:27,519
the sum over r datic

243
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:31,480
of x nx of r and d of 1 / r and then I

244
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,480
just get the d by itself.

245
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:41,000
If you move this stuff over to the other

246
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,000
side, you get the formula on the board.

247
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:49,320
Okay, so let's pause there for questions

248
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,320
and comments.

249
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:13,920
All right.

250
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:16,000
All right. So, um, so I wanted to, uh,

251
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,560
get a sense of start to explore this

252
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,399
function nx of r by looking at a few

253
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,560
different examples of sets x and writing

254
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,000
down what is nx of r. It's not

255
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,839
difficult, but having a few different

256
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,800
examples in our mind, it'll help to

257
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,800
orient us as we keep going.

258
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,959
um and and actually will help also to

259
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,120
digest this formula. So this this proof

260
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,880
was clean. This formula is a little bit

261
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,279
messy. So after looking at some

262
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,880
examples, we'll digest this formula and

263
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:44,680
think about a situation where it works

264
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,680
out a little more cleanly.

265
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:51,409
All right.

266
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:51,409
[Applause]

267
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:03,680
All right. So examples

268
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:07,920
for n sub x sub rar.

269
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:09,519
Okay. So number one, x is the one

270
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:13,040
neighborhood

271
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:15,360
of a curve like a nice like a circle or

272
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:18,000
parabola or something. So here's the

273
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,079
ball of radius r and inside of there I

274
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,199
have a nice curve and all along the

275
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:25,600
curve I have unit balls.

276
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:29,040
That's x.

277
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,800
So if I have this set, how many unit

278
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,720
balls do I have in a ball of radius

279
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:36,760
little r?

280
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,760
That would be around r.

281
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:44,959
Okay.

282
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:47,440
Do a second example. Um

283
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:49,120
second example, it would be very spread

284
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,680
out. You know, if you imagine that these

285
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:55,440
points are like positive charges that

286
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:57,279
repel each other and they push as far

287
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,720
away from each other as possible, they

288
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:01,519
would arrange themselves in something

289
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:05,600
like a lattice inside of here.

290
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:08,160
So, okay. So, I'll call this the uh well

291
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:13,399
spaced example, the most spread out

292
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:13,399
example. So, it looks like this.

293
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:24,000
So it's a let's say it's a well spaced n

294
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:28,000
byn grid

295
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:32,199
and so the distance between neighboring

296
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,199
balls would be like r /n.

297
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:39,360
Okay so now what would nx of r be like?

298
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:43,759
Um well it would be one for quite a

299
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:46,720
while if our radius is less than rn. um

300
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:48,639
then this would be one but then

301
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,959
eventually as the radius gets bigger it

302
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:54,560
would get bigger than one and at that

303
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:57,519
point it would be um its fair share of

304
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,880
the total number total size of x. So

305
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,959
once once r is bigger than this

306
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:04,559
threshold, every little r ball contains

307
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:08,400
the same amount of x. And so the density

308
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:12,039
of x is like n^2 r 2. The area of the

309
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,039
ball is like this.

310
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:23,520
Okay. And um I'll do a third example

311
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:26,000
which is the points could be very um uh

312
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,760
clustered

313
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:33,320
cluster.

314
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:33,320
So we could have n squared unit balls

315
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:41,280
in um in an n ball. So the the picture

316
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,080
would be like this. We have our ball of

317
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:47,360
radius r. Inside of there we have a

318
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:52,720
smaller ball of radius n and we pack the

319
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:58,679
smaller ball with unit balls of x.

320
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:58,679
Okay. So now what is uh n subx of r?

321
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:07,200
Well it grows like r 2 until r is as big

322
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,960
as this n ball. And after that there are

323
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,880
only n squared balls at all. So you can

324
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:15,200
make a little r bigger. It doesn't grow

325
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:18,760
anymore. So it caps off at n^ squ if r

326
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,760
is bigger than n.

327
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,640
Okay.

328
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:30,000
[Applause]

329
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:33,200
So now I will draw um some pictures of

330
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:37,000
of of these three functions.

331
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,000
You can compare them.

332
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:52,200
Okay, we'll do some pictures.

333
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:57,919
I'm going to normalize in my pictures. I

334
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:01,520
have to choose an n. I'm going to choose

335
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:03,440
n= r to the half. Uh, and that's helpful

336
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,679
because it says that the total size of x

337
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,960
is around r in all three examples. It

338
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,880
makes them a little easier to compare

339
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,200
with each other.

340
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,960
Okay. So now I'll make a graph.

341
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,600
Basically I'd like to put on this axis

342
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,559
little r and on this axis n subx of

343
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:21,120
little r. Um but this graph like many

344
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:23,760
graphs in math looks nicer if we use log

345
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,919
is a log log plot. So on this on this

346
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,400
axis I'm going to put the log of little

347
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:31,760
r and then the nicest base for that is

348
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:34,640
big r. This goes from 0 to one. And on

349
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:37,200
this axis, I'm going to put the log of n

350
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:41,039
subx of r. And it's natural to use the

351
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:42,799
same base. So this goes from 0 to one.

352
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:45,039
This could go above one potentially, but

353
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:48,320
because the size of x happens to be r,

354
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:50,799
we're going to stop there.

355
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:53,280
Okay. So now what do these three

356
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:56,840
examples look like? The first example is

357
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,840
a straight line.

358
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,760
So that's example one.

359
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,120
Um,

360
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:12,559
the second example grows more slowly

361
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:14,960
than the straight line for a while. It

362
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:18,559
doesn't grow at all for a while and then

363
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:20,799
it grows quickly to catch up. So that's

364
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:24,080
the second example. It lies below the

365
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:28,240
straight line. Uh and then the third

366
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:30,400
example grows more quickly than the

367
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,880
first example and then it reaches a

368
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:35,280
certain point and it stops growing. So

369
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:38,600
it looks like this and it lies above the

370
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,600
straight line.

371
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:48,320
Okay. So um so in this theory there

372
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:50,400
turns out to be that things that grow

373
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,559
the the straight line case is an

374
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,400
important case and then there's an

375
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,320
important distinction between things

376
00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:00,360
that are below the straight line things

377
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,360
that are above the straight line.

378
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:06,360
Um so the straight line case

379
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:17,360
would be that n that that the size of x

380
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:20,799
would be r to the alpha for some alpha

381
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:23,200
and then n sub little r of x or n subx

382
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:25,919
of little r

383
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:29,280
would be little r to the alpha. That

384
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:34,520
would be the straight line case.

385
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:34,520
And the uh below the straight line case,

386
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:47,280
uh x would still be r to the alpha. So

387
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,720
the end point would be the same, but now

388
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:52,559
in the middle, we're going to go below

389
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:57,080
what we had before. So n subx of r would

390
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:57,080
be at most r

391
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:07,840
Okay. So this thing here is called a

392
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:10,480
regular alpha dimensional

393
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:13,200
spacing

394
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:16,760
and this thing is called a alpha

395
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,760
dimensional spacing.

396
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,799
Um

397
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,640
I'd like and I'd like to make one more

398
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:36,600
definition. And I'll say that X has a

399
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,600
housegrowth spacing

400
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:46,280
if it has alpha dimensional spacing for

401
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,280
some of

402
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:54,080
but another way of saying that is if you

403
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:57,039
look at how many points of X are in a

404
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:59,280
ball of radius R to the beta it's

405
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:03,240
bounded by the total number of points of

406
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,240
x to the beta.

407
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:10,760
And this is this is equivalent. This is

408
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,760
still below the straight line.

409
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:27,600
Okay. So over here um we would have we

410
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,520
have example one and and in general if

411
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:32,159
you have any if you have a submanifold

412
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,760
in any dimensional space it will behave

413
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,480
like this and alpha is the dimension of

414
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:39,520
the sub manifold. Also some self-

415
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,679
similar caner set kind of fractals like

416
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,039
the caner set um have this kind of

417
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:45,679
spacing where alpha would be the

418
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:46,799
dimension of the of your caner set.

419
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,360
That's why it's called alpha

420
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:51,919
dimensional.

421
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:54,159
Um

422
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:56,320
and um and these things this thing

423
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:58,480
called housedorf spacing I called it

424
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:02,600
that because it it appears naturally in

425
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,600
the theory of housed dorf dimensions.

426
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,120
Um

427
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,640
yeah, so it's maybe worth saying briefly

428
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:12,240
that in the geometric measure theory

429
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,679
literature, a lot of the stuff we're

430
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,840
talking about today was originally

431
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:20,080
described in the language of housedorf

432
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:22,960
dimensions. Um but my impression is that

433
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:25,200
that's not really that helpful. Like if

434
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,640
we if we defined housedorf dimensions

435
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,960
and then we wanted to prove things about

436
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:32,240
housed dorf dimensions we would add an

437
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,440
extra layer of definition and then we'd

438
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,240
have to check the extra layer of

439
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,919
definition. Um but then in all the

440
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,360
applications that we'll talk about we

441
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,960
would never use those definitions. We

442
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:44,480
would go back to this theorem the way

443
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:47,440
it's stated now and use that. Um, so I

444
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,360
have a bit tentatively but I've come to

445
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,520
the conclusion that house dorf dimension

446
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:54,640
is not really a helpful notion for this

447
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:57,640
subject and and so I'm going to leave it

448
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,640
out.

449
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:04,799
Okay. Um, but any questions or comments

450
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:09,279
about these

451
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:09,840
different ways that a set can be spaced?

452
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:14,720
>> Yeah.

453
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:18,080
>> I'm wondering like is the And the pro 01

454
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:22,159
for the pro lower bound.

455
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:28,240
If we try to calculate lower bound for

456
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:32,880
B1 B2 like is distance like somehow

457
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:36,400
R from R1 to R2 like with that and

458
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:41,279
compare this with the upper bound with

459
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:45,000
different distance from B1 and B2. that

460
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:45,000
information that

461
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:50,960
>> yeah okay so the question is um when we

462
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,360
were processing the upper bound for this

463
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,440
we sorted it according to the distance

464
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,600
so we really have a set star sub r where

465
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,240
we add the condition that the distance

466
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:02,000
from b1 to b2 is around r and the

467
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,960
question is if if we looked at the lower

468
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:09,760
bound we could also sort it by r and and

469
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:12,640
would that be helpful yeah Um

470
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:14,400
um yeah I that is a a good thing to look

471
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,960
into. Off the top of my head I don't

472
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:20,960
know if it would be helpful. Um you know

473
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:24,159
it's uh our our lower bound with this s

474
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,760
here depends on taking all of them. Um

475
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:29,559
but it would be interesting. Yeah it

476
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,559
would be interesting to think about.

477
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,200
Other questions or comments?

478
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:46,960
Okay. Okay. So, let me show you uh so so

479
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:49,520
I so I claim so okay it seems that um

480
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,919
this spacing condition

481
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:54,240
say housedorf spacing is helpful in the

482
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:56,480
theory. Um and one way that comes about

483
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,279
is that a lot of the theorem statements

484
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:01,279
become a lot cleaner if you put in house

485
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:05,120
spacing.

486
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:07,840
Um so let's do that here. Let's suppose

487
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:09,760
that X and D have housed doororf spacing

488
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:12,760
and we'll use that to simplify this

489
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,760
thing.

490
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:19,910
[Applause]

491
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:42,080
Okay. So corollary one real is that if

492
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:47,720
we have the the setup

493
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:47,720
and x and d are housedorf spacing

494
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,320
then we get a simpler inequality which

495
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,240
matches quite well what happens in

496
00:27:54,320 --> 00:28:04,679
finite fields.

497
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:04,679
Then d is bounded by um s plus x.

498
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,600
Okay.

499
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,919
So, I'll prove this and then I'll try to

500
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,520
argue actually. So, so okay. So, this

501
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:45,760
looks a little nicer than before. It

502
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:49,520
might still not look that nice to you.

503
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:53,080
Um but I would summarize it like this.

504
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,080
Um either

505
00:28:53,520 --> 00:29:03,039
either s e either s is pretty close to x

506
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:06,000
or d is smaller than s and that's what

507
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:08,799
we had in finite fields. So why is it if

508
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,960
s is a lot smaller than x? This is much

509
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:15,320
less than one. So we can rearrange that

510
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,320
and we get that d is less than s.

511
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:32,320
Okay. So, what's the proof? Well, um,

512
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:39,000
we're going to have an expression like

513
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:39,000
nx of r n d of 1 / r.

514
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:46,720
And so now let's suppose

515
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:51,960
that little r is big r to the beta.

516
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,960
And um and then being housedorf

517
00:29:52,159 --> 00:30:01,919
it tells us that nx of r the beta n d of

518
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:06,640
r the minus beta

519
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:10,399
there that is bounded by x to the beta *

520
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:14,159
d to the 1 - beta.

521
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:16,000
That's what being housed tells us.

522
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:19,520
So being house of dwarf allows us to to

523
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:23,520
relate nx of r for any r to the size of

524
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:25,760
x which is nx of big r and algebraically

525
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:28,799
it works out like this and for d it

526
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:31,440
works out like that.

527
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:34,240
Okay. And then by amg this is smaller

528
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:36,320
than x plus d.

529
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:39,679
So every one of these complicated things

530
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:42,640
they're all bounded by x plus d

531
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:44,480
and the number of them is only log of r.

532
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:47,880
So, okay, sorry. So, I should put a log

533
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,880
of R here.

534
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:54,480
Um,

535
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:57,919
okay. So, now we're just going to plug

536
00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:00,000
this in up there. I'll have an x plus d

537
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:03,120
up there

538
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,919
and a log r factor. The x in the x plus

539
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:10,679
d gives me this and the d and the x plus

540
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:10,679
d gives me that. It's just algebra.

541
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:26,640
Okay. Now let's compare this with the

542
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:28,240
theorem we proved last time in finite

543
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:32,080
fields.

544
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:36,240
So theorem one in finite fields said

545
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:39,279
that if we had x in fq2

546
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:42,000
and d in fq

547
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:46,159
and s is the maximum

548
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,679
theta and d size is pi theta of x.

549
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:49,360
Um

550
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:55,200
then

551
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:58,200
either S is around X or D is bounded by

552
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,200
S.

553
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:04,960
And the numerology is now the same in

554
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:08,840
finite fields or or or if you have balls

555
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,840
with the house space.

556
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,720
Okay.

557
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,559
Um so in general the numerology in a lot

558
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,519
of things is the same between finite

559
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:26,640
fields and balls with housedorf spacing

560
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:28,080
and so now I'll so this was theorem one

561
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,519
from last time I'll track through also

562
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,360
theorem two from last time and the

563
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:35,720
conjecture from last time and we'll see

564
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,720
that they all match up

565
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:03,240
Okay.

566
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:03,240
So I have

567
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:10,720
projection theory

568
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:14,799
in FQ2

569
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:19,240
versus um in

570
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:19,240
versus unit balls in B2R

571
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:27,159
and B2R with housed door space.

572
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:35,840
Okay, so here was theorem two last time

573
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:41,360
in finite fields.

574
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:46,120
So if we have our finite field setup

575
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:46,120
which is over here

576
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:52,039
and S is smaller than Q.

577
00:33:52,320 --> 00:34:01,080
Um then conclusion is that the number of

578
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:01,080
directions is smaller than SQX.

579
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:09,200
And here's what we'll prove in the real

580
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:14,800
case correlary to R. So if we have our

581
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:20,200
setup of the day and X and D are housed

582
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:20,200
and S is a good bit smaller than R.

583
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:30,119
Then maybe this needs a little bit more

584
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:39,879
um than d

585
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:39,879
smaller than sr /x.

586
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:47,119
Okay. So I I use this symbol with the

587
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:49,679
extra tilda that's hiding something like

588
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:51,839
a log factor similar to the log factor

589
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:55,359
that appeared over here. Like if you if

590
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:57,599
you compare the real case theorem one

591
00:34:55,359 --> 00:35:00,160
and the finite field case we lost an

592
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:03,359
extra log r factor and that h that will

593
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:07,640
happen sometimes. Um

594
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:07,640
so uh notation

595
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:17,040
a less sum b means

596
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:20,640
for every epsilon bigger than zero there

597
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:25,320
exists c epsilon. So a is less than or

598
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:25,320
equal to c epsilon r the epsilon.

599
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:36,560
Okay. But if you compare these um Q

600
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,640
corresponds to R.

601
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:41,440
That makes sense. There are Q ^2 points

602
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:44,440
here and there are R squar unit balls

603
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,440
here.

604
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:51,520
Um and these basically match up except

605
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:54,560
that there's a minor sort of loss here.

606
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,920
Okay. And so this is this is the forier

607
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:59,680
method that we'll turn to in a little

608
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:01,760
bit. Um there is also a conjecture about

609
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,760
the sharp behavior.

610
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:06,720
So conjecture

611
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:11,880
if P is prime

612
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:11,880
and we have our finite field setup

613
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:19,520
and S is smaller than the minimum of Q

614
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,920
and X. So either of these are sort of

615
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:24,640
trivial. S is always at most Q and it's

616
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,760
always at most X. So we're make it less

617
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,920
than that. So we're sort of in a

618
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:30,320
non-trivial range.

619
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:34,320
um then

620
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:35,760
b should be bounded by s^2 overx which

621
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:40,240
would be sharp if it's true and it

622
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:44,160
matches the behavior in an integer grid.

623
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:47,839
Okay, this conjecture has an analog

624
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:51,599
uh over in the real case and the real

625
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:54,640
analog is uh is due to fenberg. It's

626
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:58,560
called the fenber set conjecture. So it

627
00:36:54,640 --> 00:37:01,960
says if we have the setup and X and B

628
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,960
are housed dorf

629
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:12,320
um and S is significantly less than the

630
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:14,400
minimum of R and X. So again S is always

631
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:17,280
smaller than R. It's always smaller than

632
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,400
X and we're saying it's significantly

633
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,240
less than that. So it's sort of

634
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,640
non-trivial.

635
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:24,720
um then

636
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:29,280
the number of directions would be less

637
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:31,040
than tilda tilda s^2 overx.

638
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:34,359
You see that these conjectures again

639
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,359
match up.

640
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:40,560
Cool.

641
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,320
Okay. Now I mentioned on the first day

642
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:44,000
that one of the fundamental thought

643
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:46,400
problems of projection theory recently

644
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,680
had been solved. This is the problem. So

645
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:53,359
this conjecture has been proven. Um so

646
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:56,560
this is a theorem from 2024

647
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:59,560
of Orpinan

648
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,560
Schmurkin

649
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:07,800
Ran and Wong

650
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:07,800
conjecture is true.

651
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,160
in the first but finite field is still

652
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:24,320
open.

653
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:27,359
>> Yes, thank you. Yeah, conjecture R is

654
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:29,280
true. Finite field is still wide open.

655
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:32,280
Yes.

656
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,280
Yes.

657
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,960
Cool. So actually another reason I was

658
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,359
excited to do projection theory this

659
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,960
semester is that a bunch of the

660
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:43,119
architects of the recent developments

661
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,960
will be visiting. Pablo Mkin is going to

662
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:47,280
be here for about a month. He's going to

663
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:50,000
talk in the analysis seminar. I might

664
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,680
rope him into talking in this class. Um

665
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,400
Kevin Ran is going to visit and give a

666
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:55,599
talk. Hung will be here at at some

667
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,599
point, although maybe not during

668
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,599
classes.

669
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,599
Yeah, I'll say let me say something very

670
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:05,920
briefly. So these these two conjectures

671
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:08,560
I presented them as being parallel to

672
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:12,320
each other. I think that's fair. Um and

673
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:14,160
they're both quite difficult. Um this

674
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,480
one people have managed to prove which

675
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:20,000
is exciting and um and this one is still

676
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:21,680
open. So uh the difference is that in

677
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,760
this problem there are many different

678
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,520
scales. We've sort of seen the many

679
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,960
different scales in in what we just did

680
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,640
with double counting. We had to think

681
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,760
about all these different scales and

682
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:33,280
we're going to do it again with the

683
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:34,560
forier method. So far you might have the

684
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,560
impression that these different scales

685
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:38,720
are just a nuisance. They make simple

686
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:41,839
arguments more complicated and the

687
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:43,359
expressions longer. Um but but actually

688
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:46,320
having these many different scales will

689
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:51,320
turn out to be a help. Um so they play a

690
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:51,320
key role in the proof of this that

691
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,560
somehow because of all these scales if

692
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:59,440
if if something goes wrong something has

693
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:01,680
to go wrong at many different scales. Um

694
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:04,480
the argument also has different cases

695
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:06,800
depending upon whether the sets look

696
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,240
like set have spacing like number one or

697
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,599
spacing like number two. There are

698
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:12,079
different things to play with. They're

699
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:14,640
both helpful in different ways

700
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:16,640
and and none of that structure is

701
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,079
available here. So So probably

702
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:21,079
completely different ideas would be

703
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:21,079
needed.

704
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:36,480
Okay, good. So the second half of the

705
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,280
class the goal is to do the forier

706
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:42,800
method in the real case and build up

707
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:44,720
towards towards doing this. Um let me

708
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,880
remind you first of the main thing we

709
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:49,440
proved using for analysis over finite

710
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:53,800
fields and then we'll set up a version

711
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,800
over over the rings.

712
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:05,309
[Applause]

713
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:23,640
Okay. So part two of the class for a

714
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,640
method.

715
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:36,400
Um okay so the main lema that we proved

716
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:42,240
over finite fields is like this.

717
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:44,240
So let's say fancy L is a set of lines

718
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:46,560
in

719
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:49,680
FQ^2

720
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:52,240
and um F

721
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:56,520
is a sum over all these lines of the

722
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:56,520
characteristic function of the line.

723
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:04,000
Okay, if that's true, then we can break

724
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:07,920
up f into two pieces. a zero frequency

725
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:10,640
piece and a nonzero frequency piece. So

726
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:14,240
then

727
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:18,240
f is equal to f0 plus f we called it f

728
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:20,079
high zero frequency high frequency.

729
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:25,119
So that

730
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:28,960
so the support of f0 hat is just zero.

731
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:30,960
In other words, f0 is constant.

732
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:33,839
Um and we can find out exactly what the

733
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:38,240
constant is. And based on that we can

734
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:41,920
say that the L2 norm squared of this is

735
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:45,040
the number of lines squared.

736
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:50,440
Then the support of the high frequency

737
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:50,440
part is the complement of zero.

738
00:42:50,880 --> 00:43:02,839
And the high frequency part

739
00:42:54,400 --> 00:43:02,839
has an L2 bound. L2 2 is L * Q

740
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:09,440
right

741
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:12,160
I remember teaching a intro to real

742
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:13,280
analysis class once and I and so I I

743
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,359
tried to answer the question on the

744
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,480
first day what is real analysis so there

745
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:18,000
are several you know there are lots of

746
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,520
different things you might say something

747
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,319
about convergence and infinity or

748
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:26,079
whatever but another thing I proposed is

749
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:29,200
um analysis is complicated equals simple

750
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:30,880
plus small.

751
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,560
We study something complicated. The real

752
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,319
analysis point of view is to try to

753
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:36,480
write it as something simple plus

754
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:38,240
something small.

755
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,760
So this is our function that maybe we

756
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,680
feel is complicated. We don't understand

757
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:44,079
it that well yet. We wrote it as

758
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:45,680
something simple. This is a constant

759
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:48,000
function which makes it quite simpler

760
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:50,880
than a general function. And then this

761
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:54,560
bit and the point here is that this is

762
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:56,000
smaller than fot or f. Now that that

763
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,680
only becomes true and this only becomes

764
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,000
at all interesting when the number of

765
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:02,000
lines is much bigger than Q. But when

766
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,400
that h when that happens this L2 norm is

767
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:08,640
much smaller than that L2 norm. So

768
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:12,560
complicated equals simple plus small.

769
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:15,119
Okay. So uh so our goal is I will

770
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:19,240
describe to you the version of this lema

771
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:19,240
in over the real numbers.

772
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:23,070
[Applause]

773
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:50,400
Okay.

774
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:52,240
So instead of a line, so infinitely thin

775
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:55,760
line, what we're going to talk about is

776
00:44:52,240 --> 00:45:01,920
a rectangle or I usually call it a tube.

777
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:04,920
So capital T for tube is a one by R

778
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,920
rectangle

779
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:10,960
in the plane

780
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:13,440
in any direction.

781
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:15,040
Okay. And so basically we're going to

782
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,800
add up characteristic functions of

783
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:19,440
rectangles.

784
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:21,440
Um but when you do for analysis

785
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,960
characteristic functions of rectangles

786
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,880
or characteristic functions in general

787
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:27,599
are not super nice because of the

788
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:29,839
discontinuous sharp cut offs their 4A

789
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:32,079
transforms are not very well behaved. So

790
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:34,079
what we often do is we work with a

791
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:36,240
smoothed approximation of the

792
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:38,000
characteristic function.

793
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:41,920
So

794
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:44,920
C subt is a smooth

795
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,920
approximation

796
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:55,599
of the characteristic function of T.

797
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:57,599
Okay. Um so another thing about this

798
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:59,520
step of doing for analysis on R2 instead

799
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:01,520
of finite fields is that certain things

800
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:03,119
are a little bit messy. for example,

801
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:05,920
it's a little bit messy to write down

802
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:09,599
the formula for C subt.

803
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:12,160
Um, so I'm going to try the approach of

804
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:14,480
not doing the messy details in class. So

805
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:17,839
in class I'll give you an overview and

806
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:20,400
then on the homework, uh, I'll do all of

807
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:21,680
the details and and and you can check

808
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,160
the things and make sure you understand

809
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:28,319
how it works.

810
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:31,200
And uh and I do that partly because I

811
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:33,680
feel like sometimes the messy details

812
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:36,240
obscure sort of the main trajectory of

813
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:38,720
what we want to do. It's good to sort of

814
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:40,000
first learn what you want to do and then

815
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:41,839
um once you know where you're trying to

816
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,079
go, fill in all the little steps to get

817
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:45,839
there.

818
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:48,400
Okay. So for this class, I won't say

819
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:49,599
anything more precise than C subt is a

820
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:53,040
smooth approximation of the

821
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:56,560
characteristic function of T.

822
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:59,440
Okay. So now here is our

823
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:01,839
um main lema

824
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:06,480
in the real case.

825
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:12,079
Okay. So instead of L is a set of lines,

826
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:15,200
T is a set of 1 by R rectangles

827
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:19,040
in the plane R2.

828
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:22,560
And then f is the sum over all the

829
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:24,800
rectangles of this smooth characteristic

830
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:28,400
function. And that plays the role of the

831
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:31,200
function f up there.

832
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:33,760
Okay. And then we're going to break this

833
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:36,319
function up into pieces. There are going

834
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:37,760
to be sort of low frequency pieces that

835
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:39,760
have the advantage of being kind of

836
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:41,760
constant and there are going to be some

837
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:44,640
high frequency pieces that have the

838
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:47,599
advantage of being small.

839
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:50,400
Uh but the difference between the real

840
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:52,240
world and and FQ is that in FQ there are

841
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:56,800
only two kinds of frequencies. There was

842
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:59,119
zero and not zero. Um but uh in in the

843
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:02,800
reals there are a lot of frequencies.

844
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:04,640
There's large, medium, small, very small

845
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:08,240
and all of those are they're each going

846
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:10,000
to to to be there. Okay. So instead of

847
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:13,000
having two pieces, we will have many

848
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
pieces.

849
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:22,000
So f is going to be the sum of f little

850
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:25,200
r little r goes from one up to capital r

851
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,880
and is diatic just like in theorem one.

852
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:28,240
So we'll have log of r many pieces and

853
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,760
these are the different scales of the

854
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:34,160
frequencies.

855
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:36,559
Okay. Uh we'll do this so that

856
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:39,200
the support

857
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:41,760
of fr hat

858
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:44,800
is contained in the ball of radius one

859
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:47,800
over little r. So that's the frequency

860
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,800
information

861
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:54,520
and um we will say something about the

862
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:54,520
L2 norm.

863
00:48:57,359 --> 00:49:02,400
Okay.

864
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:04,800
Now, um, our bounds on the L2 norm

865
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:07,040
before only depended on how many lines

866
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:09,200
there were, not about how the lines were

867
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:11,280
arranged. Uh, but that won't be quite

868
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:13,119
true anymore. Like, like we've seen in

869
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:15,760
other places, it will matter how these

870
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:17,920
tubes are clumped. So, if you have many

871
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:20,480
tubes that are clumped together inside

872
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:23,920
of a um Yeah. Okay. So, let me let me

873
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:29,920
put the other part of the definition. So

874
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:32,160
n subr of t is the maximum over tilda

875
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:34,559
which is like a two little r by two big

876
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:38,880
r rectangle

877
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:41,440
of the number of t in our set of t that

878
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:44,559
are so that t is contained in t tilda.

879
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:46,640
So here's a picture.

880
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:49,599
So here's tilda.

881
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:52,720
This axis is little r basically and this

882
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:55,440
axis is big r basically. Maybe it's good

883
00:49:52,720 --> 00:50:00,920
to put two big R. Um, and inside of here

884
00:49:55,440 --> 00:50:00,920
there may be a bunch of R twos.

885
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:09,760
So just like uh oh and I I guess to be

886
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:13,000
consistent with before I should actually

887
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:13,000
do this.

888
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:18,480
So n subx of r measured whether many of

889
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:20,880
the balls in x were clumped together and

890
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:24,400
n subt of r measures whether many of the

891
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:26,160
tubes of t are clumped together.

892
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:29,200
Okay. So the bound will depend on that

893
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:32,680
thing and it is

894
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,680
formula is

895
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:44,079
okay.

896
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:48,000
n subt of little r

897
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:53,079
um times the number of tubes

898
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:53,079
time little r inverse time big.

899
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:00,130
[Applause]

900
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:04,400
Okay, so you can see that I don't

901
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:06,079
remember this formula that well. Um but

902
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,000
one thing to notice about it is that as

903
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:10,240
as this number gets bigger then our

904
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:13,440
bound for this gets bigger.

905
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:16,800
Um I also claim that this tracks with

906
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:19,839
the finite field case. Um so if you plug

907
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:23,760
in little r equals 1 that's the highest

908
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:26,319
frequency part. Um n subt of one is is

909
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:29,280
going to be just one. If if the tubes

910
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:32,480
are disjoint then then or the tubes are

911
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:33,920
distinct then anyway um uh so then if

912
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:35,200
you plug in little r equals 1 this

913
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:37,680
number will match with the high

914
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:39,599
frequency case. And if you plug in

915
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:42,480
little r equals big r, then this will

916
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:44,000
match with the zero frequency case. But

917
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:47,000
now we also have all this in between

918
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
stuff.

919
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:55,040
Okay,

920
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:57,839
any questions or comments about this

921
00:51:55,040 --> 00:52:02,520
statement?

922
00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:02,520
So I'm going to do a proof sketch.

923
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:34,119
proof sketch main are details on

924
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:34,119
homework two.

925
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:40,440
How's homework one going?

926
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:45,119
If you're interested, there are office

927
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:48,359
hours after class today and after class

928
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:48,359
on Thursday.

929
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:53,000
Okay. Um,

930
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:03,280
okay. There's a fora analysis proof and

931
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:05,200
an important character is well we're

932
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:09,359
take the fora transform of each of these

933
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:12,400
ct hat and the support of ct hat is

934
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:15,040
going to be contained in t star where t

935
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:18,960
star is defined as follows

936
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:21,520
it's the set of c and r2

937
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:26,800
so that

938
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:32,880
the dotproduct x1 - x2 c is at most has

939
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:35,599
norm at most one for any x1 and x2 in t.

940
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:39,440
Um here's a picture.

941
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:43,920
So in x space here is our tube t and I

942
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:47,040
take a couple of points in it x1 and x2

943
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:51,440
and so so our c is going to have a small

944
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:54,319
dotproduct with any vector like that.

945
00:53:51,440 --> 00:54:00,079
And so um okay the dimensions of this t

946
00:53:54,319 --> 00:54:04,559
are this is one and this is r.

947
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:09,040
Okay. Now in csp space um t star is

948
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:14,240
going to be sort of perpendicular to t.

949
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:19,000
There's t star and it has length one and

950
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:19,000
width like 1 / r.

951
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:28,640
So geometrically the idea is that if I

952
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:31,040
take my vector here and my vector there,

953
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:32,559
the long component of this one has size

954
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:34,319
R and it gets paired with the short

955
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:37,359
component of that one which has size one

956
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:39,119
over R which gives me around one and the

957
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:40,720
two short component the short component

958
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:42,720
here has size one which gets paired with

959
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:45,720
the long component here which has size

960
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:45,720
one.

961
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:04,240
Okay. Um and this is analogous to the

962
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:06,640
lema we had in the finite field case

963
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:09,920
that that the characteristic function of

964
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:13,480
a line hat was supported in the line per

965
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:13,480
which is like star.

966
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:22,760
Okay.

967
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:22,760
Um

968
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,960
okay

969
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:33,200
so that's the first important ingredient

970
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:34,480
where the 4A transforms live and I guess

971
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:37,200
you're doing the homework now where

972
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:38,960
you're checking what what line hat looks

973
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:40,720
like and then in the next homework

974
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:44,920
you'll check what ct hat looks like and

975
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:44,920
you'll see it supported like this.

976
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:51,760
Okay. So now I'll tell you who F subr

977
00:55:47,839 --> 00:55:55,680
is. Um

978
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:58,559
so let's next do so the f subr comes

979
00:55:55,680 --> 00:56:00,640
from from littlewood paley theory where

980
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:03,040
you can take any function and you can

981
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:04,960
break its frequencies into diatic pieces

982
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:08,359
the little wood pale pieces. That's what

983
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:08,359
we're doing here.

984
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:20,440
Okay. So,

985
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:25,880
so little wood pale decomposition.

986
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:36,160
So, I'm going to write one as a sum on

987
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:39,760
my diatic little rs

988
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:43,280
of ad r of c. So this is a a partition

989
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:44,720
of unity on in 4A space. It's a

990
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:47,200
partition of unity. So these are all

991
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:50,160
positive

992
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:54,559
and um the support

993
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:57,839
of A to R is contained in in an annulus

994
00:56:54,559 --> 00:57:00,559
where the norm of C is at most 1 / R and

995
00:56:57,839 --> 00:57:02,960
at least 1 / 10R.

996
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:05,599
And that's true for R strictly between 1

997
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:07,280
and R. And at the end points we need to

998
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:08,640
have not just an annulus but something a

999
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:12,240
little bit bigger to cover all the

1000
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:15,839
frequencies. So the support

1001
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:19,440
of ADA capital R

1002
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:21,599
is contained in the ball of radius 1 / R

1003
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:23,599
and the support

1004
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:26,799
of ADA1

1005
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:31,240
is contained in the set of C where the

1006
00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:31,240
norm of C is bigger than 110.

1007
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:40,559
All right. Oh, I guess one maybe I

1008
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:42,559
should mention one one thing that we see

1009
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:45,680
from this

1010
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:48,240
is that the support of f hat is

1011
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:53,559
contained in the unit ball because every

1012
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:53,559
t star is in is in the unit ball.

1013
00:57:56,160 --> 00:58:03,599
Okay. So now I can say who f_sub_r is.

1014
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:05,839
So f is just taking f and taking

1015
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:10,400
multiplying on the frequency side by 8

1016
00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:14,480
r. So I take fhat I multiply it by a r

1017
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:17,599
and I take the 4 a transform back.

1018
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:21,599
So this is also equal to f involved with

1019
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:23,599
a to r inverse 4 a transform.

1020
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:26,599
Okay. And because this is a partition of

1021
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:26,599
unity

1022
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:33,440
that tells me that f is indeed the sum

1023
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:35,440
over r of fr.

1024
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:37,119
So that so we can check off our first

1025
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:39,359
conclusion.

1026
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:43,880
Um and from this formula this here is

1027
00:58:39,359 --> 00:58:43,880
the for transform of FR hat

1028
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:52,640
is a R * Fhat and that tells us that the

1029
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:55,280
support of FR hat is contained in the

1030
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:58,000
ball of radius 1 / R. So we can check

1031
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:59,359
off that part of the conclusion.

1032
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,839
And then the difficult and interesting

1033
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:05,799
part will be to figure out the L2 norm

1034
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:05,799
of each of these pieces FR.

1035
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:16,319
Okay. Um now this operation of

1036
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:18,079
localizing frequencies to to an annulus

1037
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:20,000
around 1 / R you can do it with any

1038
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:22,079
function not just with f. So you can

1039
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:28,000
also do it with each of the ct one at a

1040
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:30,960
time. So ct comma r would be I take ct

1041
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:34,960
hat I multiply it by a to r I take the

1042
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:41,319
for a transform back and so f is the sum

1043
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:41,319
over all the t in my set of tubes of ct.

1044
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:52,960
Okay.

1045
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:55,359
So the next thing I'd like to do is to

1046
00:59:52,960 --> 01:00:00,280
visualize together this function a to r

1047
00:59:55,359 --> 01:00:00,280
check and this function ctr

1048
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:38,680
do a visual

1049
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:38,680
of ad r check um and ctr.

1050
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:48,240
Okay, so the function A to R itself A to

1051
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:52,480
R of C that's around one on the annulus

1052
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:54,240
of size 1 / little R.

1053
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:55,839
So when I take its inverse for a

1054
01:00:54,240 --> 01:01:00,559
transform

1055
01:00:55,839 --> 01:01:02,720
um a to r check of x

1056
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:07,839
will be around

1057
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:12,640
it'll be around um 1 / r 2

1058
01:01:07,839 --> 01:01:14,400
of most of x less than r.

1059
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:16,720
So the you know the biggest this could

1060
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:18,720
possibly be is integrating this would be

1061
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:21,040
the area of this annulus which is 1 /

1062
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:24,319
r^2.

1063
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:26,400
Um and then because this is smooth once

1064
01:01:24,319 --> 01:01:28,480
I look at x's that are significantly

1065
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:30,720
bigger than r I start to get a lot of

1066
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:32,559
cancellation in the integral and let me

1067
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:38,799
write down the formula for this. So a to

1068
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:43,200
r check of x is the integral e to the ix

1069
01:01:38,799 --> 01:01:45,680
a r of c dx c.

1070
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:47,200
So if x is smaller than r, there's no

1071
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:51,040
significant cancellation in this

1072
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:53,440
integral because the c is around 1 / r.

1073
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:55,040
Um but then when x is bigger than r,

1074
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:56,559
there starts to be cancellation in this

1075
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:58,880
integral. And because this is smooth,

1076
01:01:56,559 --> 01:02:02,839
the cancellation is quite dramatic. So

1077
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:02,839
this is rapidly decaying

1078
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:06,680
x.

1079
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:13,760
Okay, so that's what the size of this

1080
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:16,079
function is like. Um but but also um

1081
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:18,960
there's some cancellation in it. So if

1082
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:21,920
you integrate this function

1083
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:25,359
well if you integrate that you get a to

1084
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:27,040
r of zero which is zero because a to r

1085
01:02:25,359 --> 01:02:28,559
is supported on an annulus and not a

1086
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:33,559
ball. So this function has some

1087
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:33,559
cancellation in it. It averages to zero.

1088
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:38,119
Okay.

1089
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:45,040
Um so

1090
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:47,040
I I can graph it. Um C sub R check is

1091
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:49,760
radial.

1092
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:54,079
So here is the radius norm of X and

1093
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:58,680
here's ADA R check of X and it would

1094
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:58,680
look something like this.

1095
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:03,119
And we have to do this carefully but the

1096
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:05,520
negative part is going to balance the

1097
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:09,400
positive part to integrate to zero. So

1098
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:09,400
imagine rotating this

1099
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:15,240
Um, and this scale here is is that's

1100
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:28,319
okay. Now, these different exponents

1101
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:30,480
here are

1102
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:35,039
work out nicely.

1103
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:37,440
Um and and a a different way a way to

1104
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:40,319
describe it is that if I take the

1105
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:42,559
integral of the norm of a total r check

1106
01:03:40,319 --> 01:03:45,680
of x dx

1107
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:49,440
um well it's around 1 / r^2 times the

1108
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:52,880
area of the ball of radius r which is 1.

1109
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:56,000
That integral is around 1.

1110
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:58,160
So um so if I were to take some function

1111
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:01,039
and convolve it with the absolute value

1112
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:05,200
of a total r check of x that would

1113
01:04:01,039 --> 01:04:08,400
roughly be the average value of f

1114
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:09,680
on the ball around x of radius r the

1115
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:11,599
sort of weighted average. It's not

1116
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:15,480
exactly the standard average but that's

1117
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:15,480
roughly what what it is.

1118
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:23,280
So is it the case that like

1119
01:04:20,799 --> 01:04:25,280
um convoluting with a function on the

1120
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:29,200
end

1121
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:32,720
like if data r is like on the end

1122
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:36,839
basically behaves the same as if it were

1123
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:36,839
on the fall radius.

1124
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:42,480
>> So the question is how would we compare

1125
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:43,920
an ad r that's supported on an annulus

1126
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:47,440
with a similar function that was

1127
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:49,520
supported on the whole ball. Um yeah,

1128
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:51,839
it's mostly similar because of the

1129
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:53,599
annulus. There's more cancellation. So

1130
01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:56,240
if we did it on the whole ball, we

1131
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:56,640
wouldn't have this integral property.

1132
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:58,480
>> Okay.

1133
01:04:56,640 --> 01:05:00,000
>> And the ne there may or may not be a

1134
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:01,359
little negative part if we did it on the

1135
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,640
whole ball, but the negative part would

1136
01:05:01,359 --> 01:05:05,960
probably would be dominated by the

1137
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:05,960
positive part.

1138
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:16,200
Okay, so that's what the function ad

1139
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:16,200
looks like.

1140
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:23,760
And now that we understand that we can

1141
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:27,920
understand the function CTR

1142
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:32,839
because CTR is equal to CT convolved

1143
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:32,839
with ADA R check.

1144
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:41,359
Okay. So the norm of ctr of x is around

1145
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:44,960
r inverse times the characteristic

1146
01:05:41,359 --> 01:05:49,520
function of a thickened tube.

1147
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:54,280
So if I take the r neighborhood of t.

1148
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:54,280
So if this is uh t

1149
01:05:55,520 --> 01:06:02,960
I could take a fat neighborhood of that

1150
01:05:59,839 --> 01:06:07,039
would look sort of like this.

1151
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:09,440
So that's the R neighborhood of T. Um so

1152
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:11,200
PT itself is basically supported on T

1153
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:13,760
although it's smoothed out a little bit.

1154
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:16,400
And then when I take the low frequency

1155
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:18,640
part the R the one over R frequency part

1156
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:21,640
then it gets spread out and it gets

1157
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:21,640
smaller.

1158
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:29,200
Okay. And it also has some cancellation

1159
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:31,440
in it. So if the the graph of this

1160
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:33,920
function mostly depends on the

1161
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:35,280
transverse direction and then it looks a

1162
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:36,720
lot like this. So this would be the

1163
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:39,880
transverse direction and this would be

1164
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:39,880
the height.

1165
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,280
So here I'll put that in the picture.

1166
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:49,680
So this transverse direction maybe I'll

1167
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:51,440
call y.

1168
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:55,440
And then we could make a graph where

1169
01:06:51,440 --> 01:07:00,079
here we put y and here we put ct

1170
01:06:55,440 --> 01:07:04,760
r of y and we would see the same thing

1171
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:04,760
uh positive negative.

1172
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:12,000
Okay. And this length scale here is r.

1173
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:14,160
the negative part would cancel the

1174
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:17,440
positive part because if you convolve

1175
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:19,760
something who integrates to zero with

1176
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:23,480
something else then the the whole thing

1177
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:23,480
will integrate to zero.

1178
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:31,799
Okay, so that's what what these

1179
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:31,799
functions look like.

1180
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:43,389
[Applause]

1181
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:48,200
All right.

1182
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:54,960
So before I erase this maybe I'll say

1183
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:57,119
sorry we mentioned earlier that if we

1184
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:59,680
have a smooth function supported on this

1185
01:07:57,119 --> 01:08:02,640
tube we take its 4A transform it's

1186
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:04,799
essentially supported on this dual tube.

1187
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:07,039
That proof is a slightly fancier version

1188
01:08:04,799 --> 01:08:08,640
of what we were just talking about. So

1189
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:11,200
we were just saying that if you have a

1190
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:13,839
smooth function on a certain annulus or

1191
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:16,239
a certain ball then its fora transform

1192
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:19,839
is essentially supported on a dual ball

1193
01:08:16,239 --> 01:08:22,400
and then it's rapidly decaying outside.

1194
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:24,319
So the this first statement is exactly

1195
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:26,640
the same as that except that we have a

1196
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:28,480
tube instead of a ball. Having a tube

1197
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:30,159
instead of a ball makes it a little

1198
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:31,520
there's a little bit more writing or

1199
01:08:30,159 --> 01:08:33,120
thinking involved but it's the same

1200
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:35,199
idea.

1201
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:39,000
uh and you'll and and it'll be the

1202
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:39,000
details will be on the homework.

1203
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:42,040
Okay.

1204
01:08:45,839 --> 01:08:52,880
Okay. So, um in the finite field case,

1205
01:08:50,239 --> 01:08:54,880
the the the the heart of the argument,

1206
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:57,359
the key thing called the key lema was an

1207
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:58,960
orthogonality lema that said that the

1208
01:08:57,359 --> 01:09:01,920
high frequency parts of two different

1209
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:04,640
lines are orthogonal. and um something

1210
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:08,159
like that is true here.

1211
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:12,159
So lema on orthogonality this is like

1212
01:09:08,159 --> 01:09:17,359
the key letter. So it says the following

1213
01:09:12,159 --> 01:09:20,600
um uh t1 and t2 are are are tubes one by

1214
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:20,600
r tubes

1215
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:27,920
um then

1216
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:32,000
the ctrs are usually orthogonal. So if I

1217
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:35,520
take the inner product of CT1R

1218
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:39,040
with CT2R,

1219
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:40,880
it's usually really small.

1220
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:42,400
R the minus a,000, something that's

1221
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:46,159
really small compared to everything in

1222
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:48,640
our proof. Uh unless the two tubes are

1223
01:09:46,159 --> 01:09:53,920
quite similar. And the way we'll say

1224
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:55,840
this is there exists tilda which is like

1225
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:59,040
basically

1226
01:09:55,840 --> 01:10:00,719
it's basically a little r by big r two.

1227
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:03,120
I'm going to magnify it just a little

1228
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:07,080
bit.

1229
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:07,080
um that contains them both

1230
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:18,920
tilda and inside of here and I have this

1231
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:18,920
t1 and t2.

1232
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:27,360
Okay, so we could have some intuition

1233
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:29,199
about this from our visualization of

1234
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:33,040
ctr.

1235
01:10:29,199 --> 01:10:35,199
If I were to take T1 and T2 in in the

1236
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:36,640
same Tilda. So this thickened

1237
01:10:35,199 --> 01:10:40,000
neighborhood notice is basically the

1238
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:42,400
same as Tilda. If I pick T1 and T2

1239
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:45,120
corresponding to the same Tilda, then

1240
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:47,679
when I when I thicken them both, I get

1241
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:50,320
basically the same rectangle.

1242
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:53,440
And in fact, then the functions CT1R and

1243
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:56,480
CT2R are basically the same function. So

1244
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:58,080
they are not at all orthogonal.

1245
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:59,360
And that's the only thing that can go

1246
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:01,120
wrong.

1247
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:03,760
Um if the thickened neighborhoods are

1248
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:05,600
disjoint they certainly are orthogonal

1249
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:06,800
and the more interesting part is that if

1250
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:08,719
the thickened neighborhoods are

1251
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:11,719
transverse to each other they are

1252
01:11:08,719 --> 01:11:11,719
orthogonal

1253
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:17,840
and we we can we check that by by for

1254
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:19,440
analysis.

1255
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:23,080
Um

1256
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:23,080
so proof sketch.

1257
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:30,560
Um

1258
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:34,120
if the

1259
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:34,120
if the angle

1260
01:11:34,159 --> 01:11:44,719
between t1 and t2 is bigger than maybe r

1261
01:11:39,679 --> 01:11:47,360
epsilon 1 / r or little r big r.

1262
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:49,280
Um then

1263
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:56,000
the support

1264
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:57,600
of CTR hat intercepted the support T1 of

1265
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:01,520
CT2R

1266
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:05,199
hat is empty

1267
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:10,719
right so the support of CT1

1268
01:12:05,199 --> 01:12:13,440
so this is the support of CT1 hat

1269
01:12:10,719 --> 01:12:15,040
intersected with the annulus of size 1 /

1270
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:20,000
are

1271
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:21,840
intersected with the support of CT2 hat

1272
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:25,600
and these are two rectangles that are

1273
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:26,640
transverse to each other. Uh and so wow

1274
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:28,320
and you can you can check the

1275
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:30,800
intersection.

1276
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:33,440
>> Why does it rule out the translations of

1277
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:35,679
rectangles?

1278
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:40,640
>> Yeah. And so that's case one. So the

1279
01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:44,400
other case is if um the R neighborhood

1280
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:49,199
of T1 is disjoint

1281
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:51,679
from the R neighborhood of T2 or you

1282
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:54,560
know a little bit more than R. Um then

1283
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:58,400
we use the formula

1284
01:12:54,560 --> 01:13:01,840
CTR is CT1.

1285
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:08,320
So that so then we have here

1286
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:12,480
integral ct1 r c2 r complex conjugate

1287
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:16,480
it's the integral ct1 convolved with ad1

1288
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:19,679
and ct2 convolved

1289
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:23,159
a r check and and these two guys have

1290
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:23,159
disjoint report.

1291
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:50,080
[Applause]

1292
01:13:48,239 --> 01:13:52,400
Okay.

1293
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:56,480
So now we are ready to estimate the L2

1294
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:58,880
norm. Um so our orthogonality lema says

1295
01:13:56,480 --> 01:14:01,280
that these different CTRs

1296
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:03,199
are usually orthogonal with a few

1297
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:06,000
exceptions and we're going to use that

1298
01:14:03,199 --> 01:14:07,520
orthogonality to estimate the L2 norm.

1299
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:11,239
But we have to keep track of how many

1300
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:11,239
exceptions there are.

1301
01:14:28,239 --> 01:14:32,679
All right. So, L2 estimate.

1302
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:40,960
So, the last thing we need to check is

1303
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:44,640
FR L2 squared. So, FR is the sum over

1304
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:47,280
all of our T of ctr.

1305
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:49,760
L2 squ.

1306
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:52,800
So that's this thing inner product with

1307
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:58,159
itself. So if I expand it out, it's the

1308
01:14:52,800 --> 01:15:02,480
sum T1 T2 of um

1309
01:14:58,159 --> 01:15:05,800
the inner product of C T1R

1310
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:05,800
C T2R.

1311
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:13,840
Okay. And the key point is orthogonality

1312
01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:16,000
lema tells us that most of the inner

1313
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:18,480
products in this sum are negligible.

1314
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:20,480
There's only a few that are not. Let me

1315
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:23,640
give a bit of a name to the ones that

1316
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:23,640
are not.

1317
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:27,899
[Applause]

1318
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:34,400
So this scenario

1319
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:36,800
here

1320
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:41,360
I'm going to abbreviate it as saying

1321
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:41,440
that T1 uh is related to T2. T T T T T T

1322
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:42,080
T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T

1323
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:43,840
T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T1 is close

1324
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:46,719
to T2.

1325
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:49,199
I guess we could put a little r here.

1326
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:52,480
So this inner product is negligible

1327
01:15:49,199 --> 01:15:54,480
unless T1 is related to T2.

1328
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:56,480
Okay,

1329
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:59,480
so let's look at our big sum of inner

1330
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:59,480
products

1331
01:16:00,239 --> 01:16:07,199
and I'll break it up into two parts.

1332
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:10,239
It's the sum where T1 is related to T2

1333
01:16:07,199 --> 01:16:12,080
inner product plus the rest of them and

1334
01:16:10,239 --> 01:16:13,920
the rest of them are really tiny by the

1335
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:17,080
orthogonality lema. So the rest of them

1336
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:17,080
are negligible.

1337
01:16:20,239 --> 01:16:24,800
Okay. Now each of these inner products

1338
01:16:22,159 --> 01:16:28,560
I'll arithmetic geometric mean it. So

1339
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:30,400
that's less than this sum t1 related to

1340
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:32,400
t2

1341
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:34,080
of ctr

1342
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:42,280
l2

1343
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:42,280
ct1 r l2 2 plus ct2r l2.

1344
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:51,199
Okay. So I want to know how many times

1345
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:53,120
does each of these functions ct1 appear

1346
01:16:51,199 --> 01:16:55,360
in this sum

1347
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:58,800
and the number of times is the number of

1348
01:16:55,360 --> 01:17:02,000
different t2s that are related to t1

1349
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:06,080
and that number is basically the number

1350
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:07,679
that appears in our main lema.

1351
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:10,400
This thing that we were counting here

1352
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:13,760
how many tubes lie in a little r by big

1353
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:17,040
r big tube. That's exactly how many

1354
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:19,440
tubes t2 are related to t1.

1355
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:21,440
So this thing

1356
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:25,760
uh

1357
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:29,040
we can say the number of t2 so that t2

1358
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:34,000
is related to t1

1359
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:37,199
this is bounded by nr of t. So this

1360
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:41,679
whole sum is bounded by

1361
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:47,719
nr of t times just the sum on all the t

1362
01:17:41,679 --> 01:17:47,719
and t of ctr l2.

1363
01:17:55,520 --> 01:18:00,159
Cool. And then finally each of these

1364
01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:02,610
functions we've already described.

1365
01:18:00,159 --> 01:18:03,840
Hopefully I didn't erase it.

1366
01:18:02,610 --> 01:18:06,400
[Applause]

1367
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:08,719
Yeah, so we described it. It has height

1368
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:11,280
r inverse and it's supported on a little

1369
01:18:08,719 --> 01:18:15,360
r by big r rectangle. So we can compute

1370
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:20,000
its L2 norm. Um

1371
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:23,600
so this is n subt of r times the number

1372
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:28,080
of tubes times uh the height was r

1373
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:32,159
inverse. So that's rus 2 times the

1374
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:36,120
uh so this is the amplitude squared

1375
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:36,120
and this is the area

1376
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:41,600
for this ptr.

1377
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:45,159
Okay. And that was the thing that was on

1378
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:45,159
the right hand side.

1379
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:51,520
Okay. Let me summarize the proof for the

1380
01:18:48,239 --> 01:18:54,840
last minute. Um let's look back at our

1381
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:54,840
statement here.

1382
01:18:57,679 --> 01:19:01,520
So if we look at this sum of sum of

1383
01:18:59,679 --> 01:19:03,600
tubes, we're going to break it into

1384
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:07,440
different frequency pieces. Littlewood

1385
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:09,600
pale theory. And then um the

1386
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:12,320
highfrequency pieces are usually

1387
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:13,920
orthogonal to each other. If you take if

1388
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:16,400
you look at two tubes and you look at

1389
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:18,800
the frequency one over R part, they're

1390
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:21,120
orthogonal to each other unless those

1391
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:23,679
two tubes are in a common fat tube

1392
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:25,600
little R by big R.

1393
01:19:23,679 --> 01:19:27,440
And so you take advantage of that

1394
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:31,080
orthogonality where it's available and

1395
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:31,080
it gives this bound.

1396
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:42,880
Okay, good. Let's stop there for today.

1397
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:45,360
uh we will wrap this up on Thursday and

1398
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:47,199
and then uh discuss how similar ideas

1399
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:52,040
apply in a different looking context in

1400
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:52,040
civ theory in in number theory.
