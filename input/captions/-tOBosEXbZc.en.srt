1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:05,799
Well, in a world advancing towards

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:08,400
globalization, strong competitive

3
00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:11,280
pressures force companies to operate as

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,559
if there were a single world market with

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,720
the same prices for goods, capital, and

6
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:19,039
labor. After decades in which the costs

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,960
of distance declined and countries

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:24,320
lowered the border level barriers to

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:27,439
trade, globalization is now reversed and

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:30,000
global markets are fragmenting. MIT

11
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:32,559
Institute professor Suzanne Burer will

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,200
give us insight into the main causes for

13
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:37,440
this shift and help us understand how in

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,879
a world characterized by new border

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,280
level barriers including tariffs, export

16
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,680
controls, import controls, and

17
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,920
immigration restrictions, national

18
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,000
support for domestic manufacturing,

19
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,399
which was dismissed as unimportant only

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,879
a decade ago, has now become a key

21
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:58,520
objective in all countries. Please give

22
00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:02,420
a warm welcome to Professor Suzanne Ber.

23
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:14,450
[Applause]

24
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:14,450
[Music]

25
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:23,720
[Applause]

26
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:31,280
So I have a presentation in two parts

27
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:34,000
and one part I'm will present this

28
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:37,119
afternoon and the next part uh tomorrow

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,720
morning uh uh because what I'd like to

30
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:44,280
explain to you this afternoon is why it

31
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:47,840
is that manufacturing has become

32
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:50,079
critical in all countries today. What

33
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,840
are the changes in the international

34
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:59,479
economy that has made it seem imperative

35
00:01:53,840 --> 00:02:02,280
for us to uh uh in fact regrow and

36
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:06,079
transform manufacturing in our own

37
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:09,039
national economies and then tomorrow uh

38
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:11,599
with my colleagues uh from MIT we're

39
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:15,120
going to talk about what we can do to

40
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:18,200
transform manufacturing and how we hope

41
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:21,760
again to be able to create uh new

42
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:24,879
manufacturing that will be significantly

43
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:27,920
more productive, significantly more

44
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:30,480
resilient, and produce better jobs uh

45
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:33,040
for those who work in this sector. But

46
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,280
this afternoon, I'd like to talk about

47
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,319
why this change has come about. Because

48
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,920
as Randall expressed, when I talked here

49
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:45,519
at um at an earlier session of of of

50
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:48,840
this of this group uh 12 years ago, we

51
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:52,239
had to even defend the idea that

52
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:55,760
manufacturing mattered at all. Uh we

53
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:58,800
were at a time when uh when when an

54
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:01,599
economist like Larry Summers uh former

55
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,920
president of Harvard um said we really

56
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:07,440
didn't need any manufacturing in the

57
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:10,400
United States at all. We could just all

58
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:13,440
follow the model of Apple. Apple's model

59
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,440
seemed to be design in the United States

60
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,080
and distribute in the United States and

61
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,879
produce everything somewhere else. So

62
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,360
how have we moved from a world where you

63
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:26,080
know 15 years ago it just didn't seem

64
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,879
important at all to a world in which

65
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:32,000
it's it's absolutely critical and I

66
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:34,879
think that these changes have come about

67
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,640
uh because globalization is really

68
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:41,000
disappearing uh and disappearing

69
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:42,599
rapidly. Uh in

70
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,080
1914,

71
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:48,799
globalization disappeared once before

72
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,400
and that was after another period from

73
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:55,280
1850 roughly to

74
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:59,920
1914 in which globalization again had

75
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:02,519
been dominant between 1850 and 1914. And

76
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,120
in that time in

77
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:06,799
1914

78
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:11,480
disappeared globalization disappeared

79
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:14,920
over the course of one week between July

80
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:18,359
31st when the London Stock Exchange

81
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:20,720
closed and August 4th,

82
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:24,800
1914 when the English government

83
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,880
declared war on Germany. And we now know

84
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,160
that the

85
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:31,759
consequences of that war and the

86
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,360
consequences of that end of

87
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:37,600
globalization

88
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:40,160
uh were uh enormous for the world. Uh

89
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:43,040
they were enormous in many many ways.

90
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,880
But if we focus simply on the economy,

91
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:49,919
what was critical was that the levels of

92
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:53,840
crossborder flows uh between countries,

93
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:57,040
flows of capital, flows of labor and

94
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:59,960
flows of goods and services. They did

95
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:03,800
not return to the level of

96
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:07,720
1914 until the early

97
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:10,280
1980s. So even if we consider only the

98
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,360
economy, Yes. First of all,

99
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:15,759
globalization is

100
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:19,639
reversible. And secondly, once you start

101
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:24,400
reversing it, it becomes extremely

102
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:27,280
difficult to bring it back again. And I

103
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,880
think that just as people in that

104
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:34,160
earlier period

105
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:37,400
underestimated what was at stake uh in

106
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:41,600
uh in for the economy. Uh I think that

107
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:45,160
today we are greatly underestimating the

108
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:48,240
costs and dangers that the end of

109
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:51,039
globalization is likely to have in our

110
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:54,000
own time. In fact, we don't even really

111
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:56,720
agree on what is happening. Many people

112
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
claim well the level of uh goods and

113
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,639
services uh has not really fallen that

114
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,360
much. uh we still if we're not getting

115
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:09,120
it from China, we're getting these goods

116
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:12,160
from Vietnam and and and Mexico. Are we

117
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:15,720
doing delobalization or do we have

118
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:18,520
something like regional variance of

119
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:21,880
globalization? Uh do we have

120
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:25,199
organization some kind of international

121
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:28,160
organization that for example uh we know

122
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,880
that Apple is still stuck in China. We

123
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:34,120
know that many of the goods that used to

124
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:37,520
come directly from China are now making

125
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:40,560
detours through Vietnam and and Mexico

126
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:43,280
and other countries. And uh so I think

127
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,319
there's a lot of uncertainty, but I

128
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:49,039
would like to suggest today that we are

129
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:52,520
truly seeing an end and that that is

130
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:56,080
really what sets up the the the

131
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:59,120
imperative of restoring and renewing uh

132
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,280
our domestic our domestic economies. And

133
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,840
as a social scientist, I'd like to

134
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:07,520
suggest that the a simple definition of

135
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:10,240
globalization is really the most useful

136
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:13,120
for us. In a simple model of

137
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:18,000
globalization, we can imagine that all

138
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:22,000
firms have to operate as if there were a

139
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,479
single world model, a single world

140
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:29,919
market rather, in which the prices of

141
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:32,240
goods, services, and wages were the same

142
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:35,919
everywhere in the world. And of course,

143
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:39,599
we know that no such world ever existed.

144
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:44,440
So what did exist? and has existed over

145
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:48,319
the last 40 years is a world driven by

146
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:52,400
competition to reduce prices and above

147
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:56,479
all the prices of goods, services and

148
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:59,280
wages. It's as if each firm believed

149
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:02,639
that they had to compete in a world in

150
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:06,919
which we were heading towards a single

151
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:11,680
world market. And uh it that that

152
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:14,240
dynamic today is being destroyed and

153
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:17,599
it's being destroyed simply because

154
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:21,599
governments are setting up barriers at

155
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:25,120
the frontier. Governments are uh uh of

156
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:28,000
course have always in a way used border

157
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:31,840
level barriers. Governments used to use

158
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:35,279
tariffs as a way of raising revenue. Um,

159
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:38,039
governments used to use uh uh tariffs as

160
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:42,880
a way of protecting one or another

161
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:46,800
domestic industry. But in the past, it

162
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:50,560
was usually natural barriers, distance,

163
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:54,000
and time that did the heavy lifting of

164
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:58,320
protecting national economies against

165
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:01,440
flows from above, flows from outside.

166
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:04,560
And I think today we're in a world where

167
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:07,279
technology has basically conquered

168
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,800
distance. Technology has made

169
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:12,560
communication between countries

170
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:15,839
instantaneous. And so we can no longer

171
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:19,440
count on natural barriers. In fact, we

172
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:22,640
need to imagine that politics and border

173
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:25,200
level barriers uh import and export

174
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:28,279
controls are going to be doing all the

175
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:31,519
heavy lifting on protecting domestic

176
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:34,080
economies against against the outside

177
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:37,480
against the rest of the world. And it

178
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:42,080
was in fact the new technologies of the

179
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:47,680
1980s and the 1990s that in fact made

180
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:50,959
this uh uh uh pressure to behave behave

181
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:53,839
as if there was going to be and in fact

182
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:57,600
there already was something like a

183
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,440
single world uh market that destroyed

184
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,000
the

185
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:05,519
containerships, the uh internet um all

186
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,640
of that did the work of destroying the

187
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:12,320
barriers, the natural barriers of

188
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:15,959
distance and time. And we saw in the

189
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:18,399
early 1990s that once you had

190
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:21,920
digitalization that it was and once it

191
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:25,440
was possible to send a digital file that

192
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:28,720
some chip designer in California had

193
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:31,680
made to a factory in Taiwan that would

194
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:34,880
actually make the semiconductor. Once

195
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:37,200
that was possible, that's what everybody

196
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:40,320
tried to do because that reduced the

197
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:43,040
cost of labor in your own country and

198
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,600
the cost of building factories in your

199
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:48,720
own country. And so on one hand there

200
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:53,040
were the technological changes that made

201
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:55,360
it possible to outsource and offshore

202
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:58,320
just about everything. And then there

203
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:01,279
was tremendous pressure from stock

204
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:05,200
exchanges, from financial markets, in

205
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:07,600
fact to outsource and offshore just

206
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,480
about everything. So those countries

207
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,600
that got rid of those companies that got

208
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:16,320
rid of uh the maximum of factories and

209
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:19,040
the maximum of workers, those were the

210
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:22,079
companies that did the best in stock

211
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:25,200
exchanges. And you could see that um in

212
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:28,480
fact those companies that did the most

213
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:31,680
outsourcing and the most offshoring did

214
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:34,480
the best in markets. And uh that was the

215
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:37,920
advice that it was virtually impossible

216
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,600
uh to to to do otherwise or so at least

217
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,720
companies

218
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:45,680
uh companies uh believed. And so we

219
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:50,000
moved into a world in which financial

220
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:53,120
markets uh desired and rewarded pure

221
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,920
play businesses. And that was a world in

222
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,120
which the

223
00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:03,360
dominant companies of the

224
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:05,680
1940s 50s60s and 70s those were uh those

225
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,320
were vertically integrated companies.

226
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:12,240
They were companies like IBM, like

227
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:14,560
DuPont, uh like uh Texas Instruments.

228
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,519
And these companies had been vertically

229
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:20,240
integrated ones. And the pressures for

230
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:23,519
pure play investment, the pressures to

231
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:26,639
get rid of factories and workers broke

232
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:29,600
apart all of those countries, all of

233
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:33,040
those companies. And what we have been

234
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:36,560
left with at this point are core what

235
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:39,680
business uh uh language calls core

236
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:44,120
component competence companies. Core

237
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:48,480
competence companies focus on a single

238
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:51,880
activity. And so it's this world of core

239
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:55,880
competence companies that we now have to

240
00:12:51,880 --> 00:13:00,240
imagine rebuilding uh manufacturing

241
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:03,519
with. And so I think today we are moving

242
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:06,800
in a very different direction from the

243
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:11,040
past 40 years. We're moving into a world

244
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:14,320
in which all countries are raising

245
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:17,839
political barriers that surround their

246
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:20,040
territories. And while the overall level

247
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:25,360
of trade has

248
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:27,760
been descending but not very rapidly uh

249
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,279
and that's why some people still

250
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,639
disagree

251
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:36,800
uh that globalization is over. I think

252
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:41,519
the direction is really pretty clear

253
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:45,440
that we're um raising barriers not only

254
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:49,760
to what comes from China, we're raising

255
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:53,360
barriers to what comes from our allies

256
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:57,440
uh and uh uh from those c countries that

257
00:13:53,360 --> 00:14:00,880
have been closest to us over the past uh

258
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:03,519
70 years. And so of course these

259
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:07,600
pressures are going to be perhaps

260
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:11,920
greatest on American uh companies who

261
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:16,880
are now facing tremendous disruptions

262
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:19,440
and very very rough rides uh today with

263
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:23,839
President Trump who I think we might

264
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:26,160
call the great disruptor. Um, but I

265
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:30,800
think we should not delude ourselves

266
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:34,160
that uh the tariffs that were passed uh

267
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:37,839
in the first Trump administration

268
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:41,360
uh were never discontinued during the

269
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:44,079
Biden administration. On the contrary,

270
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:47,040
during the Democratic presidency of

271
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:51,079
President Biden, the barriers got

272
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:55,199
higher. uh the the uh policy that Jake

273
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:58,480
Sullivan announced of a high fence but a

274
00:14:55,199 --> 00:15:01,320
small yard that is protecting uh very

275
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:05,600
little but protecting it with uh high

276
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:09,519
barriers. In fact, the small yard kept

277
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:13,360
getting bigger and the fences kept uh

278
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:17,120
getting bigger even during a Democratic

279
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:20,920
Biden administration. So I think that

280
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:24,880
waiting it out is not a rational

281
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:28,440
strategy. This is not a situation that

282
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:31,920
is likely to change even if the

283
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:35,199
Democrats return to power. And that

284
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:37,920
again, this is sort of a a lengthy

285
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:40,639
preface to the story that I want to tell

286
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:45,120
tomorrow in our workshop about why it's

287
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:48,160
so critical for us to be able to uh

288
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:52,440
transform and revive manufacturing in

289
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:56,000
our own countries. Now focusing on why

290
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:59,519
globalization has um has been destroyed

291
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,399
both by Republicans and Democrats in our

292
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:04,959
own country and I think many of you see

293
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:07,519
uh here in Austria some of the same uh

294
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:10,000
some of the same uh pressures. I think

295
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,560
there really were three reasons that

296
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,839
were have been at

297
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:19,040
work over the past uh 1015 years that

298
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:23,839
have undermined globalization. First of

299
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:26,480
all, um uh globalization was great for

300
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:30,079
many of the peoples of this of this

301
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:32,800
earth. There were millions who uh were

302
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:36,079
raised by globalization. Millions in

303
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:39,680
Asia who uh who were raised from abject

304
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:43,920
poverty to lives of dignity and and

305
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:48,079
work. But in fact, globalization was not

306
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:51,839
great for liberal democracies. uh the uh

307
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:56,800
waves of imports from lowwave low-wage

308
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:59,839
countries led to uh firings and job loss

309
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:02,720
in all liberal uh economies. And I think

310
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:05,360
we saw a tremendous reaction to that in

311
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:10,000
Britain with Brexit and in the United

312
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:14,640
States with massive movements of uh uh

313
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:17,640
uh anger and uh a very divisive forms of

314
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:20,079
political uh polarization. Uh

315
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:23,439
globalization meant that parts of our

316
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:27,199
country uh Youngstown, Ohio, Detroit,

317
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:29,320
Michigan, parts of Wisconsin, uh these

318
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:32,720
were parts of the country that were

319
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:36,400
basically single industry uh cities.

320
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:39,840
They became wastelands. The iron uh rust

321
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:43,520
rust belt and we see the same phenomena

322
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:47,520
in many many other countries. Secondly,

323
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:50,640
there was CO and CO taught the public

324
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:54,480
that there are severe dangers in a

325
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:57,600
production system based on just in time

326
00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:01,120
production. just in in time production.

327
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:03,799
Basically, the Toyota production system

328
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:09,520
uh has as its single most important

329
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:13,919
enemy eliminating waste and waste is

330
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:16,960
inventory or inventory is is waste. And

331
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:20,559
I think what we all learned during COVID

332
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:22,880
is that some inventory really can be can

333
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:26,120
be a very good can be very good

334
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:31,120
resilience. We've learned from COVID to

335
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:33,039
value resilience and the basic firm type

336
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:37,600
that we had developed in the United

337
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:41,200
States uh the uh core competence company

338
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:44,559
depended more than ever on its suppliers

339
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:47,440
and that dependence on suppliers was

340
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:50,880
critically challenged during the during

341
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:54,160
the co during the co uh uh period. All

342
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:56,480
of these c companies that had been uh

343
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:59,360
once had been vertically integrated that

344
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:03,200
hadn't been so uh reliant on their

345
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:07,679
suppliers. The GE the Texas Instruments

346
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:11,039
uh they suddenly uh uh saw how dependent

347
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:14,160
they were on suppliers that had become

348
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:18,280
that had become far less reliable and

349
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:22,480
far more difficult uh to access. That

350
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:26,559
dependence was critically highlighted by

351
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:30,480
co and I think that uh the co called

352
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:33,640
into question also the production mantra

353
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:37,120
of the last 40 years. Lean

354
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:40,520
manufacturing uh had emphasized both the

355
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:44,960
elimination of waste, the elimination of

356
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:47,480
inventory and the idea of optimizing

357
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,000
uh uh optimizing in the sense of

358
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:52,080
eliminating

359
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:55,200
redundancy. That redundancy which we

360
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:58,520
came to value in the course of COVID had

361
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:01,280
been the specific enemy of the lean

362
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:03,799
manufacturing model. And I think we've

363
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:07,120
now also come to

364
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:12,320
understand that lean manufacturing firms

365
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:16,240
that valued lean turned out to be as uh

366
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:19,600
basically hostile in a sense at least

367
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:23,360
hostile to innovation. If you are

368
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:25,840
concerned with eliminating waste, if you

369
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,080
are concerned with optimization, you

370
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:31,600
don't want to have a quarter of your

371
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:34,240
factory floor exploring new options, new

372
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:38,400
ways of doing things. It messes up the

373
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:42,080
the factory floor. It uh it's expensive.

374
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,840
Uh it it screws up the scheduling of of

375
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:47,280
the rest of your of rest of your

376
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:50,400
activity. So what we observed over this

377
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:54,760
period is that uh companies that were

378
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:59,600
heavily into lean and six sigma in fact

379
00:20:54,760 --> 00:21:02,400
became far less innovative even as they

380
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:05,039
uh followed these mantras of production

381
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:09,440
and today I think this is a way in which

382
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:11,760
we have come to re-evaluate a lean and I

383
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:14,240
I I don't think any of us really knows

384
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:17,039
what we should be putting in place of

385
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:20,880
lean but I think it's it's a moment

386
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:24,080
really of reconsideration of its values.

387
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:28,159
So uh what what has been the result of

388
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:32,280
of of of these changes? I think COVID

389
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:35,679
and um outsourcing really

390
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:38,799
um produced manufacturers at least in

391
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:41,840
the United States that were extremely

392
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:45,600
risk averse. Companies that have seen

393
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:50,080
their sector shrink. Companies that have

394
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:53,280
lost uh six million workers over a

395
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:56,400
10-year period become companies that are

396
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:58,720
really focused on survival. They're not

397
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,679
focused on innovation. They're not

398
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:05,440
focused on uh they're not focused on

399
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:09,640
change. So what we have been left with

400
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:12,720
are riskaverse firms uh and a

401
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:16,960
manufacturing ecosystem that's been

402
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:20,159
thinned out, drained and depleted. Let

403
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:23,200
me tell you about uh a visit I made with

404
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:26,720
my colleagues. We've been visiting firms

405
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:30,159
uh and sampling manufacturing firms uh

406
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:34,320
uh firms uh firms particularly that uh

407
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:36,960
hire that have fewer than 500 uh uh

408
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:40,320
workers. So these are what we call small

409
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:42,960
and medium manufacturers and I I want to

410
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:46,240
tell you about a visit to a firm that uh

411
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:48,799
we actually found ex an excellent

412
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,679
company in its way its product was

413
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:56,039
excellent. it. It's a firm in Ohio and

414
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:57,880
they make screws of very high techch uh

415
00:22:56,039 --> 00:23:02,880
screws. And

416
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:06,480
um when I asked this manufacturer what

417
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:09,159
he's looking for when he's hiring, he

418
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:14,159
said, "I want someone who will come on

419
00:23:09,159 --> 00:23:16,240
time and uh and and and stay." And uh he

420
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,960
said, and I said, "How how much you

421
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:21,360
paying?" He said, "I'm paying $13 an

422
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:25,120
hour." This was in this was several

423
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:28,320
months before uh right before COVID hit.

424
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:30,559
He said, "Unless an Amazon warehouse

425
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:34,640
opens down the street for me, then I'll

426
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:37,360
have to go up to $15 an hour." I asked,

427
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:40,320
um, do you ever think about hiring any

428
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:44,120
of those, uh, uh, guys coming out of

429
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:47,919
community colleges who've had classes in

430
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:49,880
robotics and 3D printing? He said, "What

431
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:53,919
would I do with them? I don't have any

432
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:58,679
robots. I don't have any uh 3D printers.

433
00:23:53,919 --> 00:24:03,360
In fact only even today only uh

434
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:06,000
10% of all US manufacturers have even

435
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:08,799
one robot and that's exactly how how

436
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,279
many they will have just just one. He

437
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:14,480
said I don't have 3D printers. I don't

438
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:18,480
have robots. I want them to work on the

439
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:22,320
machines I have. So then we toured his

440
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:25,440
factory and he had Davenport milling

441
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:28,440
machines that his grandfather had

442
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:32,520
purchased in the

443
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:35,159
1940s. some of there were a few new CNC

444
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:38,240
machines sprinkled in there, but

445
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:41,039
Davenport mostly Davenport milling

446
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:44,279
machines. And in fact, he was buying

447
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:48,240
when companies went out of business. He

448
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:50,799
bought their Davenport milling machines

449
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:54,159
of the same generation so that he would

450
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:57,200
have parts to repair and replace in the

451
00:24:54,159 --> 00:25:00,320
ones he owned. Now, imagine this

452
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:02,480
situation. We have young workers who are

453
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:06,000
in fact being trained in some of these

454
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:09,120
new technologies, but he has no interest

455
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,679
in hiring them. He wants to hire people

456
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:14,640
who know how to work on the machines he

457
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:16,720
has. And yet it would make no sense for

458
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,200
our community colleges or worker

459
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:22,320
training programs be training people how

460
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:25,360
to work on the machines of the 1940s.

461
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:28,640
And so in research that uh Ben Armstrong

462
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:32,400
and I have done together, we've tended

463
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:34,000
to describe this situation as a sort of

464
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:37,360
low-end

465
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:43,600
uh uh equilibrium trap. We have low

466
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:46,159
skills uh low tech and low wages so uh

467
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:49,120
uh connected to each other that it's

468
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:52,480
very hard to imagine how we can break

469
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:55,159
out of this of this sort of trap that

470
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,520
we've somehow gotten ourselves into in

471
00:25:55,159 --> 00:25:58,600
manufacturing. And I think the reason

472
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:04,880
that

473
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:09,159
um this matters now is that now with um

474
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:14,640
with the war in Ukraine and with the

475
00:26:09,159 --> 00:26:19,480
possibility of conflict in with China,

476
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:22,880
uh that uh we now realize that this

477
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:27,200
manufacturing system that we have is not

478
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:31,000
up to any of the challenges of securing

479
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:34,640
our national defense. American

480
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:38,080
policymakers are moving to more barriers

481
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:41,360
at the border exactly because of this

482
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:44,640
national security situation. But if we

483
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:48,080
actually look at the what the defense

484
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:52,159
industry is capable of, we realize that

485
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:55,600
even in supplying arms to Ukraine over

486
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:58,480
the past years, um that there has been

487
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:01,200
significant difficulty in getting even

488
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:04,400
the arms manufacturers in the United

489
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:07,039
States to produce the quantities uh that

490
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:09,039
the United States at least up to the

491
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:13,200
present has been willing has been

492
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:17,000
willing uh to send. So in the defense

493
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:21,360
industrial base, we have a few great

494
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:24,799
companies, Rathons or Lockheed Martins.

495
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:28,400
There are some new high- techch Silicon

496
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:31,919
Valley companies like Anderil uh that

497
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:35,039
have been mentioned here or Palunteer

498
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:38,960
but these companies are really still in

499
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:42,000
their infancy and not really able to uh

500
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:45,279
they're in no way able by themselves to

501
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:49,520
meet the challenges. And then there are

502
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:53,240
the myriad of suppliers to the defense

503
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:56,320
uh to the tense economy. And these

504
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:59,919
suppliers, they are the very same

505
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:02,720
companies that I just described to you.

506
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:05,120
Well, when we have gone to visit the

507
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,399
small and medium manufacturers of the

508
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:11,200
Middle East and the rest of the United

509
00:28:07,399 --> 00:28:12,840
States, something close to half of them

510
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,399
do defense

511
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:21,279
contracting as well as contracting to

512
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:26,000
the civilian economy. So our defense uh

513
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:29,960
uh industrial base is largely the same

514
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:34,799
industrial base that we in which we have

515
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:39,679
identified so many weaknesses. So as we

516
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:44,440
look at this system and as we uh try to

517
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:48,120
take into account that globalization is

518
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:53,039
disappearing just exactly at the same

519
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:56,720
time that we need uh that we need to uh

520
00:28:53,039 --> 00:29:00,399
in some ways secure supply for our own

521
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:03,799
for our own national economy and for our

522
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:07,279
national defense. This seems to be an

523
00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:10,000
extremely serious and dangerous

524
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:12,640
situation for our domestic for our

525
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,799
domestic economy. Think of just the

526
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:21,120
domestic component of this. If we are

527
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:24,559
without those cheap goods uh that China

528
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:28,799
had provided us, if today we actually

529
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:31,520
had to make uh shoes and socks in the

530
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:33,679
United States, how much do you imagine

531
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:37,360
that it would cost to make something

532
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:40,960
that today comes from China for so the

533
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:43,760
problem of inflation, the problems even

534
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,200
of the domestic economy, let alone of

535
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:48,799
the defense economy,

536
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:52,520
that we can see emerging on the horizon

537
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:54,840
as globalization recedes are really

538
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:58,799
significant. I

539
00:29:54,840 --> 00:30:02,080
um there was a French economist who gave

540
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:06,159
a talk that I attended a month ago who

541
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:10,480
said uh Europe is going to need to learn

542
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:14,320
to live without the partner of the

543
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:19,200
United States. And I think that the

544
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:21,520
problem actually is far worse. Uh that

545
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:25,720
uh the rest of the world is going to

546
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:29,440
have to learn to live with the great

547
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:34,080
uncertainties and the deep disruptions

548
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:37,240
that US policy is generating. The

549
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:41,440
international economy

550
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:47,200
basically rests on a foundation of rule

551
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:50,000
of law and trust and that foundation is

552
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:54,799
being deliberately

553
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:58,720
uh demolished at the present time. And

554
00:30:54,799 --> 00:31:03,039
it's in this international environment

555
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:04,360
that we have to situate the imperative

556
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:07,600
for

557
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:12,080
rebuilding manufacturing in all of our

558
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:14,600
economies. This is this is not I think

559
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:18,720
we have to acknowledge this is not

560
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:22,000
necessarily a good this is not a happy

561
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:25,360
this is not a happy story but it is the

562
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:28,799
story and the imperative that we face

563
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:31,520
now and I think that the presentations

564
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:35,000
that you've heard from colleagues

565
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:38,480
earlier today h have to be seen as a way

566
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:41,159
that as as as ways and and levers

567
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:44,159
that we can use to address this

568
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:48,399
situation. But we should not we should

569
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:51,559
not be we should not neglect to mention

570
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:55,279
how much we did profit from

571
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:58,399
globalization. how much we did profit

572
00:31:55,279 --> 00:32:02,399
from being able to exchange not only

573
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:05,279
exchange goods and services be able to

574
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:09,080
exchange ideas living in an open

575
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:12,559
environment of scientific exchange and

576
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:15,760
exchange exchange of ideas and so I

577
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:19,039
think it's imperative that we face this

578
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:22,880
new situation and face it with clear

579
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:26,240
eyes but it's perhaps has uh an

580
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:29,120
underside that is that also has a sort

581
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:31,360
of that also has a tragic dimension.

582
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,360
Thank

583
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:39,760
you. So we have time for questions. I

584
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,880
expect you're going to have a lot of

585
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:45,200
questions, but given the reverse trend

586
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:48,159
of globalization and the underlying

587
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:50,559
drivers of such change, what can drive

588
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:53,039
costs of remanufacturing down to be

589
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:54,880
competitive and prevent relocating

590
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:58,320
abroad?

591
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:01,080
Well, I think we hope since we hope very

592
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:04,640
much that of the the array of

593
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:07,840
possibilities, the menu of changes that

594
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:11,279
uh we saw presented by by our colleagues

595
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:13,919
today really will present uh ways of

596
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:16,559
lowering the costs of manufacturing. And

597
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:18,880
we hope to continue uh uh discussing

598
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:21,840
some of these some of these uh

599
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:24,000
technologies and changes uh that uh

600
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:27,200
tomorrow in tomorrow in the workshops.

601
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:30,320
But I think we see very promising uh

602
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:34,080
possibilities for uh for lowering the

603
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:36,480
costs of manufacturing even as we create

604
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:39,279
uh even as we create good jobs in

605
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:41,679
manufacturing. I think the goal of new

606
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:44,640
manufacturing ought to be to create

607
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:48,159
firms that are more productive. That is

608
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:51,039
firms that uh actually can afford to pay

609
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:54,080
good wages. It's an opportunity to

610
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:56,480
create manufacturing firms that are more

611
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,880
sustainable and don't contribute toward

612
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:01,440
the problems of of the environment and

613
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:04,559
climate. It's an opportunity to create

614
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:07,279
firms that are more resilient and so are

615
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:10,480
able to do with able to deal in

616
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:14,079
situations of shortage and and so I

617
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:17,520
think the under the opposite side of the

618
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:19,760
coin of why we have to do it the

619
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:22,679
opposite side of the coin or the other

620
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:25,679
is the opportunity to create

621
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:28,960
manufacturing that really can contribute

622
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:31,359
both to uh uh uh alleviating the

623
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:34,079
problems of climate change, providing

624
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:37,040
good jobs and and providing a more

625
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:39,359
resilient world.

626
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:41,679
Now, what industries are likely to

627
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:46,839
benefit most from this shift toward

628
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:46,839
domestic and alli based manufacturing?

629
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:52,639
Well, at the

630
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:55,119
moment, unfortunately, I think the

631
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:58,880
answer is defense industries.

632
00:34:55,119 --> 00:35:02,720
uh uh and so I mean if we look at for

633
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:06,000
example the situation in Germany today

634
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:09,560
exactly as auto production plants are

635
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:12,720
being transformed into defense

636
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:15,440
production plants I think we have to

637
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:18,880
acknowledge that it is the external

638
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:24,839
security situation that will probably

639
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:24,839
drive uh drive drive change.

640
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,320
Do you think fragmentation of global

641
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:33,839
markets will lead to a reduction in

642
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:36,640
global inequality or exacerbate social

643
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:39,359
economic divides? I think that's the

644
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:43,760
huge that's the huge question and the

645
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:47,599
one on which I think we as a as a as a

646
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:50,640
team at at MIT we are most committed to

647
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:53,280
trying to think of the ways of you using

648
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:57,119
using these new technologies in a way

649
00:35:53,280 --> 00:36:00,640
that reduce inequalities and and and

650
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:04,880
because we have seen in our own country

651
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:08,280
how divisive how inequality has produced

652
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:10,960
a situation of of polarization,

653
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:13,359
divisiveness. And so I think that should

654
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:15,680
be one of the things we are most careful

655
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:18,400
about with these new technologies. How

656
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:22,400
do we imagine technologies that could

657
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:25,359
both make firms more productive but also

658
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:27,839
raise uh the salaries that produce a

659
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:30,160
better uh that produce a better division

660
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:33,119
of shall we say the the rewards of

661
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:36,200
productivity uh uh among all those who

662
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:39,280
are stakeholders in the system?

663
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:42,000
Yes. Was there no role in massive

664
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:45,520
Chinese debt, corporate and municipal,

665
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,920
effectively hidden state aid, which G7

666
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:51,200
economies could not match, driving the

667
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:54,400
outsourcing you've identified?

668
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:58,320
I don't think the G7 countries were

669
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:02,079
actually interested in counteracting

670
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:04,680
Chinese growth. In fact, when we think

671
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:08,320
about how at least American

672
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:12,000
manufacturers were keen to profit from

673
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:14,160
uh Chinese from Chinese growth and uh it

674
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:18,320
was only the business community in the

675
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:22,160
United States uh were um were actually

676
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:24,720
determined to block any uh uh any any

677
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:27,599
sort of barriers uh to their uh

678
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:30,160
outsourcing and offshoring in China. And

679
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:33,040
it was only at the point in which the

680
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:35,920
Chinese government and the Chinese uh

681
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:39,079
manufacturers themselves started

682
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:42,320
blocking the expansion of US uh

683
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:46,160
manufacturers into higher level products

684
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:48,480
and higher level industries. Uh uh that

685
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:50,720
that the American business community

686
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:53,680
suddenly decided what's happening in

687
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:56,800
China. Maybe this is maybe maybe we're

688
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:59,200
not so happy about this.

689
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,920
Well, Dr. Burgerer, I want to thank you

690
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:06,320
so much for joining us again. It's been

691
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:09,320
a pleasure after 10 years about. Thank

692
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,320
you.
