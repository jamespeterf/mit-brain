00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:05,600
from the MIT energy initiative this is

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:08,200
what if it works a podcast looking at

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:11,599
the energy solutions for climate change

5
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,599
I'm Cara Miller and I'm Rob

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:20,000
Stoner and today we talk with a material

7
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:23,199
scientist about the stuff in our

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,920
buildings our phones our cars and how

9
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,439
that stuff takes a toll on the

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,039
environment materials and the

11
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,960
manufacturer of materials are

12
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:34,960
responsible for over a third of

13
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:37,120
greenhouse gas emissions globally and so

14
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,079
the choices we make at every stage of

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,200
Designing materials of recycling and

16
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:44,039
Manufacturing are going to have Global

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,960
impact that's Elsa olivetti professor of

18
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:49,440
Material Science and Engineering at MIT

19
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,039
and Mission lead for the decarbonizing

20
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,800
energy and Industry mission of mit's

21
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:57,520
climate project and of course there's

22
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,359
long been discussion in business amongst

23
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,800
policy makers about emissions what

24
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,000
should or shouldn't be coming out of our

25
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:07,200
cars how detrimental are the emissions

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,360
from airplanes but alletti says there's

27
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,720
a whole other dimension to that

28
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,000
emissions

29
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,200
conversation so those cars and those

30
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,680
airplanes are made of stuff right and so

31
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,240
we've got to do a lot to make that stuff

32
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,560
you think about what we sometimes call

33
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:25,400
the embodied impact of the stuff that we

34
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,840
hold and we you know process and and

35
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,960
live in and and throughout our lives and

36
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,680
it's also surprising maybe for people

37
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,960
that that's dominated that impact that

38
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,840
oneir is dominated by a couple of key

39
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,759
materials that we produce at vast scales

40
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,159
right steel cement we make as much

41
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,960
cement as we use water right so the the

42
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:47,479
sort of scale of that aluminum copper so

43
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,439
these kind of really big bulk materials

44
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:52,960
are a big part of that impact and

45
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:56,479
remember when you turn raw materials

46
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,840
into say an airplane there are a ton of

47
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:02,479
steps where do we tend to expend the

48
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:04,759
most energy olivetti says it depends but

49
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:07,960
there's a lot of energy involved in the

50
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:09,440
refining process so going from an ore

51
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,080
and the chemical and heat and

52
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,840
temperature processes that are

53
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:16,760
associated with making them usable in

54
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,040
whatever form and so that that's when

55
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,280
we're talking about greenhouse gas

56
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:22,760
emissions if we're talking about land

57
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,360
use or the environmental impact on an

58
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:27,519
ecosystem or water quality then the

59
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,920
burden might be shifting to a different

60
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:30,959
stage of the life cycle more in the

61
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,599
mining because the significant amount of

62
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:37,200
wastes that are produced or the uh

63
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:39,519
releases to water air and soils and that

64
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,360
gets at an important piece of this as

65
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,480
significant as greenhouse gases are the

66
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:48,239
effect of materials extraction on the

67
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:50,720
planet reaches even beyond that take

68
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,519
tailings which exist on the sites of

69
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,720
mines and they're essentially just a

70
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:58,519
bunch of the stuff that people weren't

71
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:01,200
really looking for so tailings are a

72
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:03,599
processing waste from The Mining and

73
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,640
refining process and the thing that to

74
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,239
think about with tailings is it's most

75
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:10,599
frequently wet because we add a lot of

76
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,680
water and and solvents to try to float

77
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:15,680
up the parts of the metal and the

78
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:17,920
constituents that we actually want mines

79
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,159
will often have these huge ponds

80
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,080
containing tailings and they're filled

81
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:25,959
with chemicals and as we transition to a

82
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:28,920
cleaner Energy System we will need to do

83
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:31,720
more mining so how do you make that

84
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:34,599
Mining and refinement of raw materials

85
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:37,439
more efficient and less dirty that's

86
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:40,080
what drives alletti and she says it's

87
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:43,360
important to recognize as technology

88
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:46,840
gets more advanced our needs are

89
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:49,840
changing one thing to keep in mind as we

90
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:54,280
are thinking about transitioning to low

91
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:56,680
carbon energy infrastructures that it it

92
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,840
particularly um the the technologies

93
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,280
that are needed for that are

94
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:04,560
particularly dependent on a um a wider

95
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:08,560
variety and more of the materials that

96
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:11,000
we use so something like a a car with an

97
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,599
internal combustion engine may have a

98
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,120
couple of materials that are specialized

99
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,639
for that engine but if we think about a

100
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,519
battery electric vehicle for example

101
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:22,720
there can be upwards of of five to eight

102
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:26,199
times the quantity of more Specialty

103
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,440
Minerals and a much broader array so so

104
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:30,759
things like nickel and Cobalt and

105
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:33,600
lithium and graphite that are very

106
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:36,199
critical to the battery itself and we

107
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,400
need so we need more complexity in terms

108
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:40,600
of more Supply chains that we accessing

109
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,639
and then we also need more quantity as

110
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,160
we transition to electric vehicles does

111
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,199
that mean more mining has to go on to

112
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,520
support electric vehicles than just

113
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:53,160
internal combustion engines yeah more

114
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:56,680
mining of the of that broader set right

115
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:59,840
I mean in terms of the um so yeah so we

116
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:02,600
have significant growth associated with

117
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:06,400
with a much wider variety of minerals

118
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:08,720
okay um and you know upwards of of uh

119
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,039
100 you know 100% full increases in the

120
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,160
in the quantities that we need to be um

121
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,919
going after and that there are more

122
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,680
there's more complexity associated with

123
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:18,440
those and that's really across all the

124
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,000
energy technologies that Advanced

125
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,560
Technologies that we're interested in

126
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,680
right and Rob been talking about more

127
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,440
Specialty Minerals that are present in

128
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,400
in magnets for example in wind turbines

129
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,240
but I mentioned a couple also for

130
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,720
batteries and solar cells so you can

131
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,360
think about that that the energy low

132
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:41,360
carbon energy transition is is dependent

133
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:43,199
on a significant minerals extraction um

134
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:47,280
uh

135
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:49,400
situation dependent on us doing the

136
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,639
mining and beneficiation and mineral

137
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,680
extraction in a thoughtful sustainable

138
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:56,039
sensible way in order to have that

139
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,440
transition happen without a series of

140
00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:00,560
unintended

141
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:03,919
consequences um that we want to make

142
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,400
sure that we're uh developing policies

143
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,880
and incentives to directionally look at

144
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,000
and I can talk a little bit more

145
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,880
specifically about one of those just as

146
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,919
an example uh we could dig into um

147
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,720
talking about uh nickel um and nickel is

148
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,000
interesting for a couple of different

149
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,160
reasons it's important to remember that

150
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,360
the things that are the dominant uses

151
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,759
for nickel now are not necessarily what

152
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,520
is relevant to the energy transition as

153
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:30,520
much so nickel right now is used the

154
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,599
majority for stainless steel something

155
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:35,120
we think about and use all the time but

156
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:37,919
it's also a critical element associated

157
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,520
with battery electric vehicles and and

158
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,840
so the transition for our vehicle Fleet

159
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,599
that needs to happen as part of a low

160
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,479
carbon energy transition is going to

161
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:47,520
mean there's a lot more nickel that will

162
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:50,360
that will'll need um and so that will

163
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,000
start to become the dominant use which

164
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:55,000
is pretty significant in terms of what

165
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,400
that means for for Supply chains and the

166
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,240
other thing that's interesting about the

167
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,039
the broader set of materials that that

168
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,879
we need in in part of the low carbon

169
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:05,120
energy transition is that they have

170
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:07,800
different kinds of geographic

171
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,160
concentrations than than we might expect

172
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,400
they're they could be very highly

173
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,919
concentrated in particular geographies

174
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,879
which means we're very dependent on

175
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:16,400
those

176
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:20,000
geographies um for for the mining

177
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,879
process um it also Downs Downstream as I

178
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,919
said in refining and processing so in

179
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:28,199
nickel's case the majority of of nickel

180
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,319
um extraction what you know one region

181
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:33,879
that nickel extraction happens is in

182
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:36,400
Indonesia it's also extracted in Russia

183
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:37,759
so the demand for nickel is growing so

184
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,120
rapidly that there's been a pretty

185
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,039
significant investment in mining

186
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:46,240
infrastructure in Indonesia both in

187
00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:48,759
terms of of new uh new sources new mines

188
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,639
opening but also Indonesia is interested

189
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:51,879
in the economic development opportuni so

190
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,080
they also want to be developing

191
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:55,240
infrastructure Downstream of of

192
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,759
extracting it out of the ground they

193
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,039
want to develop that capability to

194
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:00,639
refine and beneficiate um as we've as

195
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,639
we've talked about so that they get to

196
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,039
add the value in their home country

197
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,800
rather than having someone else do it

198
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:06,800
and get the money for it exactly like

199
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,360
they have been

200
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,720
historically taking that ore and digging

201
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,080
out of the ground but then shipping it

202
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,800
elsewhere to be refined and majority is

203
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,720
actually currently refined in China

204
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,919
that's true of almost all of the

205
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,759
materials we could talk about after the

206
00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:22,440
mining mining is sometimes while

207
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:24,520
geographically concentrated different

208
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:27,240
kinds of of geographic pockets for

209
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:29,960
mining but almost all of it is currently

210
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:32,279
processed and and and supply chains go

211
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:35,719
through China we're talking

212
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:39,680
Downstream um and in Indonesia in

213
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:42,039
particular what's been uh challenging is

214
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,560
thinking about the trade-offs of the

215
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:46,480
environmental impact of mining with the

216
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,440
economic development opportunity and

217
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,640
they and their need and interest to grow

218
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:53,000
rapidly to take advantage of this of

219
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,440
this opportunity yeah you know I grew up

220
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,880
in a mining town yeah in Northern Canada

221
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:01,240
sbur Ontario and and in those days it

222
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:04,000
was sulfite minerals that they they mind

223
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,800
in hard rock deep below the surface and

224
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,760
we were always aware that Indonesia was

225
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:10,600
coming along and and would have the

226
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,760
ability to mine their laterite nickel

227
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,120
deposits but those are surface deposits

228
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,240
and and as Elsa is saying I mean getting

229
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:19,360
to those deposits means you're leveling

230
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:22,519
forests and removing huge amounts of

231
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,600
Earth um and and there are other places

232
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:27,040
where that kind of thing exists new

233
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:29,880
calonia is another place in in the South

234
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,200
Pacific we were always you know feeling

235
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,399
very smug about our sulfites because we

236
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,200
didn't have to cause that sort of

237
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:37,760
Destruction we caused other kinds of

238
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,519
Destruction and so we were pretty sure

239
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,560
that that would never happen and now I

240
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:44,240
I'm seeing even looking Beyond later

241
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,560
rides people are talking about nickel

242
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,000
nodules on the ocean floor and and

243
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:51,320
they're not only talking about mining

244
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,720
nickel that way but you know scraping

245
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:56,320
huge amounts of ocean floor in order to

246
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,440
get at new minerals I I'm really kind of

247
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,079
uncomfortable with that and I think we

248
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,160
have to think about that as a society

249
00:09:59,079 --> 00:10:04,680
there's a lot of discussion I feel like

250
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,959
anybody listening to this discussion

251
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:10,440
right now their head is kind of

252
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:13,160
exploding because we're talking about

253
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:15,920
using more nickel to facilitate the

254
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:17,440
transition to cleaner energy like have

255
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,440
electric vehicles not have internal

256
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,920
combustion engines and to do that you

257
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:27,760
need to clearcut forests potentially

258
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:31,320
scrape the ocean floor um use well use

259
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:34,079
like a ton of processing right to or or

260
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:37,000
you know ship stuff to China and process

261
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:41,360
and which we already do right and so I

262
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:44,120
guess my question is we are we sure all

263
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,600
this pollution and like you know

264
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:49,519
greenhouse gas emissions is worth it to

265
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:51,399
facilitate the electric vehicles like I

266
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:54,160
assume somebody has done this math right

267
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:56,560
yeah we actually just did this analysis

268
00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:00,079
looking at those materials that I said

269
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:02,200
these sort of bulk high volume materials

270
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:04,480
at which are the majority of impact

271
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,519
right we can't forget that the the kind

272
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,880
of nuances and complexities of all these

273
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:12,839
Supply chains are very critical and very

274
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:16,480
important part of it and we must

275
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:18,480
transition to low carbon modes of

276
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,440
Transport modes of generating

277
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,839
electricity each of those are very

278
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:25,000
dependent on this broader portfolio of

279
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:27,959
materials I've mentioned but in terms of

280
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,079
the volumes it's also need we also need

281
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:32,680
vast quantities of concrete

282
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:35,480
steel copper right all of these bulk

283
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:38,200
materials as well that whole set is

284
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:40,839
necessary as part of the transition and

285
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,600
the production from an energy

286
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:44,399
perspective of all of those materials

287
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,920
that are part of the energy

288
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:50,160
transition is still about half of the

289
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:53,200
energy that would be required to

290
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:56,519
continue the fossil fuel-based

291
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,959
energy infrastructure that we have even

292
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:00,399
if you consider that like in Indonesia

293
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,920
obvious obvously it sounds like some

294
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,600
forests are being cut down and that has

295
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:08,399
like long-term ramifications when it

296
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:11,320
comes to right absorbing carbon sure

297
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:14,519
yeah so all the re the you know growth

298
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:17,360
as an economy is inextricably linked to

299
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:20,320
Resource use the things we do and the

300
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:23,000
the systems in which we exist are

301
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,440
dependent on impact on the environment

302
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,720
and I think the trick and the

303
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,079
opportunity we have in a lowc carbon

304
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,839
energy transition is while we're

305
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,800
thinking thought fully about the

306
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,079
technology we need about the impact

307
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,399
we're doing we can make sure we're not

308
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:38,120
having significant unintended

309
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,720
consequences and one of the things

310
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,399
that's interesting about the new kinds

311
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,639
of pressures and the new geography

312
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:43,720
shifts that's happening is it's

313
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,240
different kinds of pressures in

314
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:48,480
different kinds of regions and that then

315
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,920
lead to other challenges we need to be

316
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,199
tracking so in the case of of Indonesia

317
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:55,880
this fast tracking of nickel production

318
00:12:53,199 --> 00:12:58,040
and processing is is an opportunity

319
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:00,160
nationally for Indonesia but we need the

320
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,959
right kind of signal the right kind of

321
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,639
investment the right kind of signals

322
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:05,839
from demand from consumers from

323
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:07,600
automobile manufacturers of let's do it

324
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,680
right and what are the resources in

325
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,800
order to do it right so that we're not

326
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,680
having these tradeoffs instead we're

327
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:17,320
building sustainable Supply throughout

328
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:19,880
the entire life cycle of those materials

329
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:21,839
is that happening like as as we have

330
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:24,720
more electric vehicles as the Chinese

331
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:27,600
are producing tons of electric vehicles

332
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,639
um are the right incentives reaching

333
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,000
Indonesia or are people just like go

334
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:33,600
find as much nickel as you possibly can

335
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,920
and we'll pay you for it and do it as

336
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,399
fast as you

337
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:40,839
can we can say a little bit of both or a

338
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,519
lot of bit of both and but we need to

339
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:45,120
try to think about what is the full

340
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:47,399
Suite of decarbonization opportunities

341
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,800
to apply throughout the life cycle but

342
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:50,800
also other ways in which we would

343
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,600
mitigate the environmental impact of of

344
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:56,120
resource use yeah so we can work with

345
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,440
the Indonesian government for example or

346
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:00,399
the automobile manufacturers to try to

347
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:03,040
develop sustainable Supply chains and

348
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:05,000
and demand signals that would propagate

349
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,519
throughout those Supply chains for more

350
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,440
sustainable production can also think

351
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:12,880
about ways to incend production

352
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:15,360
domestically or in where we have more

353
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,360
control over those Supply chains other

354
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,920
strategies could include in increasing

355
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:22,800
recycling so which would maybe in the

356
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:25,240
long run need mean that we need less

357
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,959
primary extraction so those are there

358
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,839
are a couple of different strategies for

359
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:31,600
for managing those tradeoffs yeah there

360
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:35,759
are some processes that are forming

361
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:40,199
around the the cop and and

362
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:42,480
unfccc um that that try to create a way

363
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:45,320
for developed countries with

364
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:48,440
money to help developing countries that

365
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:50,680
are producing these minerals get cleaner

366
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:52,320
um and and the process that's most

367
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:56,120
talked about now is called the jetp

368
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:58,440
process joint transition energy plan or

369
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,639
program I think it's called where we're

370
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,000
different wealthy countries are

371
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:03,360
contributing money but there are strings

372
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,160
attached you know if if you want to we

373
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,759
will give you money for energy

374
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:09,639
development in India for example says

375
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:13,680
the United States or Japan to Indonesia

376
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:15,880
provided that you don't develop coal

377
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,759
mines and instead develop these low

378
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:22,480
carbon resources like either solar or

379
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:25,040
hydro and perhaps also adopt refining

380
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,399
practices that are less energy intensive

381
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,959
or inherently less polluting and I think

382
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:32,079
I think we're at the beginning of that

383
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:34,480
uh sort of move toward those sorts of

384
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:38,480
Arrangements but but it's a possible

385
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:41,720
way um have you been either with nickel

386
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:44,959
or with any other um uh thing that is

387
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:46,319
mine for have you been on the ground at

388
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,360
one of those minds and can you talk

389
00:15:46,319 --> 00:15:50,920
about what it's like since so few people

390
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:53,839
really have that experience what's it

391
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:57,040
like yeah I've been to a couple of of

392
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:59,440
minds and I think the part that is

393
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:03,720
consistently

394
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:06,959
shocking is the vastness of it the scale

395
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:11,120
at which things need to operate in order

396
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:13,240
to get the materials that we use and for

397
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:17,639
example I've been to the uh copper mine

398
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:20,120
in Utah kott mine that the has been

399
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:23,839
operation since 1900 it's you know

400
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:26,680
incred it's open pit incredibly you two

401
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:29,920
empire state buildings tall Pit in the

402
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:32,000
ground and you can see you know this

403
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,759
tiny little truck at the bottom that is

404
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,399
a enormous truck when you're standing

405
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,800
next to it you know the wheel is I can't

406
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,199
even see the top of the wheel if I'm

407
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:44,120
standing next to the truck but it looks

408
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:46,639
like a tiny you know Lego toy as it's

409
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:50,399
coming up you know spinning up the

410
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:54,240
spiral of the of the mine and you know

411
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:56,720
kind of rock pile after rock pile and

412
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:59,399
the vast majority of what is being

413
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:02,120
driven out of that on that you know tiny

414
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:04,280
than becoming bigger truck is rock that

415
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:06,679
doesn't contain Copp it isn't

416
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,799
necessarily part of this and you can see

417
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:11,160
in that site in particular you can go

418
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:13,400
from each of the stages down to even

419
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:15,360
some of the wire manufacturers are are

420
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,280
local uh you know within driving

421
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,439
distance of that to see that so that's

422
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:24,240
probably the most striking is the

423
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:27,120
vastness and how much activity goes into

424
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,280
each molecule that we then get to use in

425
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:31,360
our cell phones that we just you know

426
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,440
don't even really think about as we're

427
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,000
as we're living our living our daily

428
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:41,039
lives and the other thing that's

429
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:43,679
striking is we think about

430
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:46,760
decarbonizing and the trying to reduce

431
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:49,120
our Reliance on fossil fuel how much of

432
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:51,160
that process still is going to need

433
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:54,840
fossil fuels in order to transition

434
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:56,960
right that truck is using Fuel and so I

435
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,960
think that this this sort of importance

436
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:02,120
of moving

437
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,760
rapidly but but thoughtfully in what we

438
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,880
talked about in nickel or in G you can

439
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,799
think about in any of these sort of

440
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,520
local community conversations that need

441
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:11,159
to happen within mining it's a

442
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:13,400
particular challenge that that you know

443
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:15,640
engaging communities and thinking about

444
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:18,520
those processes as are happening locally

445
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:20,480
has to happen deliberately and rapidly

446
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:23,919
because of the scale and the need of the

447
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:26,080
transition all the way from every

448
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,880
battery in our vehicles to the grid but

449
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,000
also that truck that's driving out of

450
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:32,320
the mine that also brings you into

451
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,880
contact with Society more I mean some of

452
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,400
the easy places are easy because they're

453
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:39,080
far away from where people live and want

454
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:41,799
to be but as as you start pursuing

455
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:43,320
deposits of higher grades or any grades

456
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:45,600
that you can get access to you often

457
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:48,640
come into into contact with for example

458
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:51,360
Aboriginal groups uh in in Australia

459
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,600
this has been a a major factor in the

460
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:56,360
pilra area in Western Australia for

461
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,559
mining iron and and Rio Tinto one of the

462
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:00,559
big operators there had just a disaster

463
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:03,960
with with one of those mins where they

464
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:08,159
inadvertently destroyed major cultural

465
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:11,559
heritage site um and so those sorts of

466
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:13,840
uh complications introduce complexity

467
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:15,720
and developing the mines planning them

468
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,280
operating those areas and that adds to

469
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:21,159
cost as well as as just the sort of

470
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,159
having to move more

471
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:26,720
[Music]

472
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:33,720
rock uh rob you know you were saying you

473
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:36,760
grew up in a mining town in in Canada I

474
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:38,679
wonder if you think that the mining

475
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,280
industry has changed a lot in your

476
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:42,400
lifetime I know it's a lot safer now

477
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:45,520
than it used to be at least in developed

478
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:48,720
countries when I was when I was a child

479
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:50,320
we had a lot of Orphans in in my classes

480
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,600
typically going through Primary School

481
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:55,200
people had lost their fathers in the

482
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:57,000
minds a lot of amputees I had a I had a

483
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,120
cycling coach at one point who had lost

484
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,320
a leg in a m c lapse and the lots of

485
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:05,000
stories of Mind collapses that happens

486
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:06,720
far less nowadays um because of the the

487
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,679
safety culture that these companies have

488
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,640
developed but I don't know how well that

489
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:12,760
translates to environments like

490
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,840
Indonesia or or other poor countries

491
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:17,120
where people are prepared to take bigger

492
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:20,080
personal risks and maybe look the other

493
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,960
way in order to get stuff get get a job

494
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,480
or just the central government has fewer

495
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:26,720
regulations about like you have to you

496
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,559
know whatever they may not have an oosha

497
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:32,200
like these are hurdles that you have to

498
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:33,840
overcome to being licensed yeah and and

499
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,640
less automation you know they're they're

500
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:38,720
using manual labor in many situations

501
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:41,240
where we would use machines so there

502
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,120
people are more exposed also I don't

503
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,799
know if you have any thoughts there but

504
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,240
I also wonder if you can talk a little

505
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:50,000
bit about um when you think about cell

506
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:52,640
phones electric vehicles what are the

507
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,480
metals that we need more and more of

508
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,240
like if you had to say these are really

509
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,360
On The Rise Like if I if you look

510
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:01,280
forward 10 or 20 years as like these are

511
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:03,320
the things where the demand is just

512
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,520
really Rising because our lives are

513
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:07,960
changing like we didn't use you know

514
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,640
like people didn't have um cell phones

515
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:12,520
30 years ago necessarily that They

516
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:16,520
Carried with them all so what are EVS

517
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:19,960
you know yeah there are a couple

518
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:22,760
of elements that are more prominent

519
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:24,520
within the within the electrification or

520
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:26,440
low carbon

521
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:29,080
infrastructure we've talked about some

522
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:31,919
of them so uh Cobalt

523
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:34,120
copper nickel

524
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:37,440
lithium then there's also the set that

525
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:40,880
are as part of uh wind turbines and

526
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:44,080
solar so neodymium and and other Rare

527
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,039
Earth elements uh that are present but

528
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:49,640
things like

529
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:51,480
mbum um and the so there's a plethora of

530
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:53,200
those but another way to think about it

531
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:56,200
is when you're you're talking about cell

532
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:58,240
phones in something in the in 1980 there

533
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,320
was something like 11 elements that were

534
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,120
used used within the the circuit board

535
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:05,760
for a phone and now it's the entire

536
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:07,799
periodic table wow so you I mean

537
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,360
essentially you are carrying around you

538
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:14,159
know stable forms of the primary

539
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:16,320
uh periodic table in your pocket and and

540
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:19,520
so that's just from 1980 and you know in

541
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:21,320
the 2000s we added another 45 and and

542
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,360
you know just has grown and those

543
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,960
elements are there for a reason they add

544
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,400
a particular

545
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,400
functionality they you know perform

546
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:32,240
better we want that performance as

547
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,720
consumers we don't often think about the

548
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,440
trade-offs associated with the supply

549
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,600
chains of those but also the complexity

550
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,080
that it introduces in terms of trying to

551
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:42,200
do something with them when we're done

552
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:44,840
with our cell phone so it's it's

553
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,640
ubiquitous um and and also in addition

554
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:48,600
to

555
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:50,760
that the fact that there's many more

556
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,600
different types there's also just more

557
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:54,799
associated with it so silicon is another

558
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,880
element that we think about both

559
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:59,840
relevant for energy transition in solar

560
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:02,559
cells but also relevant in Wafers for

561
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,440
electronics and and and electrical

562
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:07,320
appliances are there any of those

563
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:10,080
elements where you think I'm really

564
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:13,159
worried like that I I don't think

565
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:15,360
there's enough of it when I see the

566
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:18,000
demand curve and I see what I think is

567
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,480
the supply I don't see it or I'm worried

568
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,600
that these things are going to

569
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:26,000
collide so we often say that

570
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:28,520
materials availability is not about

571
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,120
running out it's about risk assoc

572
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:32,720
associated with those tradeoffs so we

573
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,559
talked about the sort of Rapid rise in

574
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,760
nickel and you know what does that do

575
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:39,120
for for local um

576
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:42,240
communities because often we'll get it

577
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:44,640
at whatever price at whatever cost

578
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:47,440
another way to think about this is

579
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,080
the those that that kind of catalog this

580
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:53,919
so the US Geological Society for example

581
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:56,880
has this way they frame the amount that

582
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:58,919
we are uh the reserves the amount that's

583
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,559
economically extractable div divided by

584
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:02,520
the production the amount that we need

585
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:07,320
annually and that's kind of how much is

586
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:10,240
left right and so 40 years ago we had 40

587
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:13,240
Years of copper left based on that okay

588
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:16,039
now we have 40 Years of copper left and

589
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:17,760
that's because as the demand goes up we

590
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:20,919
have there's technology that that

591
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:23,320
increases our ability to extract them so

592
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:25,480
I don't think about it as running out

593
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:28,799
but you think about it as these these

594
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:31,640
significant shifts or volatility and

595
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:33,399
prices in in Supply chains and what does

596
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:35,960
that mean for local communities and the

597
00:24:33,399 --> 00:24:38,320
in the levels at which we're willing to

598
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:40,240
go in order to extract these materials

599
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,720
and then what the complications are that

600
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,240
introduces that on one side we've talked

601
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,640
about the environmental impact but we

602
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,440
could also think about on the demand

603
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:50,880
side what are we not

604
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:52,360
doing because it's gotten too expensive

605
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,840
right and you know what what does that

606
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,480
mean for the fact that we wouldn't be

607
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,200
able to Electrify the vehicle Fleet at

608
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:59,600
the rate we would want to because the

609
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,799
prices of those materials are going up

610
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,399
and that's another thing that starts to

611
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:04,240
happen with the Advanced Energy

612
00:25:02,399 --> 00:25:07,399
Technologies is as we get better at

613
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:10,039
doing them the manufacturing cost goes

614
00:25:07,399 --> 00:25:12,399
down making the battery pack making the

615
00:25:10,039 --> 00:25:14,600
solar cell but it starts to be very

616
00:25:12,399 --> 00:25:17,200
dependent on then what the prices of

617
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:18,840
those materials are and so subject to

618
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,919
the kinds of supply chain disruptions

619
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:24,240
that mean when we have actual or

620
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:27,159
perceived risk of Supply availability

621
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,640
constraints rather than it running out

622
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:30,440
you talked about you used the the word

623
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,880
primary Metals at one point when you

624
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:34,279
were talking earlier and and that's a

625
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,120
that's a really important subject I

626
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:38,919
think because you know you mind for iron

627
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,799
you mine for nickel you would make a

628
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:43,000
nickel mine you'd make a copper mine but

629
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:46,279
you'd never make a strontium mine when

630
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:49,919
or itum mine a lot of those are

631
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:52,799
byproducts of of all that

632
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:55,840
mining as we as we use more and more of

633
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:57,600
these Advanced Technologies big magnets

634
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:00,440
strong magnets for example or even

635
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:02,960
Fusion systems that use some of these

636
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:06,640
some of these exotic materials or

637
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:09,720
materials that we don't commonly find

638
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:12,440
um do we hit a wall with those where

639
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:14,679
where the primary production no longer

640
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:16,720
keeps up with demand for these sort of

641
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:21,080
secondary metals or or co-produced

642
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:26,080
metals and does do we do we sort of stop

643
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:28,880
using them and and run into um

644
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,960
disasters in terms of the

645
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,080
other kinds of risks associated with

646
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,399
materials availability there's a

647
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:38,039
particular kind of risk or a particular

648
00:26:35,399 --> 00:26:40,120
kind of dynamic associated with those

649
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:43,960
metals that we're not building the mine

650
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:45,600
for as you say and Cobalt which has been

651
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:47,039
talked about a lot in the press in terms

652
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,640
of the challenges in mining and the

653
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:52,399
geographic concentration is an example

654
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:55,559
that we don't build a mine for Cobalt we

655
00:26:52,399 --> 00:26:57,760
build a mine for nickel or copper and

656
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:59,720
the Cobalt is obtained as a byproduct of

657
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:02,039
that as your saying and so what that

658
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:04,679
means is for things like Cobalt as

659
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:07,120
demand goes up it's not necessarily

660
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:09,080
having the same kind of price response

661
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:11,200
that we would have in nickel or or

662
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:13,039
copper for example so we're kind of

663
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,640
subject to what's happening with that

664
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:16,919
nickel mine so that introduces a

665
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,799
different kind of volatility in the in

666
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:20,320
the

667
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:23,679
supply sometimes the sources for these

668
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:25,200
materials are in wastes so vadium for

669
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:27,840
example is something where there's a lot

670
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:30,640
of opportunity for other way vadium

671
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:32,960
extra ction in in secondary streams that

672
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:35,799
we wouldn't normally what is vadium I've

673
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:38,559
never heard of it it's an element it's

674
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:42,039
an under the radar but it's used in

675
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:44,080
steel and a lot and very dominantly um

676
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:47,120
and it offers a lot of really important

677
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:49,159
properties in steel but it also could be

678
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,799
relevant to some kind of battery some

679
00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:53,799
kinds of battery technologies flow

680
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:55,600
batteries vadium Lum flow batteries yeah

681
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:58,640
in it could be that's another way we

682
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:00,559
could do more uh electrification storage

683
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,399
on the grid for example I'm reminded of

684
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:04,240
a famous situation a couple years ago

685
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:05,679
where demand for steel increased

686
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,320
dramatically in China because of

687
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:11,320
subsidies for building which created

688
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:13,000
tremendous demand for vadium okay and it

689
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:15,559
wiped out all of the guys who were

690
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,960
trying to make vadium flow batteries and

691
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:19,760
so that was an interesting you know

692
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,840
crossover I see because it was like

693
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:24,120
pulled away other

694
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,600
use comp that's actually a really

695
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:28,120
important point to make back on our

696
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,720
nickel story because any we've been talk

697
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:31,200
talking about the sort of demand signals

698
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:34,080
of how do you create sustainable

699
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,919
supplies of nickel right because I said

700
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:38,159
earlier most of the nickel right now is

701
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:39,279
used in stainless steel we also have to

702
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,799
talk to the folks that are part of the

703
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,919
stainless steel supply chain if we're

704
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:43,480
just working with the battery

705
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:45,720
manufacturers and they're sending all

706
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:47,440
sorts of demand signals let's get

707
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,120
sustainable nickel but we don't talk to

708
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,399
the folks sending signals from the

709
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,640
stainless steel industry then the nickel

710
00:28:51,399 --> 00:28:54,279
miners don't care because they're

711
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,679
answering to the stainless steel folks

712
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:58,919
now so that Dynamic of what is the

713
00:28:56,679 --> 00:29:01,679
dominant use right now but then how will

714
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:03,480
that change and how fast will that

715
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,960
change is really important when we start

716
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,919
to try to think about how do we

717
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:10,320
incentivize what sorts of policies are

718
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:13,840
we going to write so let's talk about um

719
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:16,720
Solutions and you could use nickel or

720
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:21,279
anything else but maybe talk

721
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:24,600
about one element and you know how you

722
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:26,640
see kind of how you move the needle in a

723
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:29,919
way that you feel like would be a win

724
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:32,000
like how do you make it so there's fewer

725
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:33,880
greenhouse gases coming from the

726
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,720
extraction of that thing the processing

727
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:39,519
of that thing so we could think about

728
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,080
copper a little bit because copper is

729
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:43,919
interesting in that it's pretty

730
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:46,200
dependent to any kind of growth both in

731
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:48,279
terms of electrification but also just

732
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:50,120
in terms of electronic devices and our

733
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:53,480
increased demand for that and just the

734
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:55,159
need to conduct more electrons copper is

735
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:59,279
a good way to do that so it's in like

736
00:29:55,159 --> 00:30:00,799
all our laptops and our and our car

737
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:03,840
dominant use is actually in buildings

738
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:05,399
and construction wiring in our buildings

739
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,000
and the infrastructure associated with

740
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:08,799
that so it's kind of everywhere right

741
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,440
right right so cities are increasing in

742
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:12,480
size which they are then you're building

743
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:15,200
buildings so copper is is Ubi so you

744
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,799
could think about the environmental

745
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,399
implications of copper if we're focused

746
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:23,000
on energy and greenhouse gas emissions

747
00:30:19,399 --> 00:30:24,640
there's ways of thinking about Solutions

748
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,480
across the supply chain so we could

749
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:31,039
think about the production of heat to to

750
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:33,840
run the processes and can we Electrify

751
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:37,000
that but also can we change the the

752
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:40,320
chemistry of how we go from the mineral

753
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:43,640
to Copper we could look at different

754
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:45,760
kinds of of ways of uh doing that that

755
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:49,840
are more environmentally friendly so

756
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:52,559
sulfidation is an is an is a a process

757
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:56,480
being looked at here at MIT in terms of

758
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:59,320
better processing of of copper and and

759
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:01,399
to the products that we're interested in

760
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:02,519
but you could also think about reduction

761
00:31:01,399 --> 00:31:05,399
of mining

762
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:08,159
overall by increasing the recycling of

763
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:10,480
copper and recycling can be challenging

764
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:11,880
to think about in all the stuff that

765
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,039
we've talked about before because as

766
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:16,880
we're increasing

767
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:19,000
demand it we are still growing in the

768
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,960
amount of material that we use and so

769
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,120
there isn't enough existing to be

770
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:27,519
pulling out for secondary for recycling

771
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:30,679
to meet that Demand right so recycling

772
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:32,720
offers an opportunity to displace mining

773
00:31:30,679 --> 00:31:34,840
really only if we've saturated what's

774
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,600
being used we sometimes say in stock or

775
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:38,360
in the buildings that we're using but

776
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,639
some things like copper and steel as I

777
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:42,320
said because it's ubiquitous because

778
00:31:39,639 --> 00:31:44,519
it's everywhere those elements those

779
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:46,600
materials offer an opportunity for more

780
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:47,960
circularity and we do that in the United

781
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:51,120
States I mean there's a lot of scrap

782
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:53,960
steel used here exactly scrap steel and

783
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:56,159
and scrap copper where in in the case of

784
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:58,480
copper at least there's still a lot of

785
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:00,039
hidden stocks that we aren't NE that we

786
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,159
aren't necessarily collecting or

787
00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:03,760
recycling as much as we could like a

788
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:05,320
building gets torn down you mean that

789
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,480
kind of thing exactly construction

790
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:08,559
demolition waste where we're not

791
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:11,279
recovering all the copper that can be

792
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:13,639
used again in those applications how do

793
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:16,120
you incentivize people to do that rather

794
00:32:13,639 --> 00:32:19,000
than say it's cheaper to like go to some

795
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:20,399
poor country and get new copper out of

796
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,639
the ground like labor isn't very

797
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:27,159
expensive it's it's

798
00:32:22,639 --> 00:32:29,279
doable yeah yeah um so It's Tricky you

799
00:32:27,159 --> 00:32:30,960
have to build up the infrastructure for

800
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:32,679
recycling and that is actually happening

801
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,360
right now in the in the copper

802
00:32:32,679 --> 00:32:37,399
conversation in the US is there's

803
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:40,039
because of the growth in in demand and

804
00:32:37,399 --> 00:32:43,360
the fact that there could be more of

805
00:32:40,039 --> 00:32:45,880
this demand met by secondary we have to

806
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:48,559
in incent you know invest capital in

807
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:52,399
building secondary refining processes

808
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:53,559
for copper uh in the United States or

809
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:56,240
wherever or in

810
00:32:53,559 --> 00:32:58,080
Europe in order to to make that happen

811
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,039
and then as you point out with your

812
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:02,080
question there's there's then incenting

813
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:04,639
the collection of that

814
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:07,039
material so that it can then be sent to

815
00:33:04,639 --> 00:33:09,519
those to those refiners and so there's

816
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:12,639
this trade-off there between do we have

817
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:17,000
the enough capacity to process that the

818
00:33:12,639 --> 00:33:19,320
secondary material and are the is the

819
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,159
value of copper is the price of copper

820
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:23,480
high enough that that we're interest

821
00:33:21,159 --> 00:33:25,360
that there's support to set up the

822
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:26,279
collection infrastructure to do that and

823
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:29,519
most

824
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:31,840
often the will need some kind of subsidy

825
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:33,399
to incent that to to start off with and

826
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:36,279
even in countries like China there's

827
00:33:33,399 --> 00:33:38,559
significant subsidies in in in making

828
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:41,600
secondary work to to kind of start it

829
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:43,360
off and often to to continue that until

830
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,519
we're able to have the processes

831
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,720
themselves be economic relative to the

832
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:50,039
primary processes how do we how do we do

833
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:53,360
in in recycling of metals I mean are a

834
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:55,720
lot of them ending up in in dumps we the

835
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,799
us we the US well we maybe other

836
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:00,399
countries too yes we are certainly not

837
00:33:57,799 --> 00:34:04,559
doing as well as we can so the recycling

838
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:07,559
rates or is the for things like copper

839
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:10,480
is usually about 30% um of a of

840
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:12,679
consumption can is met with secondary

841
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,240
that could go up we've looked at that

842
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:17,960
copper in particular that could go up to

843
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:20,320
maybe about up to 60% um reasonably

844
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:23,480
economically but we need the local

845
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:28,200
capacity to to develop that

846
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:32,280
out um and so yeah generally recycling

847
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:34,119
is around 30 to 40% for most um Metals

848
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:37,040
in that in that range it's higher for

849
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:38,879
things like steel um and and you know

850
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,359
going down to something pretty kind of

851
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:43,000
fundamental that we all think about

852
00:34:40,359 --> 00:34:45,320
something like an aluminum can even

853
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,839
there's just significant Headroom to

854
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:50,119
increase Recycling and there we have

855
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:52,399
pretty direct evidence that deposits on

856
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:53,639
a on an aluminum can in terms of you

857
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:56,079
know we usually

858
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:58,839
say increases the amount of collection

859
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:00,240
rate so in the US the highest is sort of

860
00:34:58,839 --> 00:35:02,440
10 cents right we would think for

861
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:05,440
Redemption you have you know upwards of

862
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:07,079
of 40 50% recovery based on that but in

863
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,880
in Europe in some European countries

864
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:11,280
where it's where it's higher the the

865
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:13,280
bottle deposits are higher the recycling

866
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:16,560
rate is is also higher so there's some

867
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:18,560
pretty direct feedback loops there um

868
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:21,880
that that can you know we can use to

869
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:23,800
build uh Stronger policies for incenting

870
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:26,880
that as well it seems like though what

871
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:28,720
you're saying is um you know government

872
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,440
is extremely important if you're

873
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:33,520
thinking about um

874
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,680
recycling more and more of these

875
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,920
materials that we have floating around

876
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:40,640
versus digging them out of the ground a

877
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,480
new um and yes I immediately thought of

878
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,920
soda cans because you see people like

879
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:47,839
collecting them for the to get back that

880
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:49,280
money um and it makes complete sense

881
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:50,839
that if you have like the demolition of

882
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:54,520
a building and there's a bunch of copper

883
00:35:50,839 --> 00:35:57,040
in there the more you offer to go in and

884
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:59,079
like grab that copper out the more

885
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:01,839
likely it is is like the higher that

886
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:04,079
price is the more somebody's like okay I

887
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:06,280
will do this because it's worth my time

888
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:09,000
yeah and so we you have this model where

889
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:11,400
you have to try to think about how do we

890
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,400
incent that and and some of the policy

891
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,960
schemes start to look like

892
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:17,040
responsibility going either to the

893
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,800
individual or to the producer so there's

894
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,839
a set of incentives in recycling called

895
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,280
extender producer responsibility where

896
00:36:20,839 --> 00:36:24,560
we think about those that are

897
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:26,160
manufacturing to begin with though you

898
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:28,480
know the wire or the bottle or then you

899
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:30,160
know have a cost associated with then

900
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,599
managing that end of life and so then

901
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:35,119
it's where does that cost go who Bears

902
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:36,880
the the burden of that cost and being

903
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:42,040
thoughtful about architecting that

904
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:44,440
policy um is is part of the need

905
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:46,560
