1
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,720
Before I um pass it over to our next

2
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,279
moderator for the amazing panel on

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:22,320
policy, I just want to do a a brief

4
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:25,600
moment summarizing um our first two

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:29,199
sessions. Um, and I know we started with

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:31,439
the enormity of the global challenge in

7
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,120
front of us at from multiple

8
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,680
perspectives and I thought that was a

9
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:40,480
fantastic conversation and then we turn

10
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:44,399
to people and it's easy um to skip the

11
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:46,079
people part and uh and to not have the

12
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,600
harder conversations about all the

13
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,800
different stakeholders and viewpoints

14
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:55,760
and challenges. Um, so I'm I'm glad we

15
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:57,520
did it. And I also um felt uh the

16
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,199
um

17
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,760
I don't know, I irony isn't quite the

18
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:05,600
right word. I'm going to misuse it, but

19
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:08,799
I felt the um the kind of human level of

20
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:13,360
what it is to be in a conversation about

21
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:16,799
people. Um our emotions and our beliefs.

22
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,479
um aligning them to take action is

23
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,119
probably the largest challenge larger

24
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:25,119
than that first panel.

25
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:27,280
Um and to do that requires a degree of

26
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,960
vulnerability and human connection. I

27
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,640
think it was mentioned by some of the

28
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,560
speakers that um you know

29
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,799
heat likes to say ch change happens at

30
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,320
the speed of trust. Um it is

31
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:42,400
relationshipbased. And so, um, during

32
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,360
the lunch break, uh, after that

33
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,920
conversation about, um, utilities and

34
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,320
the question about trust, I was, um,

35
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:54,399
chatting with, um, a leader in a gas

36
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:56,159
utility. Um, and we ended up, and I'm

37
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,840
going to totally make this incredibly

38
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,840
uncomfortable and call her up. Come on,

39
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,840
Nikki.

40
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,679
>> So, here's what we were talking about.

41
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,440
We're going to just demonstrate um a

42
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,520
little bit of vulnerability and trust.

43
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,280
We ended up in a very um personal

44
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,560
conversation about how to deal with

45
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,200
waking up in the middle of the night

46
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,239
with work issues

47
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:29,120
and challenges and and you know was was

48
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:31,920
was diet, coffee, um uh acupuncture, um

49
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:35,120
other methods the way to cope with the

50
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,720
burden and the exhaustion of trying to

51
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,480
lead in this space.

52
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,080
>> I'm just going to hand you the mic.

53
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,920
Well, I'm sure it's a foreign issue to

54
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,400
everybody in the room. No one ever has

55
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:47,120
woken up in the middle of the night. Um,

56
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,599
but I think where we we came out is just

57
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,840
uh the enormity of it all on your

58
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,599
shoulders and kind of goes back to what

59
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,760
some of the panels were saying about how

60
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:58,239
do you break that down and helpffectuate

61
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:01,760
change where you can. Um, and then kind

62
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,040
of detach really because you know you if

63
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,840
you're working on something that you

64
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,760
love, even if you're exhausted, it feels

65
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,879
a little less weighty than if you're

66
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,040
just putting the paces in, but you know,

67
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,040
you don't really care. Because I'm I get

68
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,959
asked sometimes um sometimes by people I

69
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,519
love, why do you care so much? It's just

70
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,440
a job. Or and I said, well, geez, if I

71
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,920
went to work and I treated it as just a

72
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,680
job, I would be really bored. Probably

73
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,440
wouldn't perform as well. And and I know

74
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,680
I you know not everybody's wired that

75
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,080
way, right? And then you think, do I

76
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,000
have this all wrong? Because then you

77
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,519
could detach a little easier. And so I

78
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,760
know and it's not just me. I mean, I

79
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,519
stand here on behalf of my team, but um

80
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,239
a lot of us are dealing with that. And

81
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,640
and I think it's just thinking about the

82
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,680
global picture and the to use the word

83
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,920
enormity of it all, but what locally can

84
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,080
you control and what can you do and

85
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,920
trying to do the now I sound like a

86
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,080
Frozen movie, but the next right thing I

87
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,799
think was the song. You can tell how old

88
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,519
my kids are. Yeah,

89
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,439
>> I was going to say that.

90
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,680
>> Thank you so much, Nikki, for for

91
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:06,080
volunteering to do that. Um, and I just

92
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,799
I wanted to do that to bring like that

93
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,959
level of the people conversation in in

94
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:14,080
response to some of the conversation we

95
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:16,880
had before is just it's actually just

96
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,720
human. And as you get to know other

97
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,400
humans, no matter where they are in the

98
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,840
system, you will find over and over

99
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:26,880
again that they are just humans and that

100
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:29,040
it is the systems that we must evolve

101
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,040
and change to meet the moment. So with

102
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,520
that note,

103
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,440
turning it over to Andrew Eiff who is

104
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,680
going to be our next moderator. And I'm

105
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,240
so excited for this panel.

106
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,720
>> I'm excited too. I hope you all are too.

107
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,120
I think that's a great segue. We spent

108
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,040
the morning, excuse me, talking about

109
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,560
the sort of high level and talking about

110
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:53,040
people and I think policy can seem like

111
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,960
a sort of depersonified kind of a thing.

112
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,080
It's just out there in the system, in

113
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,720
the atmosphere, in the water. But I

114
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,840
think we're going to hear in this panel

115
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,040
about people making that policy and what

116
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,479
is driving them, what are the

117
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,680
opportunities, what are the challenges

118
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:13,039
that they see. Uh we're going to begin

119
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,720
with a video from Laurig Shakudian. She

120
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,240
represents district 20 in in the

121
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,280
Maryland assembly and serves on the

122
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,960
economic matters committee. As you will

123
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,120
hear, Laurig is a passionate and

124
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,759
thoughtful advocate and also runs

125
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,240
ultramarathons, which may help explain

126
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:31,039
her stamina in pushing for geothermal

127
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,280
networks.

128
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,680
>> Delegate Lauren Chudian uh in the

129
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,400
Maryland General Assembly and I am

130
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,000
sending my greetings and a little bit of

131
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,800
jealousy because I wish I was there with

132
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,800
you.

133
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,120
>> Um but I'm here in the Maryland General

134
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,120
Assembly. We are in full session and I

135
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,280
have bill hearings at the time that you

136
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,000
all are meeting. So, I know your

137
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,240
meetings um and your conversations are

138
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,639
probably amazing and I look forward to

139
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,479
hearing about everything that you are

140
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,479
learning from each other as I continue

141
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,800
to be part of this amazing network of

142
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:05,360
people across the country uh who are

143
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,240
moving legislation and pilots and

144
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,639
programs forward to increase um network

145
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:14,080
geothermal systems across our

146
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:17,199
communities. Um last year around this

147
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:21,600
time I was working to pass the warmth

148
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:24,639
act which is the um working for

149
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:27,120
accessible renewable Maryland thermal

150
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,360
heat. A bit of a mouthful but really a

151
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,600
brilliant name. Wouldn't you agree? Um

152
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,319
and warmth like who doesn't want to be

153
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:37,759
warm? And so with that as our entry, we

154
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:40,319
were able to educate my colleagues on um

155
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,880
network geothermal systems uh in our

156
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:46,639
case utility owned systems and we passed

157
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:49,360
the bill in uh 2024. And so now we've

158
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:52,800
reached a point where the utilities are

159
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:55,280
each putting in um their filings with

160
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,520
working with the community on developing

161
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,759
pilot locations um and things are moving

162
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,880
forward. So I'll back up a little bit

163
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:05,840
and tell you about our process. I became

164
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,520
um really interested in geothermal in

165
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,039
general when I was working both on

166
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,240
building electrification a number of

167
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,960
years ago. Working on building

168
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,919
electrification and also simultaneously

169
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,440
on looking at grid issues and and um

170
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:20,240
grid stability and the ability of the

171
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,400
grid to handle building and and um

172
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,400
transportation electrification. And that

173
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,080
was even before we were looking at load

174
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,720
growth from data centers and other

175
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,759
manufacturing. Um and it was clear to me

176
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,800
that geothermal had to be part of our uh

177
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:37,360
transition because of the fact that it

178
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,840
has the ability to um to do the

179
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,759
electrification superefficiently um and

180
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,599
in a way that really minimizes impact on

181
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,479
the grid and long-term as we've seen

182
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,000
from the DOE studies um really saves an

183
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:51,680
extraordinary amount of money in terms

184
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,759
of uh infrastructure um and generation.

185
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,360
So I got excited about that. I had an

186
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:59,840
initial bill um in 2021 uh to create

187
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,440
geothermal wrecks in the state. But as I

188
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,199
was doing that research, I ran across

189
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,879
the work that heat was doing and I

190
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,840
absolutely fell in love with the model

191
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:12,000
because for a few reasons. Um, one

192
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:14,160
reason is because um, as I work on

193
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,120
energy transition, one of my top

194
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,280
priorities is to make sure that the jobs

195
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,400
that are being created in our new energy

196
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,400
economy are good union jobs and are

197
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,240
equivalent to the jobs uh, that are

198
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,520
being lost as we transition away from

199
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,919
fossil fuels. And so network geothermal

200
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:35,039
of course is the most perfect of those

201
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,800
transitions because um literally the

202
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,959
very same work working on pipes in the

203
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,640
ground that could be done with gas is

204
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:42,560
the very same work working on pipes in

205
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,720
the ground that is done with never

206
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:47,519
geothermal. So that sort of checked one

207
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,440
of my top priority boxes. And then the

208
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,880
idea of, you know, I do spend a lot of

209
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:55,200
time um with legislation that the

210
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,120
utilities don't like. Um and it's nice

211
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,800
to work with the gas utilities and say,

212
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,560
"Look, you know, like if you want a

213
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,240
future, I don't have a problem with your

214
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,399
future. I just have a problem with your

215
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,720
current business model and your past

216
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,399
business model of fossil gas." And so if

217
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,720
you want a future, like let me help you

218
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:14,240
have another kind of a future. and um

219
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,920
really an opportunity to take um to take

220
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,560
what it is that utilities do have, which

221
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,320
is an ability and expertise on massive

222
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,880
infrastructure projects and access to

223
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,480
capital to do that um and a system that

224
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,040
lets us spread the costs and the

225
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,360
benefits across all rateayers. And so

226
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,839
all of those things uh made me really

227
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,920
excited about network geothermal. Um so

228
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:37,839
I went up first and u met with folks at

229
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:41,680
HEAT myself. Um learned a bunch of stuff

230
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:44,000
um with um we brought up I went up with

231
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,240
uh initially sorry first I went up with

232
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,040
uh Washington gas uh and we took a look

233
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,320
at the systems and then as I got clearer

234
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,480
about the bill that I was putting

235
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,560
together I started a process that I do

236
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,480
on most of my big energy bills which is

237
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,000
really bringing together all of the

238
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,480
potential stakeholders. So, I was

239
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,399
working with um I was working with the

240
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,720
gas utilities. I was working with the

241
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,200
labor unions, both the labor unions who

242
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,279
represent gas workers. So, the in-house

243
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,320
labor unions uh for Washington gas and

244
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:15,519
BG and then also the building trades. Uh

245
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,200
so, work that doesn't get done um by the

246
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,000
in-house unions, construction work that

247
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,240
gets contracted out could be done um by

248
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,279
building trades. I was working very

249
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,040
closely with uh the grassroots groups uh

250
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,120
the housing justice folks, the climate

251
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,279
justice folks who are doing really

252
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,200
interesting organizing in my community

253
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,839
where they're going in and measuring NO2

254
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,600
levels associated with gas stoves and

255
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,600
then they're organizing tenants who are

256
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:43,519
then going to their landlords and asking

257
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:46,000
for um asking for electrification um for

258
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,920
as a health and safety issue. So working

259
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,120
with Action in Montgomery, Interfaith

260
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,800
Power and Light, those were some of the

261
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,600
groups doing that. grassroots housing

262
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:56,560
justice, climate justice work, and then

263
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,079
um also bringing into the conversation

264
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,360
groups like the Maryland Energy

265
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,560
Administration, the Public Service

266
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,240
Commission, the Office of People's

267
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,240
Council, and then of course all the

268
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,000
climate groups um that do really good

269
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,600
work in the state, Chesby Climate Action

270
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,040
Network, League of Conservation, Vot

271
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,399
Sierra Club, and others. And so, um I

272
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:17,279
started working with all of those

273
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:21,040
groups. And um I I um

274
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:23,120
brought uh a group of people up to

275
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,839
Massachusetts and thanks again to heat

276
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,320
for hosting us. Um we had a chance to

277
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,839
see um some of the test board holes. we

278
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,480
had a chance to sort of stand there and

279
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,800
look at, you know, buildings really,

280
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,519
right? because um as AB likes to say

281
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,040
there's not a lot to see but um but to

282
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,720
be able to picture I think for folks who

283
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,240
were there to be able to you know learn

284
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,279
about what's happening but also to

285
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:48,480
picture what kind of neighborhoods um uh

286
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,760
this could be really effective in and um

287
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,839
and then we continued to work

288
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,839
collaboratively and and it was exciting

289
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,160
to bring folks together who often are

290
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,959
not working um in the same direction on

291
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,640
the same policies um working through

292
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,240
building trust across those groups of

293
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,920
people and making sure that everybody

294
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,880
body felt like the bill that we finally

295
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,639
produced really um met the needs of of

296
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,279
the folks who were going to be required

297
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:13,440
and and necessary for implementation.

298
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:16,160
And so, uh we had the bill last year in

299
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,839
the 2024 session. Um and I'm happy to

300
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,839
say it passed in the in the first year

301
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,519
we introduced it. Um and really a lot of

302
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,279
that had to do with the fact that we

303
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,360
essentially had no opposition because

304
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,519
everybody was sitting at the table. And

305
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,160
in fact, when we went for our hearing,

306
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,480
you know, I had the the climate justice

307
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,079
groups and the gas workers union and the

308
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,240
utility and the office of people's

309
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,519
council and like that's a set of folks

310
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,040
that I don't know if they've ever been

311
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,240
on the same panel before, but I was

312
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,000
telling my colleagues, I was like, just

313
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,800
go ahead and take a picture of this um

314
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,399
and then move my bill favorable because

315
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,360
um obviously there was still work to be

316
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:51,279
done and education and and so on, but

317
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,680
most of the work really was the year and

318
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:55,360
a half of building coalitions and

319
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,360
connecting people with each and making

320
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,600
sure that the language really met the

321
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,440
needs of everybody involved. So that

322
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,160
bill passed and then soon after we

323
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,720
started um you know working with the gas

324
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,320
companies uh to to start to you know

325
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,160
connect them to the grassroots groups

326
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,160
and to start to organize and identify

327
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,079
potential locations. Um and that's

328
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,279
really where we are right now. Um we're

329
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,120
going through that process with

330
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:19,279
community groups and the the gas

331
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,360
companies are working on um some

332
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:24,160
engineering studies and we're excited to

333
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,800
have um to have something here in the

334
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,320
next few years. So um I'll stop there.

335
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,920
I'm not I may or may not be able to be

336
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,079
on there for questions. I'm not sure how

337
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,839
that's going to work, but um if anyone's

338
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,600
interested in getting in touch with me,

339
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:38,320
we'll make sure that you all have my

340
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:41,839
contact information. Um so I'm happy to

341
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:44,560
follow up and be supportive um as I am

342
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,160
able. And I do hope to to connect with

343
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,079
folks and and hear more and learn more

344
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:51,320
about what you all are doing all across

345
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,320
this country.
