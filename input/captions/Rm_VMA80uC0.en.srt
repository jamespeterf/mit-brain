1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,040
So I'm Hammed Nori. I'm co-founder and

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,839
CTO of Before Health Intelligence. And

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:11,200
I'm going to introduce to you today um

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:14,160
Antrike. Antshrike is an embedded AI uh

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:17,680
platform for preventive just in time

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:20,160
warnings for heart attack and stroke as

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:23,359
well as also diseases beyond that.

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:27,359
Essentially an strike is a realtime risk

9
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:30,000
calculation algorithm that provides also

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:34,160
head health advices ahead of time. It is

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,480
comprised of two AI elements, two AI

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,680
layers, a static AI core that has been

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:43,520
trained on data from approximately

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,840
125,000 individuals and a dynamic AI

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,079
core that uses realtime sensor

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,600
measurements from commercially available

17
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:55,280
smart watches. Um, the dynamic AI

18
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:59,199
element has been trained on over 130

19
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:02,960
billion preclinical data points and thus

20
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:04,879
far on over 1.5 billion clinical data

21
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,720
points.

22
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:10,960
Um, and we are expanding that to 77

23
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:14,159
billion in interaction with Stanford

24
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:17,840
Medical School uh to prepare for also

25
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:20,560
FDA approvals for for these settings. So

26
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,640
essentially what it does and what it

27
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,280
provides in contrast to the existing

28
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,520
technologies is that it predicts

29
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,600
catastrophic and non-c catastrophic

30
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,640
conditions and health events with a high

31
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,040
temporal accuracy. So for for the vast

32
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,280
majority of diseases that we looked at

33
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,280
above 85%

34
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,360
depending on the disease that we are

35
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,720
looking at. This translates to being

36
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:47,600
able to predict the onset of a condition

37
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,520
a couple of hours to up to 5 days ahead

38
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,799
of time that would apply for a heart

39
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,159
attack. A main advantage is that in

40
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,680
contrast to the current

41
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,719
state-of-the-art,

42
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:02,240
we do not rely for the data extraction

43
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:04,799
on expensive and calibrated heavily

44
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:08,239
calibrated clinical equipment but rather

45
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,000
can work with commonly used smartwatch

46
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:13,120
data.

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,640
And another element is that it actually

48
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,840
monitors

49
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,160
and processes data passively and so it

50
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,239
does not interrupt the daily life, daily

51
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,120
routines and habits of the individuals

52
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:29,040
using this technology. Our business

53
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:31,200
model is entirely B2B. We provide this

54
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,440
uh algorithm as an integrated

55
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,680
algorithmic solutions

56
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,239
uh so far primarily for tech companies.

57
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,440
We have major traction from I would say

58
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:43,519
the top 10 uh tech companies in the

59
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,360
world. Numerous contracts signed.

60
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:49,360
Unfortunately, I cannot name a single

61
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:52,560
one of them. Um but what we provide is

62
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,879
the the algorithm integrated into their

63
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,120
existing platforms uh for them to

64
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,280
provide it for their customers. The

65
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,280
range of companies and I apologize for

66
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,000
the PDF just jumping. The range of

67
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:07,040
companies that typically fall within the

68
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,519
customer uh base of our company are

69
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,519
sensor manufacturers, smartphone and

70
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,000
variable manufacturers/ software

71
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,080
companies but also insurance companies

72
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,400
and healthcare providers. And a key

73
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,080
factor here is that the use cases of our

74
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,800
algorithm go far beyond the

75
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,120
cardiovascular diseases for which the

76
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,959
algorithms were originally developed.

77
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,159
But nowadays you can also work with

78
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:33,120
known uh work on known uh critical

79
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:35,840
conditions that can actually have uh

80
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,959
fundamentally different use cases. We

81
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:41,360
see a use in employee management

82
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,680
particularly when the algorithms are

83
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,720
trained for non-catastrophic scenarios

84
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:50,319
for in such as common cold or more

85
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:53,440
seasonal diseases. It can support work

86
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:55,920
uh force uh management and worktime

87
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,680
disruption predictions.

88
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,680
But we see also applications in the

89
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,760
domain of safety in transportation

90
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,840
industry as well as also supporting the

91
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,720
aging population.

92
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,959
And what we are currently looking for is

93
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,280
essentially

94
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,159
expanding the range of applications that

95
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,560
we have and co-development with uh

96
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:19,919
primarily pharmaceutical and personal

97
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,400
care companies because we see a high

98
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:24,720
chance to use this technology also for

99
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,639
identifying the optimal instances for

100
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,120
drug administrations

101
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:32,080
as well as also predicting more in a

102
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:37,040
personalized manner the effects and side

103
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:39,759
effects of particular drugs and also the

104
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,080
right moment for application of certain

105
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,800
personal care topics. I will look

106
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,680
forward to any questions as well as also

107
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,479
collaborations that may arise from this.

108
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,479
Thank you.
