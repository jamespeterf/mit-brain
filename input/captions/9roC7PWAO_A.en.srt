1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,319
I am excited to introduce today's

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,080
speaker Courtney Shear is a fourth year

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,120
PhD student in Deborah marks group at

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,160
Harvard Medical School she's interested

5
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:12,360
in developing machine learning models to

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,000
learn from past Evolution present

7
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,520
population and future experimental

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,920
biology sequence data for therapeutic

9
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,880
sequence design and predicting clinical

10
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,880
variant effects she's going to share

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,119
with us some exciting uh work today so

12
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,080
please if you have any questions feel

13
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,760
free to come up to the microphone um or

14
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,920
raise your hand if you're online feel

15
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,880
free to um raise your hand there or on

16
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,960
mute to ask your question or just Ty

17
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,719
type it in the chat so thank you again

18
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,719
Courtney for joining

19
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:44,680
us can you hear me great okay so the

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,760
actual title of my talk is can we

21
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:51,360
computationally predict Varian effects

22
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:53,199
so we can do a few experiments um and

23
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,559
like we just said you know feel free to

24
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,640
come up and ask questions like as you

25
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:59,480
like you don't have to wait till the end

26
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:02,399
you also can wait till the end like

27
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:05,040
whatever you like um so this is like

28
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,159
it's more fun if you you know talk and

29
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,640
ask questions because the primers are a

30
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:10,200
little bit more of an introductions to

31
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,960
the bulk of this talk in the beginning

32
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,320
will be truly like oh you know basics of

33
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,439
like varing effect prediction and then

34
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:21,640
towards the middle half of the talk I'll

35
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:24,560
go into a couple um specific modeling

36
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:26,920
methodologies that the Marx lab has uh

37
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:30,159
put together over the years so the

38
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:33,399
beginning will feel uh hopefully uh not

39
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:35,880
too um intimidating and certainly uh

40
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:39,320
nice to listen to at 8:30 a.m. in the

41
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:41,399
morning um so with all that the main

42
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,840
question we're answering here not to

43
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:46,119
make this over complicated is can we

44
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,640
computationally predict uh Varian

45
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:49,640
effects so we can do fewer

46
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:57,560
experiments maybe okay so what's the

47
00:01:53,840 --> 00:02:00,280
goal goal here is to learn what variants

48
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:02,240
cause disease and this simple picture I

49
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:05,079
have here we have a DNA strand on the

50
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:08,640
left um and then a individual who has

51
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:12,400
some non-desirable phenotype as depicted

52
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:15,440
by red spots and a um frowning demeanor

53
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,760
so how do these variants cause disease

54
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,440
that's a uh that's a question we have we

55
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,760
always want to know if we do see

56
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,800
variance in uh an individual how are

57
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,360
they causing this non-desirable or

58
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,239
potentially desirable but in this case

59
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,959
non-desirable phenotype um things we can

60
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,519
use uh to try to assess this we uh

61
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,720
classically have used things like

62
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:38,599
genomics epigenetics

63
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:41,519
transcriptomics proteomics and then with

64
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:44,920
all these things we try to um you know

65
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:47,360
understand how these uh molecules might

66
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:49,360
be manifesting and um you know

67
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,560
mechanisms and Pathways that ultimately

68
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,560
lead to uh the phenotypes we're

69
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,040
interested

70
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,800
in so how do we think about this

71
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,519
variation generally when it comes to I

72
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,640
didn't make this I'm not like an artist

73
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:05,400
this is AI generated um so classically

74
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,280
we'll think about things um from like a

75
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,519
proteome perspective where you have tons

76
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,799
of molecules being made I suppose from

77
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,080
like um I guess this doesn't show the

78
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:15,360
magnitude of the difference and

79
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,360
distributions of the size of the genome

80
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,519
that might produce these things but the

81
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,319
proteome will produce uh you know

82
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:25,000
proteins and the non-coding genome uh

83
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,560
usually won't produce proteins as we

84
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,360
tried to Define our

85
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:32,760
annotations um but to get into the types

86
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:36,560
of Vari we might see we'll start with um

87
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:39,159
a simple depiction um here where at the

88
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,040
top we have uh you know some reference

89
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:43,080
and I mean I'm sure we've all heard of

90
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,560
uh single nucleotide variants which are

91
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:48,040
just single based pair changes they

92
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:50,439
occur approximately in one in every uh

93
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:53,480
kilobase of um sequencing

94
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:55,959
data we can also see things like small

95
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,760
insertions and deletions which are a bit

96
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:59,560
more

97
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:02,280
rare and then we'll even start to see

98
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:04,319
like like predicted regions for

99
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:08,480
structural and copy number variants

100
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:10,959
which are supposedly um more rare unless

101
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,040
our sequencing data uh isn't good at

102
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:16,199
picking them

103
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:19,959
up um so anyway the types of these uh

104
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:22,120
single nucleotide variants that occur in

105
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:24,880
proteins um you know they have a

106
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:28,080
propensity to disrupt uh codons that

107
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:31,039
will actually um you know be translated

108
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,360
and turned into the protein

109
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:35,280
structures um of course we can have

110
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,800
variants that are silent having no

111
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,120
effect on the protein

112
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,639
sequence allegedly um and we can have

113
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,039
missense variants which result in an

114
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,680
amino acid

115
00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:48,759
substitution and then we can have

116
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,160
nonsense variants that um substitute a

117
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:52,600
stop codon for an amino acid so all of

118
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,199
this is a little bit of refresher keep

119
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:57,840
with me it'll maybe get more exciting

120
00:04:54,199 --> 00:05:00,160
for some of you um in addition to the

121
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,919
proteome I'm not going to go into any

122
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,639
numerical descriptions here but just

123
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:09,080
invite this uh you know uh complex uh

124
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:10,560
interaction system that we might uh view

125
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:14,120
when we're thinking about non-coding

126
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:17,160
variants and just as a speculation this

127
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:20,680
complex architecture is certain to

128
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:23,880
invite disruptions by uh all types of

129
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:26,080
variants of certain sizes but as a you

130
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,199
know foreshadowing to the future of what

131
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,600
I'll talk about at the end potentially

132
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:35,919
longer um variants might uh be more

133
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:39,199
disruptive than uh single nucleotide

134
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:42,039
variants so how are variant

135
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,639
distinguished well a lot of times in uh

136
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:45,400
population genetics literature these are

137
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:48,160
some ways that we like to distinguish

138
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:50,240
how we talk about variants aside from

139
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,759
where they are in the genome aside from

140
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,840
how big they are we talk about them as

141
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:58,400
reference versus alternate we talk about

142
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,520
them as um with respect to their

143
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,039
frequency and a population of Interest

144
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,039
we might call them the major variant or

145
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:06,400
the minor

146
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:08,720
variant um we might talk about them um

147
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:12,560
in terms of which variant matches the

148
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,560
most recent ancestor shared by um a

149
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,440
recent species and with respect to

150
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,720
humans this might be uh primates or

151
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,800
chimps when we might call this ancestral

152
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,280
versus

153
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:25,440
derived and we also talk about these

154
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:27,599
variants in terms of their um

155
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,919
association with increased uh disease

156
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:34,479
risks so we might call these risk versus

157
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:36,800
non-risk clever um classifying variants

158
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:40,360
um we can also classify these variants

159
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:42,039
further by minor alal frequencies so

160
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:44,360
instead of just thinking about things as

161
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:46,479
minor and major you can start to think

162
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,919
about the frequencies of these variants

163
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,680
in maybe a spectrum like this where on

164
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:53,360
the far end of the spectrum you have a

165
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:56,039
variant occurring in one person and then

166
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,240
on the bottom side of this uh Arrow you

167
00:06:56,039 --> 00:07:00,199
can think of these in terms of like you

168
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,440
know strict cut offs based on

169
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:04,759
percentages but we also use some of

170
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:07,120
these words at the top such as very rare

171
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:10,240
rare low and

172
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,319
common additionally we can expand this

173
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,199
on the left a bit and people will talk

174
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:18,560
about variants using language such as

175
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:21,199
the noo if a variant is even part of one

176
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,240
person being in a sematic cells as

177
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,960
opposed to

178
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,560
germline and these are just a few uh you

179
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,879
know ways we can begin to describe

180
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,319
variants um when we're talking about

181
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:33,680
them in

182
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:35,319
literature so how do we associate these

183
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,120
variants with diseases because remember

184
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:38,280
that's our that's our big question

185
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,599
that's what we want to know we can

186
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:43,440
describe these variants in many ways um

187
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,080
and but we're really concerned about

188
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,280
this question you can tell me all the

189
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,960
ways you want to describe a variant I

190
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:51,560
don't care I want to know how does the

191
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,159
variant affect cause the

192
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:58,120
disease

193
00:07:53,159 --> 00:08:00,360
so the bulk of um you know um uh

194
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,840
genetics and statistics gentics has kind

195
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:05,479
of looked at this kind of lens of

196
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,800
Association where we begin to look at

197
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:11,039
variant again on the bottom here in

198
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,639
terms of their um minor Al frequency but

199
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,479
we also want to know about their effect

200
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:18,199
size how much an individual variant

201
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:21,440
actually contributes to the phenotype

202
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:24,720
we're interested in and we kind of P

203
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:28,360
classify variants into these broad um

204
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:33,440
you know discreet um regions of this uh

205
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:36,440
two-dimensional um um um um coordinate

206
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:39,479
system and we can say what studies are

207
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:42,039
used to find these causal

208
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:43,839
variants uh we can have variants that

209
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:45,600
are extremely unlikely they're common

210
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,080
variants with major effects it's

211
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,760
extremely unlikely to find those we have

212
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,519
gwa studies which are very good uh

213
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,720
allegedly at finding low frequency

214
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:56,519
variants with intermediate effects or

215
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,120
common variant with small

216
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:01,079
effects we have rare variant analysis

217
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,800
which is is good at finding rare

218
00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:05,519
variants with small effect size and then

219
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,920
we can use some things like tools like

220
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,120
family studies to look for rare variants

221
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,720
with major effects and even sometimes

222
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:14,160
grab some of those low frequency

223
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:16,560
variants with intermediate

224
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:19,640
effects so all that is great finding

225
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:22,240
these associations but even if we find

226
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:25,920
them there still is this big question

227
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:28,480
here of can we predict how the variant

228
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,240
affect the trait so what about all this

229
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,079
stuff in the middle how are we going to

230
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:36,079
get

231
00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:38,240
there so we could do this

232
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:40,200
experimentally uh we can use tools to

233
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,440
look at the proteome such as deep

234
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:46,000
mutational scans where we basically

235
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:48,000
perturb each um amino acid and see how

236
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,040
it changes uh something simple like the

237
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,680
protein uh folding or some Downstream um

238
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:56,519
you know assay uh uh that we're

239
00:09:54,680 --> 00:10:00,160
interested

240
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:02,079
in uh we can also look at more so I

241
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,240
guess as this is called for the

242
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:07,959
non-coding regions we can look at what

243
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:10,920
are called um npas massively parallel

244
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:14,279
reporter assays where we essentially

245
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:17,920
exogenously go in and stuff our variant

246
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:21,800
of Interest into a plasmid and see if we

247
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:25,200
have um potentially expression happening

248
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:27,720
um from some uh gfp Etc or we can even

249
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,720
assess things like Star seek we're

250
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:33,600
looking at uh enhancer binding

251
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,600
Etc we also can look at things like

252
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,360
crisper mutagenesis where we can

253
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:41,920
potentially go and indirectly um you

254
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:45,480
know edit uh regions of the endogenous

255
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:48,800
cell and see how those um edits you know

256
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:52,000
manifest in some Downstream uh cellular

257
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:54,000
phenotype and even further look at those

258
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,040
at the organism level but that seems uh

259
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,360
fairly

260
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,760
expensive so why not do all these

261
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,959
experiments seems like a good idea well

262
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,320
the human genome has about 20,000

263
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:07,880
protein coating genes average protein

264
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,959
length is 470 amino acids Poss amino

265
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:12,920
acid substitutions per position is

266
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:15,560
approximately 19 variance per protein is

267
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:18,279
around that number this leads to a a

268
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:20,839
very large total of possible amino acid

269
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:23,560
uh substitutions just singles um for

270
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:25,680
double mutants this goes up to 15.9

271
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:28,040
trillion combinations and triple

272
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,320
mutations becomes

273
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:32,120
astronomical okay well I don't care I'm

274
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,639
going to do a low through preny

275
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:37,399
experiment anyway okay so a cloning and

276
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:39,320
DNA preparation might take two days

277
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:41,680
protein expression two to three days

278
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:43,920
functional assays 1 to three days data

279
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,920
analysis one day not so bad total time

280
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,920
for variance seven days you have a team

281
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,320
of five researchers you're going to test

282
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:53,560
your variance in parallel 50 for 50 per

283
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:56,399
week okay it's going to take you about

284
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:57,959
68692 years okay I'm going to do a high

285
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,560
throughput experiment low throughput

286
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:02,480
experiments that's old new mes okay I'm

287
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,959
going to do 50,000 variants per

288
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,399
experiment that's going to take me about

289
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:08,279
a month and then I'm going to do this

290
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:11,920
that's still going to take me about 300

291
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:15,519
years ah dang okay so I should never do

292
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:17,480
an experiment again no you can use

293
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,920
prediction from some magical Oracle of

294
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,279
tools which I'll try to convince you

295
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:23,560
about next uh for this initial screening

296
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:25,240
of variants you might want to test then

297
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,320
you can validate these high impact

298
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,519
variants

299
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,880
experimentally and then you can do this

300
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:32,680
in a continue feedback loop to improve

301
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,160
predictions

302
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:37,199
yes thing I always think about with your

303
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:39,399
previous slide is are you testing it

304
00:12:37,199 --> 00:12:41,560
even in the right cell type and so you

305
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:43,240
need to multiply all of those by all of

306
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:45,600
the different cell types and states that

307
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:48,199
ever exist in the human body yeah and we

308
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,560
only Define cell types that we Define

309
00:12:48,199 --> 00:12:52,839
discreet cell types but of course you

310
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:55,800
know that's a bit

311
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:57,360
artificial so it's entally inflite if

312
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,639
you wanted to like time Point any

313
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:03,839
potential cell um

314
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:08,360
as it's uh differentiating okay so maybe

315
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:13,279
you believe me okay so anyway so this is

316
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:16,519
a body of work um from a group of us uh

317
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:19,360
um uh variant effect prediction

318
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:21,720
Association um led by uh Joe

319
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,360
Marsh um we put out this guidelines for

320
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,600
releasing a variant effect predictor you

321
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,320
can check it out if you like has some

322
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,160
good um descriptions of what a variant

323
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,880
effect predictor would be do but

324
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,519
essentially a variant effect predictor

325
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:36,839
it aims to take in data information from

326
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:40,839
maybe these potential modalities on the

327
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:42,680
left um and uh be useful you know for

328
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:44,839
highlighting uh variants with this

329
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:46,920
evidence that you can use the filter

330
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:50,880
down the variants you might want to be

331
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:53,079
testing um to see if they have clinical

332
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,199
relevance so what types of models are

333
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:55,680
there what types of variant effect

334
00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:59,720
pictures are there how can we think

335
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:02,240
about this we can have supervised models

336
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:05,160
can have unsupervised models we can have

337
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,079
Ensemble models supervised models

338
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:10,120
they're great we can learn directly from

339
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:12,639
known disease variants and we get strong

340
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:14,560
performance on wall variant types U

341
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:17,560
requires on requires labels if you have

342
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,440
it you have it use it unsupervised

343
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:21,880
models May Advantage no Reliance on

344
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,759
disease labels better generalization to

345
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:25,199
unseen variants maybe we can use these

346
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:27,519
to find things we don't already know

347
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,759
about and we can utilize evolutionary

348
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,759
sequence data in theory you can use

349
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:33,079
other things but in the context of the

350
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:35,040
variant effect prediction models that

351
00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:37,199
are out there a lot of them you'll see

352
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:40,639
using evolutionary sequence data right

353
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:42,680
now you can also do a an ensemble model

354
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,480
might heard CAD things like this where

355
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:47,240
they aim to combine multiple sources of

356
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:50,440
evidence uh together which can be very

357
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:52,480
powerful um depending on your

358
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,560
question for the sake of this talk we're

359
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,320
going to continue and we're going to

360
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:59,480
focus on unsupervised models because

361
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:02,639
this seems to be um the next fr frer in

362
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:04,480
terms of like being able to uh

363
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:07,000
potentially say things about variants we

364
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:10,560
don't know things about going into this

365
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:13,600
space of um better General

366
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,440
generalization to unseen variant unseen

367
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,560
variance I think we've seen all the

368
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:21,320
variants no way so why unsupervised

369
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:24,920
models are gamechanging but this is just

370
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:28,240
a simple analysis looking at um believe

371
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:30,120
uh uh clingen and Nomad what we have is

372
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,120
just focusing on this is just focusing

373
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,600
on the 3% of the genome that is proteome

374
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,000
so you can imagine like if you had a

375
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,319
bigger pie chart you know like how much

376
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,639
we wouldn't know about the non-coding

377
00:15:38,319 --> 00:15:43,000
genome but this is kind of the label

378
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:45,040
data we have so it's pretty awesome to

379
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,959
think about the potential for some of

380
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,720
these other methods in terms of

381
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:52,839
providing us evidence for going in and

382
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:54,600
um you know learning things about these

383
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:56,680
um variants that we've never seen or

384
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:59,240
been able to characterize

385
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:01,160
before so now we'll go into the part of

386
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,959
the talk where I try to sell you some of

387
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:05,880
the models you know that we work on in

388
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:07,959
my lab in the Mark's lab um so these

389
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:10,319
models are particularly interesting

390
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:12,880
because they rely on this assumption

391
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:15,440
that we can use this piece of orthogonal

392
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:19,360
information for uh human genetics that's

393
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:21,199
found in um the 8.7 million species in

394
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,920
the biosphere so we can look at

395
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:26,759
evolutionary sequence data where in

396
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:29,360
principle this Evolution has done a ton

397
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:33,040
of experiments for us already to

398
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:35,199
highlight variants that are uh desirable

399
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,519
and to tell us stories about variants

400
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:40,199
that maybe weren't desirable and so if

401
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:42,440
we see those variants of either category

402
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:44,959
in the human population maybe we can

403
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:48,959
learn a bit of evidence as to what

404
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:48,959
variant might be more or less

405
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:53,600
desirable so the distribution of

406
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,360
sequences across all these organism

407
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,519
teaches us a lot about constraint um

408
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,759
like I just said here's like a

409
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:02,600
mathematical uh formula of what I just

410
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:05,160
said we can think about uh potentially

411
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:07,160
variants that um are less probable

412
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:09,880
meaning they're less likely to be seen

413
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:11,799
in this like learned uh distribution of

414
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,919
sequences we see in evolution they're

415
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:15,679
less probable they're probably less fit

416
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:19,240
and we can create that as like kind of a

417
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:22,919
proxy for deleteriousness a proxy this

418
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:25,160
is not uh 100% this is deleterious this

419
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:27,919
is

420
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:30,840
evidence okay so to go into this a

421
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,840
little bit more

422
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:36,679
um deep learning models capture complex

423
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,760
conservation patterns which take the

424
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:41,200
full sequence context into account um so

425
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,039
looking for patterns and sequence

426
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,360
constraints is a relatively old idea

427
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:48,640
until recently only column conservation

428
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:50,400
was considered in this model you say oh

429
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,440
I'm going to take all my sequences I'm

430
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,559
going to line them up and I'm going to

431
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,360
say oh which one happened the most often

432
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:59,720
which one didn't happen the most often

433
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:04,559
that's a very simple idea if only only

434
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:07,240
uh biology was that simple um so um as

435
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:10,120
like a next step on top of that idea we

436
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:13,960
might start to look at pairs so this

437
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:15,559
might be uh best described in proteins

438
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,919
when you're seeing pairs because of

439
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:20,120
contacts where if you see residues

440
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,440
contact in contact with each other

441
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:24,799
presumably if one has a disruption

442
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:28,919
you're going to see A disruption um in

443
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:32,000
the other one so this is a somewhat uh

444
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:33,240
not I'm GNA say old but like not uh

445
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,360
breaking

446
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:40,240
news oh that's nice

447
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:41,280
okay um so some other potential models

448
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,320
you might consider you might ask

449
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:47,320
yourself oh well what about Beyond pairs

450
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:50,039
what if there's um more interesting

451
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:52,200
higher dimensional interactions well

452
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:54,120
things like variational autoencoders

453
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,280
other types of models they start to

454
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:58,880
address this question of like going into

455
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:00,919
this potentially nonlinear space um

456
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,039
mathematically and being able to pull

457
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:04,200
out um you know some of these higher

458
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:08,360
order

459
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:10,960
dependencies um we also see a lot of um

460
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:13,720
models these days you'll see from like

461
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,559
protein language models Etc which also

462
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:18,000
use slightly different strategies um

463
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:20,720
they a lot of times they don't

464
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,159
necessarily rely on strict alignments of

465
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:26,039
your data and that can be really

466
00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:28,720
advantageous especially for proteins if

467
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:30,360
they don't align very well such as uh

468
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,440
antibodies which might have

469
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:34,960
hypervariable regions Etc um and then

470
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,000
you could imagine how this is even more

471
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,760
attractive potentially which I'll get to

472
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,520
towards the end if you wanted to look at

473
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,760
uh you know non-coding aspects of the

474
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,640
genome where you have uh you know less

475
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,600
constraint defined by structure that you

476
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:52,440
would see in proteins and they become

477
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,440
Less ad meable to alignment based

478
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,520
models so how do our models compare with

479
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:00,120
lab

480
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:03,000
experiments uh model predictions to lab

481
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:05,120
experiment yeah okay so Eve predicts uh

482
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,640
Eve is one of our models it's this model

483
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:10,039
here the vae so you can think of it as

484
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,640
like a deep learning model that's able

485
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:15,280
to pick up on higher order dependencies

486
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,240
um in the data so just breaking Beyond

487
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,679
uh pairwise dependencies it's still

488
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,919
going to get pairwise it's still going

489
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:24,480
to get sitewise but it can be

490
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:28,960
more um and what we published this work

491
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:32,000
back geez like 2021 I think now so like

492
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:34,640
right when I started my PhD um and what

493
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,720
we're seeing here is that basically the

494
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:42,360
model um is able to predict um you know

495
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:45,440
if a variant is uh uh benign or

496
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:49,000
pathogenic just as well as if you took

497
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:52,480
some mutational scanning experiment and

498
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,840
put that up to the same uh the same task

499
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:57,200
so it does it's as well as experiment so

500
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:59,000
in theory if you never had this model is

501
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,960
not trained on the experimental data we

502
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,919
made the experiment to confirm this or

503
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,280
to find new things so in theory you

504
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:06,840
never needed to do the experiment

505
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,360
because we don't do experiments to

506
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:11,080
validate our machine learning models we

507
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:13,039
do them to um well we might do that but

508
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,720
we should be doing them to find evidence

509
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:17,240
for clinical

510
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,760
variants uh so Eve is good at predicting

511
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:21,240
clinical

512
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:23,799
labels but many variant effect

513
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:26,200
predictors perform well at predicting

514
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:29,240
clinical lab labels and chlorate well

515
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:31,760
with experimental data

516
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:34,320
but they are not designed for comparing

517
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:37,080
uh variants in distinct genes we here on

518
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:40,120
the right originally we have Eve model

519
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:42,360
here that is unable to distinguish its P

520
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:45,200
its uh scores for two different classes

521
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:47,120
of genes the purple one or the one on

522
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,520
the top being Hao insufficient genes

523
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,640
where you would expect A disruption in

524
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:54,200
that Gene to be uh quite

525
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:56,320
deleterious whereas compared to a loss

526
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:59,080
of function tolerated Gene whereas you

527
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:01,240
had a varant in that Gene you wouldn't

528
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:03,880
expect it to be quite as deleterious as

529
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:06,120
the half loone sufficient Gene so what

530
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:08,760
we did is we said oh what if we could

531
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:12,400
combine this evolutionary information

532
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:15,600
with uh information from um

533
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:18,000
biobanks so we use a two-step uh modular

534
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:21,080
approach for building a whole proteo

535
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,799
model um where in this example we're not

536
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:24,200
taking like a single Eve model for a

537
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,600
single protein we're going to make

538
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:28,640
models for the whole proteum I don't

539
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:32,120
think we've quite reached 20,000 but

540
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:35,400
we've got a lot um

541
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:37,640
um and with this model we basically have

542
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,799
a VAR a variable for an evolutionary

543
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:42,799
score that we're getting from these uh

544
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:44,799
Eve models or other potential um protein

545
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:47,720
language models that might be ensembled

546
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:49,320
in some way and we basic basically uh do

547
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,720
a conditional distribution where we're

548
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:55,000
taking the probability of a variant

549
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:57,200
being seen in some um biobank in this

550
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,200
case the UK biobank and we're

551
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:03,520
conditioning this on um its evolutionary

552
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:06,760
score and um we can parameterize this as

553
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:10,840
a simple Bly distribution where our

554
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:14,919
prior um our prior uh is a gum process

555
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:17,760
prior and aside from this gum process

556
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:20,080
prior what's cool about this is we also

557
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,880
can have some measure of uncertainty in

558
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,360
the model so sometimes the model would

559
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,600
just give you a score and they'll tell

560
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,320
you how to interpret that score and

561
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,000
you're like great but wouldn't it be

562
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,360
nice to know how uncertain the model is

563
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,440
about that score because that might give

564
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:34,600
you an additional piece of evidence as

565
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:37,240
to say like how much can I trust this so

566
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:39,760
parameterizing models like this can be a

567
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:43,240
a powerful technique for giving the

568
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:46,799
researcher more um you

569
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:49,600
know uh more information about what the

570
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:52,919
model is um able to

571
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:55,400
discern um so in this case we see on the

572
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:58,159
top with our Eve model our original Eve

573
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:00,520
model which had no population data and

574
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:03,080
it's a little bit confused about how to

575
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:05,279
score the half insufficient genes versus

576
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:08,320
the loss of function tolerant genes and

577
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:12,320
then we see once we do um train a new

578
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:16,799
model with pop Eve we see um ignore the

579
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:18,799
actual um numerics on the x-axis there

580
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:21,080
it's about the comparison of the two box

581
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:23,760
plots not the actual numbers so what

582
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:26,279
we're seeing here is that the blue box

583
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:29,000
plot is slightly shifted higher meaning

584
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:32,559
it has a higher likelihood happening

585
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:35,080
meaning it's less deleterious versus the

586
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:37,480
purple box it's shifted left meaning

587
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:39,440
it's has a lower likelihood of being

588
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:42,159
seen under the distribution and

589
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:45,159
therefore it is um predicted to be more

590
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,159
deleterious

591
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:54,000
yes which Eve or po the eve

592
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:56,000
model it distinguish between the red and

593
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,880
the green bonds presumably like Capal

594
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,200
sufficient genes would have maybe more

595
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:04,080
like conservation than lolf tolerant

596
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,679
genes across species I think it would

597
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:09,600
but it's um you know I think like the

598
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:11,799
hypothesis here is that uh you know

599
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:14,360
you're you're losing some of those like

600
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:16,880
um characteristics are based on the what

601
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:19,200
we've seen in humans and you might want

602
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,720
to have more current uh standing

603
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:24,320
variation considered heavily in your

604
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:26,799
model which is why we add the additional

605
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,720
information from Human populations to

606
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:31,520
kind of get the model to say okay I'm

607
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:34,240
gonna focus more on the human variation

608
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:36,320
that I'm seeing but also consider some

609
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,919
of this evolutionary sequence uh

610
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:41,200
information as a prior that makes sense

611
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:44,520
and this is just like you can see it in

612
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:49,039
the data like that that's true but like

613
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:49,039
that's the intuition yeah

614
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,960
yeah

615
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:59,200
okay so you can try out these tools

616
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:00,960
um on the left is Eve

617
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,679
and I guess there's no links here for

618
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:06,880
you but you can Google them um for

619
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:09,559
trying out Eve and pop Eve mutation uh

620
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,080
portals they're pretty cool they'll also

621
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:12,399
I think I don't know if it's Eve or pop

622
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:14,399
Eve they'll also let you see the

623
00:26:12,399 --> 00:26:16,840
mutation like in a three-dimensional

624
00:26:14,399 --> 00:26:18,440
structure this is a little bit like

625
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:21,279
short changing them just showing you

626
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:23,679
this like ugly like front door but like

627
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:25,840
it well it's not ugly but it's like not

628
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:28,440
as cool as it could be if you put it in

629
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:31,440
an actual U thing to search there's

630
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:34,240
they're cooler than that I promise you

631
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:37,279
okay um so how can we evaluate these

632
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:40,240
models um so now I'm getting towards the

633
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:43,760
end uh but this is a very cool piece of

634
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:46,360
work that um uh Hillary fukan and others

635
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,279
here at the FR have uh worked on where

636
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:51,200
they've basically made uh this

637
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:54,640
collection of benchmarks uh and they

638
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:56,080
call them genetics gym where you know

639
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,960
there's a lot of variant effect

640
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:01,919
predictors out there which one do I use

641
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:04,080
for my problem for my variant who knows

642
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:08,080
uh I don't really believe in this world

643
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:10,360
where one model is King I think based on

644
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:14,320
your question and based on the training

645
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:17,440
data of the model you should decide you

646
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:20,080
know which uh pieces of evidence to

647
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:22,080
consider I don't I personally don't

648
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,559
believe in this like God model that you

649
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:28,720
can just feed all this data into and

650
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:31,640
it's going to um give you some like

651
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:34,240
crazy answer okay so how can we evaluate

652
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:36,520
these models in this paper I believe

653
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,880
they looked at Pop Eve which was the

654
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:40,000
model I just showed you this model

655
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,240
called

656
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,799
Misfit sorry if I don't know all these

657
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:47,559
models MPC they looked at Alpha mistons

658
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:52,600
which I believe we had a talked about

659
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:56,440
earlier in the year esm 1B primate

660
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:58,320
a3d and the first uh wish that was a

661
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,640
little bigger sorry about that and the

662
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:03,080
first uh evaluation they basically

663
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,159
looked at denovo mutations and severe

664
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:07,200
disorders um where they're comparing

665
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:09,679
mutations and individuals with

666
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:12,080
developmental disorders Etc versus

667
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:15,440
unaffected controls and for bit this

668
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:18,559
particular case you see um models like

669
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,159
pop Eva really shine which is awesome

670
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:21,600
you know we should just go home we

671
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,919
solved everything let's not look at

672
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:26,559
anything else we're the winners clap

673
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:29,039
please clap Okay no Okay so now we're

674
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:32,440
going to look at some other evaluation

675
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:34,600
um because you know this is science and

676
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:36,600
we need to not basically Champion our

677
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:39,760
own methods we need to say okay what

678
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:41,919
methods globally would be good um for

679
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:44,159
different questions so for this next

680
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:46,720
question they're looking at very rare

681
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,159
variance in psychiatric conditions where

682
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,480
you can kind of I didn't mention this

683
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,840
sorry but you can kind of think as I go

684
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,360
across here you can kind of think of

685
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,880
this as a spectrum whereas on the left

686
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:57,679
you might have things that are under the

687
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:59,440
highest constraints such as denovo

688
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:00,960
variant so if you recall back to my

689
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,640
beginning of the presentation when I had

690
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,559
that Spectrum so the ones all the way on

691
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:07,440
the left would be like variants that

692
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:10,360
under the strongest selection they're

693
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,360
not going to occur very often um so pop

694
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:13,720
Eve is very good at picking those up but

695
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,519
for the next one we might think of these

696
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:17,720
as being under moderate selection

697
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:20,480
potentially we see other models

698
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:24,159
potentially really shining at

699
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:27,039
this um and I suppose you could read the

700
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:29,360
paper to get more of an expose as to why

701
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,840
some of these underlying training datas

702
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:34,519
uh and model architectures are

703
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:37,080
particularly well suited for picking up

704
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:41,039
um uh signal from these different

705
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:43,039
variant classes called genetics gym um

706
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:45,000
so in this next one they're looking at

707
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:47,159
common disease variants which are under

708
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,919
weaker selection and they're looking at

709
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:51,559
rare and common variants associated with

710
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:55,760
v various phenotypes different biobank

711
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:57,919
datas like UK biobank engin

712
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:00,760
Etc and in this last one they're looking

713
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:04,039
at at F map variants so they're looking

714
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:06,399
at population genetics validation data

715
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:10,320
uh using newly observed variants and the

716
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:12,519
new Nomad V4 data but not in earlier

717
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,519
versions of nomad to independently

718
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:17,760
assess both Gene level and variant level

719
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:18,840
prediction of performance um maybe I

720
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,200
should have had that at the beginning

721
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:23,720
but anyway so that's the selection

722
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:26,120
pressure so what you can see here is um

723
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:29,760
these tasks you can kind of conceptually

724
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:31,880
think about them as being more or less

725
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:34,840
um having more or less selection

726
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:37,640
pressure and we can see very nicely here

727
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:40,519
that different models some of them look

728
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:42,919
like rock stars in the beginning um some

729
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:47,720
of them look like rock stars at the end

730
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:49,360
it's really uh um up to us like as um

731
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,360
computationalists who want to use these

732
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,720
tools build these tools to think

733
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:55,880
critically about what the underlying

734
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:58,600
data is and not blindly jump on the hype

735
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:01,000
train of new model I wonder if this is

736
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:03,440
going to give me the answer like no

737
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,120
consider them all think about it look

738
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:08,000
for really well done guideline studies

739
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:10,120
such as this to kind of give you some

740
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,080
bearings of how to like interact with

741
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:15,200
the models in these fi in this

742
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:17,240
field um so this is something I'm

743
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,720
working on my PhD don't read all this

744
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:21,120
sorry I should have done an animation

745
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,799
but basically well you can now say okay

746
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,840
what about unsupervise non-coding

747
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:26,679
variant effect prediction I talked a lot

748
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:28,600
about proteins what about non-coding

749
00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:32,320
variant effect prediction so this is

750
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:35,039
like a big mess um but people are trying

751
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:37,320
to get out this question we've seen like

752
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:39,960
this year small conference papers such

753
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:42,639
as uh Bend um which one of my

754
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:45,200
collaborators wrote where they basically

755
00:31:42,639 --> 00:31:46,760
took all these different some of these

756
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:50,559
different models you see her on the

757
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:52,279
right um that are allegedly training on

758
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:54,639
um non-coding information in an

759
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:58,919
unsupervised way and they're subjecting

760
00:31:54,639 --> 00:32:00,639
them to um a lot of different uh t tasks

761
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:04,399
but I highlighted in the red box here

762
00:32:00,639 --> 00:32:07,039
this variant effects task and you know

763
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:09,279
there is still a lot of room for

764
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:13,720
improvement on this task where the

765
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:17,480
variant effect here is going from you

766
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:20,960
know uh that beginning DNA sequence all

767
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:23,320
the way to the person with the the red

768
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:25,039
spots on their face so a lot of these

769
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:26,559
tasks also here on the left you can

770
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:30,360
think of them as like oh can I go from

771
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:33,519
sequence to to um you know RNA seek

772
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:35,760
expression can I go from sequence to uh

773
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:37,639
epigenetics like those are all kind of

774
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:40,000
those are good questions but you have to

775
00:32:37,639 --> 00:32:41,679
keep in mind uh we don't know always

776
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,039
like when we have a change in expression

777
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:47,360
if that's good or if that's bad it just

778
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:50,000
is so um there's very there's a lot of

779
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:53,799
room here for being able to go all the

780
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,679
way across um all the way across uh from

781
00:32:53,799 --> 00:32:58,399
uh you know molecular genomic

782
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:00,679
information to uh phenotypic information

783
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:04,159
inform um and you can check out I just

784
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:07,039
put a pre-print out um earlier uh I

785
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:09,080
don't know I think last week um on my

786
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:12,559
new model called La leave which is

787
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:15,360
basically trying uh uh to do this um

788
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:18,000
where essentially it uh trains on

789
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:22,240
promoter regions explicitly with uh

790
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:24,720
across Evolution and tandem with um uh

791
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:28,080
uh protein language model embeddings to

792
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:31,559
give you a prediction of uh the

793
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:33,039
delerious or pathogenic effect of indels

794
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:34,760
um and that's kind of all I'll talk

795
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:36,880
about here because it's kind of in the

796
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:39,279
weeds but you can check it out or ask me

797
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:42,240
about it afterwards but um not saying

798
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:44,200
this is solving the problem at all um

799
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:47,320
but it is like trying to get at that

800
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:51,159
question again of if we can do um you

801
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:54,000
know uh find mutations in our genetics

802
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:56,399
they go all the way a phenotype um in

803
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,080
the non-coding space so you want to

804
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:02,720
build a very effect prictor too how

805
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:05,080
Noble um so here is a commentary that we

806
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,399
just put out from the marks lab uh that

807
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:10,320
you can read I think it came out like

808
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:11,960
two or three days ago um on doing uh on

809
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,280
towards trustable use of machine

810
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:16,800
learning models a varant effects in the

811
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:20,159
clinic and this is a very important

812
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,599
piece of to read because you know it's

813
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:24,359
gonna highlight some of these questions

814
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:26,240
of like you give it model data and you

815
00:34:24,359 --> 00:34:28,480
ask it to Pi something it

816
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,800
will but like

817
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,599
maybe you should ask the question of

818
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:34,919
what is it training on and then is this

819
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:37,040
like relevant for what I'm interested in

820
00:34:34,919 --> 00:34:38,599
you have to ask these questions or else

821
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,560
you're you know you know you're blindly

822
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:43,200
trusting something and when it comes to

823
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,440
clinical uh clinical problems we can

824
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:48,000
blindly trust

825
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:49,879
nothing all right so thanks uh for your

826
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,960
time here's some

827
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:55,440
pictures um thanks to Harvard I think

828
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:57,320
Debbie's also associated with the broad

829
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:01,400
so thanks to the broad um and then

830
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:03,040
thanks to the NSF for funding me um and

831
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:05,240
yeah I'll take any questions if anyone

832
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,240
has

833
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,960
any thank you Courtney for an amazing

834
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:18,000
presentation uh please if anyone has a

835
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:21,160
question come on up to the

836
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,240
microphone do you think that the models

837
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:25,720
can eventually be able to understand

838
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:27,400
interactions between variants because if

839
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:30,560
a person has the dilar variant maybe

840
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:32,720
they have a a variant that compensates

841
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:35,880
and then it's doesn't affect them at all

842
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:37,680
that kind of thing love that question um

843
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:41,079
can they do it now I don't think so but

844
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:43,200
I think um I would like to believe that

845
00:35:41,079 --> 00:35:45,599
given the right training Paradigm they

846
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:47,839
could pick that out but I think it's

847
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:52,000
hard to have good validation data for

848
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:54,960
those questions um so that's my answer

849
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,640
but I think that is an amazing question

850
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,480
that I'm very interested in um because

851
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:01,400
because you could imagine like even some

852
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:04,520
of these protein language models that

853
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:07,960
are predicting clinical effects um even

854
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:09,640
such as flppy vinance whatever okay they

855
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:12,720
predict that this variance is H

856
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:14,160
potentially alterus or pathogenic maybe

857
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,000
it's not so bad if there's a

858
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:19,200
compensating variant in a promoter that

859
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,440
turns that Gene completely off so I

860
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,240
don't know I think those are that's very

861
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,040
important for like getting like a global

862
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:28,240
picture of variation in in the

863
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:29,720
individual but um I think that's the

864
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:32,560
question I'm trying to get at maybe with

865
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:36,119
my models by coupling uh promoter

866
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:38,119
regions with um uh the actual protein

867
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:40,079
embeddings is then you could actually

868
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:41,960
ask the model that question like I could

869
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:44,839
ask the model that question right now

870
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:47,200
today would I know if it's right oh I

871
00:36:44,839 --> 00:36:50,920
gotta find some good validation data so

872
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,920
that's a bit harder

873
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,599
yeah I know that there have been many

874
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:58,319
papers that have kind of set out when

875
00:36:56,599 --> 00:37:00,520
people are doing function assays what

876
00:36:58,319 --> 00:37:02,079
are the characteristics of those assays

877
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:05,319
that make them most amenable to

878
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:08,160
subsequent use in model building um do

879
00:37:05,319 --> 00:37:09,960
you have any particular uh favorite

880
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:12,800
traits for those of us who do design

881
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:14,520
functional assays um in terms of either

882
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,160
how the experiments are designed or how

883
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:19,960
they're reported that make them more

884
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:22,119
usable for your models um I guess for my

885
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:25,200
particular lens on like non-coding

886
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:28,560
variation I'm always looking for like an

887
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:31,240
endogenous editing because um I want to

888
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:33,440
see how that variant actually manifests

889
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:34,960
in the functions of the cell and I'm

890
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,599
always looking for things that are more

891
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:40,319
lended towards growth screens um where

892
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:42,400
you see the cell type growth change over

893
00:37:40,319 --> 00:37:44,760
time because I think that's a bit more

894
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:48,599
similar to what we might imagine as like

895
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:51,800
more of the organism level uh change so

896
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:53,880
for me when I think about like going all

897
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:57,280
the way across that Spectrum I want to

898
00:37:53,880 --> 00:38:00,359
see things that do that and I'm not as

899
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:02,280
um not that it's not useful but I'm not

900
00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:06,280
as interested in like these like

901
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:06,280
intermediate molecular

902
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:18,040
phenotypes oh another

903
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:20,960
one what is the what is the uh like

904
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:23,359
compute cost of running your

905
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:25,839
models well I mean I can't like just

906
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:29,480
tell you like

907
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:31,079
uh you give can give an estimate sure H

908
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:34,400
for pop Eve here's an estimate for we

909
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:36,520
needed like 500 more Eve models within a

910
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:39,640
short period of time and I think that we

911
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:42,599
spent $5,000 on like Google Cloud for

912
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:45,280
that but it can be upwards of like 20 to

913
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:46,599
30,000 if you're doing a lot of models

914
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,319
which is why we have some you know

915
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:52,480
industry people like ran a bunch of e

916
00:38:49,319 --> 00:38:54,280
models for us and they paid for it yeah

917
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,680
they did it wrong there's also I don't

918
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:58,920
know the answer to that because for my

919
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:01,560
models like at Harvard we have like a

920
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:03,960
really nice cluster they built so I have

921
