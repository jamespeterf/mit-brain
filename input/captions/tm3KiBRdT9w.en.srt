1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,639
as an engineer I want to generate a

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,639
positive impact in

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:11,360
[Music]

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,799
society the impact that I expect my

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,320
research to have is to contribute to the

6
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:17,400
fight against climate change and

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:20,000
accomplish significant reductions of the

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,600
concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,480
my research is pretty much a fight

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,480
against climate change what we're doing

11
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:28,760
is we're using biocatalysis we're which

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,560
is we're using an enzyme something that

13
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:34,440
allows us to trans form carbon dioxide

14
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:37,520
in flu gases into something useful which

15
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,360
in this case is calcium carbonate and so

16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,079
what we're doing is designing a process

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,280
that's able to transform that CO2 and

18
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,000
flu gases into something we can use for

19
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,520
something else like cement production

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,600
for example one of the greatest

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,320
challenges of our civilization is to try

22
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,320
to keep global warming under 1.5 celsi

23
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,239
deges right but the problem with that is

24
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:00,359
that current CO2 capturing technology is

25
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:03,000
very inefficient so climate change is a

26
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:05,280
complex issue and this is this just adds

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,720
like one more piece to the Mosaic of

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:12,860
solutions that we need

29
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,860
