2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:07,270
We think there's something
special about flying machines.

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:09,150
They're just so
difficult to build.

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,750
They have to be lightweight.

5
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,150
They have to be safe.

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:17,270
And they get us to places that
we couldn't otherwise get to.

7
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:19,310
You have to be able
to think big and not

8
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,260
get intimidated by your ideas.

9
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:24,340
Maybe it is crazy to
put someone on the moon.

10
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,350
But hey, we did that.

11
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:29,160
I'm working on sending
something to Mars

12
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,280
to pave the way for
humans to go to Mars.

13
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,040
I study multi-agent
reinforcement learning -

14
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,230
getting robots to work with
humans in the real world.

15
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,360
I'm researching entry
descent and landing

16
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,780
for planetary vehicles.

17
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,740
A neural network-based
visual crater detector.

18
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,560
We'll be using these
craters as landmarks

19
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,200
as we build up a map
internally on the spacecraft

20
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,450
as it figures out where it is.

21
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,270
My research focus
has been on aviation

22
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,895
and its environmental impacts.

23
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,870
When your research helps
inform public policy,

24
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,700
it's a big motivator.

25
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,610
When they're
finishing their PhD,

26
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,010
they know more
about their problem

27
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,420
than anybody else in the world.

28
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:16,350
It's really great to be able to
have so much control over what

29
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,830
you're learning and where you
take your research direction.

30
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:23,190
What's occurring right now in
aerospace is a Renaissance,

31
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:27,000
the amount of entrepreneurial
energy and excitement

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,220
is just palpable.

33
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,070
Graduate students pretty much
drive most of the research

34
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,232
into the department.

35
00:01:34,232 --> 00:01:36,190
We get some results and
then we say, all right,

36
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:39,180
let's go fly it on some drones.

37
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,020
If you're really into
entrepreneurship,

38
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:44,970
MIT has a lot of resources
for starting your own company.

39
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:48,870
If you want work at NASA, all
the recruiters come to MIT.

40
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:51,930
The faculty here are
extremely well connected

41
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:54,880
to what's going on in
the aerospace field,

42
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,290
both in the companies and
within the government.

43
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,360
If you're even at all
slightly concerned about,

44
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,860
I have no idea what
I want to study.

45
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,443
I think I want to
do propulsion, but I

46
00:02:03,443 --> 00:02:04,560
might care about robotics.

47
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,230
Or I want to do sustainability,
but I care about business.

48
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:07,770
Guess what?

49
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:10,620
All of those things
we do in AeroAstro.

50
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,750
You don't leave the
department to do that.

51
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,683
I'm interested in the
big science questions

52
00:02:14,683 --> 00:02:15,850
like, where do we come from?

53
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:16,642
Where are we going?

54
00:02:16,642 --> 00:02:17,820
What else is out there?

55
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,490
I'm very interested in
building spacecraft that work

56
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,160
on interplanetary missions.

57
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,660
I want to learn as much as I
can now about human spaceflight

58
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,420
and Mars and space
engineering so that I can help

59
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,450
push humans to Mars.

60
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:32,820
I work with people who
come from all backgrounds,

61
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:33,510
all disciplines.

62
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,310
My lab is very diverse.

63
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,060
There's a really great
sense of community.

64
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,960
And I think that the department
leadership puts a lot of effort

65
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,630
into you supporting
the student groups.

66
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,387
We have a group called AeroAfro.

67
00:02:44,387 --> 00:02:46,470
That's just a group of the
black graduate students

68
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,690
within the department.

69
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,660
They're not just
brilliant engineers

70
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:53,390
or aspiring astronauts
or amazing scientists.

71
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:56,870
They also care so much about
taking care of each other.

72
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:59,120
Every Friday, we get a
group together and go down

73
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,450
to the pub, talk, and destress.

74
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,610
I mean, you just have to
come here and find out

75
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:07,052
how special of a
place MIT really is.

76
00:03:07,052 --> 00:03:08,760
If you really want to
be at the forefront

77
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,880
and have impact
on real missions,

78
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,990
this is the right
place to do it.

79
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:16,310
We push the boundaries
of the possible here.

80
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:20,720
Where else can you say we
look ahead by looking up?

81
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,070
