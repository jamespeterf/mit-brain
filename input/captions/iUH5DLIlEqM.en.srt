1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:04,680
so I'm going to uh talk about some space

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,160
policy

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:09,800
issues um I I'm going to give you a

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:12,480
certain perspective on Space technology

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,759
from some different viewpoints and then

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,440
talk about the aeroastro department and

7
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:17,840
then talk about another issue which is

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,240
very important to me which the

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,160
demographic issues in the space

10
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,640
Enterprise and finally end it with two

11
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:26,359
different views of the

12
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,240
future so in terms of space policy

13
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:30,840
issues you know I I thought rather than

14
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,120
just hearing my perspective

15
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,760
uh what you I should let you know the

16
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,600
perspectives of some of our students

17
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:42,840
right so we we actually have a space

18
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:45,760
policy class that I uh co-teach with

19
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,920
Professor David Newman and so at the end

20
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,039
of that class we asked them to write a

21
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,120
set of papers on what they see as the

22
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,960
critical issues in space policy so so

23
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,480
this is the titles of their papers in

24
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,559
addition to that there's actually a

25
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,480
whole policy Club here and I asked them

26
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:03,559
so what do you see is the big issues in

27
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:06,600
space policy and they gave me two pages

28
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:08,560
of list right so that's good this is

29
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,560
what young people are seeing at some of

30
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,840
the issues uh in the space business and

31
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:16,759
I think what you can definitely say is

32
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,759
that there's just a lot of stuff going

33
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:24,680
on in space policy and space technology

34
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:27,640
it's a very Dynamic time driven both by

35
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:30,079
the rise of entrepreneurial space as in

36
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:32,040
you know what SpaceX is doing what blue

37
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,920
origin is doing and it's other companies

38
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,720
one web and so on also by the fact

39
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,520
there's now many many countries that are

40
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,079
in the space business it's no longer the

41
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,759
purview of just a few but there are many

42
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:45,320
countries that launch many countries

43
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:49,040
that build satellites and so

44
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:52,439
International um issues have grown

45
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:55,079
substantially so uh here you see the

46
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:57,759
list from the from let's first of all

47
00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:01,039
start with space policy class uh you

48
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:03,799
know one of the the issues for a space

49
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:06,600
policy is the fact that you know the

50
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:09,840
outer space treaty comes from the 60s

51
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:13,080
the outer space treaty which governs uh

52
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,319
international law in space you know was

53
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,160
was negotiated at a time when there were

54
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:18,720
really only two players in the space

55
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,160
business which was the Soviet Union and

56
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,599
the United States and it it reflects

57
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,280
that and you know many people myself

58
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:28,360
included think that the outer space

59
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,160
treaty needs to be updated but certainly

60
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,840
one of the things that come become very

61
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,040
current is the whole issue of liability

62
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,599
and claims in space you know if if

63
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,840
somebody's satellite hits something else

64
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,400
who actually is liable I mean what the

65
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,239
outer space treaty says is it's the

66
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,879
launching uh country uh but of course

67
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,400
satellites are now owned by many

68
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:49,640
different people different countries

69
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,480
different companies and so on so there

70
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:54,400
are issues there that need to be sorted

71
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:57,800
out another big issue is the whole Space

72
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,319
Traffic management um development you

73
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,239
know when you're when you're talking

74
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:02,959
about a very small number of of things

75
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:04,799
in space you can track them individually

76
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,400
and see if they're going to collide when

77
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:11,560
you're talking about you

78
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:15,519
know up north of 50,000 satellites

79
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:17,920
occupying a band of low earth orbit uh

80
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,159
now you get into serious Space Traffic

81
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,840
management policy issues who who is

82
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:25,400
responsible for informing you know

83
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,560
SpaceX are going to collide with

84
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:30,840
somebody else uh who is supposed to move

85
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,439
I mean all of these things need to be

86
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,400
you know sorted out I mean right now

87
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:37,519
what happens is you know they get a a

88
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,599
message from the from the space force

89
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,280
and they can choose to move or not right

90
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:44,519
I mean you know so it that's to be

91
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,640
sorted out uh the whole issue of space

92
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:50,680
sustainability has now become much more

93
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:52,640
cogent what does it mean to have a

94
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:55,120
sustainable space

95
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,319
environment uh especially as the number

96
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,560
of satellites goes up old orbital debris

97
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:01,480
goes

98
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,400
up what what does it mean to have the

99
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:06,200
sustainability environment go down into

100
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:08,200
the atmosphere so there are now people

101
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:11,879
talking about that and developing a

102
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:13,640
whole set of structures around it um

103
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:15,480
laser Communications is a particularly

104
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,880
interesting one it it turns out there

105
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:20,160
are rules about firing lasers

106
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:23,400
up um but there are no rules about

107
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,000
firing lasers down you you know so

108
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,600
there's a set of policies that need to

109
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,240
be developed there uh um of of you know

110
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,840
we we know there's going to be

111
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,520
commercial space stations so those

112
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:38,680
policies need to be developed for those

113
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:42,240
you know the both NASA and the space

114
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:44,800
force are talking about U nuclear

115
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,039
propulsion uh do the do the rules that

116
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,840
we apply to nuclear materials on the

117
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:52,240
earth still make sense to apply to

118
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:54,520
things up in space um I mean is that the

119
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,720
right way to do things or not I mean

120
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,240
there are people discussing those issues

121
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,120
so as you can see there's just lots and

122
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,199
lots and lots of space policy issues and

123
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:06,639
you see some of some of the uh questions

124
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:09,280
from the space policy club uh

125
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,520
International cooperation how how to

126
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,199
think about dealing with emerging space

127
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,280
powers like India and China where you

128
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:18,759
unlike with us companies you don't have

129
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:20,280
any ability to force them to do things

130
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:21,280
so you have to enter into agreements

131
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:25,560
with them

132
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:27,600
right um um how how does to take the

133
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,400
last one how do you balance Innovation

134
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,000
and regulation with a rapid rise of

135
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,880
price space companies you know too much

136
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,960
regulation will inhibit Innovation so

137
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,840
you don't want that on on the other hand

138
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,440
if you have no regulation then you get

139
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,960
actually what's happening right now

140
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,560
people are just putting up satellites

141
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,080
putting up satellites and there's no

142
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,280
fundamental controls on how much they

143
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,199
put up and where they put them up you

144
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:51,440
know it is true they have to get

145
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:54,199
licenses from the FCC and so on uh but

146
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,639
but that's about it right so oh I'll go

147
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:59,160
to the next one so here's some other

148
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,039
issues the balance of public sector

149
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:04,600
interest with the dominance of private

150
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,880
space companies um space becoming an

151
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,479
economic

152
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:10,319
Frontier uh how how should national

153
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,479
government subsidize or regulate the

154
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,319
private space industry these are all

155
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,080
from the students by the way saying this

156
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:19,599
this these are issues that they care

157
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,880
about um how does policy makers ensure

158
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:23,840
that commercialization of space does not

159
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:27,800
lead to environmental degradation like

160
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:29,960
we've seen on Earth um uh you see the

161
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,800
word sustainability come up there rep L

162
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,240
these students are concerned about these

163
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,720
issues how do we ensure that in the long

164
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,479
term we have something that's

165
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,960
sustainable what are the key

166
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,840
technological innovations that will

167
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,800
shape the future of space exploration

168
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,759
and policy next 20 years what are

169
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:50,400
policies that govern dual use

170
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:53,039
Technologies and you know some perceived

171
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,720
as an incre increasing militarization of

172
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:57,879
space how do we prevent What policies

173
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,360
can we adopt to prevent an arms race in

174
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:02,199
space um especially as different

175
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:05,280
countries are are maneuvering for

176
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:07,840
position there so lots and lots of space

177
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,800
policy issues uh there's no shortage of

178
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,560
opinions these things actually need to

179
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,840
be sorted out I said I thought I'd show

180
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,879
you this because this tells you what

181
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,520
these young people are actually uh

182
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:19,400
thinking

183
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:23,400
about now let me turn and give you a

184
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:25,639
couple of different perspectives um I

185
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,680
I'm currently the president of the aiaa

186
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:30,160
and because I'm the president I I see

187
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:33,120
some of the internal documents so the

188
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:37,479
aiaa has been developing a set of white

189
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:39,599
papers um for uh actually Aeronautics

190
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:41,199
what they call Aerospace R&D and and

191
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,120
space so I'm going to show show you

192
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:46,159
what's in the white papers for Aerospace

193
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,800
R&D and Aeronautics so these are the

194
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:53,800
things that the aiaa believes are the

195
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:57,360
the The Cutting Edge R&D um issues uh

196
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:59,520
across Aerospace digital twins autonomy

197
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,599
AI these things are going to make a huge

198
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,639
difference in the space business

199
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:06,680
additive manufacturing for for space

200
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,199
system engineering that's transformative

201
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:11,400
Quantum sensing human robot teaming this

202
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:14,759
is what they think is part of the future

203
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:16,319
for for uh space there's an equivalent

204
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:17,400
list for air but that I'm not going to

205
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,800
show you

206
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:23,639
that and then for the space domain as

207
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:25,759
opposed to R&D the fact there's many uh

208
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:27,639
simultaneously operating systems I mean

209
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,560
you can think of starlink you can think

210
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:32,120
of Kyper you can think of one web all

211
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:35,919
all operating to first order in the same

212
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:38,240
large space um there's the whole idea of

213
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:40,839
how do we get to routine operations with

214
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:44,200
these large complex regions of space the

215
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:46,600
emergence of an independent space sector

216
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,120
that is independent of the government

217
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:52,040
that's the point independent of the

218
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:53,800
government um obviously uh maturation of

219
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,640
commodity subsystems I think you might

220
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:58,240
say many of the Technologies in

221
00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:00,399
satellites are now Commodities actually

222
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,440
and digital management the fact there

223
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,800
fractionation of agency that's actually

224
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,560
implicit in the space policy still who

225
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,839
is the agency that that actually

226
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,079
authorizes everything to occur up there

227
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:12,200
at least from the US point of view the

228
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:13,600
answer is there is no one agency

229
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,640
different people authorize different

230
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:19,079
things right the emergence of potential

231
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,839
space conflicts and of course again

232
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:24,000
unsustainability of today's civilization

233
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:26,519
for uh the Earth's biosphere so this

234
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,000
whole issue of space sustainability uh

235
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:32,320
comes up again in that white paper

236
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,600
uh and and the these are the the areas

237
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:39,279
of space in the in the aiaa white paper

238
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:42,279
they call out Earth launch Leo out to

239
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:44,440
600 kilometers the moo to Geo uh

240
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:47,399
environment the CIS Luna space going

241
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:49,600
outside of Geo Luna surface and deep

242
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:51,959
space what's interesting about this list

243
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,920
is how much bigger it is than something

244
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:56,240
you might have seen even 10 years ago

245
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,800
it's because you know science is

246
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,160
expanding out there commercial interest

247
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,440
is expanding standing out there uh I

248
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:05,680
mean just just to take for example um

249
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,600
Luna if you just look at at least what

250
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,920
people say they're going to do in the

251
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,880
next four or five years there going to

252
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:14,120
be upwards of a hundred satellites going

253
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:17,079
around the Moon doing interesting things

254
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:19,200
science commercial stuff and so on right

255
00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:22,519
so it's

256
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,440
expanding and then I I thought I um I

257
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:26,440
would tell you give you some sense of

258
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,760
what space force is saying I I do

259
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,399
actually see some space force documents

260
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,519
and these are are all public documents

261
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,800
you can go find them yourself they're

262
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:37,639
saying what the what are the things that

263
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:40,920
interest them the great power

264
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:42,680
competition um the space force is very

265
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:45,040
interested in how to integrate with

266
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:47,160
commercial space Solutions as opposed to

267
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,760
doing everything themselves game

268
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:52,240
changers in space they've identified on

269
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:56,120
orbit servicing as a game Cher and

270
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,600
nuclear propulsion as a game changer um

271
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:00,240
obviously they need to know what's the

272
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,600
expanded space domain awareness is

273
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,399
um technology maturation and fielding

274
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,880
and again believe or not the space force

275
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:09,240
itself says sustainable space operations

276
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:13,440
is of interest to

277
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:15,760
them um the there's also a list you can

278
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,760
find of technologies that will enable

279
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,440
new capabilities in space what you'll

280
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,079
notice about this list is how similar it

281
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,639
is to the aiaa list what's going to

282
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:27,160
change the the nature of what's going to

283
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:29,279
occur in space autonomy trusted AI cyber

284
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:31,959
all of these things are happening for

285
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,760
ICS uh informetric Imaging Quantum

286
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:36,600
Communications there are lots of people

287
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:39,680
looking at those things now nuclear

288
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,320
propulsion and Power on orbit assembly

289
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,160
repair manufacturing and high energy

290
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:45,000
lasers and power beaming I mean these

291
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:47,120
are all technologies that over the next

292
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,399
number of years when they come to pass

293
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,839
will make a difference to what occurs in

294
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:53,760
the space

295
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:56,240
business so having given you those

296
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,800
perspectives uh I thought I'd now turn

297
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:03,279
and give you a perspective on what is

298
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:05,519
MIT aeroastro Department doing uh so the

299
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:08,200
Engineering Systems lab my colleague

300
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:10,120
Professor Deek is the head of that uh

301
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,800
there's work going on on space system

302
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:14,480
architectures to optimize uh system

303
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,519
designs I'll show you some of that we

304
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,880
have a human systems lab that's looking

305
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:22,120
at optimize human system Effectiveness

306
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:24,199
uh we have a space repulsion lab looking

307
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:26,360
at enhanced space propulsion

308
00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:28,120
astrodynamics lab I think Professor

309
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:31,519
Laris is going to come later and talk to

310
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,959
you about that and then a a a Labs uh

311
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,360
what they call the star lab that does

312
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,639
state-of-the-art laser Communications so

313
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,839
this this of course is not everything

314
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:43,079
that's going on in space but it's it's

315
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:43,079
where this department is actually

316
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,040
focused then I thought I'd just give you

317
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:48,480
a quick perspective of what my own

318
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,839
research group does because I'm going to

319
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,440
take this opportunity to talk about that

320
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:55,959
so uh we have students that are working

321
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,040
on different a aspects of space

322
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:59,639
architectures there and I'm going to

323
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:02,279
show you some of the results

324
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:05,000
uh the highight band with space

325
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:07,279
Communications um I I had a student that

326
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,079
took a look at what does it mean to

327
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,720
continuously produce satellites like

328
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:14,440
Space X does and how does that change

329
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:16,320
the nature of what you do we actually

330
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:20,480
are have another student who's taking a

331
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:23,040
look at uh the commercial space um

332
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,920
augment actually more integration policy

333
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,480
of space force and comparing it to what

334
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:30,560
the Air Force does uh we are actually

335
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,760
looking at the atmospheric impact of

336
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,600
large scale deorbiting if you think

337
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:38,279
about all the satellites that are going

338
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:40,760
up um you know the the current now rule

339
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:43,399
which the FCC imposed is they all have

340
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:45,560
to be deorbited in five years five years

341
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:47,760
after they finish operation not five

342
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,880
years from now uh but which means

343
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,440
they're all going to come back into the

344
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:55,079
Earth's atmosphere and you're talking

345
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:57,079
about if you sum them up I said tens of

346
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:59,600
thousands of satellites deorbiting into

347
00:13:57,079 --> 00:14:01,519
our atmosphere so what's the last SC

348
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:05,160
atmospheric impact of that I mean they

349
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:07,720
will demise about 60 km mainly aluminum

350
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:09,560
some lithium and deposit that into our

351
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,800
atmosphere and it turns out we've

352
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:15,079
actually done the calculations it's

353
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:16,560
sufficient mass that it will it's about

354
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:18,880
the same order as what comes in by

355
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,720
meteorites except meteorites are mainly

356
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,639
of course Stone carbon we're talking

357
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:26,360
about aluminum lithium now being

358
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:27,680
deposited into our atmosphere something

359
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,079
that we've never done before it's a

360
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,360
human race so it's the question is

361
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:35,680
what's the environmental impact of

362
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:37,759
that um we we I have another student

363
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,959
that looked at iterative manufacturing

364
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:43,000
system confidence combined with I Isam

365
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,680
in space servicing assembly and

366
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,800
manufacturing of have a student I'm

367
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:48,120
going to show you some of the results

368
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:52,680
looking at what value does on orbit

369
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:54,639
servicing provide uh Space Systems um

370
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:56,920
and what is utility most

371
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,680
impactful uh and we we took a look at

372
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:01,040
Luna Space Traffic management and we're

373
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:02,399
also looking at what can AI do for for

374
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,240
so you know there's a whole bunch of

375
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,839
students all working on a whole range of

376
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,440
issues associated with the exciting

377
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:10,600
things that are happening in

378
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:13,040
space so so this I'm going to show you

379
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:15,120
two sets of results so one is the

380
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,360
question of optimized communication

381
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,639
architectures with deep space missions

382
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,759
so you know right now of course um NASA

383
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,199
communicates with um deep space missions

384
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:29,240
through the deep space Network it's an

385
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:31,000
RF Network it's basically at capacity

386
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:34,199
and as more science Mission goes out how

387
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,399
do they actually get stuff back so we we

388
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:40,319
we looked at a whole range of different

389
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:42,480
architectures uh single a laser single

390
00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:44,720
ground station a Goldstone and a raid

391
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,880
ground station multiple

392
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,079
Goldstone ground station in Goldstone

393
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,800
Madrid and Cur putting something out of

394
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:56,319
The L4 point and putting a space-based

395
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:59,000
array at moo to then capture the laser

396
00:15:56,319 --> 00:16:02,040
links coming back from these deep space

397
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,319
satellites then down link to Earth by RF

398
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:06,240
the the trouble with laser Cal of course

399
00:16:04,319 --> 00:16:10,560
from a satellite around around say

400
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:12,759
Jupiter or around Saturn is you you know

401
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,440
weather the sigma if the sigma comes

402
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:16,839
back and it's cloudy over Goldstone you

403
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:18,360
won't get it right so you know how do

404
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:20,639
you deal with weather so that that's why

405
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:24,360
you might think of putting stuff out in

406
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:26,480
space and so not not maybe not

407
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:30,480
terrifically surprising we we actually

408
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:33,160
found that a uh a spacebase array

409
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:35,040
outperforms and data availability that

410
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:38,279
is if you if you have an array of

411
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:40,680
receivers in moo uh and then then down

412
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:44,079
Link in RF you can actually get very

413
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:47,639
high data Rel be well over 90% very high

414
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:50,279
data volumes because basically they can

415
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:52,040
always see the laser signal but not

416
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:53,360
surprisingly it's the most costly option

417
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:57,120
of the options we looked at it's the

418
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:59,399
most costly option um you know if what

419
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,440
if what you want to do is save money

420
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:03,399
then the least costly option is to put

421
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,839
something at Goldstone to put a laser

422
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:08,199
receiver at Goldstone and just but you

423
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:10,000
but you will end up actually not being

424
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:11,120
able to receive the signals some fair

425
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,240
amount of the

426
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:17,480
time now of course you could always tell

427
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:22,079
the the uh satellite to send again all

428
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:22,079
right once it can see but but you

429
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,760
know and then I'm going to talk to you

430
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:30,559
about the work we're doing on on orbit

431
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,600
refueling and reposition

432
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:35,760
so

433
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:38,960
um you know the the space force says it

434
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,840
is very interested in the whole issue of

435
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,679
of maneuvering in space and the and the

436
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:44,919
way they characterize it is maneuver

437
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:46,520
without regret because if you ask the

438
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:49,559
question why don't they maneuver a lot

439
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:51,039
of the satellites now it's because

440
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:53,919
there's only so much fuel on them and if

441
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:55,600
you maneuver the satellites then you you

442
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:59,240
basically reduce the lifetime of the

443
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,559
satellites right okay so that's reason

444
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:03,200
why they're interested in the question

445
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:06,919
of on orbit refueling and repositioning

446
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:08,960
and um you know that there is now a a

447
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:13,159
limited commercial capability North

448
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:15,039
grman offers in geosynchronous orbit to

449
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:17,240
actually uh they they don't actually

450
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:20,360
refuel geinger satellites they actually

451
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:22,520
attach another satellite with fuel on it

452
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:25,840
and then it allows it to maneuver to

453
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:28,200
Contin to maneuver past his uh lifetime

454
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,799
his nominal Lifetime and and the

455
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,640
Europeans have just announced that

456
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:34,840
they're going to be building an un orbit

457
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:36,760
refueling system with a robotic arm by

458
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:39,000
the way uh to go out to geosynchronous

459
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:40,400
orbit and potentially refuel and with

460
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,159
the robotic arm they can also think

461
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:46,480
about repairing right okay so we we we

462
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:49,559
took a look at the question

463
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:53,640
of when does it actually make sense to

464
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:55,240
refuel relative to uh the Alternatives

465
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:58,159
so the alternative of course is you

466
00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:00,559
launch a new satellite right that's the

467
00:18:58,159 --> 00:19:05,400
alternative right

468
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:08,400
um and so here we construct um uh trade

469
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:13,360
spaces where you have cost along the x

470
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:14,919
axis and the and utility along the Y AIS

471
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,640
uh and and basically everywhere you see

472
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:19,159
color is where it makes more sense to

473
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,400
actually do this right but but here's

474
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:24,120
where it really gets interesting is if

475
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:27,440
now you you compare it against um

476
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:30,200
altitude so we uh we're looking at

477
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:33,360
utility versus altitude you uh if you

478
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:35,400
have what they call a a an undemanding

479
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,480
case where you can basically put more

480
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,559
fuel on the satellite you're not

481
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:42,280
stressing the pay the payload is not so

482
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:44,960
large that it's stressing the system uh

483
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:47,120
then refueling makes sense of very low

484
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,559
altitudes and that's because the drag is

485
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,080
very high and if you want to keep it up

486
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,679
there you have to refuel it and it makes

487
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:55,280
a little bit of sense as you go all the

488
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:57,880
way out to geosynchronous altitude but

489
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,320
if you have a case which is payload Mass

490
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:01,520
demanding that is you want to put more

491
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:05,200
payload on and reduce the size of your

492
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:06,919
fuel tanks and maneuver a lot then as

493
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,280
you can see again refueling makes a

494
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:11,799
great deal of sense at low altitudes it

495
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,799
does not make sense at the Leo altitudes

496
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:15,640
because at Leo altitudes you can always

497
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:18,000
just put up another satellite relatively

498
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:19,919
quickly but at geosynchronous altitudes

499
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,880
it's much harder to do and so the

500
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:26,679
ability to do that gets gets

501
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:29,440
um uh not the ability but so the utility

502
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:32,400
of doing it gets much better as the

503
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,200
altitude goes up uh so we we intend to

504
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,799
push this out Beyond goo but this is

505
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,960
this is how far we've got and the

506
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:39,840
different curves on this is just showing

507
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:43,559
you know different launch systems Falcon

508
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,559
9 Falcon heavy and so on

509
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:48,559
right now let me turn to talk about

510
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,880
another issue which I think is really

511
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:55,440
important which is demographic issues so

512
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:59,480
so here is the the um demographics the

513
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:01,600
US population uh percentage of of of uh

514
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,200
of female persons you know white black

515
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,159
Hispanic so this so this is from the

516
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,360
July

517
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:11,360
2022 uh population estimate

518
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:17,360
right now let's look at

519
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:19,200
it uh now let's talk about uh the stem

520
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,400
Workforce especially in Aerospace so if

521
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:25,279
you look at the the stem Workforce some

522
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:27,720
uh something of the order of which is 36

523
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:29,039
million people this is again from this s

524
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:34,039
uh this is NSL

525
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:35,880
data um 78% of people in the work that

526
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:38,200
this Workforce have a bachelor's degree

527
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:39,600
so so basically the argument is if

528
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,520
you're going to be in the stem Workforce

529
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:44,279
you need a bachelor's degree it's not to

530
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:46,679
say there isn't room for people in stem

531
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:48,640
Workforce don't have but most people

532
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:50,200
have a bachelor's degree so what it

533
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,640
means is you got to look at the

534
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:56,159
educational pipeline

535
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:59,840
now so this is from aiaa it should be

536
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:05,200
AIA a industry report survey and they

537
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:08,600
surveyed um um 850,000

538
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:13,679
employees counting everybody that that

539
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:16,000
says they're in Aerospace right okay um

540
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:18,640
and what do you see by contrast to the

541
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,360
what the Census Data I showed you is the

542
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,799
percentage of women in the Aerospace

543
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:26,960
business is quarter

544
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:30,279
25% percentage of African-Americans or a

545
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:34,120
10% um the point is it's very different

546
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:34,120
from the GL Census Data I showed

547
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:42,279
you now let's look at the educational

548
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:45,679
pipeline so this this is from uh Adare

549
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:47,960
is the Aerospace Department's um

550
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,799
Aerospace Department's chairs

551
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:53,840
Association

552
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:58,200
um so th this is data goes up through

553
00:22:53,840 --> 00:23:00,600
2022 and it shows you across uh the

554
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:03,200
people responded to this with 60 60

555
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:07,760
different schools with departments in

556
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:09,400
aerospace engineering okay uh um um what

557
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:14,120
what do you see you see the percentage

558
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:17,520
of women uh across those years is is it

559
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:19,200
the undergraduate level you know a bit

560
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,559
less than

561
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,240
20% uh and underrepresented minorities

562
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,039
goes up and down but it's you know again

563
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,360
about

564
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:30,000
20% the point I want to make is this is

565
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:32,200
very different from the Census spir data

566
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,480
um and it's even different from from the

567
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:38,559
the big uh survey across all of

568
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:42,840
Aerospace so so this pipeline is just

569
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:45,200
not producing enough people you know to

570
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:46,640
uh you know help the Aerospace is

571
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,960
industry actually

572
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:53,000
Chang here's now the data for graduate

573
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:56,679
programs through

574
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:59,720
2022 uh the both foreign students uh you

575
00:23:56,679 --> 00:24:03,200
can see is the order of

576
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:07,000
30% uh women which actually went up

577
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:10,000
quite dramatically from 2020 to 2022 and

578
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,360
then underrepresented minorities right

579
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,840
so if if if you're looking for the

580
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:16,799
demographics of Aerospace to change this

581
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:19,440
data does not support the notion that

582
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:20,640
it's changing and I the reason I'm

583
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,440
showing to you is I think it's an

584
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,919
important issue for the Aerospace

585
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,799
business uh this just goes back a bit

586
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:31,799
further uh both ethnicity and gender

587
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:34,520
Trends back to 2010 and you can see the

588
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:36,159
C the curves are basically flat so there

589
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:38,279
there's not very much progress that's

590
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:41,960
happening in the Aerospace

591
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:44,520
field just to give you the contrast uh

592
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:47,840
this is from the aeroastro class of

593
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:50,120
2019 you know we here at MIT we do

594
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:53,360
somewhat better a higher percentage of

595
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:54,799
women higher percentage of minorities um

596
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:59,919
not so much better The Graduate students

597
00:24:54,799 --> 00:25:02,080
but the undergraduate level um

598
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:03,720
so let me just end by saying you know

599
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,840
I've talked to you about space policy

600
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:08,840
issues I've talked to you about some

601
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:12,360
technology issues uh I've talked to you

602
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:14,399
about some of the demographic issues uh

603
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:16,279
you know I I think this in the space

604
00:25:14,399 --> 00:25:19,320
business this is my take it's of course

605
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:21,559
we can we can debate this uh there a

606
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:25,840
tale of two

607
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:27,520
Futures uh so the pessimistic view is

608
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,880
there's an imbalance of governance and

609
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,880
freedom we either have have too much

610
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:35,640
regulation or too little regulation and

611
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:37,039
in the pessimistic view uh space debris

612
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:40,399
would continue to increase it's

613
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:43,600
increasing right now but it it continues

614
00:25:40,399 --> 00:25:46,600
to increase we don't develop any rules

615
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:49,120
of the road or or there's no

616
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:51,760
standardization um there aren't enough

617
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,080
rules of the road there may be active

618
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,640
warfare in

619
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:58,320
space uh there's there are large scale

620
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:00,320
environmental effects both low orop and

621
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:04,240
down into our

622
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:06,440
atmosphere uh ISM Technologies which are

623
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,080
underdevelopment or immature maybe

624
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,720
having Aeris using and there's a cooling

625
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:12,559
off of space interest I mean certainly

626
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,919
if we get to the point where the low

627
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:15,320
orbit environment is full of space

628
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,840
debris there'll be a cooling off of

629
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:18,880
space interest because the satellites

630
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:21,399
will get

631
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:24,600
destroyed that's the pessimistic

632
00:26:21,399 --> 00:26:26,360
view here's the optimistic view where

633
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:29,080
there's a healthy balance of governance

634
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:32,679
and freedom and you know where where

635
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:35,520
there's enough regulation to keep things

636
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:40,080
in control but not so much as to uh

637
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:42,000
inhibit Innovation so uh those rules of

638
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:45,399
the road that are established not just

639
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:48,520
for us companies but for us companies

640
00:26:45,399 --> 00:26:51,080
and with other countries like China and

641
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:54,720
India rules of the road are established

642
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:56,840
that are agreed to standardization is is

643
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,760
established in order to actually refuel

644
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:01,640
a satellites you actually need to

645
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:03,240
standardize the refueling um because

646
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:05,559
there's no point in developing a

647
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:07,000
refueler if it can't actually go up and

648
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:10,320
refuel the satellite because it can't

649
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:13,919
connect to it right um there's

650
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:16,640
widespread Commerce uh maybe with space

651
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:20,080
stations uh certainly with respect to

652
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:22,320
all the internet in the sky um that you

653
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:25,080
know SpaceX is developing and Kyper is

654
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:27,159
developing we we have figured out how to

655
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:32,039
extinguish space

656
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:35,720
debris you know what is the case is that

657
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:38,480
some uh you know NASA now says they have

658
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:40,799
now establish an office of space

659
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:43,760
sustainability and they they say that

660
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:45,440
one of the things they will do is is

661
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,000
understand what are the Technologies we

662
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,000
need to develop to get rid of space

663
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,840
debris I

664
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,679
mean you actually have to probably go up

665
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:54,279
and grab it and push it into the

666
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:55,840
atmosphere or do something else with it

667
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:59,080
but you just can't leave it up there

668
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:01,600
right uh the Japanese government is also

669
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:04,120
funding astroscale to do some work on

670
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,559
Space debris and astroscale has a system

671
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:07,519
up there right now where they've already

672
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:09,159
shown they can find Space debris and

673
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,519
then the I think the next mission

674
00:28:09,159 --> 00:28:12,360
they're going to try to actually grab

675
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:14,519
some and deorbit

676
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:17,000
it uh we have mitigated the

677
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:19,240
environmental impact of all of these

678
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,399
satellites coming back into the

679
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:23,240
atmosphere uh either we show that

680
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:25,440
there's no impact which actually is not

681
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:27,320
very likely I I'm pretty sure we can

682
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,440
show there is some impact but we we

683
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:32,159
understand what it is and we've

684
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:35,159
mitigated it uh we now use Isam

685
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:37,120
Technologies in space servicing assembly

686
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:40,200
manufacturing for benefit we we

687
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:41,960
manufacture things in space we assemble

688
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:46,000
things in space you know

689
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:48,760
robotically um and we we we that extends

690
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,679
out to lunar orbit and it extends out to

691
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:53,840
beyond that and we've developed nuclear

692
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:58,279
propulsion and nuclear propulsion will

693
00:28:53,840 --> 00:29:00,440
allow us to get human beings to Mars you

694
00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:03,200
know in time scales are not measured in

695
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:05,720
years but get human beings there and get

696
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,120
people back if that's the optimistic

697
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,480
future if we can do all of that stuff

698
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,000
you'll see a different future than the

699
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:13,039
pessimistic

700
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,559
one so I you could probably tell I

701
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:17,360
sincerely hope this is where we're going

702
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:20,240
but there are there's there also

703
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:22,360
indications of you know the the

704
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,679
pessimistic future being there and so

705
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:26,600
you know I think we're not so much a

706
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:29,360
Tipping Point this very moment but over

707
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:32,480
the next several years uh you know we're

708
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:35,760
going to move in either one direction or

709
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:38,679
another so with that my key takeaways

710
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:41,519
are um first of all this is why I showed

711
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:43,240
you the the demographic data we need a

712
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:47,720
diversity of people in the Aerospace

713
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:49,320
business Empower to implement change uh

714
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:51,600
uh and an atmosphere to make it a

715
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:55,840
reality the Aerospace business has to be

716
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:59,279
open to all the capable men and women

717
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:01,320
who want to be in it we need to do that

718
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:04,039
this is something that's important for

719
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:06,039
us as a department and it's important I

720
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:08,240
I'm going to argue for the Aerospace

721
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:11,000
business that there needs to be the

722
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,720
development of a balance of government

723
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,039
governance and policy so this is some

724
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:18,960
combination both what the US government

725
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:21,919
does other governments do the UN does um

726
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,720
what the commercial companies agree to

727
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:26,600
uh I'm talking about the spacex's and

728
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:28,320
the blue origins of the world uh there

729
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:31,880
needs to be a balance of governs polic

730
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:33,360
but also the in Freedom uh in space is

731
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:36,200
is essential because we need to have

732
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:39,240
Innovation there uh and all that must be

733
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:41,120
evolved by both education and actions I

734
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:43,360
mean it's important that everybody

735
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:46,080
understand what needs to be done

736
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,919
there uh space domain and space

737
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:50,000
technology has changed you know some of

738
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:53,120
the Technologies I showed you at least

739
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,880
in words will will lead to dramatic

740
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,279
changes in the space Enterprise I mean

741
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:59,960
think of all that you can actually do

742
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:03,399
with serious nuclear propulsion I think

743
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:05,120
all you can do with serious uh inspace

744
00:31:03,399 --> 00:31:07,760
servicing and repairing and

745
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:10,240
repositioning and assembly and

746
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:12,120
Manufacturing uh think of all you can

747
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:15,279
actually do with with uh laser

748
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:19,080
Communications up there so things are

749
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:21,279
changing rapidly uh and our governance

750
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:23,360
and policy has to actually keep up with

751
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,960
that actually I would say right now

752
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:27,399
they're changing faster than governance

753
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,039
and policy keeping up with that uh which

754
00:31:27,399 --> 00:31:30,480
is why you see people just putting stuff

755
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:33,240
up there and seeing what actually

756
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:35,639
happens and and you know space research

757
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:37,360
which is one of the things we do here uh

758
00:31:35,639 --> 00:31:39,960
within Academia with industry and

759
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:43,200
government entities remain is vital in

760
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:45,039
informing the space policy uh that

761
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,720
that's why I showed you initially you

762
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:49,919
know what these students here are are

763
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:51,240
concerned about when they look at all

764
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:54,440
that's happening in space they're

765
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:56,840
concerned about issues of of both the

766
00:31:54,440 --> 00:32:00,039
the rapid spread of Technology but also

767
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:02,279
sustainability so uh it's it's important

768
00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:05,080
that we look seriously at those issues

769
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:10,639
um so that we have an optimistic

770
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:14,030
future I think that's my last slide yeah

771
00:32:10,639 --> 00:32:18,600
okay so with that let me

772
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:21,080
[Applause]

773
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:23,399
stop and's see where we got any

774
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:25,120
questions uh we we will take a few

775
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:28,519
questions from the audience we don't

776
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:30,120
have a Kion Hall in this track so

777
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:32,960
if you have any question please raise

778
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:36,880
your hand I will pass along the

779
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,880
mic oh there's a question over

780
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:44,279
there thanks Dan Ron Spangler from

781
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:47,880
corporate relations we know that Artemis

782
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:51,480
3 relies on the Starship human Landing

783
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:54,440
system to land people on the moon 2026

784
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:56,320
whenever all of the things it has to do

785
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:59,480
have been more or less demonstrated

786
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:02,360
except the large scale transfer very

787
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:05,000
quickly of massive amounts of cryogenic

788
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:08,399
liquid on orbit what's your view on that

789
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:10,679
is it realistic oh that's a good

790
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:11,760
question I have a whole set of views

791
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:14,760
about

792
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,760
timus

793
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:22,720
um so I'm not entirely sanguin that

794
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:27,559
everything's going to happen by 2026

795
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:30,919
first of all right okay uh secondly you

796
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:33,320
know you're right the so what's the

797
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:34,320
experience with transferring propellants

798
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:37,600
in

799
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:39,960
space uh that's been propelled and

800
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:42,080
transferred on the station I believe

801
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:44,240
there was there was a experiment called

802
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:46,760
orbital Express that took two robotic

803
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:49,480
vehicles and transfer propellants right

804
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:53,120
but but the answer is it's not very

805
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:55,120
much and we're talking about a lot of

806
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:58,360
propellant that has to be TR it's

807
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:01,000
actually worse than that uh because one

808
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:05,080
of the issues with that is cryogenic

809
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:06,360
boil off so if you know there's a whole

810
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:08,720
they have to do a whole set of these

811
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:10,399
missions and if they get delayed then

812
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,240
what will happen is they'll be losing

813
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:13,679
the cryogens faster than they're putting

814
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:17,320
stuff on there and then they will not

815
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:19,240
have enough fuel to get there so uh it

816
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:21,599
what can you say it's a high-risk

817
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:23,480
Venture right but of course SpaceX is

818
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:26,040
demonstrated highrisk Ventures as well

819
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:28,919
right so

820
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:30,359
um but that's the reason why I'm less

821
00:34:28,919 --> 00:34:31,679
sanguine that we're going to do

822
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:34,720
something by

823
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:36,159
2026 you know to get actually back to

824
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:40,599
the Moon I mean now there are other

825
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:43,480
issues with timus right the NASA uh

826
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:45,000
Inspector General has pointed out the

827
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:46,879
basically if you want to run an

828
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,960
efficient rocket service and launching

829
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:51,720
once a year is not the way you do it you

830
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:53,760
you do it by launching a lot you do it

831
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:57,839
about the do way the space ex so that

832
00:34:53,760 --> 00:35:00,720
that's another issue with space loan uh

833
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:03,720
LS you know don't get me

834
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,720
started

835
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:12,960
yeah follow what you just said um in the

836
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:15,839
commercial space particularly for

837
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:19,599
communications um starling's cleaning

838
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:22,800
up uh there's the real possibility that

839
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:26,680
from a commercial perspective the GEOS

840
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:28,520
have no Market left over the medium term

841
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:30,440
just as a hypothetic

842
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:32,400
what do you expect the mix to look like

843
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:34,720
long run do the Leos just come to

844
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:37,079
completely dominate because their launch

845
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:40,200
cost costs per gigabit per second

846
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:43,760
ability to reposition orbits gives them

847
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:46,400
a multifaceted commercial

848
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:50,240
Advantage uh actually I I do think

849
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:54,240
that's quite possible

850
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:58,520
um yeah I mean once you have a a

851
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:59,359
robust um internet um connection ction

852
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,520
you know

853
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:03,599
Leo uh I mean you can pass lots of

854
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:06,599
things through it you can replace Direct

855
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:09,520
TV for example right uh you can replace

856
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:10,800
the geom so the answer is sure no

857
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:14,040
actually I do I think that's quite

858
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:16,319
possible now now having said that I I

859
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:17,640
myself if if you actually look at how

860
00:36:16,319 --> 00:36:21,960
many companies have said they're going

861
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:26,359
to do you know internet in the sky right

862
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:28,560
certainly SpaceX has right now got the

863
00:36:26,359 --> 00:36:30,319
um

864
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,560
you know put most of the satellites out

865
00:36:30,319 --> 00:36:34,480
but you know Kyper is starting to launch

866
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,440
those satellites W Weare satellites

867
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,720
there's actually another set of

868
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:40,319
companies that say they're going to do

869
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:43,079
that um I I personally don't I'm not

870
00:36:40,319 --> 00:36:46,040
sure I believe that that I think the

871
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:48,520
total is actually six that six companies

872
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:51,200
are going to survive doing that I mean

873
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:54,640
some of them are going to not survive

874
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:56,079
right um I mean what of course SpaceX

875
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:58,319
and Kyo have the advantage of being

876
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:00,440
backed by billionaires right

877
00:36:58,319 --> 00:37:06,079
right so so the answer is I I actually

878
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:09,400
agree with you that I think geoc coms

879
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:10,680
um will be hard to compete with those

880
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,440
but I just don't think that you're going

881
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:15,440
to see all of the Leo based systems

882
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:15,440
survive in

883
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:28,720
the yes that's my m just be clear it's

884
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,720
my personal opinion right

885
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:37,160
okay uh we will take one more uh

886
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:37,160
question from the audience any

887
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,720
question okay thank you Professor okay
