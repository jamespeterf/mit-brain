00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:06,720
So hello everyone and welcome to MIT

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,400
Startup Exchange demo day. Thank you for

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,679
joining whether it's your first time or

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:14,160
you're back with us once again.

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:17,440
I'm Ariadna Rodenstein, program manager

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,279
with MIT Startup Exchange and shortly

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,640
you will hear from eight startups. I'm

8
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,080
excited that we're all going to be

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,880
learning about their innovative and

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,279
nimble technologies very varied and I'll

11
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,640
get into those areas in a moment. But

12
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,679
first, I'd like to share a brief

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,160
overview of our program.

14
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,239
So MIT startup exchange was created to

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,079
support MIT connected startups as they

16
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,000
grow, expand, and solve some of the

17
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,760
world's greatest challenges. And we do

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
this by fostering partnerships and

19
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,079
collaborations between the startups and

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,640
industry, primarily members of the

21
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,320
industrial leazison program or ILP

22
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,239
represented by so many of you joining us

23
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,280
today, but also the MIT innovation

24
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,879
ecosystem and beyond.

25
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,879
The startups in our program have a

26
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,039
strong connection to the institute. They

27
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:03,520
may be based on MIT licensed technology

28
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,920
or founded by MIT staff, faculty or

29
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,400
alumni. They may also be vetted by some

30
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:12,400
of our MIT peers including the engine,

31
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,400
start nano or cel startup connect plus.

32
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,200
We have around a thousand startups in

33
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,280
the program and they usually join at

34
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,920
pilot stage or beyond and they may

35
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,920
represent any sector and any geography.

36
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,000
Here you can see some of the trending

37
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,040
solutions and the trending technologies

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,119
of MIT startups and those involved are

39
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,960
those represented by the startups here

40
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,880
today. Of course we start with AI and

41
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,759
ML, big data and analytics,

42
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:41,520
sustainability, renewable energy and

43
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:43,600
materials, robotics, IoT and sensing and

44
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,840
healthcare.

45
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,159
So when it comes to value, everything

46
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,320
that we do is to support the exposure of

47
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,720
startups and connections to industry.

48
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,560
And we do this in a variety of ways,

49
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,320
which is a customized approach. And so I

50
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,960
hope that everyone can take advantage of

51
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,040
these benefits that are listed here. For

52
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,280
example, we launch calls for startups.

53
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,119
We call these opportunities.

54
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,600
And they're based on a corporate's

55
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:10,239
priorities and internal challenges. And

56
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,239
so startups can apply on our website and

57
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,560
if selected they can work with you as an

58
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,040
ILP member to help you with a problem

59
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,120
that you may be facing in your industry.

60
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,680
We also host one-on-one meetings, demo

61
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,760
days like today, other events like

62
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,440
webinars, conferences locally and

63
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,120
internationally and they have the

64
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,599
component of startup lightning talks and

65
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,520
an exhibit. We also host workshops and

66
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:34,480
trainings sometimes in conjunction with

67
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:37,120
our MIT peers.

68
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,959
And so what is emote? It's a virtual

69
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,959
forum to facilitate these corporate

70
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,720
interactions with industry ready

71
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,720
startups

72
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,800
and the goal is to explore potential

73
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,280
collaborations and partnerships but also

74
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,800
especially to do it sooner rather than

75
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,680
later. This way you can get to know more

76
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,000
of the startups that join our program.

77
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,760
The format today will be eight startups

78
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
presenting for four minutes followed by

79
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,000
two minutes of Q&A and then we're going

80
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,840
to move right on to breakout room so

81
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,959
that you can learn more and engage with

82
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,200
the startups further. For the Q&A part,

83
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,360
I ask that you either use the Q&A tab at

84
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,360
the bottom of your screen, indicate the

85
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,920
startup that the question is for. You

86
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,120
can also upvote questions, but also if

87
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,519
you feel more comfortable, you can

88
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,159
engage via the chat. You can post the

89
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,680
questions there. You can um directly

90
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,400
communicate with the startups, exchange

91
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,400
information, etc.

92
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,400
And as always, reach out to us if you

93
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,799
need help connecting with the startups

94
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:36,720
through our program or of course via the

95
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:39,040
your ILP program director. So with that,

96
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,280
a couple of reminders. The startup

97
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,120
presentations are being recorded and

98
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,920
also at the end of the event, you'll get

99
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,159
a brief pop-up survey on your screen. So

100
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:52,560
please help us with your feedback. So

101
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,560
now let's hear from the startups.
