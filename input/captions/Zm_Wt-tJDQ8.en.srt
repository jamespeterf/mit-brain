1
00:00:10,637 --> 00:00:13,220
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:16,025 --> 00:00:18,704
(music ending)

3
00:00:18,704 --> 00:00:20,700
- All right, it looks
like we've got a quorum.

4
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,160
Welcome everyone to today's seminar.

5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,770
I'm Craig Keast from
MIT Lincoln Laboratory,

6
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:29,430
and I'm actually happy
to introduce our speaker,

7
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:32,010
Sam Karlson, who is going to be telling us

8
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:33,660
about the work he and his teammates

9
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,630
have been doing on
using nitrogen vacancies

10
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,363
in diamond for magnetic imaging.

11
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,840
Sam, who's originally
from Denver, Colorado,

12
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,470
is a second lieutenant in
the United States Air Force

13
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:49,830
and also a master's student
in the nuclear science

14
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:51,843
and engineering department at MIT.

15
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,660
He holds a military fellowship out here

16
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,190
at Lincoln Laboratory where he is working

17
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,900
with our quantum information

18
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,450
and integrated Nanosystems group.

19
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,940
Sam received his BS in physics

20
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,760
from the United States Air Force Academy,

21
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,760
and he joined the MIT
family in the fall of 2022.

22
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,890
So I'd like to introduce Sam.

23
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,230
I will ask all the folks participating

24
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:19,530
to hold their questions until the end,

25
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,360
and we'll do the Q&A session

26
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,620
and you can either raise your hand

27
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,240
or write something in the chat,

28
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,360
and we'll make sure to
answer those questions.

29
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,183
So with that intro, Sam,
the screen is yours.

30
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,110
- Thank you, Craig, for that introduction.

31
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,270
As was mentioned, I'm a second lieutenant

32
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:37,200
in the United States Air Force

33
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,200
and I'm currently a
master's student here at MIT

34
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,500
in the Nuclear Science and
Engineering department.

35
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,220
And as Craig mentioned,
I am specifically working

36
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,460
at Lincoln Laboratory in
the quantum sensing team

37
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,133
with a focus on nitrogen
vacancy centers in diamond.

38
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,680
And in particular, my project specifically

39
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,680
focused on wide field magnetic imaging.

40
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,750
There are numerous applications

41
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,900
for wide field magnetic
imaging in a variety of fields

42
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,590
including biology, geology,
and material science.

43
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,080
Just a few mentioned that
I'm gonna mention here

44
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,820
include efforts to image neurons

45
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,670
and immuno magnetically labeled cells.

46
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,940
There are applications
for failure analysis

47
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,740
for integrated circuits,

48
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,590
as well as studying
the magnetic properties

49
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,900
of superconductivity in detail,

50
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,453
looking at vortices and their dynamics.

51
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,680
Magnetic imaging can also
be used in geophysics

52
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,940
to characterize remnant
magnetization in geological samples.

53
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,830
And there have been
demonstrations of magnetic imaging

54
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:44,187
for 2D magnetic materials
looking at magnetic (indistinct).

55
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,410
Nitrogen vacancy centers are created

56
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,260
by replacing a carbon with a nitrogen atom

57
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,440
and removing an adjacent carbon
atom in the diamond lattice.

58
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,200
These solid state systems are advantageous

59
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,520
over other quantum sensors,

60
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,620
because they operate at room temperatures

61
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,843
and do not require cryo cooling.

62
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,660
NV centers have stable energy levels

63
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,283
suitable for quantum control.

64
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,540
The ground state for this
system is a spin triplet state.

65
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,060
A green laser excites the system,

66
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,790
a non-radiating decay
pathway, preferentially

67
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:26,880
repopulates the MS equals zero state,

68
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,380
which enables initialization
of the quantum state.

69
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,240
And one of the advantages
of these quantum systems

70
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,090
is that measurements are
tied to physical constants,

71
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,590
which reduces the need,

72
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:40,390
which reduces uncertainty and
the need for calibrations.

73
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,680
In addition, as solid state sensors,

74
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,560
the NV centers are fixed in the lattice,

75
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,420
and that is especially important,

76
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,240
because it enables
spatially resolved imaging.

77
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,610
And in addition, the fixed orientation

78
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:58,740
of the NV centers in the lattice

79
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:02,460
makes NV diamonds native vector sensors.

80
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,440
So by addressing the different
orientations in the lattice,

81
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,930
you can create the full magnetic vector,

82
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:09,063
recreate and discover that.

83
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,880
The nitrogen vacancy center
becomes a magnetic sensor

84
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,090
when a resident microwave
field is applied to the system

85
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:21,390
which transfers population
to the MS = 1 state.

86
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,910
Since more population
is in the MS = 1 state,

87
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:26,010
fewer optical photons are emitted

88
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,330
as they return to the ground state

89
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:30,120
through the non-radiating decay pathway.

90
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,060
A static magnetic field
causes a Zeeman interaction

91
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,700
that splits the degenerate +/- 1 states

92
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,533
and increases magnetic sensitivity.

93
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,680
Any change to this external magnetic field

94
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,050
will change the resonant
condition of the system,

95
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,640
so scanning microwave frequencies

96
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,410
for this resonance condition

97
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:49,650
can be used to determine
changes in the magnetic field.

98
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:51,120
And as I mentioned previously,

99
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,180
these measurements are
tied to physical constants,

100
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,190
so that reduces the uncertainty

101
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,593
and makes it a more
valuable quantum sensor.

102
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,890
More advanced methods of
detecting the magnetic field

103
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:03,330
include pulse sequences,

104
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:05,970
and these pulse sequences
can improve sensitivity

105
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,343
and limit dephasing of the quantum system.

106
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,960
My research has specifically involved

107
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,360
using nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond

108
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,660
and these quantum systems for
wide field magnetic imaging.

109
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,940
Other quantum imaging techniques do exist

110
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,280
that can provide a magnetic image.

111
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,590
However, devices like the SQUID,

112
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:31,320
the superconducting
quantum interference device

113
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,960
operate at cryogenic temperatures.

114
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,360
And so to make magnetic
images at room temperatures,

115
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,880
they must be separated
from the imaged object,

116
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,953
which limits their spatial resolution.

117
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,550
Other methods like the hull probe, NV tip,

118
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,610
or raster scanning also
can provide an image

119
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,140
that has high resolution,

120
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,210
but they do not demonstrate
time dynamics the way

121
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,740
that a wide field imager can.

122
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,570
And so as I emphasize at the bottom,

123
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:58,380
only widefield imaging adds
spatiotemporal dynamics

124
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,693
to traditional magnetic
imaging techniques.

125
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,310
So the way that the
magnetic microscope concept

126
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,050
using NV centers and diamond works,

127
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,360
we start with our diamond,

128
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,630
which has a dense layer of
NV centers near the surface

129
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,493
where we put our sample of interest.

130
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:21,180
We then shine our laser
to optically initialize

131
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,280
and read out the quantum state.

132
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,113
As you can see here,

133
00:06:24,113 --> 00:06:25,920
the laser enters the side of the diamond

134
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,010
and totally internally
reflects off the top surface.

135
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:30,750
This is advantageous
for a number of reasons,

136
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,970
including preventing
the sample of interest

137
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:35,463
from being damaged by
overheating from the laser.

138
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:40,440
We have some imaging optics

139
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,353
and a focal plane that
senses the fluorescence.

140
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,080
Fluorescence from a
specific region will pass

141
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,180
through the optics and land on the sensor.

142
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,800
The fluorescence from
each spot on the diamond

143
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,273
is mapped onto a pixel,

144
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:00,510
and that happens for each
spot and every pixel.

145
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,343
And so,

146
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:07,620
we place the sample

147
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,840
generating a spatially
varying magnetic field

148
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,250
on top of the diamond.

149
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,100
In this case, it's a spiral
made of conductive material

150
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,350
that we put a current through.

151
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:18,420
The NVs process at different rates based

152
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,800
on the magnetic field strength

153
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,050
and the fluorescence is
captured on the sensor

154
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:24,753
enabling us to map out the
wide field magnetic image.

155
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,370
This is the magnetic image

156
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:32,430
that we created when we
applied a 1-mil amp DC current

157
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,630
to the spiral structure.

158
00:07:39,033 --> 00:07:41,130
And as I mentioned, so
some of the benefits

159
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:43,470
of this diamond magnetic microscope

160
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:46,080
is that you can use it
for temporal dynamics

161
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,550
of a changing magnetic field

162
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:51,303
and also reconstruct the full
magnetic vector at each point.

163
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:59,460
Here is a depiction of
the magnetic imager setup.

164
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:03,570
The bias magnets split the
energy levels of the NV system.

165
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:06,150
The green laser initializes
the quantum state.

166
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:09,420
The wires deliver resident
microwaves to the system.

167
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,880
The nitrogen vacancy
centers emit fluorescence

168
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,790
that is captured on a
digital focal plane array,

169
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:15,960
which is essentially the camera

170
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,513
that we use to detect the magnetic image.

171
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,503
And then here on the right is
an actual photo of our setup.

172
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,060
So we decided to use
our magnetic microscope

173
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,280
on a through silicon via test chip

174
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,680
that we fabricated here
at Lincoln Laboratories.

175
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,790
This is a visual photo of the chip,

176
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:52,560
and here is a schematic
that shows the chip itself.

177
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,690
As you can see, the current
travels back and forth

178
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:57,360
across chip in an alternating pattern.

179
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,530
And if you look at the bottom image,

180
00:08:58,530 --> 00:08:59,550
you'll notice that as it does,

181
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,150
it comes in and outta the plane.

182
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,110
A changing in current
creates a magnetic field

183
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:09,110
leading to the magnetic
image that you see here.

184
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,800
So this is actually the magnetic image

185
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,683
that we were able to take
using our magnetic imager.

186
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,920
The alternating blue and red stripes

187
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,230
reference the direction of
the current through the chip,

188
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:22,410
creating positive and
negative magnetic field values

189
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:23,730
that correspond to the projection

190
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,630
along the NV axis we are measuring on.

191
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:41,820
Here is a video demonstrating the spatial

192
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,400
and temporal dynamics
of our magnetic imager.

193
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,850
We sent a signal current
through silicon via chip

194
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:50,700
that varies temporally
as a heartbeat signal.

195
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,860
You can see the magnetic field
strength change over time

196
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,823
and spike with each beat at
these two locations on the chip.

197
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,340
You can see the initial signal current

198
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,200
as well as the
corresponding magnetic field

199
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,900
and the upper box and the lower box.

200
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,730
Since the current is going
in opposite directions

201
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,010
at those points, they
have opposite positive

202
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:09,843
and negative magnetic field values.

203
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,710
This diagram shows accomplishments

204
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:20,910
of other quantum sensing methods

205
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:24,000
using nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond.

206
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,520
They have primarily been confined to DC

207
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,160
and low AC frequencies
below about 10 megahertz

208
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,650
or in the gigahertz frequency range.

209
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,330
As you may notice,
there's a fairly large gap

210
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:35,040
between these frequency ranges.

211
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,770
Recently there was a
paper that was published

212
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:41,460
demonstrating a method called
quantum frequency mixing,

213
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,230
which enables us to bridge the gap

214
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:45,930
and detect frequency ranges
previously inaccessible

215
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:48,840
by other quantum sensing methods

216
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,433
with nitrogen vacancy centers.

217
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,380
We applied this quantum
frequency mixing method

218
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,330
with our magnetic imaging method,

219
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:09,120
and this enabled us to make
magnetic images of structures

220
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,973
in this previously inaccessible
AC frequency range.

221
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,550
Here is a schematic diagram

222
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:17,640
of quantum frequency mixing
our magnetic microscope.

223
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,380
Quantum frequency mixing is analogous

224
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,760
to classical frequency mixing,

225
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,010
but it uses the quantum system itself

226
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,930
as the mixer since a classical mixer

227
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:26,553
is too bulky to be applied.

228
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,390
Here, the NV centers
serve both as the sensors

229
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,950
and as the mixer.

230
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,920
So as before, a green
laser illuminates a region

231
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,440
of nitrogen vacancy
centers in our diamond.

232
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,300
Different regions of the diamond sensor,

233
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,120
here, they're highlighted by
blue and red (indistinct) spins

234
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,190
respond to spatially
varying magnetic fields

235
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:45,600
from the test structure

236
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,790
and produce magnetic field
dependent fluorescence,

237
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,130
which is imaged onto a
sensor array using a set

238
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:54,120
of imaging optics all as
we did with the DC imager.

239
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,510
The frequency mixing works
by taking a signal field

240
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,310
and combining it with a bias field that

241
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:01,680
creates some indifference frequencies,

242
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,800
which allow us to down convert
the resonance frequency,

243
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,923
down convert to the resonance
frequency of our NV system.

244
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:10,530
At this resonance frequency,

245
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:13,950
population oscillations occur
between the two spin states,

246
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:14,783
the NV fluoresce,

247
00:12:14,783 --> 00:12:16,380
such that the photo
luminescence oscillates

248
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,660
with a frequency
proportional to the amplitude

249
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,100
of the signal drive field.

250
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,930
So by obtaining this frequency,

251
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:25,320
we can determine the strength
of the magnetic field.

252
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,110
And here, our example test structure

253
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:30,150
generating a spatially
bearing magnetic field

254
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,460
is a Lincoln Laboratory (indistinct) logo

255
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,770
displayed at the sensor plane
with a corresponding image

256
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:37,290
of the logo projected at the focal plane.

257
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,120
Spatial variations and
field amplitude result

258
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,060
in variations in the Rabi
frequency from pixel to pixel,

259
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,670
allowing wide field
imaging of AC signal fields

260
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,653
at arbitrary signal frequencies.

261
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,140
Using this quantum
frequency mixing technique,

262
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:06,420
we were able to image
the same spiral structure

263
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:10,080
at AC frequencies up to 70 megahertz.

264
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,290
So here is a schematic
and a photo of the spiral,

265
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:15,690
which we created by depositing
conductive materials

266
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:17,433
on a glass microscope slide.

267
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:26,130
Here is an example image of
the detected Rabi frequencies

268
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:29,823
of the spiral at a signal
frequency of five megahertz.

269
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,340
At each pixel, we map
out the Rabi oscillations

270
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,050
of the NV fluorescence

271
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:40,230
and use a fitting function to
extract the Rabi frequency,

272
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:42,330
which is proportional to the amplitude

273
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,430
of the magnetic field.

274
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,530
The detected Rabi frequency
is inversely proportional

275
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:51,480
to the signal AC field frequency.

276
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,890
So at 50 megahertz signal,

277
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:55,830
the extracted Rabi frequency
is slower by a factor of 10

278
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,963
than for our 5 megahertz signal frequency.

279
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,320
We plotted this detected Rabi,

280
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,870
we plotted the detected Rabi frequency

281
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:09,390
against the applied signal
frequencies for a given pixel

282
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,390
demonstrating this inverse relationship.

283
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,740
We naively applied this
frequency technique

284
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,300
on the TSV circuit ship that we

285
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,370
had previously used for DC imaging,

286
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:27,930
and we quickly noticed that even

287
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:30,600
at low AC input signal frequencies,

288
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,580
we could not detect the same
magnetic field structure

289
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,200
as we could at DC fields

290
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,730
with the structure even less discernible

291
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:36,843
at higher frequencies.

292
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,110
After evaluating the device
on a network analyzer,

293
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:42,660
we concluded that the chip
likely had some capacitive

294
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,160
or inductive characteristic

295
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,470
preventing us from seeing the structure,

296
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,900
likely some capacitive short
that caused the input signal

297
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,543
to traverse a different
path through the TSV chip.

298
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:54,330
In the upper right, we
see the absolute value

299
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:56,730
of the magnetic field for a DC signal

300
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,980
compared to the detective Rabi frequencies

301
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,380
at AC frequencies below it,

302
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,310
with the Rabi oscillations

303
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:06,030
for two of the pixels
for our AC frequencies.

304
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,680
And our results here lead us to believe

305
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,000
that there may be some application

306
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,830
for this magnetic imaging technique

307
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:13,500
from impedance
characterizations in circuits.

308
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,423
You know, as we noticed that the,

309
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,220
we were able to visually
see differences in the DC

310
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,623
and the AC where the
current might be traveling.

311
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,320
So I wanted to just take a moment

312
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,040
and thank my MIT and Lincoln Lab advisors.

313
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,103
They've done an incredible
job in helping me with this,

314
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:50,220
not only just with our specific project

315
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,240
and this magnetic imaging,

316
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,730
but also just in developing as a scientist

317
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:57,900
and teaching me how to learn and grow

318
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,130
in the scientific method

319
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:00,990
and also just for being
incredibly supportive

320
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:02,760
and helpful throughout my entire venture.

321
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,590
So I wanted to give a special thank you

322
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:07,440
and shout out to Paula
Cappellaro, Danielle Braje,

323
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,960
Jennifer Schloss, Paul
Kehaylas, Andrew Maccabe,

324
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,040
and Matthew Steinecker.

325
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,500
They've just been
incredibly wonderful to me

326
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,503
and helpful through my
experience here at grad school.

327
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:19,260
And I wanted to thank everyone else

328
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,603
for listening and for hearing this talk.

329
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:26,433
- Thank you, Sam.

330
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,160
So we're now open for questions.

331
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:33,300
You can either do that by
raising your virtual hand

332
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,583
or putting it in the chat.

333
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,940
So as people are thinking about it, Sam,

334
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,130
I'm gonna start with a question.

335
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:44,160
In terms of spatial resolution,

336
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,200
what is sort of the spot size

337
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,600
that you can image using this technique

338
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,250
or that you've been able to image?

339
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,770
A lot of the features that
you showed were, you know,

340
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:54,930
reasonably large from a,

341
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,880
you know, sort of a
microelectronic standpoint,

342
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,413
but what kind of spot
size can you achieve?

343
00:16:59,413 --> 00:17:00,510
- Right, right, thanks for that question.

344
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:04,770
So, and just so you know,
so like for the things

345
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:06,360
that we did image that we have shown here,

346
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,710
like the spirals,

347
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:10,090
the spirals are 50 microns in width

348
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:13,290
and like the actual,

349
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:16,320
the width of the conductive
material is 50 microns.

350
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,610
Here we, you know,

351
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:20,260
we initially did a test
on a 20 micron structure

352
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,670
and we actually haven't

353
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:25,410
characterized completely
the spatial resolution yet.

354
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:27,270
That's actually one of our next steps.

355
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,130
This is mostly a proof of principle

356
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:31,740
for the quantum mixing
technique on the imager itself.

357
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,690
And so that's kind of our
next step to determine

358
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:34,950
what the spatial resolution really

359
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:38,460
will be for these great mixing techniques.

360
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,603
- Great, thank you.

361
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,430
Any,

362
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,750
there's, again, one question.

363
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,330
Will the recording be
sent to us to watch again?

364
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:49,440
The answer is yes,

365
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,163
it will be posted in a week's time or so.

366
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:59,120
So there is a another
question here from May Kim.

367
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,110
Great talk, Sam,

368
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:05,160
I saw that there's heavy
dampening in the Rabi oscillations

369
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,160
and was wondering what that's due to

370
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,970
and whether that limits
the precision/resolution

371
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:14,523
of your measurement and
how can it be improved?

372
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:16,983
- No, that's a great question.

373
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:20,200
So yeah, the dampening

374
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:24,510
is due to the phasing
of the quantum system,

375
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:28,230
and that actually, you know,
was a potential limitation

376
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:32,310
for us in terms of being able
to detect the Rabi frequency,

377
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:35,580
especially as we go into higher
signal frequencies, right?

378
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,890
The defacing the system

379
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:41,370
causes the Rabi oscillations
to decay faster.

380
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:45,900
And so, you know, especially
up to 70, 80 megahertz,

381
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,520
we don't even get a full oscillation,

382
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,553
and it makes it harder to
extract that Rabi frequency.

383
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:54,420
And in terms of,

384
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,580
there are a number of things we can do

385
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,630
to improve that, right?

386
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:59,883
Removing gradients from the system,

387
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:05,340
we can, you know,

388
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:08,010
play some tricks and games
in order to kind of reduce

389
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:10,350
how quickly that gets stamped.

390
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,400
But ultimately that is a problem,

391
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,700
especially as we get into
these higher frequency ranges

392
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,533
that is,

393
00:19:15,533 --> 00:19:17,170
makes it harder to detect that signal.

394
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:22,380
- Again, so number of questions
rolling in here now, Sam.

395
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,290
Are there limitations,
this is from Emil Patel,

396
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:28,740
are there limitations today
on diamond substrate size

397
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,173
and the density of the NV sites?

398
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,990
- There are actually,

399
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:36,270
I don't know the specific limitations

400
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,103
off the top of my head,

401
00:19:37,103 --> 00:19:39,000
but there are limitations
to how, you know,

402
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,610
'cause these diamonds are grown.

403
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:46,260
It's a chemical CVD, chemical
vapor deposition, process.

404
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,000
That is how these,

405
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,650
the nitrogen vacancy centers are placed

406
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:51,870
in the diamond and you can only get to,

407
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:53,160
you know, a specific size.

408
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,880
Our diamond is about four
millimeters by four millimeters,

409
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,060
and it's about one inch in diameter

410
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,373
is like the total
limitation from what I know.

411
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,450
- So this comes, next question comes

412
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:09,120
from Colin Dunn, awesome talk.

413
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,940
What are the potential
real world applications

414
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:12,773
of your research?

415
00:20:12,773 --> 00:20:13,606
And I know you actually

416
00:20:13,606 --> 00:20:14,940
showed some of this on the first slide,

417
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,881
but maybe you wanna review those?

418
00:20:17,881 --> 00:20:18,714
- Yeah, yeah, I'll go back.

419
00:20:18,714 --> 00:20:21,010
I did kind of rush through
those a little quickly.

420
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:29,010
And so there's a number of applications

421
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:30,360
across a wide variety of fields.

422
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,130
The ones that we've
primarily been looking at

423
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:34,950
have been for integrated circuits

424
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:38,190
and seeing if we can use them
for like fault detection.

425
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,870
That's specifically what
we've been looking at.

426
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:41,340
Although, you know, as you can see here,

427
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,260
there are a number of
particularly biological

428
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:48,093
and biological applications
and you know, geology.

429
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,370
But yeah, we've been looking at,

430
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:54,360
especially for this quantum
frequency mixing technique,

431
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:58,290
it's, you know, circuits
that have signal fields,

432
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:01,080
you know, above 10 megahertz, right?

433
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,700
I mean, something we were discussing

434
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,910
was potentially like RF components

435
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:08,590
that might be useful for
seeing the magnetic field

436
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,650
for those components.

437
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,620
- All right, and the next couple

438
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:17,010
of questions actually come
from an anonymous attendee.

439
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:19,230
Again, thank you for your
very nice presentation.

440
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,063
Very impressive.

441
00:21:20,063 --> 00:21:22,020
Just two questions for you:

442
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:26,250
to achieve Rabi oscillations
of some fixed frequency,

443
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,740
we have high or low signal frequencies

444
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:33,300
to use as well as magnetic
signals correspondingly.

445
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:36,753
What kind of combinations
will be preferred,

446
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:41,250
lower signaling frequency
or higher signal frequency?

447
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,670
- I'm sorry, could you
repeat that one more time?

448
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:44,730
- Yeah, that didn't make
much sense to me either,

449
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:45,993
so I'll read it again.

450
00:21:47,476 --> 00:21:51,210
And to achieve Rabi oscillations
of some fixed frequency,

451
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:54,360
we have high or low signal frequencies

452
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:59,070
to use as well as magnetic
signals correspondingly.

453
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:02,580
Which kind of combinations
will be preferred,

454
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,613
lower signal frequency or
higher signal frequency?

455
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:08,460
- I'm still not entirely
sure I understood that,

456
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,460
but I think one thing to
emphasize is, you know,

457
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,080
in terms of this,

458
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,580
at least this mixing method, right?

459
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,413
We're,

460
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,263
try to run through here,

461
00:22:21,109 --> 00:22:22,320
you know, we have a signal frequency

462
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,153
and a bias frequency,

463
00:22:23,153 --> 00:22:24,780
and the combination of those two lead

464
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:28,410
to the resonance frequency of our system.

465
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:30,540
And so obviously we're
trying to detect signals

466
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:32,130
that are outside of the range

467
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:35,250
of other quantum sensing techniques.

468
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:38,040
And so, you know, we'd
want to use the combination

469
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,660
of the signal and bias frequencies

470
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:42,360
that allow us to access those frequencies

471
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,913
outside of that accessible range.

472
00:22:46,852 --> 00:22:50,107
- And the sort of follow up
question here is can you,

473
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:53,730
I'm sort of translating here,

474
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:56,430
can you provide a little
bit more deeper details

475
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:59,010
on the spatial temporal dynamics

476
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:01,023
in your measurement technique?

477
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:07,590
- Yeah, the,

478
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:10,680
yeah, so I mean essentially
the way that it works, right?

479
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,560
And something like, you know,

480
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,260
these other scanning
methods like an NV tip,

481
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,960
you have to specifically
scan across the entire image,

482
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:21,480
you measure a single point,

483
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,280
and then move it and
measure another point.

484
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,290
And one of the beauties of this
wide field imaging technique

485
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:27,300
is that you take the entire image at once,

486
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:32,300
and so it allows you
to measure fast enough

487
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:35,460
that you can actually get
these temporal dynamics.

488
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,650
And you know, as you can see here, right?

489
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:41,220
This signal occurs over
the space of about,

490
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:44,010
you know, several hundred milliseconds

491
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:47,763
and there you can get a temporal,

492
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:53,190
sorry, you can get the
time dynamics of, you know,

493
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:56,253
of about sub millisecond resolution.

494
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:59,253
- Yeah, thank you.

495
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:03,240
What are the next steps in the project you

496
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,230
are hoping to achieve?

497
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:05,310
I think you mentioned some of this,

498
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:08,220
this is principally for integrating,

499
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,230
for imaging in integrated circuits.

500
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:11,790
Is that what you really hope to be doing?

501
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:13,560
- Right, and also, you know, we wanna,

502
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:16,500
so far we actually are
trying to apply this,

503
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,380
the temporal dynamics to
the AC frequency range.

504
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,753
So, so far we've taken images of our,

505
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:26,130
taking images at these
higher AC frequencies,

506
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:28,710
but we are looking to actually make

507
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:31,660
like a magnetic movie of these
AC frequency ranges as well.

508
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,030
- Next question.

509
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:41,030
How can you improve the
imaging process with diamond?

510
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:42,780
Because inside the diamond,

511
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:46,200
I need light perform multi
reflection by diamond,

512
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,790
so I think this is the fact

513
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,140
that you have multiple passes,

514
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,090
internal reflection through the diamond.

515
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:54,840
How does that sort of boost your,

516
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,253
I guess your signal,

517
00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:00,030
the fact that you're doing
total internal reflection

518
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:01,410
within the diamond?

519
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:03,453
Like that's what they're trying to ask.

520
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:07,173
- Oh, how does it boost the signal?

521
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,470
I do know that there's a way for it

522
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:12,480
to actually increase the contrast

523
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,070
by the way that it
totally interlink reflects

524
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:17,220
and that it's, you know, not,

525
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,330
I mean, part of it is it's not

526
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:20,400
illuminating the sample itself, right?

527
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,170
Which as I mentioned also
prevents it from overheating,

528
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:25,170
but also allows more light to actually

529
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:27,120
fluoresce back down to the focal plane.

530
00:25:28,269 --> 00:25:29,102
- Okay.

531
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:35,010
Let's go on to this next one here.

532
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:38,523
How does the measurement of
vector magnetic field work?

533
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,820
Was it using configurations,

534
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,260
the NV diamond centers,

535
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:45,270
and are these known beforehand?

536
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:46,410
I think this is probably referenced

537
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:48,630
to the diamond structure, right? Yeah.

538
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:52,957
- Yeah, so the way that
works is the NVs are,

539
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,610
there are four different orientations

540
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:56,580
in the diamond lattice.

541
00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:00,720
And so by addressing different
orientations and you,

542
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,420
but you basically can
measure the amplitude

543
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:05,790
of magnetic field in
different orientations

544
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:06,630
and by using that,

545
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:08,310
you can compile it together

546
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:10,563
to make the full magnetic vector.

547
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,730
- Okay, the next question has to do

548
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:17,340
with the temperature of the measurements.

549
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:20,820
What temperature was the
spiral conductive material at,

550
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:24,060
and what are the temperature limitations

551
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,913
of the device that you're describing?

552
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:29,730
- So the,

553
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:32,490
I mean, the spiral was
measured at room temperature,

554
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:33,753
although that being said,

555
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,543
we used about,

556
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,000
the laser actually going

557
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,160
through the diamond is
one watt at the diamond.

558
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,960
And so there was some additional heating

559
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,850
of the spiral based off of that,

560
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:46,950
just kind of it being right next to it.

561
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:49,320
Although realistically, you know,

562
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,930
we're hoping to kind of
remove that heating element

563
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:55,410
and make it so that it's just
measured at room temperature.

564
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:56,550
And sorry, what was that last part?

565
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:58,230
What are the limitations?

566
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:00,372
- Yeah, what are the
temperature limitations

567
00:27:00,372 --> 00:27:02,070
of the device?

568
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:06,150
I would assume that
temperature limitations

569
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:08,160
for the device under tests, like-

570
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,401
- Oh yeah, I mean,

571
00:27:10,401 --> 00:27:11,820
I think specifically for the spiral,

572
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,410
the spiral is just a,

573
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:15,270
like I said, conductive, you know,

574
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:18,900
some metal layers on a
glass microscope slide.

575
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,873
And so I mean it's just as
much heat as that can take,

576
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,030
which is pretty significant.

577
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:28,350
I mean, I don't think we're
gonna fry the glass slide

578
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,490
or the, you know,

579
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:33,093
unless you evaporate the
conductive material off the slide.

580
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:36,060
I think, you know, we're pretty well

581
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:38,550
within the heat limitations.

582
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:39,720
- Yeah, yeah, I think the question is,

583
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,760
I mean, is there a
limit to the temperature

584
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,460
of the sample that
you're trying to measure?

585
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,330
I mean, does it have to be

586
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,100
within a certain temperature range?

587
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,263
- Oh, no.
- No, okay, okay.

588
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,200
Next question from Dane.

589
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,350
Great to see the amazing
progress on this project.

590
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:00,480
In the TSV image,

591
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,740
I was noticing some
heterogeneity across the image.

592
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:08,430
Is this due to non-uniform excitation

593
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:11,823
in homogeneous magnetic fields, et cetera?

594
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:16,950
- I think Dane's referring
specifically to the,

595
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:18,243
like the specific,

596
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:23,550
I think he could either be referring

597
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:24,700
to the bumps or to the-

598
00:28:26,155 --> 00:28:27,960
- I, again, I don't know if these people

599
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:31,140
can chime in and ask
the question themselves,

600
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:34,170
but as I look at this image, right?

601
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:37,500
It does vary as you move
along the signal path, right?

602
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,630
So you move through the VHA,

603
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:42,630
and it's, you know, much more pronounced

604
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:43,890
in that top row,

605
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:47,310
maybe less so the intensity is different

606
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:49,110
from row to row, right?

607
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:49,943
- Right, right,

608
00:28:49,943 --> 00:28:52,410
so that in itself could
be a number of things.

609
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:54,150
I mean, one is how the TSV chip

610
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,920
is actually placed on the diamond.

611
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,750
There might be some spots
that are a little closer,

612
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,373
the beam spot itself,

613
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,913
there has,

614
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,590
it could be how close
the TSV chip is to it.

615
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:09,960
I mean, we've also
pushed this TSV chip back

616
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,300
and forth on the diamond numerous times.

617
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,650
And so, you know,

618
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:15,630
the wires themselves might
move just a little bit

619
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:17,400
creating differences in the magnetic field

620
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,780
at certain points.

621
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,760
So there's a number of
reasons why the chip itself

622
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:24,000
might have slightly
varying magnetic fields

623
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,290
at different spots.

624
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:27,420
- And Dane actually has a
follow up question here.

625
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:29,880
Also, what sensitivity are you getting

626
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:34,683
for the QFM relative to the
record values on the chart?

627
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:40,270
- So we haven't characterized
the sensitivity yet

628
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:42,720
for the AC signals.

629
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,710
It's not gonna be as
good at DC particularly,

630
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:48,660
mostly because we're limited

631
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:51,270
by the noise in the signal itself.

632
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:53,370
And so the, you know,

633
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:56,760
our ability to make time
average measurements

634
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,660
with greater sensitivity

635
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:00,093
is limited by how much
noise is in the signal.

636
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:03,600
- Next question.

637
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,980
What is the impact of boron
and phosphorus, dope diamond,

638
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,663
on NV center properties?

639
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,060
- Could you say that one more time?

640
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,200
- They're asking the question is,

641
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,990
what is the impact of doped diamond,

642
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:19,050
either boron or phosphorus doped diamond,

643
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:21,090
on NV center properties?

644
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:23,763
- Mm, I actually don't
know much about that.

645
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,293
- There's a follow on,

646
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:33,870
could minute changes in
temperature be detected?

647
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:35,490
- Mm.

648
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:37,620
Yeah, so when we make these measurements,

649
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:41,520
we specifically find
the resonance frequency

650
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,050
for each signal frequency.

651
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,643
And so, you know, if,

652
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,580
basically when we take our measurement,

653
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,050
we make sure that we are on resonance.

654
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:51,330
And so if the temperature changes,

655
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:52,920
we'll be able to detect the change

656
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,317
in resonance for the system.

657
00:30:55,317 --> 00:30:57,720
- And the question is how
sensitive a temperature

658
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,920
change do you think
you'd be able to detect?

659
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,700
- Oh, that's a great, like, in terms of,

660
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:09,930
I mean, yeah, that's
something I'd probably

661
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:11,785
have to think about it.

662
00:31:11,785 --> 00:31:14,163
The resonance frequency changes,

663
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:19,440
some number like -70 kilohertz per Kelvin

664
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,990
or something like that, and so,

665
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,460
but I don't know off the top

666
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,383
of my head exactly what that is.

667
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:31,470
- So, the next question
has to do with the depth

668
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:34,410
of field of the imaging system.

669
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:36,303
So you're,

670
00:31:37,739 --> 00:31:40,740
how deep within an object

671
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:43,050
can you measure the
magnetic field, I guess?

672
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:43,950
- That's a great question.

673
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:47,730
So the,

674
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:48,900
one of the limitations

675
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,130
of this technique is that you actually,

676
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:53,160
the standoff distance has to be very close

677
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:57,900
in order for you to be able
to sense the magnetic field

678
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:00,180
with high resolution.

679
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,680
And so, you know,

680
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,910
we're normally, you know,

681
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:06,120
for the spiral images,
we're about 60 microns away.

682
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,100
If you are much farther,

683
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:11,130
say you're 100 or you
know, 200 microns away,

684
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:13,110
you're better off using a
different sensing technique

685
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:16,440
like the superconducting
quantum interference devices,

686
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:19,110
SQUIDs or something else because you know,

687
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:21,000
that's just one of the
advantages of those systems

688
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,620
is that you need to be further away.

689
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:25,050
And so yeah, for this technique,

690
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:27,450
you wanna be as close as you can.

691
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:28,750
- Yeah.
- To the diamond.

692
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:32,670
- So question from Arthur Lobo,

693
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:34,410
has MIT Lincoln Laboratory

694
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:38,580
developed a low swap NV
center diamond magnetometer

695
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:41,853
for magnetic anomaly navigation?

696
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:45,960
- I am not sure.

697
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,390
I'm sure that someone somewhere

698
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:50,010
is working on something like that.

699
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:51,453
- Okay, all right.

700
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:54,773
So,

701
00:32:57,330 --> 00:33:00,810
also what is the temporal resolution

702
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:02,910
and what controls that?

703
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:06,090
What controls the temp
temporal resolution? Yeah.

704
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:07,680
- Oh, that's a great question.

705
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,560
So for the,

706
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,680
I know it can be the temporal resolution

707
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,943
of sub milliseconds.

708
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:18,633
For, you know,

709
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,590
for

710
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:24,240
ours in particular, it's about,

711
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,110
you know, what's it's about?

712
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:30,090
It's on the order of milliseconds

713
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:31,510
and that kind of depends on

714
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:40,050
the,

715
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:41,460
like our,

716
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,810
the length of our pulse sequence,

717
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:45,390
the camera frame rate, the,

718
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:46,890
yeah, how many images we take.

719
00:33:47,782 --> 00:33:49,500
- Okay, and in this next question,

720
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,520
I think you've already answered,

721
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,320
but I'll ask it,

722
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,180
what are the environmental conditions

723
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:58,053
for your measurements, EG
vacuum, cooling, cryo, et cetera?

724
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,170
- This is just room temperature.

725
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:02,973
No cryo, no vacuum.

726
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,847
- Curious, there appears to be-

727
00:34:08,847 --> 00:34:10,590
- But one point on that I'd like to add is

728
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,873
that you can translate that to a cryo,

729
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:16,443
you could put it in a cryo environment.

730
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,180
- There appears to be increased emphasis

731
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:25,230
for high quality visual
output of scientific data

732
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:28,680
among various scientific research topics.

733
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,870
You mentioned the magnetic movie.

734
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:32,553
What purpose would this serve?

735
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:36,330
- Yeah, that's a great question.

736
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:38,340
I think the,

737
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,420
I think any, you know,

738
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,700
we talked about circuit
and fault detection, right?

739
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:44,910
And so if you're looking for changes

740
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:46,830
in the magnetic field for whatever reason,

741
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:48,380
I think being able to see that,

742
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:52,410
you know, within a few milliseconds

743
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:55,593
could be advantageous for
circuit fault detection.

744
00:34:56,868 --> 00:34:59,310
- Okay, next question.

745
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:02,280
What are the challenges
in building arrays,

746
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:06,993
ensembles of these NV
diamonds sensor magnetometers?

747
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,544
- What are the,

748
00:35:09,544 --> 00:35:10,377
could you say that one more time?

749
00:35:10,377 --> 00:35:14,550
- The challenges in building
arrays of these devices.

750
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:16,770
I think you are, you know,

751
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:21,720
you have a planar surface
of these NV centers

752
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,640
that you're imaging with
a focal plane, right?

753
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:26,160
So I guess-

754
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,190
- But like multiple diamonds
in a row or like an array?

755
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:31,620
- I think that's the way I
guess it would interpret it,

756
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,480
arrays of these ensembles.

757
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:37,260
Maybe that's building a
very large magnetic imager.

758
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:40,080
So for example, let's say you wanted,

759
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,360
you know, magnetic image of body

760
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,790
or something like tiling
these things together.

761
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:45,690
- I mean,

762
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:47,400
well, I think they would get
very expensive very quickly.

763
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,410
I think one of the problems you'd have

764
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:52,680
is you'd need a lot of
lasers to address each one.

765
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,760
Yeah, the,

766
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,960
yeah, so you'd need,

767
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,793
I mean, you know,

768
00:35:55,793 --> 00:35:56,760
'cause there are limitations to how,

769
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,950
as I mentioned, how large
you can grow the diamond

770
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:01,050
and if you just put a
bunch of diamonds in a row

771
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:03,360
and you address them all
with a bunch of lasers,

772
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,320
you'd need a lot of lasers,

773
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,780
had a lot of laser power
or one giant laser,

774
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:09,423
but that would be very
expensive, very quickly, so-

775
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:12,630
- Next question, do you have to compensate

776
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:14,313
for the earth's magnetic field?

777
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,400
- Yeah, so in our calibrations,

778
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,113
we account for the magnetic
field of the earth.

779
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:24,840
- And the last question.

780
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,770
Great talk.

781
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:27,220
And again, I agree with that.

782
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:31,890
What are the methods for
increasing the contrast

783
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:33,513
in the high frequency range?

784
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:37,860
- Oh, I mean, the,

785
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:40,473
so I mean, one of the things,

786
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:42,750
you know, there are a number of ways

787
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:43,950
to increase the contrast.

788
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:46,380
The, I mean, something we've just been,

789
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,180
you know, this is something
we need to explore

790
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,980
on how to do better,

791
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,780
but it's, you know, not a problem.

792
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:55,050
I mean, you can put more
signal through the device

793
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:58,260
and obviously that'll lead
to a greater contrast.

794
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:02,133
You can increase the amplitude of your,

795
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:06,333
the microwave fields that
you apply to the diamond.

796
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:12,060
You know, there are a number
of ways that the contrast

797
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,260
can be improved,

798
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,633
reduce, yeah.

799
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,160
- One last question snuck in here

800
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,870
and then we'll call it at this.

801
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:24,270
How far does the sensor have to be

802
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:26,513
from the magnetic field

803
00:37:26,513 --> 00:37:28,500
and sort of at what
distance can you no longer

804
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,333
do the imaging?

805
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:31,470
'Cause you do, in this particular case,

806
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:35,490
show your device right on
top of the diamond, so.

807
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:37,230
- Right, yeah, no, you know,

808
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:39,080
as close as possible after, you know,

809
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:43,830
if you're, even just a
couple hundred microns away,

810
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:45,750
you're starting to get
to the point where the,

811
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:50,730
you start to lose your ability
to make magnetic images

812
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:52,180
with high spatial resolution.

813
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:56,220
- Right, hey, Sam, thanks again

814
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,740
for an excellent, excellent presentation

815
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,330
and I do wanna remind everybody

816
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:04,720
that the next seminar is
scheduled for Tuesday, April 9th

817
00:38:05,692 --> 00:38:06,720
and the slot is open.

818
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,250
So if you know anybody
who might be interested

819
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,210
or if you're interested,

820
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:13,800
please contact Cherise.

821
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:18,660
She just put her email contact in the chat

822
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,400
so that we can,

823
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,290
how about a presentation in April.

824
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:25,440
So again, I thank everybody
for their time today

825
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,033
and have a good day.

826
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,883
Thanks, Sam.
- Thanks, Craig.

827
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:39,898
(chips falling)
