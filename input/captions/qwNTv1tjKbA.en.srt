1
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:16,000
uh so the new topic we'll focus on today

2
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,279
is uncertainty and how you make

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,240
decisions under

4
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,760
uncertainty now the reason it's sort of

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,480
embarrassing we've taken this long to

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:26,640
get to it is most decisions in life are

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:30,000
made under uncertainty so consider for

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,239
example your decision to study for the

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,680
Final in this

10
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:37,000
course if you knew exactly which

11
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,280
proportion of the final com would come

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,879
from which lecture you could study them

13
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,879
in those proportions or figure out what

14
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,520
you knew best and not and you'd have a

15
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:48,800
clear studying plan but you don't know

16
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:51,199
that I do but you don't so basically

17
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,760
you've got to figure out in an uncertain

18
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:54,520
world where you're not sure what's going

19
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,280
to be on the final how should you

20
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:59,399
allocate your time to

21
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,440
study okay that is a decision under

22
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,600
uncertainty

23
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,760
if the forecast had a 50% chance of rain

24
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,159
today you have to decide whether to

25
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,000
carry an umbrella you know the benefit

26
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:10,680
is your you're protective it's wet the

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,400
disadvantage is you might lose it and

28
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,520
it's a pain to carry it around that's a

29
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,119
decision under

30
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,920
uncertainty as you grow up uncertainties

31
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,759
multiply and multiply whether to buy a

32
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,560
house or rent whether to get health

33
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,960
insurance what kind of life insurance to

34
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:30,320
buy everything becomes larger and more

35
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:32,799
uncertain As you move into adult life

36
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,720
and so we need if we're going to have a

37
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,040
realistic model of people making

38
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,159
decisions we need a model that allows

39
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,920
for decision- making under

40
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:44,920
uncertainty and that's what we'll spend

41
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,640
today's lecture on now once again while

42
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,439
this is late in the course and we're

43
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,159
compartmentalizing you'll be able to see

44
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:51,920
how you can take this model and incord

45
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,320
it into the other things we're

46
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,000
doing okay indeed one thing we strive

47
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,640
for in the final is to get you to apply

48
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,200
Concepts across different lectures so a

49
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,759
lot of things we'll talk about making

50
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,000
under certainty will immediately tie

51
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,520
back to some of the things we learned in

52
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,039
consumer Theory you should be able to

53
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:10,319
see how those things fit

54
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:13,080
together okay so to understand this

55
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:16,200
let's start by me offering you a bet

56
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,640
okay and the bet I'm going to offer you

57
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,120
is

58
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,120
heads you get

59
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:29,280
$125 tails you pay me

60
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,680
$100 okay that's the bet now without

61
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,560
thinking what the Professor wants to

62
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,920
hear just gut instinct how many of you

63
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,920
take that

64
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,640
bet okay so that's about the proportion

65
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,120
I always get that's about maybe 20% of

66
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,680
the class takes the bet so let's think

67
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,200
about that decision about whether to

68
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:52,680
take the bet or not well a natural place

69
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:57,920
to start is to compute the BET's

70
00:02:52,680 --> 00:03:00,959
expected value expected value is simply

71
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:04,959
the probability that you win

72
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:06,519
times the payout so the probability win

73
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,400
times the

74
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:12,920
value if you

75
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:15,319
win plus the probability that you

76
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:20,239
lose times the

77
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:21,760
value if you lose well for this bet the

78
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:25,920
expected

79
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:27,319
value is 50% I mean I I guess I should

80
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,439
have specified I'm an honest guy it's

81
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:34,280
unweighted coin but I presume you guys

82
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:34,280
assume that 50% times winning

83
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:42,200
$125 plus

84
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:44,640
50% times losing $100 or an expected

85
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,640
value of$

86
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:51,360
12250 it's a positive expected value bet

87
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:54,120
or what we call in economics a more than

88
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,640
fair bet a fair bet is one with an

89
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:00,040
expected value of zero this is a more

90
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,840
than fair bet

91
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,599
okay so the defition of fair bet is zero

92
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,079
expected value so this bet by definition

93
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,760
is a more than fair bet but when I

94
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:10,040
offered you this bet most of you didn't

95
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,280
want to take it now I don't think it's

96
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:14,040
that you can't do this math in your head

97
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,239
I think it's that you're

98
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,799
human okay and

99
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:23,799
humans have a feature of their decision-

100
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:23,799
making that we call risk

101
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:32,680
aversion risk

102
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:36,680
aversion risk verion means that

103
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:39,600
individuals value each dollar of winning

104
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:41,080
less than they devalue each dollar of

105
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,000
losing they're made less Happy by each

106
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:46,000
dollar of winning than they than they're

107
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,919
made sad by each dollar of losing and

108
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,280
the reason is actually pretty clear when

109
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:53,919
we go back to Consumer Theory and to do

110
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,280
this we're going to turn to a new tool

111
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,880
which is going to be expected utility

112
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,280
Theory so a new tool which is expected

113
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,639
utility Theory

114
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,320
the way I expect utility the is going to

115
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:05,840
work is we're going to rewrite this

116
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:07,759
equation but not in terms of dollar

117
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,320
values but rather in terms of what

118
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:13,199
matters which is utility utility is not

119
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,000
about dollars it's about utility so how

120
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,280
do we rewrite this expect utility Well

121
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,280
we'd say look the expected utility of a

122
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:24,080
gamble is a probability that you

123
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:29,880
win times your utility if you

124
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:33,280
win plus the probability that you lose

125
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,280
times your utility if you

126
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:40,919
lose now if utility functions were

127
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,520
linear I hope you can see this would be

128
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:45,960
the same as expected

129
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:48,120
value if utility function was a linear F

130
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,600
proper linear function of your money so

131
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,360
give expected value but in fact utility

132
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:55,080
functions aren't linear we typically

133
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:57,440
consider utility functions being concave

134
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:01,479
that is we typically assume diminishing

135
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,479
marginal product of consumption

136
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:06,199
okay we typically assume uh or

137
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,960
diminishing Marge utility of consumption

138
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,440
diminishing Marge utility of consumption

139
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,599
or diminishing marginal rates of

140
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:16,000
substitution going back to Consumer

141
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:19,960
Theory okay and the what that yields

142
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:23,160
naturally without any new math is risk

143
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:27,240
aversion someone who has a concave

144
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:30,440
utility or diminishing margin utility of

145
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:34,160
consumption will naturally be risk

146
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:37,360
averse why is that well

147
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:40,560
intuitively it's because if you're if

148
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:43,800
you have a concave utility function each

149
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:46,039
additional dollar makes you less happy

150
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:49,520
than losing a dollar makes you

151
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:51,639
sad okay and that yields naturally risk

152
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,039
aversion so let's go through Let's do an

153
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:55,440
example let's use our typical utility

154
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:57,120
function form which utility is square

155
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,800
root of consumption a one argument

156
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,240
utility function make life super easy

157
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,000
all you care about consumption utility

158
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:10,680
square of consumption okay and let's say

159
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:11,560
that c0 is 100 so u0 equals 10 you start

160
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:16,680
with

161
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:19,720
100 and you end up with 10 now let's

162
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:23,319
calculate the expected utility of the

163
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:27,919
gamble I offered you the expected

164
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:29,919
utility of the have few would be a 50%

165
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:32,039
chance

166
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:34,560
that you win well if you

167
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:37,280
win someone raise their hand and tell me

168
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:42,479
what's your utility if you

169
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,479
win yeah 15 how'd you get

170
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:49,520
that you you want 100 you want you

171
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,680
started with 100 you want 125 so it's a

172
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:56,120
square root of

173
00:07:51,680 --> 00:08:00,720
225 or 15 that's exactly

174
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,720
right what is your utility

175
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:09,240
if what is your utility if you

176
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:12,879
lose what is your utility if you lose

177
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:16,360
yeah zero it's 0.5 times the square root

178
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:22,560
of zero you started with 100 you lose

179
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:26,319
100 so it's half of 15 plus 0o or

180
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:30,520
7.5 so you expect utility is lower you

181
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:33,479
started with 10 it fell to 7.5

182
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,800
I offered you a more than fair bet and

183
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:37,080
you didn't take

184
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,560
it simply because youve diminishing

185
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,200
margin utility of consumption I'll come

186
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,640
back to why some people might have taken

187
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:45,320
it but the reason most people don't take

188
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,640
that bet is simply because the property

189
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:50,839
that we all derived as natural feature

190
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:54,320
of utility back in lecture two which is

191
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:56,640
diminishing Marge utility of consumption

192
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,800
okay I find a great way to see this as

193
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,200
graphical so let's go to figure 20-1

194
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,480
which I find a little confusing but

195
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,160
ultimately helpful so let's take our

196
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:06,560
time on this figure 21 is a different

197
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,720
figure we've ever seen before on the

198
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,279
xaxis your wealth or your consumption in

199
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,120
this case you sort of consume your

200
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:15,959
wealth okay on the y- axis we're just

201
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,200
graphing your udal okay once again we

202
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:18,920
don't care about the level of oodles we

203
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,279
only care about the relationships

204
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,200
between different decisions and how they

205
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:25,240
affect your

206
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:29,839
oodles okay so for example you IM you

207
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:31,839
originally start at Point a

208
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:36,440
you have

209
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:40,600
$100 that translates to utility of 10 10

210
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:44,440
util now I've given you a choice between

211
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:47,640
a gamble with a 50% chance at ending up

212
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:49,880
at zero and a 50% chance of ending up at

213
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,880
point

214
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:56,720
B well if you value that you just say

215
00:09:54,399 --> 00:10:00,200
well a 50% chance of each means that I

216
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,320
end up at Point c i take 50% of point a

217
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:05,800
I say 50% of zero 50% of point B and at

218
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:08,560
Point C which is below point

219
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:11,279
a because of the concavity utility

220
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,160
function because by going up towards 225

221
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,519
it gets

222
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,959
flatter so I don't get nearly as much

223
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:18,560
but when I go down towards zero it gets

224
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:21,720
steeper so I'm really sad about losing

225
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:23,800
Zero sucks 225 is good but like is it

226
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,720
you know that's great but I'm not nearly

227
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,360
as happy when know 125 I say I'm having

228
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,160
nothing to eat this

229
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,160
week so because of of the concavity

230
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,480
utility

231
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:36,519
function okay you don't want a bet even

232
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,839
though it's more than fair even though

233
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:40,800
it's a bet that's more than fair you

234
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:43,880
still don't want

235
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,800
it once again no new assumptions here no

236
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,920
new

237
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:50,120
math this is just using the property of

238
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,240
diminishing Marg utility of consumption

239
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:54,839
questions about

240
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,480
that okay what if utility function a

241
00:10:54,839 --> 00:11:00,880
different form what if utility function

242
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:03,320
instead of the form of um utility of

243
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,720
square root of C what if utility

244
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:09,399
function of the form

245
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:11,360
um uh actually no let me let me let me

246
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:13,079
cover something else first so what you

247
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,920
see like I said you're better off at

248
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:18,360
Point a than Point C that's why I choose

249
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:21,279
not to take the gamble indeed here's a

250
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:23,720
fascinating fact you would imagine I

251
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,760
came to you and I said look I'm your

252
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,360
boss you're going to take this gamble

253
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,920
unless you pay me not to so change the

254
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,760
framing I say to you're going to take

255
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:34,480
this G gble unless you pay me not to

256
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,800
someone can anyone in do the math and

257
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,200
tell me how much they'd be willing to

258
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,519
pay me with this utility function not to

259
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,440
take this

260
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,760
gamble can everyone figure out how much

261
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,920
they be willing to pay me not to take

262
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,920
this

263
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:55,839
gamble well

264
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:59,880
yeah what's

265
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:01,760
that uh no not quite but let

266
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:04,560
let's keep going think about it so let

267
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:07,200
let's work out the math of this okay you

268
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:12,000
basically are saying you're I'm asking

269
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:14,279
you what payment to me plus the gamble

270
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,839
leaves you back at this original

271
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:21,120
point so if you take the gamble that's

272
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:23,399
as if your consumption if you take that

273
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,800
gamble if you look at the answers here

274
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:25,920
on the graph you look at Point C and go

275
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,839
to the

276
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:31,240
left that gamble leaves you at the same

277
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:34,240
level of Happiness as having

278
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,240
$56.25

279
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:43,240
yeah exactly that gamble leaves you at

280
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:45,160
the same level of half 56 so therefore

281
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:47,880
you're willing to pay

282
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:50,480
$43.75 to avoid that

283
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:53,440
gamble because by paying that you end up

284
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:56,959
by paying that by by because if you pay

285
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,839
me because if if if you pay me $43.75

286
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01,040
and take the gamble it leaves you in

287
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:03,360
different not taking the gamble can

288
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,639
people see that think about that for a

289
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,959
second it's

290
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:09,199
stunning I've offered you a more than

291
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:11,320
fair

292
00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:14,600
Gamble and yet you're willing to pay me

293
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:17,760
almost half your wealth to get out of

294
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:20,079
it it's pretty amazing right that is the

295
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,880
power of concavity of utility functions

296
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:25,079
you are so sad at

297
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:27,800
zero the you'll give up half your wealth

298
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:29,639
to avoid a 50% chance of ending up

299
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:32,399
there okay

300
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:35,440
another way to see this how much would

301
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,639
the winning payoff have to be to get you

302
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,199
to take the

303
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:43,160
gamble someone tell me that how much

304
00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:46,279
would the win if lose 100 win X how big

305
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,279
is X before you take the

306
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:56,000
gamble

307
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:56,000
yeah four how' you get

308
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:04,440
400 trying to get to you're trying to

309
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:07,399
have your um utility be 10 before and

310
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:10,399
after so if it's half of four the square

311
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:13,040
of 400 is 20 and then half 20 is 10 so

312
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,480
then if you have add that the um

313
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,120
expected value that's going to remain is

314
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:20,720
10 uh that's exactly like one wrinkle

315
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:23,120
it's 300 not 400 why because you start

316
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:26,079
with 100 oh yeah so you're right you

317
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:29,680
want 400 in that square root but but you

318
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:31,560
don't uh but but you start with 100 okay

319
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,480
so the point is so another way to think

320
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,399
of this is literally this is how crazy

321
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:38,399
you bet I have to offer you to take it

322
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:39,839
literally tails you lose a 100 heads you

323
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:44,680
in

324
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:47,000
300 okay so that is a really

325
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:49,079
massive Fair bet I have to give you to

326
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,279
take it and that's the key lesson in

327
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:52,600
this lecture everything we talk about in

328
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,079
this lecture and next lecture is all

329
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:57,800
driven by one simple thing it sucks to

330
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:59,720
go to zero okay and the closer you get

331
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,440
to zero that is an enormous make you

332
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,920
enormously sadder than getting above

333
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,199
where you are today makes you

334
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,920
happier and I don't think that's

335
00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:08,839
unreasonable okay as a way to think

336
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,800
about the

337
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:15,000
world okay now let's do some extensions

338
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,680
and applications of this model before we

339
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,399
get to through some extensions and

340
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:23,480
applications to talk about why this

341
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:26,000
model can

342
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,920
explain lots of things in the world why

343
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
adding this wrinkle essentially remember

344
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,399
what I said about modeling the first

345
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,839
first lecture we start with the simplest

346
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:35,079
possible model and then add wrinkles to

347
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,800
allow to explain more things here's a

348
00:15:35,079 --> 00:15:39,079
wrinkle this making our modeling

349
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:42,600
harder okay but it's can explain a lot

350
00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:45,160
more things by doing so so for example

351
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:47,800
let's change this to instead of utility

352
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:50,040
me square root of C let's say utility is

353
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:52,000
0.1 time

354
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:55,480
C that's

355
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,199
utility so once again you start with C

356
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:01,040
0al

357
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:05,959
100 u0 equals

358
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:08,800
10 but now if I offer you that gamble do

359
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:12,720
you take it what's your expecting

360
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:17,920
utility well there's a 50% chance you

361
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:23,360
win times uh 0.1 *

362
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:25,440
225 and the 15 CH you lose 0.5 * 0.1

363
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:29,360
Time

364
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:31,319
Zero what is that

365
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,920
it's 12 and a half it's I'm sorry it's

366
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:35,639
not 12 and a half it's uh if you do that

367
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:39,319
it's 11 and a

368
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:39,319
quarter so this

369
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:46,560
equals which is greater than 10 so you

370
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,560
do take the

371
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:52,720
BET why do you take the bet in this case

372
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:55,720
and not in the previous

373
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,720
case

374
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,639
yeah exactly it's linear so all you care

375
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:02,240
about expected value the expected value

376
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,880
is positive you're

377
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:07,000
done

378
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,959
okay now what if we had a different

379
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,679
utility

380
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:13,199
function what if we had a utility

381
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:16,439
function and we see that in figure 20-2

382
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:18,640
I'm sorry this shows we call this risk

383
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:21,240
neutrality so you're no longer risk

384
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,640
averse with linear functions you are

385
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,720
risk neutral you just do expected value

386
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,000
you don't care about the risk just

387
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,520
taking expected value and that's shown

388
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,320
here that basically look I start at 10

389
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:35,160
this bet leaves me at Point C which

390
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:37,039
11.25 so I'm better off so with concave

391
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:40,280
functions you get risk

392
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:42,640
aversion and unwilling to take Fair

393
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:44,559
Bets with risk

394
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,600
neutrality with with I'm sorry with

395
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:49,600
linear utility you get risk neutrality

396
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,760
and sort of an indifference towards risk

397
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,520
but of course there's also a third case

398
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:57,280
which is what if your utility function

399
00:17:54,520 --> 00:18:02,039
was of the form um what if utility

400
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:02,039
function was of the form

401
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:11,880
uh uh oh yeah what if function was the

402
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,559
form utility equals

403
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:19,960
c^2

404
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:19,960
over uh utility equals c^2 over

405
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,440
1000 utility equals c s over a 100000 I

406
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:29,559
chose this particular function because

407
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:33,120
once again c0 = 100

408
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:34,320
u = 10 that's why I chose that function

409
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,120
same starting point it makes it easier

410
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:39,240
to start from the same point but now

411
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,600
let's ask what happens with this

412
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:43,000
function what's the expect utility the

413
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:48,840
gamble the expect utility

414
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:53,280
0.5 time um uh 0.5 times if you win

415
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:53,280
that's 225 sared over a

416
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:59,799
100000 plus 0.5 times if you lose which

417
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:03,600
is zero

418
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:03,600
what is the value of that it's

419
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,000
25.3 you are really happy to take this

420
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:13,320
gamble you've increased utility why

421
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,159
figure 20-3 utility is now

422
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:19,120
convex this is what we call a risk

423
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:21,000
loving individual they're no longer risk

424
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,480
averse not even risk neutral they're

425
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,799
risk-loving they are made happier by

426
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:30,360
taking risk that yields a convex utility

427
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:33,400
function okay in in that case you are

428
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:34,880
much better off at Point C than point a

429
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,240
because in this case it's you don't have

430
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,679
diminishing marity consumption you have

431
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,760
increasing Marge utility of consumption

432
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:42,760
so going getting a dollar richer makes

433
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,919
you happier than getting a dollar poor

434
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:49,880
makes you

435
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:51,919
sad now this is really uh unreasonable

436
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,120
as a description of people in general

437
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,480
but it's not unreasonable description of

438
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,320
some people in some places maybe

439
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,159
risk-loving and if you're risk-loving

440
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:01,760
you will take an unfair Gamble

441
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:05,039
in this case imagine I said heads you

442
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:08,159
win 75 tails you lose

443
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:10,480
100 that is an unfair bet that's a

444
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:12,559
negative expected value bet yet this

445
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:15,360
person would still take

446
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:18,000
it they would get an expect utility from

447
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,000
that of

448
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:26,960
15.3 they can expect you if so if I said

449
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:29,400
heads 75 you get 75 tails you pay me 100

450
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,600
so it's a negative expected value of 12.

451
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,360
yet with this utility function that

452
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,760
person will take that bet because it

453
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,440
yields an expected utility of

454
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,080
15.3 so if you're risk loving you'll

455
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:42,360
even take unfair

456
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,679
gambles indeed it goes further than that

457
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:46,000
you will pay me for the opportunity to

458
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:48,039
take an unfair

459
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
gamble risk leving implies that

460
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:51,200
literally if I'm walking along and say

461
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,520
well I you know I might offer you this

462
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,480
deal you know if you're really nice you

463
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,720
know you you know I might have this

464
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,880
unfair bet you'll pay me to take the

465
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:00,120
unfair bet because it makes you happy to

466
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:02,240
take that risk

467
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:04,440
now you prefer a fair bet obviously more

468
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,240
is better but you prefer an unfair bet

469
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:09,559
to not taking a

470
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:12,240
bet okay questions about

471
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:16,080
that so that's the

472
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:18,080
basics okay let me do one more

473
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,880
extension which is very interesting let

474
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:23,480
me ask another question once again gut

475
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:27,720
reaction just give me the answer your

476
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:31,640
gut let's say that I changed the example

477
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:35,679
which is if you win you get

478
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:38,360
$12.50 if you lose you pay me $10 how

479
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,360
many people take that

480
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:44,679
bet okay this always happens too now

481
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,880
you're all being a little inconsistent

482
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:48,440
because many more of you should take

483
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:51,320
that bet why is

484
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:53,640
that why

485
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:55,240
yeah it's what it's worth less money

486
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,039
it's the same divided by 10 but why it's

487
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,240
being worth less money make you more

488
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,520
want to take it as a risk averse

489
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,520
individual

490
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:06,640
[Music]

491
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:09,480
last1 exactly think about this concave

492
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:12,760
utility function back in figure

493
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:16,440
20-1 think about what happens as you

494
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:17,840
shrink the gamble to shrink the gamble

495
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:20,960
towards the initial

496
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,799
Point what happens the function becomes

497
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:26,840
locally

498
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:28,960
linear so in fact the smaller the gamble

499
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:31,320
the less concave effectively is your

500
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,640
decision- making and once you're linear

501
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:36,320
you only care about expected value so

502
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:38,640
indeed in the what I just said if I just

503
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:41,240
did that gamble I gave you guys and put

504
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,360
it on our original risk averse utility

505
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:48,840
function the expect utility of that

506
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:52,799
gamble was 0.5 times the square root of

507
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:56,200
um the square root of

508
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:56,200
uh uh

509
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:04,559
11250 plus 0.5

510
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:10,320
* theun of 100us 10 or

511
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:13,679
90 and if you add that you actually get

512
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:15,640
10.05 Which is higher than your initial

513
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:18,000
expect

514
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:20,919
utility this is very

515
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,880
important what matters is not the size

516
00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:24,360
of the

517
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:26,760
gamble what matters is the size of the

518
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:30,159
gamble relative to your

519
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:32,520
resources risk aversion is

520
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,600
relative okay what matters is not the

521
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,760
size of the gamble stand of the gamble

522
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,000
Rel to your resources Bill Gates and you

523
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:41,679
feel differently about a $100

524
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:44,200
gamble okay so basically and that's

525
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:46,480
because as the gamble gets small Rel to

526
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,200
your initial wealth utility function

527
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,799
becomes locally linear and you become

528
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,919
risk

529
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:54,200
neutral it's a very very important

530
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,279
Insight you should be able to see this

531
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,159
actually I can tell you a couple things

532
00:23:55,279 --> 00:24:00,559
you should be able see the same

533
00:23:57,159 --> 00:24:02,360
Insight uh answers a um a couple of

534
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:06,039
other a couple of other

535
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:07,559
questions what so what this says is as

536
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:09,840
the gamble get basically the bottom line

537
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:11,840
is as the gamble gets small or as your

538
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:15,080
initial wealth gets bigger you become

539
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:17,600
more risk-neutral that's the key lesson

540
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:20,600
okay any questions about

541
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,600
that

542
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,640
yeah uh because we never care about the

543
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,240
only care about comparing decisions note

544
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:35,360
I always said well it's 10.05 bigger

545
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:37,080
than 10 that's all I care about I never

546
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,240
said anything about interpreting

547
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:41,880
10.05 I just said is it bigger than 10

548
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:44,000
or smaller than 10 the key thing is we

549
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,679
always compare cardinal values but it's

550
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,799
only the relative implication that

551
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:49,559
matters what is comparing values when

552
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:51,039
you calculate utility calculate a value

553
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:52,559
it's just that value in a vacuum is

554
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,080
meaningless it's only meaningful

555
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:55,960
relative to an alternative Choice with a

556
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:59,799
different utility value and that's how

557
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,799
you Val them does that make sense

558
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:10,320
ah excellent point that is that's a

559
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:13,679
great Point expect utility theory is

560
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:15,559
making a particular assumption about how

561
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:18,559
we combine utility different

562
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:20,000
states you could imagine in fact when

563
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:22,679
you get to higher order Theory it's a

564
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,320
great question there's other kinds of

565
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:25,559
models people use for expect utility

566
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,039
that don't make this simple linear

567
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:29,640
combination assumption and you talked

568
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:31,960
about one reason that assumption may not

569
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:33,279
be great it's in approximations because

570
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:35,399
it sub that we're combining Cardinal

571
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,840
things we it's a cardinal sin we're

572
00:25:35,399 --> 00:25:39,039
combining things that we said we really

573
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:42,159
shouldn't be combining that's a great

574
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:46,200
point it works very well in 99% of cases

575
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:48,840
but there are cases where you get um uh

576
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:50,799
Pro paradoxes with this model and to

577
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:55,039
explain them you need more complicated

578
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:56,559
models great Point other questions okay

579
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:59,200
now let's go on and talk about a couple

580
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:01,799
of applications let's start by talking

581
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,799
about

582
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:10,120
insurance okay insurance is big business

583
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:13,559
in the US US consumers spend about 10%

584
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:15,320
of GDP or over two trillion dollars a

585
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:17,600
year on

586
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:20,320
insurance health

587
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:22,360
insurance life

588
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:25,480
insurance accident

589
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:29,240
insurance insurance against fire or

590
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:30,760
theft Etc Auto Insurance

591
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:34,520
insurance is Big Business and it's

592
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:35,919
literally 10% of our GDP is Insurance

593
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:38,399
why do they do this I mean that's a huge

594
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:40,440
amount of money for this product more

595
00:26:38,399 --> 00:26:43,240
than many many other sectors in the

596
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:45,039
economy why is that true well to

597
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:49,039
understand that let's go through an

598
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:50,440
example suppose that you're a 25y old

599
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,919
and I'll explain why in a second why I'm

600
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:54,520
being gendered in a second you're

601
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:56,799
25-year-old single male here in

602
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:58,559
Cambridge Okay the reason I picked male

603
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:00,279
is because basically a 25y old single

604
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,520
malale is Invincible the only risk to

605
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:02,600
bad health is getting hit by a car was

606
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,960
women can get pregnant and that's

607
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:06,679
another risk to their health so let's

608
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,399
pick a male who basically the only thing

609
00:27:06,679 --> 00:27:10,039
that could cause medical expenditures

610
00:27:08,399 --> 00:27:11,760
would be get hit by a car which

611
00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:15,640
unfortunately is a real risk in

612
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:18,760
Cambridge okay so imagine that um you

613
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:21,600
have a situation where your income is

614
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:24,840
$40,000 a year that's your initial

615
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:28,919
income $40,000 a

616
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:30,520
year okay and let's say that there's a

617
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:33,240
1%

618
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:35,279
chance that you get hit by a car every

619
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:37,720
year higher than we'd like but probably

620
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:40,000
not unreasonable for Cambridge okay and

621
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:41,600
if you get hit you end up with a

622
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,720
hospital

623
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,720
bill of

624
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:49,240
$330,000 that's your hospital bill if

625
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,240
you get

626
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:54,200
hit so how would you evaluate and I'm

627
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:56,159
going to come along and offer you

628
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:59,000
insurance and what that insurance is

629
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:00,360
going to do is pay

630
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,840
the way insurance is going to work is

631
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:04,720
you're going to pay me a certain amount

632
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:06,679
no matter what happens if you get hit or

633
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,039
not but if you get hit I pay your

634
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:10,600
medical bill so let's be clear Insurance

635
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:11,880
you pay no matter what if you get hit or

636
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,600
don't get hit you pay me an insurance

637
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,840
premium a certain amount of money we

638
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:18,519
call that the premium so you pay me a

639
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:21,279
premium whether you get hit or not in

640
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:26,600
return if you get hit I pay your medical

641
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:28,880
bill okay well let's ask how much should

642
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:31,799
someone be willing to spend

643
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:33,399
for insurance what what is the amount

644
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:36,120
they willing to pay well imagine your

645
00:28:33,399 --> 00:28:37,840
utility function is square root of C as

646
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,200
we've been working with square Ro of C

647
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:43,880
so your expected

648
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:45,720
utility is what happens if you do get

649
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:47,600
hit well if you do get hit there's a

650
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:50,200
0.01

651
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:52,080
chance of what that utility is a square

652
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,320
root of what well you still earn your

653
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:57,840
income I'm assuming you don't lose your

654
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:57,840
job you still earn your 40,000

655
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:05,279
and you still pay your insurance premium

656
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:08,640
no matter what let's call that

657
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:10,039
X but you don't have any medical bill if

658
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,880
I'm sorry this is if you if you don't

659
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:12,720
have insurance if you don't have

660
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,279
insurance and then I'm sorry if you

661
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,279
don't have insurance you pay 40,000

662
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:19,000
minus the 30,000 medical bill this is

663
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:21,799
the no this is the no insurance case

664
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,440
Okay expected utility no

665
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:27,159
insurance there's a 0.1 chance that you

666
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:29,679
end up with 40,000 inome 30,000 medical

667
00:29:27,159 --> 00:29:31,679
bills there's 99%

668
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:33,919
chance that you end up with the square

669
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:36,919
root of

670
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:36,919
40,000

671
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,679
okay okay and that is an expect utility

672
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:44,720
of

673
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:45,840
$199 that's your expect utility if you

674
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,720
don't buy

675
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:52,480
insurance if you do buy

676
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:55,000
insurance expect utility yes Insurance

677
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:58,000
there's a 0.01 chance that you get your

678
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
40,000

679
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:03,240
minus the insurance premium X we're

680
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:05,679
going to come to what x is but you don't

681
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:09,559
pay your medical

682
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:12,240
bill and if you don't get hit by the car

683
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:17,360
you actually get the same thing

684
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:19,480
40,000 minus X so literally this is just

685
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:22,240
of 40,000 minus

686
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:26,320
X so now we can

687
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:29,840
ask what is the price you'd be willing

688
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:31,799
to pay for insurance

689
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,559
against getting hit by a car and the

690
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:37,039
answer is we answer that by setting your

691
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:40,840
expected utility equal with or without

692
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:43,640
insurance so your expected utility with

693
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:45,880
insurance is the square root of 40,000

694
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,880
time

695
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:54,519
x 40K minus X you expect utility without

696
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,519
insurance is

697
00:30:55,039 --> 00:31:03,320
$199 so this is one equation one unknown

698
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:07,720
40,000 40K - x = 199 and you solve that

699
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:07,720
and you get that X =

700
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:13,440
3.99 you will pay

701
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:15,559
$399 let's be clear the reason you will

702
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,519
is because that's a premium that equates

703
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:19,679
your well-being in the state with or

704
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:22,360
without the

705
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:24,440
accident

706
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:26,840
okay think about that number for a

707
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:28,600
second relative to what the insurance is

708
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:31,360
worth

709
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,919
what's the in what's the expected value

710
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:35,600
of this

711
00:31:32,919 --> 00:31:38,240
insurance what's the expected value of

712
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,240
the insurance you're

713
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:47,720
buying what's expected yeah $300 there's

714
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:49,000
a one there's a 1% chance that they pay

715
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:51,360
pay you

716
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,159
$30,000 so you are paying three you are

717
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:55,600
willing to pay

718
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:59,639
$3.99 for insurance with an expected

719
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:02,440
value of 300 why because is your risk

720
00:31:59,639 --> 00:32:04,720
averse you are happy to pay more just

721
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:07,960
like you're unhappy to take a

722
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:10,240
gamble that's fair you're happy to buy

723
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:12,960
insurance that's not

724
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:15,159
fair because this is the opposite of

725
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:17,519
gambling insurance is the opposite of

726
00:32:15,159 --> 00:32:20,799
gambling so just as a risk averse person

727
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:23,120
will take a gamble won't take a gamble

728
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:25,760
that's fair they're they're willing to

729
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:27,960
buy insurance even if it's unfair and we

730
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:32,120
call this extra $99

731
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:35,639
the risk premium so the extra 99 we call

732
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:35,639
the risk

733
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:42,679
premium how much are individuals willing

734
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:45,360
to pay to avoid through Insurance to

735
00:32:42,679 --> 00:32:45,360
avoid bearing

736
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:50,279
risk

737
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:52,240
okay this is a striking fact and it's

738
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:54,279
consistent with the fact that insurance

739
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,519
is big big big business in

740
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:59,320
America it's consistent with that

741
00:32:56,519 --> 00:33:02,480
because risk averse individual ual will

742
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:05,039
pay um to have

743
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:07,519
insurance now I would like you to take

744
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:10,799
do as an exercise to show yourself that

745
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:14,880
the following things are true

746
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:18,679
a as the size of the loss Rises holding

747
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:24,039
income constant the risk premium

748
00:33:18,679 --> 00:33:28,559
Rises B holding the loss constant as

749
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:30,799
your income Rises the risk premium Falls

750
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:33,919
both of those things simply follow from

751
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:37,600
the intuition we've developed in

752
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:40,240
gambling basically the more you become

753
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:42,919
the more the the gamble is is irrelevant

754
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,440
Rel to your income the less you care and

755
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:46,159
the less you're willing to take do

756
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:48,279
unfair things like take an actual unfair

757
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:52,200
bet or Bay pay a risk

758
00:33:48,279 --> 00:33:55,279
premium okay questions about

759
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:56,399
that that's it now you're right these

760
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:57,480
are making certain mathematical

761
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:59,600
assumptions but the idea that people

762
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,960
want to risk premium is just comes the

763
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,320
magn to this risk premum will depend on

764
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,559
what you assume about the form of the

765
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:06,240
expect utility function or the utility

766
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:08,359
function itself but the Notions as a

767
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:10,040
risk pre will always be true with risk

768
00:34:08,359 --> 00:34:13,440
averse individuals

769
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:15,520
yeah complicating the model do people or

770
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,040
we want to talk about people um if you

771
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,320
like Incorporated the fact that if you

772
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,839
are paying for insurance that's

773
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,159
preventing you from buying something

774
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:24,520
else does that change how much oh no no

775
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:26,560
that's that's it that's Incorporated

776
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:29,119
it's Square to see so by definition if I

777
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:31,320
buy insurance I can't buy something else

778
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:35,800
right that's Incorporated

779
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:37,839
here okay now that's one application

780
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:40,240
let's talk about another application

781
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:42,480
let's talk about the

782
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:45,079
lottery the lottery in the United States

783
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,560
is a total ripoff the expected value of

784
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:48,679
a lottery ticket of every dollar you

785
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:52,720
spend on the lottery in the US is 50

786
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:55,560
Cents it's a massively unfair bet yet

787
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:57,200
it's also massively popular and a major

788
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:59,320
source of revenue for states is state

789
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:04,240
lotteries

790
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:08,160
why is that how can you have a situation

791
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:10,400
where you have um a popular unfair bet

792
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:13,200
now there's four theories for why this

793
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:17,079
is Theory

794
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,079
one is people are risk

795
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:21,680
loving they play the lottery because

796
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:23,560
they're risk loving how can you use

797
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:26,079
something I just talked about 37 seconds

798
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:27,359
ago disprove that theory how can you

799
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:28,599
disprove the fact that people are risk

800
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,760
loving

801
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:32,280
how can you say Americans are clearly

802
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:34,400
not risk loving they spend 1.5 they

803
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:36,480
spend $2 trillion on insurance they're

804
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,680
clearly not risk loving so that theory

805
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,960
goes out the

806
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:44,119
window okay the second

807
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:48,760
theory is a little more subtle which is

808
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:48,760
that people are both risk Avers and risk

809
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:57,839
loving and to see this we go to figure

810
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:59,760
we go to figure 20-4 of what what's

811
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:00,839
called fredman Savage preferences you

812
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,599
don't need to know that that's just what

813
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:03,880
they're

814
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:06,119
called this is our preferences to help

815
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:07,880
to explain riddles like this and here

816
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:10,680
those preferences look they're

817
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:12,800
preferences where they start concave and

818
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:15,800
then become

819
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:18,200
convex so the way this works is follow

820
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:20,960
along with me imagine as a small 5050

821
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:25,319
gamble between W1 and

822
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:27,720
W3 for that small gamble people clearly

823
00:36:25,319 --> 00:36:29,800
don't want to take it they are worse off

824
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:33,119
with the gamble at point B than the

825
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:35,079
utility of B Star so the same logic

826
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:39,040
before people won't take that small

827
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:41,359
gamble now imagine a giant

828
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,800
gamble oh I'm sorry now imagine G from

829
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:45,839
W3 to

830
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:48,079
W5 well for that gamble they become risk

831
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:49,119
loving they're H they're more than happy

832
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:50,680
to take that gamble even though it's

833
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:53,520
5050 it's above the

834
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:54,359
utility so now imagine a Gamble from W1

835
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,040
to

836
00:36:54,359 --> 00:36:59,480
W5 if you do a giant gamble people might

837
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:01,280
end up RIS looking risk loving so it

838
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,800
could be yeah they're risk averse over

839
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:05,000
small things but they love those big

840
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:08,359
gambles and that's why they play the

841
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,359
lottery why is that empirically

842
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:13,319
false why is an empirically false

843
00:37:10,359 --> 00:37:14,640
description of the lottery because 99%

844
00:37:13,319 --> 00:37:17,599
of the money made in the lottery is not

845
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:19,480
on Mega Millions it's on scratch tickets

846
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:22,160
which are you gamble for

847
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:23,119
$100 okay so people are in the range

848
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,480
where they're at the bottom of this

849
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:27,680
function if that theory was true we'd

850
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:29,480
see lotteries but only Mega Millions you

851
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,839
wouldn't see little lotteries and you

852
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:33,480
do so that's how we empirically prove

853
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:37,720
this theories and

854
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:40,720
right okay the third and fourth

855
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:41,839
theories are in subsets to flip sides of

856
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:45,040
each

857
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:47,240
other and the third theory is that this

858
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,240
is

859
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:55,960
entertainment and this comes to how we

860
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:58,359
go further in micrograms 1401 imagine

861
00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:00,480
that I put in utility function not just

862
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:02,640
consumption but the thrill of scratching

863
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:05,079
something off the scill of the thrill of

864
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:08,000
seeing gee maybe I won money and maybe

865
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:09,000
it's worth a dollar to you just a th

866
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,040
chance even though you know you'll

867
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,720
probably lose maybe in utility function

868
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,680
is the thrill you get from that there's

869
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,000
nothing wrong or IL legitim about that

870
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:18,079
just the way you write down the utility

871
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,599
function so many people just gamble

872
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:21,400
because they find it entertaining and

873
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:24,160
the The Thrill is in the utility

874
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:25,960
function the problem is there's another

875
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,720
theory which is that people are

876
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:30,520
uninformed

877
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,520
or just making

878
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,560
mistakes which is not that they get

879
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:37,359
utility Jo from but they just don't

880
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,960
understand what they're doing they don't

881
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:40,119
understand what a bad deal it is or if

882
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:43,000
they do understand they just don't think

883
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:47,960
it through properly and they're making a

884
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:49,680
mistake okay now we can't really we both

885
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:52,000
these are true to some

886
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:54,560
extent why does it matter which one is

887
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,319
true well it matters enormously if we

888
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:59,160
think the truth is one of these it

889
00:38:56,319 --> 00:39:01,480
matters enormously which one it is

890
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:03,240
primarily and why is that because it

891
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:06,440
drives what the government should

892
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:08,680
do if this is the correct view

893
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:10,040
government should support lotteries it's

894
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:13,440
a great way to make money it's what we

895
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:15,560
call voluntary taxation if people like

896
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,280
gambling then why let the private sector

897
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:19,680
make the money the government can make

898
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,000
the money by setting up a lottery so if

899
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,800
that's true we should be encouraging

900
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,000
state lotteries if this is true we

901
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,680
should be discouraging them the

902
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,599
government is sanctioning people to make

903
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:30,520
bad decisions that's not the role of a

904
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:32,599
government is not to set up more

905
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:34,920
opportunities people make bad

906
00:39:32,599 --> 00:39:38,040
decisions so it terms out it matters

907
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:41,160
enormously for government policy which

908
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:42,880
of these are right matters enormously

909
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:44,480
which of these are right because

910
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,560
basically it depends on is this a

911
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:49,800
voluntary tax or government encourag

912
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:52,599
mistakes and we don't

913
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:55,520
know but the stakes are huge in some

914
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:59,280
low-income communities people spend I

915
00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:02,200
kid you not up to 20% of income on the

916
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,960
lottery these are huge Stakes for many

917
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:06,520
people's lives this is a very important

918
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:09,200
question to be thinking about okay

919
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:09,200
questions about

920
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:14,319
that okay one last topic I want to cover

921
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:16,319
and this is going to be a lead into what

922
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:17,560
we're going to cover after Thanksgiving

923
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:18,680
so you have to think about this and sort

924
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:22,280
of put it in your head and Che it over

925
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:27,560
for for a week and a half okay which is

926
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:27,560
the problem of information asymmetry

927
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:37,680
information

928
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:40,119
asymmetry what do I mean by that well

929
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:42,000
let's go back to our insurance fact I

930
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:42,720
said that insurance is Big Business 10%

931
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,560
of

932
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:48,920
GDP you know what you know what else

933
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:51,440
amounts to about six or s% of

934
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:54,440
GDP government provided

935
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:56,920
insurance that is not only do people

936
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:58,800
spend $2 something trillion dollars on

937
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:01,920
private Insurance the government spends

938
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,839
almost another $2 trillion on public

939
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:06,440
Insurance well you might say wait a

940
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:08,480
second how could that make sense people

941
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:09,920
want Insurance they're buying it what's

942
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,480
the government doing in this

943
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,560
business why should there be a

944
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,480
government role people just buying they

945
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,599
want insurance they should buy it some

946
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:16,040
people risk ofers they buy it some

947
00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:19,560
people aren't they don't what's the

948
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:23,680
government doing with it and the reason

949
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:25,599
is because private people buy too little

950
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,839
private

951
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:29,960
insurance not cuz they're not not

952
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:32,000
because they're not risk averse but

953
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:35,560
because of an information

954
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,440
asymmetry because some parties have

955
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:40,160
information that others do not and that

956
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:42,440
can cause a failure of insurance

957
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,960
markets and to see that let's go to the

958
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:45,200
best example the classic example the

959
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:48,359
example that won the Nobel Prize for

960
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:50,800
George acof which is the ex the lemons

961
00:41:48,359 --> 00:41:52,720
problem acof set up the following

962
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,960
problem and the the lemon's problem is

963
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:57,800
basically the Insight that information

964
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:59,680
asymmetry can cause market failure

965
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:02,280
remember if markets don't fail the

966
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:05,560
government's just piss off okay

967
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:09,400
government is only useful if markets

968
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:11,319
fail okay and acrofs insight was that

969
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,880
information asymmetry much like Monopoly

970
00:42:11,319 --> 00:42:15,160
or other things we'll talk about can

971
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:18,160
create a market failure how does it do

972
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:20,160
so let's go through a simple example uh

973
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:22,640
imagine the world of George George

974
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:24,040
Jackoff was writing in back in the 1970s

975
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,839
where when you bought a used car there

976
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:27,680
was no Carfax there was none of that

977
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:29,280
stuff you had no idea what had happened

978
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,240
to the car when you bought a used car

979
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,240
when I was young you were just sort of

980
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:37,599
basically taking a gamble how good was

981
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:41,359
the car okay so imagine that um so so

982
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:44,800
imagine that um uh I have a 10-year-old

983
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:46,960
car that I keep in pristine shape and

984
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:50,839
let's say that that is worth

985
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:53,800
$5,000 so the value to to John the value

986
00:42:50,839 --> 00:42:57,400
of the card of John is

987
00:42:53,800 --> 00:43:00,200
$5,000 okay that's what everyone says a

988
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:03,599
good car in good shape is worth and

989
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:05,000
let's say I'm going to sell to Andrew

990
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:06,839
and let's say the value of the car to

991
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,880
Andrew is

992
00:43:06,839 --> 00:43:11,079
$6,000 for a pristine car he's will to

993
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:15,599
pay

994
00:43:11,079 --> 00:43:19,400
$6,000 this is a welfare improving

995
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:21,400
transaction it makes Andrew happier than

996
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:23,359
it makes me sad I am happy to sell it at

997
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:25,839
5,000 he's happy to buy it at $6,000

998
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:29,000
there's $1,000 of consumer surplus

999
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:32,440
created by the this transaction should

1000
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:35,359
happen now but imagine that Andrew also

1001
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:37,480
knows that most 10-year-old cars are

1002
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:40,400
crappy they're not kept in good

1003
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:42,520
condition and he knows that on average

1004
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:47,520
if you buy a 10-year-old car you'll have

1005
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:47,520
to put in $2,000 of repairs to make it

1006
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:53,359
run so Andrew doesn't know that my car

1007
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,599
is not crappy I can tell them it's

1008
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:55,400
pristine I could show them things it's

1009
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:56,440
like whatever you could have got an

1010
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,240
accident I have no idea I don't have

1011
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:01,280
Carfax Carfax says what's the internet

1012
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:03,680
no that exists okay he said I don't know

1013
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:07,240
all I know is if I buy a 10-year-old car

1014
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:10,000
my value is 6,000 minus the $2,000 I

1015
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:12,280
expect to put in to fix it so I'm not

1016
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:16,319
buying your

1017
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:18,200
car the market has failed a transaction

1018
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:21,440
that make both parties better off has

1019
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:24,839
not happened why because information

1020
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:26,720
asymmetry imagine now in today's world

1021
00:44:24,839 --> 00:44:29,359
imagine we have perfect information

1022
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:30,599
about how good a car is then there's no

1023
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:31,960
more information symmetry in today's

1024
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:33,720
world I could show them the Carfax and

1025
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:35,319
everything and say look it's pristine

1026
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:37,359
they'd say great I know have to put

1027
00:44:35,319 --> 00:44:40,240
$2,000 in let's do

1028
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:43,079
it but without that information he

1029
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:45,920
doesn't do it the information asymmetry

1030
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:46,839
is that I know how good the car is but

1031
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,960
he

1032
00:44:46,839 --> 00:44:51,160
doesn't and the fact that different

1033
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:54,800
parties of different information just by

1034
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:57,319
itself can cause an entire Market to

1035
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,880
collapse okay this is very important

1036
00:44:57,319 --> 00:45:01,200
this is incredibly deep Insight one of

1037
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,640
the deepest insights in all economics

1038
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,119
okay that basically a market where

1039
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:06,520
nothing else is wrong no Monopoly

1040
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:08,040
nothing else is wrong just the fact that

1041
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:09,800
the buyer and seller have different

1042
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:11,559
information could cause the market to

1043
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:13,119
collapse here the market is just one

1044
00:45:11,559 --> 00:45:15,640
sale but you can expand it to Market see

1045
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:18,040
how it could collapse okay and the

1046
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:20,319
intuition is with perfect information

1047
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:22,119
this transaction would happen without

1048
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:23,559
perfect information it doesn't therefore

1049
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:27,480
the information asymmetry has caused a

1050
00:45:23,559 --> 00:45:30,040
market failure questions about that

1051
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:32,800
now let's think for a second about how

1052
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:34,960
that applies to

1053
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:37,280
Insurance Andrew's got his insurance

1054
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:40,920
company Andrew Co I walk in I'm like hey

1055
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:43,280
I'm John I want Insurance he's like why

1056
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:45,640
like are you a sky dier do you engage in

1057
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:47,720
Risky sexual behavior why aren't you buy

1058
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:50,079
insurance through MIT or someone else

1059
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:52,040
I'm worried I'm worried that there's a

1060
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:55,040
problem that we're going to call adverse

1061
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:55,040
selection

1062
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,079
I'm worried that there's adverse

1063
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:03,280
election that is the set of people the

1064
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:05,280
people who come to me to want to buy

1065
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,720
insurance are only the people who really

1066
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,960
need it and I'm going to lose money if I

1067
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:10,040
sell them

1068
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:13,319
Insurance the information asymmetry is

1069
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:14,800
on the other foot now now the buyer

1070
00:46:13,319 --> 00:46:16,079
knows more than the seller does in the

1071
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,480
car example the seller knew more than

1072
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:19,599
the buyer did now with insurance the

1073
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,440
buyer knows more than the seller does

1074
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:24,040
but it's the same

1075
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:26,760
problem if Andrew knew that in fact I'm

1076
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:28,720
a I'm a clean living non- skydiving guy

1077
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:30,559
okay okay then he'd be happy to sell me

1078
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:32,839
Insurance say you know let's say I come

1079
00:46:30,559 --> 00:46:35,160
and I say I'm willing to pay $3.99 he

1080
00:46:32,839 --> 00:46:37,200
says great I make $99 in

1081
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:38,559
profit but since he doesn't know that

1082
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,520
he's worried the fact of coming in means

1083
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:41,880
I'm someone runs in the middle of the

1084
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:43,319
street W Mars gets hit a lot so he's

1085
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:45,760
going to lose money if he gets gives me

1086
00:46:43,319 --> 00:46:47,200
Insurance therefore he won't insure me

1087
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,880
even

1088
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:51,319
though societyd be better off he'd be if

1089
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:53,359
he had full information' be happy to

1090
00:46:51,319 --> 00:46:56,040
insure me because it partial information

1091
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:58,559
he won't that's a market failure the

1092
00:46:56,040 --> 00:47:01,839
reason government provides insurance is

1093
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:04,559
because that market failure leads to

1094
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:07,000
underinsurance that market failure leads

1095
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:09,000
people who could have insurance at a

1096
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,000
fair price not getting
