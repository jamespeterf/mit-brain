00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:08,440
hello and welcome to energy reads my

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,719
name is Kelly Travers I'm your host I'm

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,599
speaking to you from the MIT energy

4
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:14,200
initiative sometimes when we read these

5
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:15,599
articles to you on the podcast there's

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,840
just a bit more to the story that we're

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,600
dying to tell you and now we can today

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,519
is our first footnote edition of the

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:25,119
podcast where we will be digging a bit

10
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:27,199
deeper into some of our articles in our

11
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,199
last episode responding to Ukraine's

12
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,320
ocean of suffering we introduced you to

13
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:35,000
Ian Miller he's an MIT Alum as well as a

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,800
former colleague of mine at MIT well at

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,960
the energy initiative Ian researched

16
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,719
electric vehicles and also worked on a

17
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,840
modeling tool called the sustainable

18
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:46,160
energy system analysis modeling

19
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,000
environment or Sesame this tool allows

20
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,440
us to study the carbon footprint of the

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,600
energy system as a whole plus if that's

22
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,280
not enough Ian's also an expert on

23
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:57,840
photovoltaics and windpower as we

24
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,600
learned in the article within 72 hours

25
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,760
of the first Russian missiles striking

26
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,479
key Ukraine Ian was on a plane to Poland

27
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,799
he's been working tirelessly to Aid the

28
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:09,159
Ukrainian people ever since he

29
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,119
co-founded zeroline a nonprofit

30
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:12,920
dedicated to delivering Medical Aid

31
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,680
vehicles and equipment to ukrainians on

32
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:17,680
the front line today I'm joined by Ian

33
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,520
to talk more about his work his interest

34
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,799
and energy and how he got to where he is

35
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,119
today thank you for being here Ian and

36
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:25,400
for taking the time to share more about

37
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,840
your life with us thanks a lot for

38
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,520
having me it's an

39
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:31,400
honor well there is a lot to talk about

40
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,040
your story story is so interesting and

41
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,840
so inspiring so let's just Dive Right In

42
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,920
and I'm going to start with an obvious

43
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,799
question how did you get involved in

44
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:44,399
energy I first got interested in energy

45
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:47,600
in college I was majoring in government

46
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:51,040
at Georgetown and I took an energy

47
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:54,759
policy class which was focused on uh

48
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:58,000
policies to fight climate change and

49
00:01:54,759 --> 00:02:00,240
that was very interesting to me but it

50
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,960
didn't really

51
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:06,759
go anywhere energy specific just yet but

52
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:10,200
it did start an interest a simmering

53
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:13,000
interest and then after college I became

54
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,840
a science teacher I started a after

55
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,760
school science program called young

56
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:23,080
scientists and I I taught that in Uganda

57
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:26,080
New York and Boston and a big part of

58
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:28,959
that curriculum was about energy it was

59
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:32,560
focused on energy now it was for little

60
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:37,319
kids some sometimes high schoolers um

61
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:40,840
but still um describing the science of

62
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:42,159
energy and of conversion of chemical

63
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:46,280
energy

64
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:49,200
into uh Fuel and electric energy for

65
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:51,280
middle schoolers and above that built my

66
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,080
interest further

67
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,800
gradually I realized that there was a

68
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:00,120
engineering desire in me and that I

69
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:03,640
wanted to work in energy technology

70
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:06,680
somehow and I looked at ways to do that

71
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:08,799
chemical engineering was a very uh

72
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:11,080
appealing way because there's so many

73
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:13,280
applications in energy within chemical

74
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,360
engineering uh whether it's designing

75
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,920
materials for better

76
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,959
photovoltaics or biofuels um or the the

77
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,560
software modeling World which is so

78
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:27,640
important to electric vehicle adoption

79
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:31,239
and many other areas of renewable energy

80
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:34,200
growth so I I looked at how to get into

81
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:38,319
chemical engineering and the the short

82
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:40,360
answer was graduate school I got some

83
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:43,120
coursework under my belt in chemical

84
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:47,439
engineering some of the prerequisites I

85
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:50,680
was missing I got myself into a couple

86
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:54,120
Laboratories at MIT as a lab assistant

87
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:57,239
to get some real wet lab experience with

88
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:00,319
uh professors Doyle and gleon and then I

89
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:03,360
applied and focused on energy in my

90
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:05,000
masters in chemical engineering at MIT

91
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,000
so do you think any of your early

92
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,120
experiences kind of also set you on this

93
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,400
path or do you think it was really that

94
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:13,439
energy policy class that kicked it off

95
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,959
for you it was a big part of it uh there

96
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,919
was a a more general interest right why

97
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:21,479
did I take the energy policy in the

98
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:22,759
class in the first place learning about

99
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:26,919
uh energy

100
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:29,759
challenges and climate change concerns

101
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:32,880
and and staying informed on those topics

102
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,520
and getting really excited about growing

103
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,000
electrification not just in

104
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:40,000
transportation but in other areas Like

105
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,160
Home Heating and be beyond that was a

106
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,680
motivator as well so when you started

107
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,919
working on your Masters in chemical

108
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,600
engineering you were pursuing studies in

109
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:51,680
solar and wind energy then your move

110
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,560
your research moved more into electric

111
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,800
vehicles and modeling greenhouse gas

112
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,240
emissions across the energy Spectrum can

113
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,720
you tell us a bit about your research

114
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,400
trajectory and how it's shifted over

115
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:06,080
time I started in wet Labs before the

116
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:10,120
Masters I was working on micro batteries

117
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:13,039
in Professor Karen Gleason's lab and

118
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:16,280
then in my Master's and then into my my

119
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:19,560
thesis research with Professor Bob

120
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:24,600
Armstrong I shifted more towards

121
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:28,400
modeling and they were surely related

122
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:30,520
because you know experiments um always

123
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,319
involve some amount of modeling whether

124
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:35,919
it's in the predictions or the

125
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:38,479
measurements or the analysis or a

126
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,319
combination and you know I had always

127
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:43,520
always been interested in

128
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:47,039
Renewables um and and Bob and mighty

129
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:50,520
more broadly are doing so much uh

130
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:52,960
exciting essential work in modeling of

131
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:58,080
Renewables I was immediately interested

132
00:05:52,960 --> 00:06:00,919
in that so uh when Bob and uh Dr Frank O

133
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,160
Sullivan described to me the modeling

134
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:06,000
work they were doing and the Sesame work

135
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:09,240
that was just kind of nent it was just

136
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,199
starting with a Dr emry genser I was

137
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:15,440
really interested so they took me on and

138
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:18,560
the wind and photovoltaics Analysis

139
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:21,080
related really smoothly to the electric

140
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,880
vehicle work because as the Sesame group

141
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:25,759
grew and our research grew you know I

142
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:28,479
got to see the big picture of how

143
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:31,080
Renewables and electric vehicles can

144
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,639
interact so we've mentioned Sesame a

145
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,240
couple times now do you mind just kind

146
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:39,560
of running through what Sesame actually

147
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:42,759
is sure uh so Sesame above all is a fun

148
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:45,599
name for a software platform so that

149
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:50,080
people can say open sesame that's my bad

150
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:53,639
joke uh that that's good I like it great

151
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:57,160
so sustainable energy system and

152
00:06:53,639 --> 00:07:00,160
modeling environment is the acronym

153
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:04,720
Sesame focuses on analyzing questions

154
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:07,919
like okay if electric vehicle share of

155
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:11,919
the fleet in a country say the US grows

156
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:14,240
to 50% by 2040 what does that mean for

157
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:17,560
electricity demand what does that mean

158
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:20,120
for the shape of electricity demand and

159
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:23,879
how does that affect the possibilities

160
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:26,360
for the power generation mix scenario

161
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:28,840
analysis is a really big focus of Sesame

162
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:32,000
right so look at that high EV future

163
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:35,199
with high renew Ables with no

164
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,639
manipulation of when people charge just

165
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:41,080
assume it matches when they charge today

166
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:44,840
and then compare that to a scenario

167
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:48,560
where where virtual power plants and

168
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:52,319
other in intermediary companies shift

169
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:55,479
when electric vehicles demand energy and

170
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:58,000
estimate which scenario has higher costs

171
00:07:55,479 --> 00:08:01,199
which scenario has higher emissions and

172
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,360
those are the two most important outputs

173
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:06,280
of the Sesame model when it's analyzing

174
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:09,000
any future scenario the greenhouse gas

175
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:11,560
emissions associated with that scenario

176
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,759
and the costs associated with that

177
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:17,120
scenario I don't want to I don't want to

178
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:20,120
jump the the gun here I I can't resist

179
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:23,919
just a little it might not be widely

180
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:27,759
known how much the war in Ukraine has

181
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:29,599
generated interest in Renewables yeah no

182
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,039
I'm glad that you made the segue because

183
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,919
because I was actually just going to ask

184
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:35,039
you about your working Ukraine because

185
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:37,320
it really does seem like one energy is

186
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:41,959
such an underlying thread in this war

187
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:43,560
but also you are there doing great work

188
00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:45,279
you know when the war in Ukraine broke

189
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:47,240
out you immediately flew to Poland to

190
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,600
see how you could help I think a lot of

191
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,360
people wish that they could help in

192
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,800
those moments but if you actually get on

193
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:55,200
the airplane and do it can you tell me

194
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,959
what it was like making that decision I

195
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:03,079
made the decision for three reasons

196
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:06,399
inspir Iration ease and impact the

197
00:09:03,079 --> 00:09:09,000
inspiration part was watching the news

198
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:12,040
on February 26 the third day of the

199
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,760
invasion on my couch in

200
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:18,600
Boston I was horrified by what Russia's

201
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:22,200
Army was doing the attacks on civilians

202
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:25,680
the indiscriminate bombing was um a a

203
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:29,519
feature not a bug from day one and I was

204
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:33,079
inspired by zelinsky's calls for help

205
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:35,360
among others he was begging not just

206
00:09:33,079 --> 00:09:37,800
governments but explicitly private

207
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:41,079
foreign citizens to to come help in any

208
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:44,720
way they could so I had the thought oh

209
00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:48,120
maybe I could go try to help that light

210
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,519
bulb then became a more rigorous

211
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,120
analysis I I wrote it down and looked at

212
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:56,079
the pros and cons and that's where the

213
00:09:52,120 --> 00:10:00,680
ease part kicked in right uh so I knew

214
00:09:56,079 --> 00:10:03,120
that I could go to Poland and try to

215
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:05,920
help so it was in that sense somewhat

216
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:08,320
low stakes I I didn't need to know that

217
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:12,240
I'd be able to help or need to know what

218
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:14,680
the coming months held to try it out and

219
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,720
I figured if I failed to be helpful I'd

220
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,680
turn around visit my sister in France

221
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:22,040
where she lives and and come back and

222
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:25,200
call it a trip uh the third part right

223
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:27,320
the impact part was why I didn't turn

224
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,640
around and I stayed there and kept

225
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:31,519
working what was it like in those first

226
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:33,800
days because you are still working at

227
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:36,279
the energy initiative balancing that job

228
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:39,120
but then also I think what sitting in

229
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:42,079
lobbies of hotels kind of seeking out

230
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:46,000
opportunities you're exactly right I was

231
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:49,480
posting up in the cafe Lobby of my hotel

232
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:53,040
working my MIT job on my laptop and

233
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:55,360
hoping to overhere some of the hundreds

234
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,680
of volunteers and reporters who were

235
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,639
working out of the hotel and you know

236
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,720
surrounding the train station so I I

237
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:04,440
mentioned that I encountered thousands

238
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:08,040
of refugees I also encountered hundreds

239
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:12,120
of volunteers um some with pre-existing

240
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:15,320
NOS some not like myself one day I think

241
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:17,560
it was my second day there I overheard a

242
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:19,440
finish man interviewing with a reporter

243
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:21,519
about the aid work he had been doing you

244
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,399
know he he beat me by a couple days on

245
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,639
the first day of the invasion he was

246
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:28,240
working at Oracle in Finland in

247
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:30,720
logistics and he decided along with a

248
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,560
couple colleagues to drive a van down

249
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,040
full of bulletproof vests and

250
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,000
bulletproof helmets and the reporter was

251
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,360
asking him about that work so I

252
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,760
interrupted and we we verified

253
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,079
identities and then I asked if I could

254
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,760
uh maybe Shadow him uh and his

255
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:49,600
colleagues and he said absolutely and in

256
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:51,920
that shadowing uh quickly you know we

257
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:55,320
realized that I could help and began

258
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:59,639
doing so it started with helping uh

259
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:01,760
procure and fulfill delivery of some

260
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:04,160
observation drones that were going to

261
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,040
ke's Northern suburbs that week which at

262
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,200
the time were the front lines they were

263
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:11,000
under attack by that 40 mile Convoy of

264
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:13,040
Russian troops we kept on iterating and

265
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,040
growing and and I can say more about

266
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:18,360
that but that was the start and so since

267
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:20,519
then you've co-founded a nonprofit

268
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:22,279
called zeroline that's aiding ukrainians

269
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:24,760
on the front lines can you tell us about

270
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:28,880
zero line and the word that you're doing

271
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:32,560
yes zero line has a mission and a method

272
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:35,600
the mission is saving Ukrainian lives

273
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:38,639
and doing our small part to accelerate

274
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:42,160
the end of the war and our method is

275
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:44,519
helping ukrainians avoid Russian bombs

276
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:47,160
Russian Artillery is the number one

277
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:50,959
cause of Ukrainian deaths in this war

278
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:53,600
responsible for Approximately 80% of the

279
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:57,800
over 100,000 ukrainians who have been

280
00:12:53,600 --> 00:13:01,000
killed since February 2022 we provide

281
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:03,760
that help partly through research so

282
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,199
through heavy Frontline research boots

283
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,920
on the ground interviews and

284
00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:09,920
observations we try to identify

285
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,720
important gaps in government Aid and

286
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:15,199
government capacities and also homegrown

287
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,120
Ukrainian programs who are filling those

288
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:19,880
gaps but not getting the support they

289
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:22,959
deserve and then zeroline provides that

290
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:26,320
support injects private donations uh to

291
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:29,440
provide desperately needed uh equipment

292
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:32,320
and other Aid and also does what we call

293
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:35,160
partner coordination basically trying to

294
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,639
attract uh bigger more institutional

295
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:41,079
supporters for these really life saving

296
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:44,120
impactful programs we're the tiniest bit

297
00:13:41,079 --> 00:13:46,440
like a venture capital firm or an

298
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:48,880
incubator in that there is this huge

299
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:52,399
need this Valley of Death Ukrainian

300
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:54,680
Civil Society is doing amazing work but

301
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:57,759
because of what Putin's doing because of

302
00:13:54,680 --> 00:14:01,040
the industrial scale war crimes and

303
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:03,680
attacks the Ukrainian government can't

304
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:06,600
possibly do everything we have attracted

305
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:09,600
some in-kind donations from corporations

306
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:12,120
including a 300 large lithium battery

307
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:15,759
shipment from a finish company and some

308
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:18,720
others so that that Avenue is not a

309
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:20,759
closed door we absolutely want to engage

310
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,759
more companies maybe some more

311
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:25,320
technology focused ones maybe some

312
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:28,560
institutions like MIT honestly about

313
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:31,480
their uh used laptops right the aid that

314
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:34,279
zero provides we're a 501c3 right we're

315
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,959
not a military contractor so the the

316
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:39,920
physical items we're providing are

317
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:42,839
things like turn kits rugged laptops

318
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,440
communication equipment is a big Focus I

319
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:46,720
thought it was really gripping to read

320
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:48,440
about how you Quantified kind of Liv

321
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,680
save per dollar and so what you're

322
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:52,360
talking about is these things that you

323
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:55,480
need on the front line just $100 buys

324
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:57,600
for T gets $1,000 doll adds crude steel

325
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:00,000
armor to a Jeep it just really made an

326
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:03,079
impression big time big time yeah we try

327
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,759
to you know we try to make it concrete

328
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:08,680
both both in our analysis and in our

329
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:11,440
donor facing Communications right uh

330
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:13,000
people need and deserve to know how

331
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,199
their donations are actually going to

332
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,120
save lives what concretely they're going

333
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:20,120
to become yeah absolutely what has it

334
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:24,720
been like kind of living and working in

335
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:29,240
a combat zone it's a weird mix of uh

336
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:31,199
normal and New York City post 911 so I

337
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:34,480
lived in New York City when the Twin

338
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:36,160
Towers were struck and I'll never forget

339
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,440
being there and walking around the days

340
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:42,560
and weeks after everyone you know you

341
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:46,759
looked at the the feeling of having the

342
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:49,360
same thoughts was kind of insane and

343
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:51,720
intense and basically it it feels like

344
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,199
that every day in ke so yes millions of

345
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:56,959
people are going about their jobs but

346
00:15:54,199 --> 00:15:59,480
almost all of them have a family member

347
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:01,920
on the front lines or in the m military

348
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:04,399
or who's been killed or wounded or who's

349
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,759
in Russian army occupied territory

350
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:09,399
living a nightmare or who was forced to

351
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:11,160
dig trenches for the Russian army you

352
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:13,279
know the majority of them are putting a

353
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:16,040
big chunk of the paychecks from those

354
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:19,360
jobs that they're walking to towards the

355
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:21,680
the defense so it's it's obviously very

356
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,720
different from from the normal that we

357
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,639
know in the US yeah I can't even imagine

358
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,399
it's incredible what you're doing so we

359
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:32,519
talked a little bit a moment ago about

360
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:34,600
energy and how it's you know kind of a

361
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:36,399
big theme in this war from Russia

362
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,920
cutting off energy supplies to Europe to

363
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,680
their targeting Ukraine's energy

364
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,440
infrastructure can you speak a little

365
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,680
bit more to this um from your

366
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,040
perspective as both an energy researcher

367
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,440
and as someone who's there in the thick

368
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:51,880
of it like you said this war is is

369
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:54,399
largely about energy energy was one of

370
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:56,920
the biggest factors that that caused the

371
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:59,519
War tragically and what I mean by that

372
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:03,520
is Putin invad

373
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:07,280
Crimea and the Eastern donbas in

374
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:10,120
2014 and the Free World and Germany's

375
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:13,280
government responded by increasing

376
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:16,480
energy imports from Russia Germany's

377
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:19,240
government was definitely hoping that

378
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:22,240
engaging with a

379
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:26,400
dictatorship was going to not only help

380
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:29,360
their own economy uh but also help that

381
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:33,679
dictatorship become less malevolent

382
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:37,400
and it's not a crazy idea many countries

383
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:40,960
including South Korea and Singapore and

384
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:44,039
others over decades after World War II

385
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:46,280
did go from more autocratic governments

386
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:49,000
to more democratic governments while

387
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:52,559
increasing trade with the Freer

388
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:55,000
world now it all ties back to Renewables

389
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:58,360
and nuclear as well because you know one

390
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,080
reason Germany was so desperate for

391
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:03,720
energy supplies and natural gas from

392
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:06,799
Russia was because they shut down their

393
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:10,799
nuclear power Fleet in the aftermath of

394
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:13,080
Fukushima it went from roughly 20% maybe

395
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:16,520
a little less of Germany's electricity

396
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:18,880
Supply to nearly zero and the the

397
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:21,280
replacement has to come from somewhere

398
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,799
and a lot of it has come from Renewables

399
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,679
growth but but not enough the last

400
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:27,799
energy component I would mention would

401
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,320
just go back to what we talked about a

402
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:31,440
little at the start

403
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:33,640
we're all about zero line's all about

404
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,200
filling these holes in in government

405
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:38,120
capacities so naturally we coordinate

406
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,520
with government and that includes

407
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:43,520
members of parliament who work in energy

408
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:45,600
including the chair of Ukraine's

409
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:48,039
parliament's energy committee these

410
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,280
people are really interested in

411
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:51,080
increased

412
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,120
Renewables not just for the

413
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:56,159
environmental benefits we talked about

414
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:58,799
before but for the resiliency

415
00:18:56,159 --> 00:19:00,640
benefits well thank you so much for

416
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,480
telling us about that the work you're

417
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,120
doing in crane through Zer line is super

418
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,080
important and so I want to give you an

419
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:07,360
opportunity to tell any listeners who

420
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,480
might want to support your cause how

421
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:14,080
they can help donations to zerol line

422
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:16,320
really are like a turnkey way of saving

423
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,280
lives in Ukraine now there are other

424
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,360
ways of saving lives in Ukraine and

425
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:22,240
there are many good organizations but

426
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:24,559
for anyone listening if you're looking

427
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:27,919
for an effective way you don't have a

428
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:29,720
week to do research zero line is a very

429
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:33,159
effective way to help help Ukraine so

430
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:36,679
zerol line.org is our website it's fully

431
00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:39,080
