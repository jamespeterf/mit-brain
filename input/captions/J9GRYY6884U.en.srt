1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
All

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,519
right, our next speaker is Stephen

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,920
Barnes from uh MIT's Misty UK and

4
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:20,240
Netherlands, I believe. Stephen, um not

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,160
to forget our friends over there. Um

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,840
where we Melissa had already mentioned

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,480
Misty UK, but without further ado,

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,640
Stephen, thanks.

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,640
>> Thank you.

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:34,079
>> Hi everyone. Um, my name is Steven

11
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:37,520
Barnes. I am the managing director of

12
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,040
the MIT UK program uh, first of all and

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,960
the and the Netherlands program. Thanks

14
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,719
to the uh, ILP and to to BT for hosting

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,719
us here today. I'm going to talk a

16
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,239
little bit about the Misti program that

17
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:52,239
Melissa mentioned at the end of her

18
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:54,719
remarks um, and how we engage MIT

19
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:57,680
students in the UK and all around the

20
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:01,199
world through experiential education. So

21
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,680
um MISTI stands for MIT International

22
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,760
Science and Technology Initiatives. We

23
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,640
sit within a unit at MIT which is called

24
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,280
the Center for International Studies. Um

25
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,520
and we're focused on we're definitely

26
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,840
interested in sustainable aviation

27
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:19,360
solutions because we send about 1,200

28
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,560
students abroad every year. Um we work

29
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,159
in all of these different countries

30
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,240
around the world and we also have

31
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:30,159
faculty collaborations um in many of the

32
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:33,439
countries that we work in. Um these are

33
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:35,920
the areas that we work in. Um

34
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,400
my focus is UK and Netherlands as I

35
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,320
mentioned. Um and why do we exist? Why

36
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,640
is Misti a thing? Why you know students

37
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,320
are at MIT. It's this incredible

38
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,920
institution for science, technology,

39
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:51,200
engineering. um why would they want to

40
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:54,159
leave? Um well, it's embedded in MIT's

41
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,560
mission um that we are working with

42
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,320
others to bring the knowledge to bear on

43
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,399
the world's greatest challenges. So,

44
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,079
it's a fundamental part of MIT. We've

45
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,640
heard about it today about the the

46
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,399
stakeholders and the ecosystem. Um it's

47
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,560
not just in labs in Cambridge,

48
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:12,000
Massachusetts. It's also out in the

49
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,200
world. Um so the programs that we run um

50
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,400
there are four different kinds of

51
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,200
programs that I'm going to or three

52
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,599
really that I'll focus on today. Um

53
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,520
internships so these are hands-on

54
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,920
projects uh all around the world

55
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,959
typically for three months. Teaching

56
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:30,239
programs where we send students to um

57
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:33,280
teach in schools um and um further

58
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,280
education colleges. um study abroad, the

59
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,599
the more traditional kind of going to

60
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,519
either enroll in institutions around the

61
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:42,080
world or to travel with MIT faculty

62
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:45,280
members where they participate in more

63
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:48,000
hands-on workshops and then seed funds

64
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,720
seeding early uh collaboration early

65
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,200
stage uh research collaborations for MIT

66
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:59,200
faculty and researchers um with um peers

67
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,280
around the world. Um so just a uh a

68
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,599
quick overview mo we work with students

69
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,680
from all across the institute about 75%

70
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,159
of our students are undergraduates about

71
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:11,200
25% of our students are are graduate

72
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,560
students um and what makes MIT unique?

73
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,840
Why is it different? There aren't many

74
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,280
other universities in fact I don't think

75
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,800
there's any other university that I know

76
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:21,440
of that really is focused on um

77
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,280
providing these handson

78
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,560
um projectbased opportunities for

79
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,959
students. It's very common for there to

80
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,560
be a study abroad office in the UK. We

81
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,959
used to have Arasmus, but you know, we

82
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,080
have um exchange programs where students

83
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,239
will go and enroll in other

84
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,799
universities. But being MIT, we're

85
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,280
really focused on embedding students in

86
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:43,280
industry, embedding students in research

87
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:45,519
um as early as we can. Um

88
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,159
we have a pretty intensive preparation

89
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,000
process for the students. Thankfully for

90
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,080
me, the preparation to send a student to

91
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,239
the UK is less intense than my

92
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,159
colleagues who send students to Japan.

93
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,080
Um, I have to teach them how to make a

94
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:01,040
cup of tea without putting the tea bag

95
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,120
in the microwave. Um,

96
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,280
you joke about it, but it's true. Um, I

97
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,560
have to teach them that when you come

98
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,400
into work and people say, "You're

99
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,239
right." That's just a greeting. They're

100
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,760
not actually worried about your mental

101
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:15,120
state. Um, but so we prepare the

102
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,799
students before they go so they can hit

103
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,959
the ground running when they're here.

104
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,720
Um, and then crucially for students,

105
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,079
it's a costneutral program. So, we're

106
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,240
not charging students. We're not an

107
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,680
internship provider that ask students to

108
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,080
pay for the experience. We want this to

109
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,160
be available to all students regardless

110
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,080
of their background. So, we actively

111
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,240
fund raise. We ask companies to cover

112
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,160
the full cost so that students can have

113
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,560
these international experiences

114
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,840
regardless of um where they're coming

115
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:44,000
from. Um, why do companies do it? Why do

116
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:47,040
companies want to bring students from

117
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,160
MIT? Um first of all that you know

118
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,400
there's access to worldclass talent and

119
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,600
the students can make a real tangible

120
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,199
impact right from the beginning. Um when

121
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,160
I talk with companies here in the UK

122
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,280
they say well it's great we have

123
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,880
students we can get a student from

124
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,000
Imperial we can get a student from UCL

125
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,759
we can get a student from Oxford

126
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,240
Cambridge and those are all brilliant

127
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:09,039
students as well. Um I think one of the

128
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,639
things that sets MIT students apart is

129
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,000
again goes back to what Melissa was

130
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,400
talking about earlier. the students are

131
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,840
used to working incredibly hard and they

132
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,280
want to be challenged. So most of our

133
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,720
students because of the visa they come

134
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,919
on, there's a special internship visa

135
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,400
and you're not really supposed to work

136
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:26,000
more than 40 hours a week. For our

137
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,880
students, 40 hours a week, that's like a

138
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,120
summer vacation that when they're at

139
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,320
MIT, they're doing 40 hours a week of

140
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,560
classroom work and then they're probably

141
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,240
doing another 40 hours a week of their

142
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,400
their clubs, their activities, all that

143
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,320
kind of stuff. So, um, they can come in

144
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,479
over a 3-month period and really bring

145
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,639
immediate value and look at, um,

146
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,160
problems from a different perspective.

147
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,440
Another thing that makes it valuable for

148
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,840
companies is that they're building

149
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,759
relationships with these students, these

150
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,600
very impressive students at a really

151
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,160
critical point in their career

152
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,440
trajectory. So, the mentorship, the

153
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,080
relationships that are built with the

154
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,080
internship supervisors at a young age

155
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,080
can go on to, you know, 5 years, 10

156
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,759
years, 15 years down the line. those

157
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,120
relationships that students build with

158
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:12,479
the with their um hosts can rebound back

159
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,479
to them. Um and then finally, exposure

160
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:17,360
to new ideas and and latest thinking

161
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,560
coming out of MIT. So many MIT students,

162
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,520
I'm not sure exactly what the statistic

163
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,840
is. It might be close to 90% of MIT

164
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,960
students who do Europs. I'm not sure

165
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,080
>> over 90 so over 90% of MIT undergraduate

166
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,440
students will participate in

167
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,440
undergraduate research when they're at

168
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,000
MIT. So what that means is that they're

169
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,160
doing 10, 15, 20 hours a week of

170
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,080
research in a lab. So these aren't just

171
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,360
students who are sitting in lectures

172
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,840
ingesting information. They're actually

173
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,440
doing the hands-on research work at MIT.

174
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,720
And that they bring that knowledge, they

175
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,880
bring that expertise, they bring that

176
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,479
perspective to the companies that

177
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,960
they're working in. So that's a a kind

178
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:53,919
of general overview of the program as a

179
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:56,080
whole, the UK program specifically. Um

180
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:59,120
so it began as a pilot in 2015 with

181
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,360
thanks to Phil uh and Fiona who are our

182
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,759
faculty directors. Um so it's been

183
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,000
around for about 10 years. Um but it's

184
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,919
grown hugely in the last few years.

185
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,919
Obviously we had COVID where we couldn't

186
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:12,160
send anybody for a couple of years. And

187
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,520
to some of the the the the previous

188
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,120
questions about you know remote

189
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,120
collaboration and what what Masha was

190
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,400
saying about being in person you know

191
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,400
having the whiteboard being able to

192
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,560
collaborate in person the remote

193
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,400
internships were not a huge success.

194
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,240
I'll just put it that way. Especially

195
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,880
for students at the the beginning of

196
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,280
their career, the in-person in-off

197
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,680
interactions um with peers is really

198
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,960
where a huge amount of learning happens,

199
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,280
not just by the project that they run,

200
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:40,560
but also by osmosis being in the same

201
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,800
physical space. Um so the UK program

202
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,520
started about 10 years ago as a pilot.

203
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,960
Um now we send about 60 students or last

204
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,440
couple of summers we sent about 60

205
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:52,800
students to the UK every summer. The UK

206
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:55,280
for obvious reasons is um a popular

207
00:07:52,800 --> 00:08:00,479
destination among MIT students. We speak

208
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:03,120
the same language mostly um and we um

209
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,479
that the the focus on innovation,

210
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,160
science, technology, engineering, there

211
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,919
are companies here that students want to

212
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,160
work at and crucially also place it's a

213
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:13,199
place where students might consider

214
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,400
moving after they graduate. Um the

215
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,599
students that we work with, so I

216
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,360
mentioned this before, we work with

217
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,280
students from all across the institute.

218
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,919
So everything from first year

219
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,440
undergraduates all the way to PhD

220
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,080
students and recent graduates. We

221
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,560
actually have a recently graduated PhD

222
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,840
student here. Where's Venit? I'm going

223
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,080
to call you out. Yeah, a recently

224
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,560
graduated PhD student who's interning at

225
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,719
Shell um for a few months. So we work

226
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,640
with students from all across the board

227
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,399
um and from all majors as well, all

228
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,440
departments. But typically what we see,

229
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:45,040
I don't know if you can see this in the

230
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,480
back, but there's a heavy focus on um

231
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,320
you know things that you would expect

232
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,640
there to be in the UK. There's a lot of

233
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,320
computer science, machine learning, AI

234
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,800
projects, a lot in life sciences and

235
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,760
health, energy, sustainability, uh

236
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:01,200
climate um but really these key sectors

237
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:03,600
that align with um the UK government's

238
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,399
industrial strategy uh quite well as

239
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,240
well. Um

240
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,880
some of the companies that we work with,

241
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,240
we really work with um everything from

242
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,839
large corporates. Some of these names

243
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,800
will be very familiar to you. Some of

244
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,800
these are you know startups with 15 20

245
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,560
people. Um and then we work with a lot

246
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,720
of universities as well where students

247
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:26,640
are embedded in labs and research

248
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:30,880
institutes as well. Um so um it's really

249
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:34,880
quite a a wide mix. Um

250
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:36,800
a few examples. So this is Christina. Um

251
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,120
she was at the welcome Sangra Institute.

252
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,600
So she graduated, spent six months at

253
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,839
the Sanger Institute doing research in

254
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,160
women's reproductive health. She liked

255
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:49,120
it so much that actually she she after

256
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,800
she graduated she decided to apply for a

257
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,519
visa. There are all kinds of visa routes

258
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,839
now to attract, you know, very high

259
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:58,240
potential international talent to the UK

260
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,720
so they can stay for longer. Um so she

261
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,920
actually converted her visa to stay and

262
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:06,240
become a full-time um lab researcher at

263
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,480
the Sanger and then um from there

264
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,080
applied for uh the Gates scholarship

265
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,160
where she's now studying at at at the

266
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:14,800
University of Cambridge. We have Sonia.

267
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,320
She was uh she's an economics major. She

268
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,120
was here this past summer working at

269
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,800
Barclays on sustainable finance um and

270
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,399
is actually coming back to London. They

271
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,320
made her a return offer and she decided

272
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,480
that she wanted to give London a try.

273
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,600
She came in the summer, so we won't tell

274
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:32,000
her about the rest of the year. Um, and

275
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,959
then um, a couple of others. It's not

276
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,200
just London, it's not just the

277
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,880
Southeast, we have students in Scotland.

278
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,480
We had Emma this summer who was at

279
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,839
Scottish Power working on

280
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,320
sustainability. And as I was talking

281
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,720
about, the hosts really talk about how

282
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,240
it's not just um, the technical

283
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,079
expertise, it's also the the fresh

284
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,600
perspective, a new way of looking at at

285
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:53,680
problems that makes a difference. Um and

286
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,519
then finally in in Manchester we had the

287
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,120
last two summers we've had uh four

288
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,839
students every summer at at a tech

289
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,640
company called Matilian working on AI

290
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:06,480
projects related to their cloud data

291
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:09,200
platform something that is more beyond

292
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,200
my knowledge. Um

293
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,560
so that those are just a few examples of

294
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,560
the of the kinds of uh companies and and

295
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,480
placements that we might do. That's the

296
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,480
internship program. The other program

297
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,640
that we run um we also have some

298
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,560
partners in the room today um from our

299
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:28,720
global teaching labs program. This is a

300
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:30,480
program that we run over January. Um and

301
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,600
again I think this speaks a little bit

302
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:36,000
to what makes MIT students unique. So at

303
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,079
MIT there's a the January period is

304
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,800
called international activities period.

305
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:42,880
It's a month where um there's lots of

306
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,920
things going on on campus. There are

307
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,440
workshops, hackathons, some classes but

308
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,680
students don't have to be there. They

309
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,720
could be on the beach in Hawaii. They

310
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,880
could be skiing in Colorado. Um, lots of

311
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:58,560
them want to come to wet, rainy England

312
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:02,079
or Wales or Scotland. Um, and teach STEM

313
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:04,800
classes, workshops, um, and hands-on

314
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,480
kind of educational programming. So, we

315
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,519
send students to the UK every January.

316
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,360
We have about 20 who come to uh

317
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,600
different schools up and down the

318
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,079
country um spreading their enthusiasm

319
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,560
for STEM and hopefully inspiring UK

320
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,160
students to um maybe follow in their

321
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,279
footsteps or certainly get involved in

322
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,320
STEM. Um and again what they're doing is

323
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,000
they're bringing this kind of

324
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,680
interdisciplinary

325
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,200
project-based learning. None of them are

326
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,600
trainy teachers. So they're they're not

327
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,000
in a a kind of teacher track. They're

328
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,399
very much scientists, engineers, but

329
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,320
they've had experience and exposure of

330
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,399
MIT's curriculum, MIT's teaching

331
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,560
methods, and they come in and they

332
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,079
infuse the uh or infuse the the

333
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,279
classrooms that they're working with

334
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:51,279
with that same energy and and mindset.

335
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:52,880
Um and then finally uh before I close

336
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:55,920
the the other program that I wanted to

337
00:12:52,880 --> 00:13:00,320
mention is our global seeds fund global

338
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:03,360
seed funds program which um offers small

339
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,279
travel grants to support MIT faculty to

340
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:09,360
collaborate with peers around the world.

341
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:11,440
So um there's a a general fund where

342
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,160
applicants from universities anywhere in

343
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,639
the world can apply to to come to MIT,

344
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,639
bring their students to MIT and and for

345
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:21,360
MIT faculty and and their students to

346
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:26,639
travel to other countries. Um we do

347
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:28,399
prioritize um um proposals that include

348
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,000
students. We want students to be part

349
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,440
again coming back to this piece about

350
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,600
undergraduate research getting the

351
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,920
students involved at an early stage. um

352
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:39,200
we really prioritize that. Um this has

353
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:42,079
been running since about 2008. Um about

354
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:44,160
$26 million have been awarded during

355
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,839
that period. Some of that is central

356
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,240
funding that comes from MIT. Again

357
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,320
coming back to MIT's mission, we want to

358
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,639
support uh these international

359
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,120
collaborations and then some of it are

360
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:58,560
um funds that are sponsored by a third

361
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:00,079
party or by a local um or national uh

362
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,360
institution that wants to increase

363
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:06,079
collaboration with um MIT faculty in

364
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:09,120
