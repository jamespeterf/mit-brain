1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:06,400
First up, I'm pleased to introduce

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:08,240
Professor Joseph Doyle, the Irwin H.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,639
Shell Professor of Management and

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,280
Applied Economics at the MIT Sloan

5
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,920
School of Management. Joe is also the

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:19,520
faculty lead for MIT's Health Systems

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:21,840
Initiative or HSI. Today, Joe will

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,320
discuss efforts to apply behavioral

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,359
economics to increase engagement with

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:30,160
wellness programs with the goal of

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,480
better understanding their effectiveness

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:36,160
in improving employee health and

13
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,840
productivity. Over to you, Joe.

14
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,520
>> All right, good morning everyone. This

15
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,920
topic of trying to improve employee

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,879
wellness just a fascinating topic to me

17
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,559
because we could think about lowering

18
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,920
health care costs but also improving

19
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,280
productivity, employee satisfaction and

20
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,079
I really feel like it fits with the

21
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,760
mission of most most uh large employers

22
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,320
that you want to do well by your

23
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,480
employees. So there's this a lot of lot

24
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,120
of uh arrows pointing in the in the

25
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,640
positive direction here. Um there's a

26
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,960
lot of interest in what works and what

27
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,720
doesn't in this area and unfortunately

28
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,880
from the research side we just don't

29
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,280
know what works so well. So what I want

30
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,479
to do is uh as part of our presentation

31
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,360
today is show you what we've been

32
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,479
working on and ultimately I want to be

33
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,000
recruiting you know potential

34
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,159
collaborators for other curious

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,720
like-minded folks that want to know how

36
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,320
can we actually go about improving the

37
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,320
employ the well-being of of our

38
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,320
employees.

39
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,280
All right. So first I very brief

40
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,079
introduction to our health systems

41
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,320
initiative here at MIT. We have three

42
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:41,119
focus areas in healthcare analytics

43
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,040
operations and incentives and there are

44
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,360
many shops that do analytics quite well.

45
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,759
What we bring is both the frontier

46
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,680
knowledge of how to build analytic tools

47
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,920
with the management lens coming from

48
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,079
anthropology, sociology, economics,

49
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,560
psychology of how people actually use

50
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:59,280
these tools, how they buy into them and

51
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,040
how they can be successful.

52
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,200
On the operations side, we do help

53
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:07,360
health care systems. So think payers and

54
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:10,080
providers uh um work to be more seamless

55
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,680
in how they run their operations. A big

56
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,040
piece of that which is related to what

57
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,040
we'll talk about today is how do you

58
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,959
improve the workforce both at health

59
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,160
care systems but also with large

60
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:22,800
employers to try to think systematically

61
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,400
of how to improve employee wellness and

62
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,280
in terms of healthcare incentives I'm an

63
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,560
economist so this is my bucket of of

64
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,879
greatest interest how do you use

65
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,680
behavioral science to encourage healthy

66
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:35,760
behaviors as well as on the provider

67
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:40,080
side of health care systems how do you

68
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,760
get them to um provide best practices

69
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,599
What I want to talk about today in the

70
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,840
brief time I have with you is our

71
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,200
employee population health lab where

72
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,959
we're working with large employers.

73
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,360
We've had some funding from American

74
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,599
Express and Quest Diagnostics to think

75
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,400
about how do you go about improving

76
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,599
employee well-being. So just a bit of

77
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,000
background on this corporate wellness

78
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:02,800
industry. You know I find it to be a

79
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,080
really exciting area. Um just to give

80
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:09,040
some numbers um in 2022 we spent about

81
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,440
$42 billion worldwide on corporate

82
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,239
wellness programs half of that in the US

83
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,680
40%. But this is an industry that's

84
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,000
going to be growing. There's more

85
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,360
expectation on the part of employees to

86
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,920
have the access to these types of

87
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:25,680
programs. employers are receptive to uh

88
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,400
introducing these programs both for

89
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,879
selection of employees that they feel

90
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,959
are productive as well as uh to try to

91
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,560
lower health care costs. So we expect

92
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,200
this industry to grow to about 100

93
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,879
billion by 2033.

94
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,400
There are three types of things that I

95
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,120
have in mind when I talk about wellness.

96
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,040
One is what you might think of as well

97
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,120
per se, which is how do you screen

98
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,120
employees for how healthy they are? How

99
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,000
do you provide fitness programs for them

100
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,000
to get healthier? Another category would

101
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,239
be disease management. So for people who

102
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,519
already have a disease or on the edge of

103
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,519
getting that disease, how do you prevent

104
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,599
that? And then there's a third bucket

105
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,120
which is mental health programs. So

106
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,680
think about your employee assistance

107
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:09,040
programs which are now um you being

108
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,640
revolutionized by tellaalth. And about

109
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,159
half of the employers, large employers

110
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,560
that we see will offer some kind of

111
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:16,079
wellness program. um and about a quarter

112
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,120
of them are offering disease management

113
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,479
and mental health uh programs.

114
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,079
Sorry there's a lot on these slides but

115
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:24,960
I just I'll hit the highlights given the

116
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,240
the limited time we have today. So to

117
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,479
give a sense of who are some of the

118
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,199
major players uh think about firms like

119
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:33,360
WellHub, ShareCare, Levongo and

120
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,720
personally as of if I'm speaking with

121
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,960
the payers of these programs, large

122
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,560
employers like yourself, I'd be really

123
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,360
interested to know whether these

124
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:44,880
programs actually improve wellness um

125
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,479
and improve productivity of employees.

126
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,160
And to do that, we need to have some

127
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,000
rigorous research. And I'll show you why

128
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,520
in a minute. At the bottom there we have

129
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,080
well and you'll hear a presentation by

130
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,800
well today of how they use gamification

131
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:59,520
and software to try to encourage healthy

132
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,000
behaviors among employees.

133
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,680
So the average participation rate among

134
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,120
employers if they're going to offer a

135
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,120
program how do their employees actually

136
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,280
take them up? Well if it's a health risk

137
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,560
assessment this HA you know half of the

138
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,960
employees who are offered it will take

139
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,000
it up. Um if it's a fitness program you

140
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,479
know we're going to get people walking

141
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,320
at lunch 20% are going to participate in

142
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,759
that. As soon as you get to disease

143
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,919
management or some harder things like

144
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,479
smoking sessation, you start to get down

145
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:28,000
toward those uh single digits. This is

146
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,680
uh not uncommon to have 5 to 15% of

147
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,440
people participating in programs among

148
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,039
those who are eligible for those

149
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,720
programs.

150
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,880
And in terms of as an economist, I'm

151
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,240
interested could we use finances to

152
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,320
encourage people to do so. About

153
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,400
twothirds of large employers will be

154
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,800
offering some financial incentive to

155
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,639
participate in a program. And that's

156
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,199
often with this health risk assessment

157
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,479
or disease management programs. They're

158
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,639
not usually large amounts of money

159
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:55,520
that's capped by law. In many cases,

160
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,759
think like $200, $300 being lowering

161
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,280
your your healthare premium. And as a

162
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,639
behavioral economist, I do like to think

163
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,639
about how do you structure those

164
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,560
messages about how those funds are

165
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,000
available to people. If you tell people

166
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,280
you'll see this at the end of the year

167
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,039
and a paycheck that you don't really

168
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,880
look at that closely, you're not going

169
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,639
to have near the effect as if it was

170
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,319
sort of front and center. Hey, you have

171
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,120
this money, you're going to lose it if

172
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,720
you don't use it.

173
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,720
Now, there have been two large clinical

174
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,240
trials, randomized control trials of

175
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,919
wellness programs, and these are the

176
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,440
type that you know screening employees

177
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,880
for are they healthy or not? And then

178
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,720
maybe giving some suggestions on a

179
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:32,960
pamphlet u maybe encouraging exercise.

180
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,120
There's one at with the large retailer

181
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,600
BJs and another at the University of

182
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,919
Illinois among their 50,000 employees.

183
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,840
And both showed that if you look at the

184
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:44,000
treatment and control groups ran like a

185
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,400
drug trial that these programs have very

186
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,800
little effect on clinical outcomes or

187
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,240
healthcare spending. And the reason why

188
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,160
I'm bringing this up is because if you

189
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,600
look in these data at people who

190
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,199
actually engage with the program or

191
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,800
those who don't, you would get the

192
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,880
misleading impression that the programs

193
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,479
were very effective. Because those who

194
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:04,080
engage look like they improve their

195
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:06,560
health over time and that's because they

196
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,639
have those attitudes and encouragement

197
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,880
of their own behavior to get healthier

198
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,880
with or without the wellness program. We

199
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,120
know that because of the of the clinical

200
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,120
trial. We if we look at the randomly

201
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,280
assigned treatment group who has access

202
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,520
to the program and those who don't then

203
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,759
we find a very precise zero that these

204
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,680
programs are not effective at least in

205
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,360
these two contexts. So why am I bringing

206
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,560
this up in a and something I'm trying to

207
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,400
encourage you to think about these

208
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,160
issues. Well one is at MIT we're going

209
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,000
to do rigorous research like this to see

210
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,280
actually what works and what doesn't. We

211
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,680
don't go we're not an advocacy

212
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,280
organization. We want to know what works

213
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:43,520
so that you're putting your money where

214
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:45,039
it is most effective. Um but also we

215
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,639
need that rigorous type of research to

216
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,479
uncover that you need a control group.

217
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,000
You need someone who is randomly

218
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,000
assigned not to have the program in

219
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,080
order to see what would have happened if

220
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,360
the person who was randomly assigned to

221
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,960
get the program what what would happen

222
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,960
if you took it away from them. You won't

223
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:02,000
know that in an observational study but

224
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,919
you would with a randomized trial. So we

225
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,599
do have other methods besides randomized

226
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,720
clinical trials to estimate these with

227
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:11,680
quasi experimental methods. But getting

228
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,199
a valid and credible control group turns

229
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,360
out to be key to actually understanding

230
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,039
what works and what doesn't. So just as

231
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,479
a summary of this literature, I think

232
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,120
there's huge potential here. We have a

233
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:23,919
well- definfined group of employees who

234
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,319
are uh you you know who you're trying to

235
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,680
intervene on and and companies do want

236
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,199
to improve the well-being of their

237
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,159
employees. That's one of the missions of

238
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,760
the of organizations. So I feel like

239
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,760
there should be some collaborators out

240
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,760
there who want to go out and and figure

241
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,599
this out. It's a big and fast growing

242
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,200
industry with lots of changes of how

243
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,000
things are being delivered both through

244
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,680
apps and using artificial intelligence.

245
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,640
And so with all that churn, it gives us

246
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,399
the opportunity to start testing things.

247
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,160
We do need to test it rigorously.

248
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,920
However, the sort of pre-post

249
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,920
comparisons of the past are just not

250
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,160
going to cut it when we think about are

251
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,680
these programs actually effective. So we

252
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,279
have a lot of room for improvement both

253
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,040
in terms of designing these programs but

254
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:06,000
also how do you get people to engage

255
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:09,120
with them once they are eligible.

256
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,880
I want to delve into that last piece a

257
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,959
bit more in the remaining minutes I have

258
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,880
with you. So I'm working with David

259
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,360
Moler of University of Illinois who ran

260
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,040
that workplace wellness study there and

261
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,560
Nicholas Torsiello from Quest

262
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,360
Diagnostics to think about how do you

263
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,680
encourage um engagement with programs

264
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,279
once people are eligible. So we have

265
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,279
data from a large employer and we think

266
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:31,040
about their annual risk assessment.

267
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,959
Everyone we're looking at here are

268
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,360
eligible to engage with that and we

269
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:37,040
found you know precoid about twothirds

270
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,959
of people were engaging with that

271
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,279
program. That's been similar across the

272
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:44,800
years maybe a little higher recently.

273
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:46,399
And then among those who are um screened

274
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,519
about a quarter will be eligible for

275
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,120
some kind of wellness uh program.

276
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,839
And among those who are eligible for the

277
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,920
wellness program, only 6% are actually

278
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,519
engaging with the program. Um, that's

279
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,200
right. So, it's might be hard for you to

280
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:02,399
read if you're looking on a phone and

281
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:05,279
that's intentional. U, basically, people

282
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,040
are not engaging with these programs.

283
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,360
Um, if you do look at who actually does

284
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,920
participate, they tend to be female. So,

285
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,519
63% of people at the firm are eligible

286
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,600
for the program. basically all the

287
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:19,040
employ 63% of the employees are are

288
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,560
female but and 66% participate in the

289
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,279
annual risk assessment. So that's pretty

290
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:26,240
much on par with the representation that

291
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:29,120
you would expect. Among those 66% who

292
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:32,959
are eligible or who are um participating

293
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:37,200
or 66% are of the are participating in

294
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:39,600
the annual risk assessment um 58%

295
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,480
are of the eligible population are

296
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,760
female. So they're sort of

297
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,240
underrepresented. they're they're

298
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,240
healthier. Women are healthier. But then

299
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,040
if you look at among the 58% of

300
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,640
eligibles are female, um 74% of those

301
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,800
who actually engage are female. So

302
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,240
they're disproportionately engaging. And

303
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,920
this is something we see across a number

304
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,800
of contexts that women tend to engage

305
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,640
with these programs more than men. If

306
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,440
you look at the income level of the

307
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,600
employees, um by construction, we

308
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,360
created a data set where half are low

309
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,959
income and half are high income. They're

310
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,360
basically the lowest cortile of spending

311
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,320
of income versus the highest cortile.

312
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,000
But then if you look at the

313
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,519
participation, it's largely the high

314
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,720
income folks who are participating in

315
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:21,279
the annual risk assessment. And then we

316
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,000
know that 14% are low income. About 14%

317
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,360
15% are eligible. So actually they're

318
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,640
actually it's pretty similar in terms of

319
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,279
whether they'd be eligible for a

320
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:32,160
program. And then if you look at whether

321
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:34,000
they actually engage, it's about 15% of

322
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,519
of those high and low-inccome folks that

323
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,279
engage in the program. So that's a

324
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,519
slightly different year. It's a subopul

325
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,760
of what I showed you before, but it

326
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,120
looks like if we looked at income

327
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,880
disparities, it would be coming through

328
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,880
the front door here of do they start off

329
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,880
with any engagement, but once they're

330
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,079
eligible and engaging, they do it at a

331
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,120
similar rate whether you're in the top

332
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:55,680
or bottom of the income distribution. In

333
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,920
terms of age, as you age, you are going

334
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,480
to be spending more on health care,

335
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:03,440
which is very typical. Um, but you're

336
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:06,000
less likely to engage in these types of

337
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,240
wellness programs. This is a disease

338
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,399
management program. So maybe folks at

339
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,880
the upper end of the age distribution

340
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,880
are um are already getting a lot of

341
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,720
access to health care whereas the

342
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:20,639
younger folks are taking advantage of it

343
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,639
through their employer more.

344
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,320
A couple other things we found that I

345
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,839
think is pretty interesting. The people

346
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,600
that are engaging in this program that

347
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,760
we're looking at which was a a weight

348
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,040
loss program. we see that they have the

349
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,800
people who engage are more likely to

350
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:36,399
have had a shock increase in their

351
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:38,399
weight in the year prior um to engaging.

352
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,600
So maybe they they put on a few pounds

353
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,639
and they're the ones who are motivated

354
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,079
to try to take them off. In terms of

355
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,839
mental health, we find that those who

356
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,399
engage actually have higher rates of

357
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,480
depression and anxiety. Um and they had

358
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:53,040
a little bit of a shock increase in

359
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,920
their mental health problems. And it may

360
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:58,000
might be times when you people want to

361
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,920
engage with these programs to start to

362
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,600
get healthier.

363
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,120
This graph is one of many that we have

364
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,519
in our research, but I wanted to show

365
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,880
you one. If we look at the the annual

366
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,320
survey that people take as part of the

367
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,839
annual risk assessment, we can learn

368
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,839
things like have they had a flu shot in

369
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,279
the past? Have they avoided health care

370
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,200
due to the cost of healthcare in the

371
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,279
past? We find for those two categories,

372
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,040
they are engaging more with the program.

373
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,639
So, you know, people who are interested

374
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,880
in preventive health are the ones who

375
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,880
take up preventive health care and those

376
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,320
who don't have as much access to health

377
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,720
care because they can't afford it are

378
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,519
more likely to take these programs up.

379
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,760
The bottom panel here, um, when we think

380
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,360
about risk aversion, we have these

381
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,360
measures of do you speed on the highway

382
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,800
or do you use sunblock? And we find that

383
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,320
the people who speed on the highway are

384
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,839
less likely to engage in these wellness

385
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,160
programs. They're like more of the risk

386
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,839
takers and they decide not to engage.

387
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,440
And those who people who wear sunblock

388
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,839
can and we could do this controlling for

389
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,000
demographics um they are more likely to

390
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:55,600
engage. So again riskaverse folks are

391
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,480
more likely to engage in the um in the

392
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,160
wellness programs.

393
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,760
So a big question is is there a return

394
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,440
on investment for firms to offer these

395
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,360
types of wellness programs and one way

396
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,760
you could have a return would be through

397
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,600
healthcare spending. And so we find that

398
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,600
those who engage with the program

399
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,480
actually in the year before and after

400
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,639
they actually stay steady only a $12

401
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,639
reduction in their healthcare spending

402
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,720
per member per month that the

403
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:23,199
non-engagers actually saw an increase of

404
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,360
134. So this would suggest that the the

405
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:27,839
program cost $600

406
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,360
um and the claims over the course of the

407
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,760
year you would have this savings of

408
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,040
1,700 and this is a type of number that

409
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,920
you do see in the literature quite a bit

410
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,519
that you could save 3 to one if you look

411
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,199
at program people who engage and those

412
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,800
who don't engage but if you remember

413
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,800
back to the slide I showed you a few

414
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,680
slides ago about a randomized control

415
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,519
trial showing no effect we could

416
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:51,120
replicate this type of result in the

417
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:52,320
those RCTs randomized control trials

418
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,320
If you compared those who actually

419
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,480
engage who don't engage, you would find

420
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,760
this seeming improvement. But when you

421
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,360
go back and you compare the treatment

422
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,720
and control groups who are randomly

423
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,880
assigned, you don't find an effect,

424
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,959
suggesting that some of this is likely

425
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,240
due to selection. The people who engage

426
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,160
are the ones who are going to be on a

427
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,519
better trajectory regardless of whether

428
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:14,639
they engaged or not. So the returns are

429
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:16,079
so large 300% or so that you know that's

430
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,920
probably going to come down if you do a

431
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:20,480
more rigorous study. But there's still a

432
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,079
large potential here to see. The other

433
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,920
part is that it's not only healthcare

434
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:25,360
claims that firms might might care

435
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,519
about. Maybe they you could care about

436
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,120
job retention. So we find that after a

437
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,440
year of engaging, the engagers are more

438
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,120
likely to stay at the firm. 94% are

439
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,480
still there versus 90% of those who

440
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,920
didn't engage. So the reason why firms

441
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,240
could have these wellness programs would

442
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,800
be to attract and retain employees. And

443
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,399
that shouldn't be lost in this

444
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,079
discussion of whether firms should be

445
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,000
offering wellness programs. and

446
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:50,000
something that we'd love to uh to push

447
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,839
on.

448
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,639
So just as a summary of what we found in

449
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:56,079
the background investigation of

450
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,399
historical data, we found that disease

451
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:00,240
management engagement is very low. Women

452
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,440
are more likely to engage, those with

453
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,880
low income are less likely to

454
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,959
participate at the front door of the

455
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,480
annual risk assessment, and members with

456
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,839
low health care costs are more likely to

457
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,240
engage. So that's kind of interesting

458
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:12,639
that the relatively healthier folks are

459
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,360
more likely to engage and mental health

460
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,959
shocks may precipitate um engagement.

461
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,480
There is a large potential for return on

462
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,560
investment here both through medical

463
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:24,639
spending and through higher productivity

464
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:26,160
measures. So a big question we have is

465
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:29,199
how can you get people to engage more in

466
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:31,839
these programs? And so we've designed a

467
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:33,920
randomized trial of uh with our

468
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,160
collaborating partner of looking at the

469
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,000
power of defaults. So we know from

470
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:41,519
behavioral economics that defaults are

471
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,360
very um powerful. So here's a classic

472
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,199
study of if you have people default into

473
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,279
their 401k versus having to join on

474
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,720
their own that you have much higher

475
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:51,680
participation for those who are

476
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,440
defaulted to do so even though um it's

477
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,240
people are leaving money on the table by

478
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,800
by not. So what we did is we designed a

479
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,399
trial and outreach campaign that there

480
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,639
the firmo already had an outreach

481
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,400
campaign that basically said something

482
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:07,839
like you see on the left of your screen

483
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,439
there. if you you get a a drip of emails

484
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,720
saying, "Hey, you're invited to join

485
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,799
this program. You're eligible. Please

486
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,439
enroll today." And we said, "Well, what

487
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,720
if you reframed this in terms of, hey,

488
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,880
you're already in this program. Why

489
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,199
don't you start engaging?"

490
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,640
And we thought that this might not have

491
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,839
that large of an effect. Like, it's not

492
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,319
that big of a difference between saying,

493
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:29,919
"Hey, you're invited," versus, "Hey,

494
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:32,480
you're in." Um but it turns out that we

495
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:35,200
find that with a large scale like 5,000

496
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,120
people in this trial that the simple

497
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,360
framing change led to a two to three

498
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,520
times higher engagement rate. So those

499
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:44,160
people who are typically we we see at

500
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:46,400
that 5% engagement level for men you're

501
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,160
going to triple the uh the engagement

502
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,080
and for women about double the

503
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,440
engagement rate. If you just said hey

504
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,240
you're already in this program why don't

505
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,320
you start engaging? So in the next phase

506
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,320
of that we didn't get from five to 100%.

507
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,840
So, we're we're encouraging and we're

508
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,880
investigating is whether we can use on

509
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,960
the job time to engage with that program

510
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,559
where supervisors would tell eligible

511
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,320
employees, hey, you're you're welcome to

512
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:10,320
use a half an hour a week for 12 weeks

513
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,559
to meet with your health coach. We feel

514
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,400
like that could really boost engagement

515
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:16,559
and we'd love to find collaborators who

516
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,120
would be willing to test that type of an

517
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:20,640
idea. So going forward, what we'd love

518
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,480
to have are finding additional

519
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,960
collaborators who would like us to look

520
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:27,440
over their data and see what their prior

521
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,280
wellness activities have generated, but

522
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,280
then also think about outreach campaigns

523
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,600
or other methods to try to improve

524
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,520
engagement. Maybe experiment with

525
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,840
financial incentives or how they are

526
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,240
announced. And then annual risk

527
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,919
assessments. A lot of firms offer those,

528
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,440
but when you get your results back, they

529
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:45,520
could be kind of confusing. So, how do

530
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,039
you we could test different ways of

531
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,480
messaging

532
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,160
how healthy you are based on those

533
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,679
annual risk assessments. So, thinking

534
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,919
about how do we get an interpretable

535
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:56,400
health score, maybe have some

536
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:58,480
competitions with how you are ranking

537
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:02,240
versus your co-workers and kind of

538
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:03,919
gamify that approach. So, my name again

539
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,160
is Joe Doyle. You could reach me at jj

540
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,640
doymit.edu if you're interested in

541
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,480
collaborating. And um I left a few

542
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,000
minutes here where Anna and I can talk

543
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,280
and hopefully get a few questions from

544
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,720
from the audience. So Anna,

545
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:21,280
>> uh thank thank you Joe for an insightful

546
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,120
and timely discussion. Uh to take us a

547
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:26,480
bit deeper, I'm now happy to hand things

at Sloan and director of HSI. Anna will

550
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,360
be moderating the questions and answer

551
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,600
sessions with Joe and our other speakers

552
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,440
today. Welcome, Anna.

553
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,600
>> Well, thank you so much, Jim, and thank

554
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:44,640
you for giving us the opportunity to

555
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:48,080
share the research that we're doing and

556
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:50,799
to uh I'm thrilled to see so much um

557
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:53,200

558
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:56,080
audience in terms of uh coming to our

559
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:59,440
webinar. Um, and you are of course more

560
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:02,880
than welcome to uh put questions in the

561
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:05,200
Q&A um as we go along and we'll be keep

562
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,440
coming back and um and asking some

563
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:11,280
questions. So Joe, I'd like to start

564
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:15,280
with uh one question which is um what do

565
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:18,799
you hope to achieve with the employee

566
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:20,080
population health lab going forward?

567
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:22,320
>> Well, what I want to do is bring

568
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,520
together leaders in the industry of the

569
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,840
wellness industry. Whether that's

570
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,840
disease management or these wellness

571
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,520
type screening programs with large

572
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,520
employers who are interested in

573
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:34,799
improving the well-being and

574
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:36,240
productivity of their employees. And you

575
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:38,240
know if we could get five to 10

576
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,240
companies coming together. We have an

577
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,480
annual workshop that we is an invite

578
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,320
only workshop among our collaborators to

579
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,120
see what we what are we seeing in in

580
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,880
your data and how can we design

581
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,799
prospective trials to see if we can

582
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,960
improve wellness. And that's in

583
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:56,559
collaboration with about 30 faculty

584
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:58,320
members here at HSI as and hundred or

585
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:02,480
100 plus PhD students across the

586
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:05,120
institute across MIT um who are eager to

587
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,640
uh to grapple with these questions.

588
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,880
>> All right. And we'll actually see some

589
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,360
of that later today in this webinar in

590
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,600
terms of our collaborators and uh one of

591
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:16,720
our PhD students who is actually uh

592
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:20,240
working working on this. Um well another

593
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:22,880
question that I had is um in your in the

594
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,720
first part of your uh presentation you

595
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:28,559
show that you know the Illinois study

596
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:30,000
and the BJ study didn't really show um

597
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,760
you know a difference between the

598
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,320
treatment group and the control group

599
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:36,400
after one year. Do you know if you know

600
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,919
if this study had gone on longer or if

601
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,480
there are if there are additional

602
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:44,559
results that that just takes a long time

603
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:45,919
for um for uh results to show. What what

604
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,760
do you think? Yeah, there was follow-up

605
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:50,799
to the Illinois workplace wellness study

606
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:53,840
that I know that went out two years and

607
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:55,520
they just continue to find um that these

608
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,760
the people who were randomly assigned to

609
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:00,240
have access to the program

610
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:02,799
um they did engage with the program but

611
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:05,600
they did not see improvements in their

612
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:07,760
um in their clinical outcomes or with

613
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,520
their healthcare spending. And so yeah,

614
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,760
if if something might take 10 10 years

615
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,520
to see effects, they're going to be weak

616
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,600
incentives among employers to offer

617
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,960
those types of programs.

618
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,559
And we're thinking about a literature

619
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,360
here saying within a year you're going

620
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:23,280
to see 300% returns. I think people

621
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,760
really don't believe those 300% returns.

622
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,440
They might be closer to 40% returns,

623
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,039
which would be fantastic, but we need to

624
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,280
figure out which programs work for what

625
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,799
type of employee. And for that, we need

626
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,159
this type of rigorous research to get

627
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:36,240
that done.

628
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:39,120
>> Absolutely. So, I just had a question in

629
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:42,000
the Q&A, which is I love the idea of opt

630
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:44,159
out and optin model. Um, do you know if

631
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,400
there's legal compliance or privacy

632
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:49,360
concerns with the wellness partners or

633
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,880
the employers um autoenrolling, you

634
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,880
know, using these messages and

635
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,760
essentially autoenrolling them in a

636
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,960
program,

637
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:58,159
>> right? So, we've certainly had the

638
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:00,159
lawyers at both MIT and at our

639
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,240
collaborator look at what we were doing.

640
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:04,480
And so I feel like from a legal

641
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:07,039
standpoint, we were on solid ground. But

642
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,320
importantly, the the collaborator was

643
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:09,919
already reaching out to eligible

644
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:14,000
employees with emails saying, "Hey, you

645
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:16,240
should join." And um

646
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,760
it the way that you frame that is a

647
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,679
choice. You could say, "Hey, you're

648
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,240
eligible." Or, "Hey, you're already in

649
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:24,240
this program." It's it's quite a subtle

650
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,480
change. And we're not forcing people to

651
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,240
go to meetings. We're not um there's

652
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,280
really it really is a nudge and not a

653
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,200
push. Um, and so I wasn't so surprised

654
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,400
to see an improvement, but I was a

655
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,559
little surprised to see that tripling

656
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,720
among men that they would take that,

657
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:40,640
hey, you're in this program versus, hey,

658
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,960
you're eligible for this program and uh,

659
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,400
and see that big big jump in engagement.

660
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,320
I think the next phase there is to see

661
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:49,840
if we can improve it much higher than

662
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:52,320
15%, get up to 50% with something like

663
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,679
uh, support from your supervisors.

664
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,280
>> All right. Well, thank you so much.

665
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,039
Those those are all the questions I have

666
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:58,159
right now.

667
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:00,400
>> All right. Thanks everyone. I appreciate

668
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:01,520
it and I hope to hear from uh anybody

669
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,600
who would like to collaborate with us.

670
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:06,720
We'd love to talk with you. So enjoy the

671
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,720
rest of the show.
