1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,560
all right thanks everybody I am uh Kent

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:08,000
senson Chief technology officer at

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,880
alonia we are a bioen company really

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,639
taking inspiration from nature and

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:15,240
especially biology to work to solve some

6
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:18,279
of the world's most challenging

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:21,400
environmental issues um I am MIT uh

8
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:23,560
graduate student from further back than

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,680
I care to admit especially after uh the

10
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:28,880
last few presentations but it has been a

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,240
while but alonia was also um a spin out

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,559
of gko bioworks which is another MIT

13
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:36,160
startup so um couple of connections

14
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:37,520
there so while we're working on a number

15
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,440
of different environmental challenges I

16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,480
really want to focus on sustainable

17
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,559
Mining and metals and specifically

18
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,520
bioextraction of rare Earths this is one

19
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:48,120
of the things that uh we're advancing

20
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,559
fairly rapidly just in the last year and

21
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,079
you've heard a lot this morning about

22
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,039
demands for electricity and needs for

23
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:56,440
electrification particularly in terms of

24
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,239
decreasing carbon emissions well you

25
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:01,239
can't do all of that today without a lot

26
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:02,640
more metals so specifically The Rare

27
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:04,519
Earth elements and what the department

28
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,479
of energy calls critical materials or

29
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:10,159
critical minerals things like copper

30
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,000
lithium Cobalt Etc nickel um we we need

31
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,040
a lot more of those Metals so how do we

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,360
mine those sustainably considering that

33
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,479
the mining industry is something like 10

34
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,799
to 20% of global carbon emissions today

35
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:22,880
um depending on how you do that

36
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,960
accounting so we'd like to decrease that

37
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,560
while while still meeting the

38
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,880
electrification needs one way to do that

39
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,119
is to upcycle waste certainly but we

40
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,880
also from a security standpoint need

41
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:36,439
domestic Supply chains of these

42
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:39,159
materials and currently 90 to 95% of the

43
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:41,920
rare earth Global Supply is controlled

44
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:44,520
by China using a very environmentally

45
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,360
intensive chemical intensive process to

46
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,799
separate those rare Earths and we so

47
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:50,200
we'd like to decrease the environmental

48
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:51,759
footprint but also secure domestic

49
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,320
supply chain so we're focused on

50
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,880
recovering Rees from uh potentially a

51
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,520
variety of different waste streams uh we

52
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,240
are also looking at Copper and other

53
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:03,439
critical materials but clearly using

54
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:06,320
biology we want to decrease the volume

55
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,680
of toxic reagents but also as has been

56
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,879
pointed out by some of the other

57
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,520
presenters here do this in a way that is

58
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:14,080
a little more plug andplay to reduce

59
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,040
capex costs and allow for faster return

60
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,280
on investment so what specifically is

61
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,519
the technology well we are using

62
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,280
proteins and as a benchmark we have a

63
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:26,120
protein called land modulin which we can

64
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,840
attach to beads and put in a column very

65
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:31,400
similar to an ion exchange column and

66
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,160
when we run water through those beads uh

67
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,239
with the rare earth metals and and

68
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,680
specifically these are some of the

69
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,720
lodide metals what you see is really

70
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:41,319
interesting because biology biological

71
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,200
proteins are very good at sequestering

72
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:45,400
very specific metals because they either

73
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,200
need them for metabolism or to reduce

74
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,360
toxicity or a variety of other

75
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,159
biological processes so you have all

76
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,120
this other metal that's in water like

77
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:54,640
acid mine drainage that's passing

78
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,319
directly through the column with no

79
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,440
sorption to our protein or our beads the

80
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:02,560
three rare Earths are the lines here you

81
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,080
see about 30 to 40 bed volumes before we

82
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,799
start to see breakthrough of those so

83
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,560
we're seeing really good specific

84
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:11,480
sorption of those compounds in that

85
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,560
column and then what's great is when we

86
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,440
elute the metals off of that we're

87
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,799
getting a concentration of about 10 to

88
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,480
45x with some of our preliminary data

89
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:22,680
here at something north of about 90%

90
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,760
Purity for those mixed rare Earths so

91
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,080
very very different solution coming out

92
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,680
than went

93
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,640
in now where we go from here is we're

94
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,480
partnered with a global Mining Company

95
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:37,000
already at a US mine site uh actually a

96
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:38,680
copper mine for initial testing uh with

97
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,480
a mine impacted water that looks

98
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,439
something like the one in the picture

99
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,480
that's only about less than 10 parts per

100
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:46,319
million of rare Earths but has thousands

101
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,720
of parts per million of things like iron

102
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:51,200
and aluminum and other competing Metals

103
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,239
so we want to remove those and we're

104
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,879
we're very excited that we are seeing

105
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:58,159
now um some very good pre-treatment

106
00:03:55,879 --> 00:04:00,159
results that allow us to easily remove

107
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,599
things like aluminum and iron and then

108
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,680
in the previous chart I already showed

109
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,319
you how calcium magnesium and a lot of

110
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,680
other metals that are in that uh

111
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:09,120
material go right through the column and

112
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,239
what we're showing on the bottom here is

113
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:15,200
in addition to that we're able to see

114
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,519
multiple cycles of reuse of the protein

115
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,239
so we can regenerate the protein right

116
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:23,240
now we've got no loss of capacity after

117
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:24,880
five cycles of absorption and desorption

118
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,919
um when you get to about 10 Cycles you

119
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,440
are starting to lose some capacity there

120
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:29,880
and this is where some of our protein

121
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,360
engineering will come in we do need need

122
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,759
to increase that to make the economics

123
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:37,560
start to look really good but it's very

124
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:39,960
promising to be at this stage right now

125
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,919
uh we plan to go to the field in uh the

126
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:44,320
first quarter of 2025 and actually be on

127
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:46,600
the M site doing this at a small Scale

128
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,240
Pilot scale so we're certainly

129
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,680
interested in Partners who are end users

130
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,800
um whether that's mining companies

131
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,080
energy companies uh electronics

132
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,680
companies and and defense also uses a

133
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:00,440
lot of rare Earths we we need access to

134
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,840
more Wast streams that contain these

135
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:05,800
materials so that could be E-Waste Urban

136
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:08,720
mining um other Industrial Waste streams

137
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:10,840
produced uh waters for example from the

138
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,000
fracking industry have Rees and then

139
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,639
there's a number of different waist

140
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,400
streams that have these Metals in them

141
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,039
and of course deployment Partners we're

142
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,639
not going to be the whole solution we're

143
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:22,199
going to be part of an integrated system

144
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:23,960
at some point and so other partners who

145
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:26,520
want to work with us on this are are of

146
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:28,560
great interest and I've been focused on

147
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,440
on just the rare earth Market but just

148
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,960
to let you know we are also very much

149
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,800
involved in emerging contaminants

150
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:36,440
especially past treatment from water um

151
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,080
as well as a couple of other sustainable

152
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:41,120
mining Solutions so uh hope to see you

153
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:43,370
stop by our table over in the other room

154
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:47,120
and uh thank you appreciate the time

155
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:47,120
[Applause]
