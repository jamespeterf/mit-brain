1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,800
What I'm going to do now is going to

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,400
reach in here. I'm going to take a

3
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:08,000
dollar bill and I'm going to put it in

4
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,200
the flame. Just like that.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,280
>> Was that too fast?

6
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,200
>> How is that dollar bill burning up so

7
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,720
quickly? It's actually not a dollar

8
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,440
bill. It's called flash paper. And

9
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,359
[music] it's paper that has been treated

10
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,840
with chemicals to make it burn quickly

11
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,439
and leave no ashes. Practically, what

12
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,279
that means is that you soak [music] the

13
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:28,400
paper in a mixture of concentrated

14
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:30,240
nitric and sulfuric acids. The cellulose

15
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,960
in the paper then reacts with the acid

16
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,680
to produce nitrated cellulose and water.

17
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,520
Now the nitro group, the NO2 is the

18
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,440
reactive group and it can be very

19
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,600
reactive depending on the molecule that

20
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,120
it's in. You've no doubt heard of

21
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,079
nitroglycerin

22
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,079
or [music] TNT. All of these molecules

23
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,640
have nitro groupoups in them. [music]

24
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:53,920
And it's the nitro or NO2 groups that

25
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,840
make these molecules explosive.
