1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:06,480
when I got my first smartphone and I

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,360
landed on YouTube I went looking for

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,880
answers to some of the questions I had

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:13,120
and then I found this entire world of

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,679
people who actually had answers and all

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,720
this other knowledge that was out there

7
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:19,039
for

8
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:21,800
free I'm Sarah Hansen for this episode

9
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:26,119
of chalk radio I sat down with two very

10
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:29,279
special guests hi I'm Emanuel igazi I'm

11
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:33,600
a data scientist a creative a learner

12
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:36,200
and AI SP I'm from campala Uganda East

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,760
Africa hi I'm Michael Jordan Pilgreen

14
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:41,520
I'm from Memphis Tennessee I'm a learner

15
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:44,480
an educator an engineer and a bridge

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,360
builder and it's a pleasure to be here

17
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,800
today Michael and Emanuel are two of the

18
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,800
millions of people who have used MIT

19
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:55,079
open courseware in their Journeys as

20
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:57,840
lifelong Learners after connecting with

21
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:00,440
ocw they connected with each other and

22
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,600
are now good friends despite living on

23
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,280
two different

24
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,720
continents in this conversation they

25
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:09,439
explain how they've both used ocw to

26
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:12,080
transform their lives and later they

27
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:14,560
tell us about the open Learners podcast

28
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,360
an exciting new season of chalk radio

29
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,200
that they're hosting that will bring

30
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:21,759
stories like Theirs to listeners and

31
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:24,159
Learners around the world so what

32
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:27,360
exactly is an open

33
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:31,360
learner so an open learner can be a lot

34
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:34,200
of things I think Emanuel and I within

35
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:38,079
the context of open courseware and MIT

36
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:41,159
specifically think it's anybody that is

37
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,439
engaging with material and hopes of

38
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:46,119
learning

39
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:49,320
anything and we specifically call it

40
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:52,280
open Learners because going back to when

41
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:56,119
we first met being from Memphis

42
00:01:52,280 --> 00:02:00,360
Tennessee and Emanuel from Calo

43
00:01:56,119 --> 00:02:03,680
Uganda it was so fascinating that we

44
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:06,479
both had experienced a certain level of

45
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:10,119
anti-intellectualism growing

46
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:14,239
up and I think as adults we're both at

47
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:17,319
the point now where we can be open about

48
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:20,680
learning and I know that's a weird

49
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:23,280
concept to wrap your brain around but it

50
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,879
finally feels good and like

51
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,319
accepted it is something to be proud

52
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:30,800
about being proud of being a learner

53
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,840
everybody comes out of a fouryear degree

54
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,599
nowadays especially in the United States

55
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,800
and they think they need to be an expert

56
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:41,800
and they try to put on this Persona that

57
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:46,040
they do know everything and it's okay to

58
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:48,360
admit I don't you know and and I'm

59
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,599
willing and open about the fact that I'm

60
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,920
still

61
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:54,200
learning I was curious to know how

62
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,680
Michael and emanuel's learning Journeys

63
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,680
eventually LED them to MIT open

64
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,360
courseware I've always been interested

65
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,959
in finding out

66
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,000
how things work and more so how we work

67
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,959
as human beings uh I know this is going

68
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,799
to sound cliche but I was that kid who

69
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:12,519
used to look up at the stars and wonder

70
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:14,280
what all of this is what are we what is

71
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:16,640
consciousness what is life how comes I

72
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,480
can talk and that tree can't you know

73
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,840
and the further I grew up the more I

74
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,879
went looking for these answers to these

75
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:25,280
questions that father led me to the path

76
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,680
of psychology philosophy and trying to

77
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,159
answer the great questions of the world

78
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,519
how I got to ocw was that through my

79
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:36,159
hobbies what I like I came through

80
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,879
psychology I was trying to just you know

81
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,840
at any point in life at any stage in my

82
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,159
life I always have a

83
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:46,280
psychological kind of thing that I'm

84
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:48,120
watching or studying you know just for

85
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,239
my own interest just to try and

86
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,959
understand I'm still on this journey

87
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:54,360
trying to understand who we are what the

88
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,599
world is and you know the wise the house

89
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,879
the great questions of the world I'm

90
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:00,680
still on that

91
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:03,959
journey I was led to been learning an

92
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:06,599
MIT open course where doing a very

93
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:11,040
stressful and desperate part of my

94
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:15,000
life I am trained as a poet from my

95
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:17,320
undergrad degree during the covid-19

96
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,959
pandemic all

97
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:24,560
the artwork jobs out there both public

98
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:27,040
and private facing sort of evaporated

99
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,520
overnight and I had to figure out what

100
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:33,960
was next and I found an introduction to

101
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:36,280
finance course by Andrew low and I fell

102
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:39,680
in love with his Charisma and his

103
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:42,320
ability to Captivate an audience and

104
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,800
that led me to discovering Gary guinsler

105
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:48,000
you know the SEC

106
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:51,120
commissioner and I was just shocked that

107
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,120
he had multiple courses online for free

108
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,520
where he's articulating and dialoguing

109
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:59,840
with students in a masterful way about

110
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:02,000
Capital markets even for people that may

111
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:06,400
not be interested in capital Marcus he

112
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:10,320
was able to digest these very complex

113
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:13,400
interconnected Concepts and simplify

114
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:17,039
them in a way that everyday Learners

115
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:20,400
could interact with and that fascinated

116
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:23,000
me and it encouraged me to continue down

117
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:26,120
the financial technology

118
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,160
path so how exactly did these two open

119
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:31,080
Learners connect and end up co-hosting a

120
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:34,800
special season of chalk

121
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:36,960
radio so after watching the psychology

122
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,880
lessons because this was one of the most

123
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,800
profound like I said I'd been doing

124
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,720
courses on this but not from like the

125
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,120
top top institutions so when I found the

126
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:49,000
top instiution was honestly different so

127
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,479
I was like this is amazing does this

128
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,639
professor know what he's doing for the

129
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,199
world and I remember sitting one day and

130
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,720
I'm like you know what I want to thank

131
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:58,360
this person I'm done with this coures

132
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,039
cuz this is something groundbreaking so

133
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:02,160
when I saw the psychology profess Prof I

134
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:05,120
wrote out to him like thank you for this

135
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,160
amazing course you're doing amazing work

136
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,440
I just wanted to thank the professor and

137
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,759
then CT wrote me

138
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,360
back for those of you who are new to the

139
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:18,560
podcast the Kurt he's referring to here

140
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:21,080
is Kurt Newton the director of MIT open

141
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,440
courseware and he asked if they could

142
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:25,840
share my story I didn't understand what

143
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,319
that meant at the time but I was like

144
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:31,120
okay cool and then in that email they

145
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,639
sent me a link to Michael's story we're

146
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,919
going to write a story about you and

147
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,479
it's a story like this one so one day

148
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,639
I'm playing around my LinkedIn and I see

149
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:42,319
an invitation from Michael I'm like wait

150
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:44,000
I know this gentleman so I accept the

151
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,520
invitation then I write him back I'm

152
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,599

00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:52,039
your story it was a great piece uh thank

154
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:54,680
you and Michael wrote back like do you

155
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:58,080
want to get on a call I was like why not

156
00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:01,319
so we get on a call I remember that day

157
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:04,280
my power even went out

158
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:06,680
yeah so I had this laptop that had like

159
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:08,840
20% battery left I was like either way

160
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:12,680
I'm taking this call if we talk for only

161
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:15,400
like five minutes it's okay so we talk

162
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:18,919
Michael was it blew my mind that this

163
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:20,560
was this person across the continent but

164
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:23,800
then as we kept talking we found that we

165
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:26,199
have similar interests we both have a

166
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:29,520
background in arts we both L philosophy

167
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:31,319
and psychology we are both on this

168
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,199
journey to kind of transition our

169
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:35,840
careers were both and it was just

170
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,560
mind-blowing to me and that this what

171
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,520
brought all this together was this

172
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:43,599
platform this ocw platform and since

173
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:46,840
then we've been talking almost every

174
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:49,240
week here at ocw we love how open

175
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:51,159
learning and open education can forge

176
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:55,280
the kinds of relationships that Michael

177
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:57,479
and Emanuel have it inspired an idea how

178
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,560
could we amplify this community-building

179
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:02,720
effect of open learning to even more

180
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:05,960
people and so a new podcast was

181
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,720
born we are just trying to do or give

182
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,879
people what me and Michael

183
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:13,479
experienced like these were two people

184
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:15,800
from two separate continents other side

185
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:17,800
of the world ours apart but then you get

186
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,280
to talking and then you find you kind of

187
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:24,560
have similar interests and now you get

188
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:27,000
to know this person and then you get to

189
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,800
start this commune with this person they

190
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
become your friend they become your

191
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,519
mentor they become your colleague

192
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,399
building that community and that

193
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:39,839
connection between Learners across the

194
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:41,479
world despite everything despite

195
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:45,480
differentiated

196
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:48,320
context and different you know

197
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:50,920
Lifestyles all these things that people

198
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,640
are still fundamentally the same and

199
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:56,839
going through the same struggles going

200
00:08:53,640 --> 00:09:00,480
through the same self-doubts When

201
00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:02,880
approaching learning really giv giving a

202
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,440
platform for people to continue to share

203
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:08,800
their stories and

204
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:11,120
hopefully that will serve as

205
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,959
inspiration along the way for other

206
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,440
Learners right just

207
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:19,320
another support system to know that

208
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,680
you're not alone in this journey when

209
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,519
you're going to learn it's about the

210
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,800
people that you can go along with

211
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:29,040
because in schools that's easy you're

212
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:30,120
all in one Community you're in one space

213
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,839
you know

214
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:37,480
but online learning and open learning as

215
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:39,720
a whole it's kind of vague and it's not

216
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:42,600
so clear written but in school you know

217
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,279
I'm in class with 70 people you know so

218
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:47,279
that's what we're trying to give people

219
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:49,480
with this open learning platform also

220
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,760
maybe learning in your culture is an act

221
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:55,399
of defiance right you know

222
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:58,240
especially given the global context not

223
00:09:55,399 --> 00:10:01,800
everybody can just openly learn whatever

224
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,959
they want and I think an inspiration for

225
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,760
change we are looking at talking to

226
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:10,240
people from every continent every

227
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:12,079
background every culture whichever

228
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,560
tradition is constrained those who can

229
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,680
learn those who can't learn just to make

230
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:18,600
them know that whatever it is you're

231
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,360
going through it's scary yes but you're

232
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,600
not alone he's another person from the

233
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,279
other side of the continent who went

234
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,640
through the same thing and they made it

235
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:28,920
and it was okay and we just want you to

236
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:31,320
know that and that's the purpose of open

237
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,320
learning
