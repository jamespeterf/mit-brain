00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:04,400
hi everyone thank you for having me um

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,879
my name is Emma Flynn I'm from the

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,440
University of Pittsburgh where I work in

4
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:09,760
Dr David CO's lab so in our lab we

5
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,400
develop computational tools for

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,080
structure-based drug Discovery so in

7
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,679
structure-based drug Discovery we want

8
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,520
to use our knowledge of a Target protein

9
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:18,080
structure to find a ligant that can bind

10
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,680
to this protein for some therapeutic

11
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,119
effect so how do we find this Li so

12
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,599
there's two main categories of

13
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:25,840
techniques one is virtual screening and

14
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:27,560
in Virtual screening because you're

15
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,039
screening because you're screening

16
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,759
databases of known commercially

17
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,520
available molecules then whatever you

18
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:34,480
find is commercially available and ready

19
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,079
for testing but the drawback of this is

20
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,680
that it takes a really long time to do

21
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,960
the screening and that time scales with

22
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,920
the size of the database the other

23
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,480
category is denovo ligan Generation so

24
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,600
recently there have been deep learning

25
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,840
models that have emerged that are

26
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,559
capable of creating new lians for a

27
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,480
given protein pocket in just a matter of

28
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:52,600
seconds but the field has found some

29
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,879
issues with the validity of these

30
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,559
molecules and the synthesizability and

31
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,399
finding a synthesis pathway if one

32
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,760
exists for this molecule is very timec

33
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,399
consuming so in we're really excited

34
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,119
about pharmacophore search which is a

35
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,880
subcategory of virtual screening that

36
00:01:04,119 --> 00:01:08,479
takes a fraction of the time a pH a

37
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,159
pharmacophore consists of spheres of

38
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,799
interaction that are described by 3D

39
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,280
coordinates and a feature type such as a

40
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:15,799
hydrogen donor um and then the Spheres

41
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,600
of interaction can be customized to

42
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:20,079
align with certain features in your

43
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,680
target protein pocket that support ligan

44
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:25,640
binding so then you can use the phor to

45
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,600
query databases of molecules in order to

46
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,119
find results that match with your phora

47
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,520
and eliminate a large fraction of the

48
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,000
ligans to save a lot of time so

49
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,280
traditionally these pharmacophores are

50
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,520
made by using a reference Lian as you

51
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,680
can see here with our reference

52
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:40,240
pharmacophore and then domain expertise

53
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,960
is required to basically tweak the

54
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,079
Pharmaca for so you can get a unique set

55
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:47,360
of Lian results so we wanted to design a

56
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:49,240
way that we could more easily and faster

57
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,040
generate Pharmaca fores that give us a

58
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:53,320
set of high quality and unique Lian

59
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,600
results when we query with them so to do

60
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,159
this we created PHA Forge which is a

61
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,759
diffusion model that's capable of

62
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:00,640
generating a Pharmaca for for a given

63
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:01,600
protein pocket with a user specified

64
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,399
number of

65
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,439
centers um so with phic for we're able

66
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,560
to generate 30 plus Pharmaca fors in a

67
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:10,280
couple of minutes the animation here

68
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,840
shows the sampling process for

69
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,440
generating a new Pharmaca for That's

70
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,879
Unique from the reference liant but is

71
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,760
able to come up with lians that will

72
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:20,519
bind to this pocket as well the main

73
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,800
issue that we faced with this project

74
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:24,560
was evaluating Pharmaca for Quality so

75
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,120
we can have we can measure the validity

76
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,440
of the Pharmaca for and make sure that

77
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,920
there exists a corresponding structural

78
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,640
feature in the pocket that will match

79
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,400
with our pharmacophore centers but a

80
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,319
pharmacophore is really only as good as

81
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,319
its performance and downstream screening

82
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:38,760
tasks so we screened with our

83
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:40,720
pharmacophores and compared these

84
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,400
results to denovo generated lians

85
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,920
specifically pocketo and diff sbdd where

86
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,440
pocketo is an autoaggressive based

87
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:50,239
method and diff sbdd is also a diffusion

88
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:53,560
method um so we generated 30 plus

89
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:55,400
pharmacophores for um the uh due data

90
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,920
set which consists of 102 protein

91
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,360
targets and then we screened the kemell

92
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,040
database with our pharmacophores and

93
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,360
compared these results to the NOA

94
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,480
generated lians for all the duude

95
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,720
targets so our initial results can be

96
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,760
shown in the top half of this violin

97
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,400
plot the lighter color um and this shows

98
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,840
the minimization which is the local

99
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,239
optimal pose for the protein for the LI

100
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,720
in the pocket so from this we can see

101
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:18,959
that we perform about the same as diff

102
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,879
sbdd while pocket Simo outperforms both

103
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,239
methods so we were still happy with this

104
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,040
result because this means that our

105
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,840
pharmacophores are capable of finding

106
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,720
lians that bind with as that bind with

107
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,480
as high Affinity or high predicted

108
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,439
Affinity as Li generated specifically

109
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,959
for the pocket but one of the things

110
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:36,560
that we notice when we visualize these

111
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,799
molecules the top performing ones from

112
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,840
all methods is that the generated lians

113
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,519
were often in highly strained poses and

114
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,280
red very tightly into the pocket um so

115
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,480
we calculated the strain energy for all

116
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,040
of these for all these molecules and

117
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,599
found that the generated lians had a

118
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,040
higher strain energy than those from the

119
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:54,360
phic for query so we REM minimized and

120
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,560
docked and found the results on the

121
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,840
bottom half the dark color of the plot

122
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,840
and we see that with the D strain

123
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,480
molecules in the minimized poses the

124
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,480
phic forge ones stay about the same

125
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,200
which makes sense cuz these are

126
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,640
commercially available already existing

127
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,400
compounds but the generated lians show a

128
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,519
decreased affinity for the pocket

129
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,560
because in order to have the high

130
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,920
Affinity they needed to be in unnatural

131
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,280
poses so this is a promising result that

132
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,079
shows that with Pharmaca Forge we're

133
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,959
able to overcome some of the main

134
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:20,959
problems facing denovo generation of

135
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,400
ligans and that our pharmacophores are

136
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,800
able to find quality ligans that bind

137
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,400
with high predicted definity to the

138
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,000
pocket if you're interested in learning

139
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,199
more please come see me at my poster

140
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,199
thank you
