1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,240
so the clinical genetic testing sphere

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:09,440
is increasingly large these days I live

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,400
very solidly in this diagnostic space

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,320
where we have a patient with a series of

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,720
phenotypes suggestes of a genetic

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,960
disorder that is being sent for genetic

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,279
testing to try and find an answer either

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,640
a unifying diagnosis that explains all

9
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:27,000
of the phenotypes or maybe multiple

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,519
diagnosis that together explain them

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,640
however this clinical care Continuum is

12
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,320
AAS basically expanding more towards the

13
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:37,079
preventive side in genetic testing where

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,800
you may have some predictive tests for

15
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,960
susceptibility for adult onset or even

16
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:45,680
childhood onset conditions in the form

17
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:48,640
of newborn screening um prenatal testing

18
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:52,840
or Carrier testing um to help with re

19
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:55,879
reproductive planning Etc um so in these

20
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:58,120
different forums of genetic testing well

21
00:00:55,879 --> 00:01:00,760
the content that you might include in

22
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:03,440
these tests and the types variants you

23
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:05,680
would report back may change the general

24
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,759
process for classifying Gene disease

25
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,119
relationships and variant pathogen as

26
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:13,400
they should not change so I'm going to

27
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,960
spend a fair amount of time today

28
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:18,400
talking through some honestly pretty

29
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,880
onerous guidelines that the field has

30
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,600
developed for classifying variant

31
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,520
cogenic and classifying Gene disease

32
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,119
relationships and before I take you

33
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,600
through those I just want to give you a

34
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:33,159
sense of why we go through this process

35
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,640
why we put ourselves through this um and

36
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:38,439
it's really that the results of genetic

37
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:41,040
testing as with many other medical tasks

38
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:43,720
does impact lives so it's very critical

39
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,320
that we get these interpretations right

40
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:48,200
um over interpretation of these task can

41
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,159
lead to a patient for example getting

42
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:53,520
diagnosed with a disease they may not

43
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,320
have this may then result in additional

44
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,759
follow-up tests that have their own

45
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:01,079
costs and risks associated with them and

46
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:03,159
it doesn't just apply to that one

47
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:05,439
individual who got the genetic testing

48
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:07,200
originally they may then go and do

49
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,800
Cascade screening and their family

50
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,400
members so it can expand out to impact

51
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,280
the entire family as well and impact

52
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,440
reproductive decisionmaking so the

53
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:19,080
article at the back here is actually one

54
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:22,120
from the Atlantic where um they're

55
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:24,319
describing uh the story of a family who

56
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:27,120
had some abnormalities reported in a

57
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:29,200
fenus fetus on ultrasound ended up doing

58
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,959
some pren needle genetic testing related

59
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,800
to that and received a likely pathogenic

60
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:34,879
variant on their prenatal genetic

61
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,879
testing

62
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:40,360
report um the lab interpreted that

63
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:42,120
variant to the standards at the time and

64
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,519
to the best varability given the

65
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,560
evidence they had at the time um but it

66
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:48,400
turned out that several years later that

67
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,720
variant and the family decided to

68
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,599
terminate the pregnancy based on that

69
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,760
information but it turned out that

70
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:57,840
several several years later um that

71
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,959
variant was reclassified to a likely

72
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,159
benign variant so that's obviously an

73
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:05,319
undesirable outcome um on the flip side

74
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:07,640
the under interpretation of genetic

75
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:09,879
testing results May lead to a patient

76
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:12,239
not getting a diagnosis that they

77
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:15,120
perhaps could have received based on the

78
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,080
identification of a variant and the

79
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,440
evidence available for that variant at

80
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,840
the time obviously this could lead to

81
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,000
missed treatment opportunities again

82
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,080
both for that one patient being tested

83
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,840
as well as their family members and we

84
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:32,120
already have examples of lawsuits um

85
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:34,239
related to these kind of mistakes so the

86
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,000
the interpretation does matter and

87
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:41,000
that's why we spend a lot of time trying

88
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,360
to standardize it so in um a the world

89
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,400
of a clinical geneticist who is trying

90
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,280
to interpret the results of a genetic

91
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:51,920
test we are constantly considering two

92
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:54,439
different axes of implication

93
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,239
and that being the variant level

94
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:59,120
evidence which we're depicting here on a

95
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:01,799
y AIS and the gene level evidence on an

96
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,200
xais in this figure which was still ined

97
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:07,000
in McArthur so in this top right

98
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:10,040
quadrant we have a very wellestablished

99
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,680
pathogenic variant in a very well

100
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:15,480
established disease genes so the example

101
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:18,160
here is the Delta 508 variant in cftr

102
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,280
the most common cause of cystic fibrosis

103
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,880
very well

104
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,639
established even in these

105
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,120
wellestablished genes we're going to

106
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,840
encounter some variant for which we have

107
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,320
a lot less information so this would be

108
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:33,919
a varant of Uncertain significance or a

109
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:36,680
v us for example in the cftr gene as we

110
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,479
move back down along the xaxis there

111
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,120
you're also going to encounter

112
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,919
especially if you do broader scale

113
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:45,080
genetic testing some variants that we

114
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:47,039
have little evidence for and also genes

115
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:51,479
that we have little little evidence for

116
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:54,919
so this is a gus a gus or a gene of

117
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:57,199
Uncertain significance and some

118
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:59,400
people not much we can do with these

119
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,360
these really don't belong on genetic

120
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,280
test reports at this point until more

121
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,120
evidence

122
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:07,000
emerges um but what I want to especially

123
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,840
point out in this figure is that this

124
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,800
top left quadent really cannot exist you

125
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,919
cannot have a variant that you are

126
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,400
confident is pathogenic for a given

127
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:20,520
disorder if the gene that that variant

128
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:23,199
Falls within or impacts is not

129
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:25,520
Disorder so let's talk about how we

130
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:28,440
decide whether a gene is implicated in a

131
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:31,120
given disorder to set the stage a little

132
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:33,759
bit here I want to give some um some

133
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,080
framework of where we're at with Gene

134
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,479
Discovery overall so this is a nice

135
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,240
figure from the center brelan genomics

136
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:44,440
where these kind of blue green Hues are

137
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:46,280
the subset of the protein coding genes

138
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:49,000
within the human genome that we have

139
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:51,280
some evidence have a role in a melan

140
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,280
condition whereas the yellow and orange

141
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:57,199
shoes are those genes where we just

142
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:59,720
don't have um any known in uh

143
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,240
implication in a melan condition just

144
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,560
yet so that's obviously the vast

145
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,520
majority but what's really interesting

146
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:08,240
to see here although we've made great

147
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,479
progress in gene Discovery is that if

148
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,520
you look at human constraint data and

149
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:14,240
mouse model data there is evidence that

150
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:17,199
there's still another in the range of

151
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,840
10,000 melan disease genes to be

152
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:22,039
discovered so as we're working through

153
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,400
particularly in broader like exom and

154
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:26,960
genome testing the types of variants we

155
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,840
find you're going to see a big spectrum

156
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,520
of Gene Disease Association evidence Lev

157
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,400
from the very wellestablished all the

158
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,280
way down to the

159
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:38,759
Undiscovered and even if we hone in just

160
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:40,960
on those genes that have had some

161
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:43,440
implication in human disease there's a

162
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,759
lot of variability at least historically

163
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,840
in the field in how that information is

164
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,880
integrated and classified ultimately so

165
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:53,759
as a read out of this this is an

166
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:56,520
admittedly a bit um outdated chart of

167
00:06:53,759 --> 00:07:00,319
the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy panel

168
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:02,759
testing um available at 14 different us

169
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:05,240
clinical labs and hopefully what you can

170
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:07,639
appreciate um is that the number of

171
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,840
genes that are included on that panel

172
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:11,960
actually varies pretty widely between

173
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,280
the labs right so you can see that's a

174
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:16,919
lot of labs are in the range of 20 genes

175
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,960
whereas others are way up over a 100

176
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:20,960
there are several reasons for this but

177
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,680
one of the main reasons is just

178
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,199
differences in how labs are deciding to

179
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,080
integrate the information that's

180
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,840
available in the literature to decide

181
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:31,520
this Gene has a worthy enough associ a

182
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,800
with human disease to include it on

183
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,599
their

184
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:39,440
panel so um to begin to standardize the

185
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:42,440
field in this respect the clingen group

186
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,800
has put out um these nice uh

187
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:47,720
evidence-based framework for classifying

188
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,360
Gene disease validity before I go into

189
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,960
that we're going to talk a lot about

190
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:55,639
clingen today so let me just introduce

191
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:58,879
what clingen is this is a large nah

192
00:07:55,639 --> 00:08:01,360
funded project um that has three major

193
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:05,080
centers one of which is led by Heidi

194
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:07,240
gream here at the bod and really their

195
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:09,000
motive is to create an authoritative

196
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,440
Central resource that defines the

197
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,080
clinical relevance of genes and variants

198
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,800
for use in both clinical genetic testing

199
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,800
as well as research so clingen has four

200
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,520
major Focus areas Gene disease validity

201
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:25,120
variant pathogenicity dosed sensitivity

202
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,960
and clinical Astron ability and in

203
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,159
addition to doing a massive amount of

204
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,360
curation work in these four categories

205
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:33,479
they also committed to disseminating

206
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,479
their knowledge broadly and freely to

207
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:38,760
the community um so you will see many

208
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,360
examples of really critical cling gen

209
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:44,000
developed resources that we use in both

210
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:47,040
Gene and variant

211
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,959
classification um so back to the gene

212
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,240
disease validity guidelines for a

213
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:53,600
clingen again this is an evidence-based

214
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,760
framework that considers both genetic

215
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,240
evidence the case level evidence family

216
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,079
segregation data Etc as well as

217
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,040
experimental evidence like your mouse

218
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:05,680
models Etc um and I will say though this

219
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:09,480
is the original paper on this framework

220
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:12,320
published in 2017 clinten has iterated

221
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:14,279
on it a bit um and so you can actually

222
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,079
find their current standard operating

223
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:18,000
procedures for Gene disease validity

224
00:09:16,079 --> 00:09:20,040
classifications on the Clinton website

225
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,040
which linked at the bottom

226
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:25,880
here so one of the major contributions

227
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:28,600
of this paper in addition to the

228
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:30,519
framework was defining the terminology

229
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,920
we used to describe the strength of

230
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:36,240
disease Rel Gene disease relationships

231
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:39,120
prior to these guidelines every lab kind

232
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:42,959
of had their own way of describing these

233
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:45,200
right so one lab may have a red to Green

234
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:48,079
scale where a red Gene is one that is

235
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,120
inated in the z a green Gene is not

236
00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:52,640
other labs also use that red to Green

237
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:55,040
scale but had the opposite scale so that

238
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,160
a red was not implicated disease so it

239
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,959
was just hard to align on this when we

240
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:01,279
weren't even speaking the same language

241
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,240
so this is really important to Define

242
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,839
these

243
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,920
terms all the way from definitive at the

244
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:09,000
highest level of implication and disease

245
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:11,720
down to no evidence reported and even a

246
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,279
few categories of conflicting evidence

247
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:16,519
reported as

248
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:19,079
well it's a points spased framework so

249
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:20,760
you will see if you look at the top here

250
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:22,680
that the genetic evidence can be

251
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:25,360
assigned anywhere in the range of 0 to

252
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:28,399
12 points the experimental evidence in

253
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,519
the range of 0 to six points and then in

254
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,000
the middle you can see see after you add

255
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:34,959
those points together the final

256
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,880
classification you end at an important

257
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:39,399
thing to note is that given that the

258
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,720
experimental evidence is limited to six

259
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:43,800
points total you cannot get above a

260
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,920
limited classification without at least

261
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:48,320
some human data supporting the gene

262
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,560
disease relationship which makes sense I

263
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,360
think if you're considering a a clinical

264
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,880
implication of

265
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,959
this um another thing you might notice

266
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,680
looking at these categories is that the

267
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,959
strong and definitive categories

268
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:03,279
actually have the same number of points

269
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:05,200
the distinction between these categories

270
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,839
is really that the gene has stood the

271
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,519
test of time as they say that there's

272
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,880
been at least three years since the

273
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,440
initial publication of the Gene and no

274
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:16,320
significant conflicting evidence has has

275
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:19,959
come up in the mean

276
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:22,639
time so in addition to standardizing how

277
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:25,800
labs are interpreting the relationships

278
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:29,360
between genes and diseases um this is

279
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:31,760
very important for how labs are defining

280
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,800
tests as well so shortly after the

281
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,839
publication of this framework the

282
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:38,240
American College of medical genetics and

283
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,560
genomics Incorporated this into their

284
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,959
technical standards for the design of

285
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:46,040
diagnostic sequencing panels

286
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:48,160
recommending that sequencing panel tests

287
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:50,480
should really only include genes in

288
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,680
these definitive strong and moderate

289
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,760
categories and that limited evidence

290
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,440
genes for the most part do not belong on

291
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:58,399
these panels and should only really be

292
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,480
addressed in more broadscale sequencing

293
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:04,079
like Exel and G you

294
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,880
know um so back to our framework let's

295
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:08,360
walk through what it might look like to

296
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:11,880
use this framework in the real world so

297
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:15,320
let's say you were

298
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:19,120
yeah um about those panels given that

299
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:20,959
genomics is changing every year do these

300
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,920
under the hood are they running exom or

301
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:25,000
is it just Gene panels yeah great

302
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,680
question so under the hood the vast

303
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,440
majority of Labs at this point are at

304
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,560
least on an exone backbone and

305
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,920
increasing even going to a genome

306
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,240
backbone and there are huge advantages

307
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:37,560
to this so that when you want to add

308
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:40,040
genes as they are discovered it's just a

309
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:42,320
matter of bioinformatically unmasking

310
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:45,360
them versus having to create a new Pinel

311
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:48,240
with new capture

312
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,720
yeah all right um so we're doing an

313
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,839
exone sequence we're analyzing it for an

314
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,160
adult with dilated cardiomyopathy trying

315
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:58,040
to find an answer for this patient say

316
00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:01,399
you found a variant in the abcc9 gene

317
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:03,160
right you may say go to Omen see well

318
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:05,079
you know what is the role of this Gene

319
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:07,240
and disease and you might be very

320
00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:10,240
encouraged to see oh look there's a line

321
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:12,160
for dominant dilated cardiomyopathy

322
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,399
maybe this is very important for my

323
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,040
patient you might also do a little

324
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,079
Googling and see that this Gene is

325
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,639
included on some diagnostic panels for

326
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:22,440
dilated

327
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:24,320
cardiomyopathy um so you do your due

328
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:26,079
diligence and you say you'll take this

329
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,279
through the clingen gene curation

330
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,959
framework and I know this text is a

331
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:33,040
little hard but I will walk you through

332
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:35,000
the data um what you will find upon

333
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:37,240
doing a literature search is actually

334
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,639
that there is only really one paper that

335
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:42,519
convincingly finds variance in this Gene

336
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:45,680
in a patient with isolated dilated

337
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:47,880
cardiomyopathy this paper from 2004 and

338
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,680
there are actually two prob bands within

339
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:53,240
that paper with DCM one of them had a

340
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:55,240
frame shift variance so this was a loss

341
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:58,320
of function variant and in the framework

342
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:00,120
this would normally get you 1.5 points

343
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,759
but when you're looking around in Nomad

344
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,279
you actually notice that there's a

345
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:07,680
nearby Fram ship variant in Nomad not

346
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:09,519
the same one but a nearby one that has a

347
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,880
frequency that's a little high that you

348
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:14,000
would expect for DCM so you decide to

349
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:15,839
downgrade those points a little bit to a

350
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,480
total of one point

351
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:20,720
there you also find that there's a

352
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,560
missense variant in a proband with ACM

353
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,440
in that paper reported as well that

354
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,360
missense variant had some functional

355
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:29,480
studies to suggest it impacted the

356
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:31,880
protein so that qualifies for 0.5 Five

357
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:34,399
Points that's all that you found for

358
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:36,480
your genetic evidence but looking into

359
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,399
some of the functional studies that are

360
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,720
available you find that there is

361
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:43,880
expression in cardiac tissues which gets

362
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:47,399
you 0 Five Points you find that there is

363
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:49,959
an animal model with some cardiomyopathy

364
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:51,959
phenotype as well as a rescue experiment

365
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:54,240
done that rectifies that dilated

366
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:56,839
cardiomyopathy and pond reintroducing

367
00:14:54,240 --> 00:15:00,240
the wild pipe Gene so together that is

368
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:04,800
going to get you um a 2. Five

369
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:08,600
Points so overall we have now a total of

370
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:11,360
four points for this Gene this lands us

371
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:13,040
very firmly in this limited domain so

372
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,079
ultimately even though it looked

373
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,920
promising at first this variant cannot

374
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:20,880
be interpreted as a diagnostic variant

375
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,839
for your patient it doesn't rule it out

376
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:25,040
over time maybe the more evidence will

377
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:27,639
emerged for this Gene but given that the

378
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:30,079
first paper was in 2004 and not much has

379
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:30,800
emerged since then hopes are not high at

380
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,519
this

381
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,440
point so you can probably appreciate

382
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:38,040
from going through this that this is not

383
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,600
too bad of a process if you have only a

384
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:42,759
few papers for these jees that being

385
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,440
said it looked much easier just because

386
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:45,880
we already had the paper summarized and

387
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:48,399
it takes some time to go and read

388
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:50,440
through all those papers but as you get

389
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,720
to genes that have more and more

390
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:55,720
evidence a lot more papers to read this

391
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:58,399
can be a very cumbersome process so it

392
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:00,480
really does not make sense for every lab

393
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,800
individually be assessing all of these

394
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,920
genes and duplicating efforts across

395
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,519
labs and so one of the major

396
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:10,120
contributions of clingen is to kind of

397
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:12,240
centralize some of this curation work

398
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,920
and also put it in the context of

399
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,959
disease area experts because

400
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,720
interpreting what the functional studies

401
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:19,160
really stay about the gene can be

402
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:22,800
complicated as

403
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:24,880
well um so again clingen has established

404
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,680
these expert panels that are disease

405
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,880
area focus and go in and curate things

406
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,880
like Gene disease relationship ships and

407
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:34,360
they've made great progress so far this

408
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:37,759
is a ton of work and as of Tuesday this

409
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:40,319
week There's over 2800 gen disease

410
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:43,519
curations available for free for

411
00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:45,160
everyone to use on the clingen website

412
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,160
one thing that I think is particularly

413
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:49,880
interesting to note if you look at this

414
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:53,199
little chart here is that those red TO

415
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:56,360
gray Hues in this top left section of

416
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:59,120
the chart indicate that overall clingen

417
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,920
is finding about 25%

418
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,360
of the gene disease relationships

419
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:05,520
reported in the literature are limited

420
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,640
or below evidence so that's kind of a

421
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,079
good warning for anyone who is thinking

422
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,880
that maybe if this Gene disease

423
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:13,760
relationship has been published it must

424
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:16,679
be real it's definitely not

425
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,799
true um a little more detail about what

426
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:21,160
you might see if you went on to this

427
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:24,120
information on the cenen website again

428
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:26,720
it's all freely available there you will

429
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:29,160
note that genes can actually have been

430
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,320
curated for more than one disease

431
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:33,200
Association and that the strength of the

432
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:35,960
evidence for each of those associations

433
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,120
can differ so for this particular Gene

434
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:41,120
it's definitive for hypertropic

435
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:43,520
cardiomyopathy only moderate for dilated

436
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,679
cardiomyopathy and then has no known

437
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,840
relationship for

438
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:51,280
arbc there were also additional curation

439
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:53,200
information on the clingen website in

440
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,799
addition to this Gene disease validity

441
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,080
again we're going to touch on this a few

442
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:59,240
times but you can see information about

443
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:01,159
dosage sensitivity curation which is

444
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:03,039
important for the interpretation of copy

445
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:05,440
number variation that you might find in

446
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:07,320
this Gene as well as the clinical action

447
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,159
ability which really reads into more of

448
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,960
the types of tests that this genan

449
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:14,280
should be included

450
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:16,159
on so Clingan as I said has done a lot

451
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,919
of curation work all of their

452
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:19,919
information is available on their

453
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,000
website but they are not the only ones

454
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,840
doing curation work in terms of Gene

455
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
disease relationships every lab that is

456
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:29,600
establishing a panel for example does a

457
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,240
lot of precur work to decide which genes

458
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,440
should be included on that panel and any

459
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:37,400
lab that is doing exom or genome

460
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:39,240
sequencing is also evaluating a lot of

461
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,440
Gene disease relationships while they

462
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,120
look through the results of that

463
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:46,200
sequencing to see if it's relevant to

464
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:46,200
your proband of interest you have a

465
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:51,320
question two questions the first one was

466
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:53,520
what happens if you are hypothesizing

467
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:56,440
that the variant is maybe impacting like

468
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:58,799
a gene far away how does that affect how

469
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:01,520
you interpret disease Gene validity and

470
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:03,919
the second question was I guess if you

471
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:06,400
find a variant in your patient but it's

472
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,159
not recorded anywhere else but maybe

473
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,080
there's like comparable variants in the

474
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:12,880
literature nearby how do you how do you

475
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,120
decide if those V if the variant that

476
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,520
you have and the variant that's in

477
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:20,039
literature it's comparable or it's like

478
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:23,280
too distinct to like be weak evidence to

479
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:27,600
use both great questions so the first

480
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:29,520
one um remind me again was um variance I

481
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:33,200
guess in trans like really far away from

482
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:35,360
the transacting bar yeah so um that is a

483
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:38,559
great question there isn't definitely

484
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:41,200
specific guidelines on that um it would

485
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:43,080
be really a matter of just looking even

486
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,080
if it's far away that the gene that you

487
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,760
think it's impacting has a role in

488
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:49,120
disease as well and whether there's

489
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:51,039
other variation that supports that role

490
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,919
and whether you can prove your variant

491
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:55,320
is impacting for example the expression

492
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:57,559
of that G and that would be sufficient

493
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:59,360
okay um the second question which is

494
00:19:57,559 --> 00:20:01,919
about other variants that may have a

495
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:04,280
similar impact um we'll get to that when

496
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,240
we do variant interpretation discussions

497
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:08,440
but there are specific codes for

498
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,080
variants that impact the same position

499
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,840
for example that are established as

500
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,080
pathogenic that counts as evidence

501
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:17,120
towards the pathogenicity of your

502
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:19,000
variant um we do also very much consider

503
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,760
the variant spectrum of the genes we'll

504
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,679
touch on that a little bit as well

505
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:24,720
knowing that this sense variance in this

506
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:26,840
region for example or a hot spot there's

507
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,159
a specific code you can apply for that

508
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:30,679
to GL to this paper

509
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:33,720
thank

510
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:35,360
you all right um so as I was mentioning

511
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,760
there is a number of different groups

512
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,600
doing this Gene curation work and

513
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:42,159
previously all of this information is

514
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,960
just siloed inside those labs right they

515
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,120
have their own dat databases that

516
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,799
they're keeping so they're not

517
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,440
duplicating their own work but it's not

518
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:52,400
shared broadly um and so this was really

519
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,400
the impetus for Heidi and Marina dno

520
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:57,120
who's also based at the broad here to

521
00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:00,600
establish the gene curation Coalition or

522
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:02,640
the Gen CC which is a clingen supported

523
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:05,280
public database of Gene disease

524
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:08,360
curations um the participating members

525
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:10,640
at present are listed along the top here

526
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:12,559
and all of these groups are submitting

527
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:15,279
their databases of Gene disease

528
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:17,600
durations to the website for everyone to

529
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:19,520
see this is an important resource

530
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,360
because it kind of democratizes access

531
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:24,880
to this information but also allows us

532
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:26,840
to see conflicts that are existing

533
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,720
between these Labs there were always

534
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,320
these conflicts they existed before but

535
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,840
now we can see they're there and begin

536
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:35,200
to address them which is really

537
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:37,000
important to improving um the quality of

538
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,559
interpretation across the field as a

539
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,279
whole so if you were to open up the Gen

540
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:44,840
CC website which again is the Gen cc.org

541
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:47,000
you might see a page like this if you

542
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:49,720
search for a specific Gene

543
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,600
gjb3 and you can see every um

544
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:53,360
submitter's classification for any

545
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,400
submitter that has submitted a

546
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:58,760
classification for this Gene the

547
00:21:55,400 --> 00:22:01,120
strength level and the disease specific

548
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:03,880
Association as well as inheritance

549
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:06,799
pattern you will see that the categories

550
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:08,720
used on gen CC correspond to those that

551
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,159
were recommended in the clingen

552
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,720
guidelines for Gene disease

553
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:15,320
interpretation with a few extras so for

554
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,840
example the supportive category is not

555
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,799
something you've seen in the clingen

556
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:21,480
guidelines but it was designed to be

557
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:23,559
able to incorporate some databases that

558
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:26,039
actually are more curating the presence

559
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:28,000
of a reported Gene disease relationship

560
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:29,159
rather than evaluating the strength of

561
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,640
that evidence

562
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:32,840
we thought it was important to bring

563
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,919
that type of information into gen CC as

564
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:37,240
well so everything submitted by orphanet

565
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:39,080
we'll have that supported tag and soon

566
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,799
everything from om is going to be in

567
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:42,640
there as well and these are really

568
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:44,600
valuable databases particularly for

569
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,320
bioinformatic pipelines because it can

570
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:49,440
allow you to annotate some of these Gene

571
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:52,279
disease relationships in Broad scale um

572
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,679
and again the importance of identifying

573
00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:57,919
these conflicts allows us to go in and

574
00:22:54,679 --> 00:22:59,960
try to resolve them so um the Gen CC

575
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,600
steering committee calls Marina will

576
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,360
gather evidence on some of these

577
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,679
conflicting genes from the available

578
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,039
labs and present them together on the

579
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,799
call and then the steering committee

580
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:11,799
actually goes through a voting process

581
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:14,320
to decide overall what gen cc is going

582
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:17,159
to kind of weigh in and decide what this

583
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:19,480
G disease classification should be we

584
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:21,440
don't get to the level of um definitive

585
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:23,240
or strong or moderate we just decide is

586
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:28,200
it moderate or above essentially should

587
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:28,200
it be included on a panel test or not

588
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:34,039
um do you ever incorporate like when the

589
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:35,600
data was last modified or updated

590
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:38,799
because I imagine I'm just thinking that

591
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,559
this is ever evolving in terms of the

592
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:42,000
conflict resolution yeah yes and

593
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,400
especially like on these displays it's

594
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,919
really helpful to know where they differ

595
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,559
but I wonder if where they they say that

596
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:50,880
there's limited evidence maybe it's just

597
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:52,679
old so in a different you on the Gen CC

598
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,520
website you can see the submission date

599
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:57,039
which is very helpful as well or at

600
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:58,760
least the date that it is last assessed

601
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:00,679
um and you can see that in clingen as

602
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:03,159
well actually it's it's not to say that

603
00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:04,840
the expert panel classifications are

604
00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:06,960
right forever right they're going to

605
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:08,960
change over time so it is important to

606
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,000
think about when that classification was

607
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,279
done whether there's new information

608
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,600
that comes out and we definitely do take

609
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:17,159
in the age of that classification into

610
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,919
account when we think about how we're

611
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:21,880
going to go about about um resolving the

612
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,480
conflicts in particular for the oldest

613
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:25,440
classification will often just go back

614
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,760
to that lab with the older one say like

615
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,200
hey have you looked at this more

616
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,960
recently um and often they will say no

617
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,640
and when they do look at it it it kind

618
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:37,600
of automatically resolves the conflict

619
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:39,360
yeah okay um so we're like halfway

620
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,640
through and we're just getting to

621
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,440
variant interpretation so let's move on

622
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:45,279
um we can definitely talk more about

623
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,000
Gene curation at the end if we have more

624
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:49,080
time but let's make sure we're talking a

625
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,399
little bit about variant classification

626
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:54,480
as well um so variant classification a

627
00:24:52,399 --> 00:24:56,440
lot of the themes you're going to he

628
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:59,440
here are very similar to what we talked

629
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:01,120
about in gene curation so classification

630
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,760
again especially historically in the

631
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:07,399
field is subjective equally qualified

632
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:09,760
professionals can interpret the same

633
00:25:07,399 --> 00:25:11,919
variant differently and this can be

634
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:14,240
because they may not have access to the

635
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:16,360
same base of evidence so for example in

636
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,640
my lab I might have seen this variant

637
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:20,559
Den noo in a patient that was really

638
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,159
convincing evidence for me but another

639
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:24,559
lab does not have access to that

640
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:26,640
evidence they may interpret it

641
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:29,320
differently but even with the same

642
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,880
evidence Labs can wait the evidence they

643
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:34,559
find differently which can arise um in

644
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:36,640
different classifications as well so

645
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:38,960
this issue has become particularly more

646
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,320
apparent in recent decades for two

647
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,320
primary reasons one being that there's

648
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:45,480
just a lot more Labs doing sequencing so

649
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:47,360
more opportunity for conflict and that

650
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:50,279
the same Labs different labs are seeing

651
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:52,000
the same variant um and that also

652
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:53,559
there's this database clintar which

653
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,480
we're going to talk more about later

654
00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:57,880
it's kind of the variant version of gen

655
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:59,720
CC which allows different labs to submit

656
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:01,440
their classifications for variance and

657
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:03,799
that has just highlighted the fact that

658
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:07,080
there are conflicts um and that we can

659
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:10,720
now see them um so if you look across

660
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:12,679
clinvar in fact about 23% of all the

661
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,559
variants in clinvar with multiple

662
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:16,880
submitters have conflicting

663
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:19,159
interpretation so clearly there's again

664
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,640
some standardization work to be done

665
00:26:19,159 --> 00:26:24,799
here um and I'm not going to dwell based

666
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:27,159
on the time we have a lot in history but

667
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:29,000
this this makes sense historically just

668
00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:31,520
looking back and see

669
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,000
what variant interpretation has been

670
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:36,640
like as clinical genetic testing has

671
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,320
been evolving um there were some

672
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,080
guidelines for the interpretation and

673
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:43,480
reporting of these sequence Texs back in

674
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:45,360
2007 but they were very vague it was

675
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:46,880
kind of the wild wild west back then

676
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,799
there wasn't really any standardized

677
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,919
terminology about how to classify

678
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:52,919
variants and some of these guidelines

679
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:54,799
are essentially you know it was what was

680
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:56,360
available at the time but essentially it

681
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:58,240
was like you should check to make sure

682
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:59,760
your variant is in another database for

683
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,960
for example or see if it's in another

684
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,520
database before you go and report it

685
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:05,399
didn't really tell you how to integrate

686
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:09,000
that information and how to classify

687
00:27:05,399 --> 00:27:11,600
based on it um so luckily for us a

688
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,760
standard came out in 2015 that was a lot

689
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,799
more prescriptive about how what types

690
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,840
of information you should look at when

691
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:20,720
classifying a variant and how to

692
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:22,440
integrate that information together um

693
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,960
and this was a guideline developed

694
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,880
together with the American College of

695
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,960
medical genetics and the association for

696
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:30,120
molecular

697
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:32,200
prology um so in addition to telling us

698
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:34,320
how to classify variants more or less

699
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:36,159
again this guideline standardized the

700
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,440
terminology in the field which was an

701
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:40,840
important step suggesting that variant

702
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,760
should be classified into these five

703
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:44,919
categories that are listed in rainbow

704
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:47,799
colors here with pathogenic meaning this

705
00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:50,120
is definitely a disease causing variance

706
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:52,720
theine meaning this is definitely not a

707
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:55,200
disease causing variance likely

708
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:58,600
pathogenic and likely benign on either

709
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,720
side which reflect about a 90% comp

710
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:02,360
level and then everything in the middle

711
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,320
goes into this bucket of what's called a

712
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:08,000
varant of uncertainty significance or a

713
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:10,159
v us um before again as with the gene

714
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,799
curation before the existence of these

715
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:14,440
guidelines there was a lot of

716
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:17,600
variability in the clinical field about

717
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:19,760
how the terminology that was used um so

718
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,960
for example a lot might say benign or

719
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:24,440
they might say polymorphism or normal or

720
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:25,919
not associated which is pretty confusing

721
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:28,240
when you get that kind of information

722
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:30,000
back on different reports um but these

723
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,279
guidelines have really been very widely

724
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:37,080
adopted in the field since they've been

725
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:40,320
published and as of 2017 about 95% of

726
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:42,519
lats We Now using these terms so let's

727
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,640
talk through about a little bit about

728
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:48,000
how these guidelines work so if you were

729
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:50,720
to open up this paper you would see this

730
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,440
nice pretty rainbow chart um which is

731
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:56,559
really the fundamental um variant

732
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:58,440
classification guidelines here um to

733
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:00,120
walk you through it I don't expect to be

734
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:02,120
able to read all the texts in these

735
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:04,320
cells but just to walk you through it a

736
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:07,080
bit there is two major categories of

737
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:09,919
evidence here on the pathogenic side and

738
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:11,559
on the benign side in the columns you

739
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,320
will see that there are different

740
00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:15,080
strengths of evidence so on the

741
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:17,840
pathogenic side the strengths of

742
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:20,840
evidence range from supporting moderate

743
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:22,960
strong and very strong and on the benign

744
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:25,480
side we have strong and supporting

745
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,559
evidence now in the rows there are

746
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:29,480
different classes of evidence that we

747
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:31,760
considered and interpreting variants for

748
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:33,600
example population frequency data

749
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:36,080
computational prediction tools

750
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:39,840
functional data segregation within

751
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:41,600
families Etc um so the general process

752
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:44,600
here when you're classifying a variant

753
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:47,200
is to go out into the literature public

754
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:49,240
databases Etc pull all of the

755
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,679
information you can possibly find about

756
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:54,360
this variant which is a task in and of

757
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:56,039
itself it's very timeconsuming and then

758
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:58,159
determine the pieces of evidence that

759
00:29:56,039 --> 00:30:00,559
you can find within those Publications

760
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:02,840
and databases and how they matap to this

761
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:04,799
grid and then basically come up with a

762
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:07,320
list of the criteria codes you might be

763
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:09,279
able to apply once you have that list

764
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:11,320
you can go to this table at the right

765
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:14,240
and determine how the different codes

766
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:16,320
you have add up to a final

767
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,880
classification so let's walk through an

768
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:22,559
example of what that might look like

769
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:27,159
let's have this nonsense variant in the

770
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:30,440
pH Gene so pah is an established causal

771
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:33,760
Gene for for phenol ketonuria or PKU an

772
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:35,960
autal recessive condition this variant

773
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,880
is a loss of function variant a nonsense

774
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:40,960
variant expected to lead to nonsense

775
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:44,000
mediated Decay and it falls within a

776
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:46,360
gene pH in which the L we know that loss

777
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,559
of function causes disease causes fenal

778
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:52,960
Cuttin area so this allows us to apply a

779
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:55,600
pvs1 Criterion

780
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:58,679
here just to give you a little overview

781
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:01,360
of how the code naming works starts with

782
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:03,600
p it's on the pathogenic side it starts

783
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,320
with B it's on the benign side and then

784
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,639
the subsequent letters indicate the

785
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:10,360
strength so this is pathogenic very

786
00:31:07,639 --> 00:31:13,200
strong Criterion

787
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:15,399
one um you look in the Nomad database

788
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,320
for this variant see what its population

789
00:31:15,399 --> 00:31:20,760
frequency is like and you notice that

790
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:23,360
it's in one out of almost 75,000 African

791
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:24,880
chromosomes in Nomad which translates to

792
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,519
a

793
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:29,039
0.001%

794
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:31,399
frequency this allows us to apply the

795
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:34,120
pm2 Criterion which says either the

796
00:31:31,399 --> 00:31:36,720
variant is very absent is completely

797
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:38,679
absent in Nomad or is at a very low

798
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,480
frequency consistent with a recessive

799
00:31:38,679 --> 00:31:43,639
disorder which is what we're looking at

800
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:46,960
here so in the 2015 guidelines this

801
00:31:43,639 --> 00:31:48,679
allows us to apply the pm2 Criterion and

802
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,399
caging that a little bit because there

803
00:31:48,679 --> 00:31:53,000
has been some evolution in thinking

804
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:55,039
about this code and we now only apply it

805
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,399
at a supporting level but we're going to

806
00:31:55,039 --> 00:32:00,279
go with what the 2015 criteria say for

807
00:31:57,399 --> 00:32:02,919
now and pm2 can I ask a question from

808
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:06,399
online about that um someone anonymously

809
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:09,320
asked about um how these pathogenicity

810
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:11,080
and coding relates to genetic ancestry

811
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:12,919
and they're wondering is there are there

812
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:15,919
any examples of variants that are

813
00:32:12,919 --> 00:32:19,480
pathogenic in one An ancestry but benign

814
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:22,720
in another yeah so when we consider AAL

815
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:25,679
frequency it does not have the ancestry

816
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:28,039
within Nomad does not have to me match

817
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:30,080
the patient being studied and that's

818
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:33,240
really because if this variant is at a

819
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:35,880
high enough frequency in any population

820
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:38,080
it suggests that it cannot cause disease

821
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:39,760
unless that disease is particularly

822
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:42,519
enriched so this is particularly true

823
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:45,039
for Continental populations if you have

824
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:47,760
a subpopulation like the Amis population

825
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:49,440
the Asad the Jewish population where

826
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,399
that variant where that disease is

827
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,279
enriched as well you have to be careful

828
00:32:51,399 --> 00:32:56,799
interpreting your frequency cut offs

829
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:59,279
that you would apply um in terms of if

830
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:02,080
there is any examples of variants that

831
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:05,960
are pathogenic in one population and not

832
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:09,240
in others we we actually do not assign

833
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:11,320
variant pathogenicity in a patient

834
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:13,200
specific manner in that way if a variant

835
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:15,679
is pathogenic it's pathogenic for

836
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,880
everyone but the overall interpretation

837
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:21,320
of that variant in the context your

838
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:24,279
patient may change there is maybe some

839
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:27,159
option of um background variation that

840
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:29,240
may impact the expression of that

841
00:33:27,159 --> 00:33:30,960
condition or penetrants of that

842
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:33,240
condition and that exists but we still

843
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,039
call that variant maybe pathogenic we

844
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:37,679
may acknowledge on the report that it

845
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:39,480
has reduced penetrat in some populations

846
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:43,200
for

847
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:45,080
example okay um so then we do a

848
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,880
literature search for the variant we're

849
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:49,559
looking at and we find that our variant

850
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:52,960
is observed in a proband with classic

851
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:56,039
PKU who also carried a second variant on

852
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:58,480
the opposite copy of their PKU Gene so

853
00:33:56,039 --> 00:34:00,320
another variant in trans and that other

854
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:03,200
variant this missense variant at

855
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:06,440
position 408 is a very wellestablished

856
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:08,520
pathogenic variant for PKU it's

857
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:11,159
classified as pathogenic for example by

858
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:13,800
18 different labs in kinbar this allows

859
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:15,800
us to apply the pm3 Criterion which

860
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,720
states that for recessive disorder this

861
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,040
variant was detected in trans with a

862
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:22,320
pathogenic

863
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:25,200
variant so in total after doing all of

864
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:27,720
this review we find we have one pbs1 one

865
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:30,359
very strong code and two moderate C

866
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:32,200
codes applied and if we go back to that

867
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:34,599
chart on the last slide you would see

868
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:37,000
that this adds up to a pathogenic

869
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:39,520
classification for this variant for aomo

870
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:42,399
recessive

871
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:44,159
PKU so this is kind of a nice clean

872
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:46,280
example for the purpose of the talk but

873
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,720
the more you think about these Criterion

874
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:50,839
and really work with them you'll find

875
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:53,320
that a lot of them are actually pretty

876
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:56,000
vague and it can be hard to decide when

877
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:59,320
to assign each Criterion right so that

878
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,839
is because these um classification

879
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:03,320
criteria were really designed to be

880
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:06,040
applicable across all mandelian disease

881
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:08,599
right so they had to be vague to apply

882
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:10,599
broadly um but you may look in and you

883
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:12,640
may see questions like well this code

884
00:35:10,599 --> 00:35:14,960
says a well-established functional study

885
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:16,320
shows a delarius effect what what does

886
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:19,359
that mean what's a well-established

887
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:21,200
functional study or there's a code that

888
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:23,079
says there's Co co-segregation with

889
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,960
disease and multiple family members so

890
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:28,040
multiple affected family members carry

891
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:30,040
this variant but how many do I need to

892
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:31,480
apply this codee and if I have a lot of

893
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:34,880
affected family members because I make

894
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:36,920
it a stronger level or the code saying

895
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:39,079
that the minor Al frequency is too high

896
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:42,240
for the disorder how do you decide what

897
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:45,160
is too high um so you can see there's

898
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:47,240
more work to be done in terms of these

899
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:50,160
codes and again this is work that

900
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:52,319
clingen has really taken on so in

901
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:54,440
addition to doing all of that curation

902
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:57,040
work we talked about the clingen expert

903
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:59,960
panels also work to further specify

904
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:02,599
these codes to make them applicable to

905
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:06,359
specific disease areas in a more logical

906
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:08,680
way um so there are now over 30 disease

907
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:12,319
areas that clingen expert panels have

908
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:14,280
designed these um specifications for

909
00:36:12,319 --> 00:36:17,640
they are available in this database

910
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:19,480
called cpec the link I've shown here and

911
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:21,200
this is a database searchable by the

912
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:23,680
either the gene the disease or the

913
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:25,880
expert panel and what you might see if

914
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,839
you open up one of these for example is

915
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:29,839
further specification

916
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:32,040
how to apply the codes in a disease

917
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:35,560
specific fashion so this is an example

918
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:37,800
from the myh7 specifications where you

919
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:40,440
can see that if you look in the 2015

920
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:42,720
guidelines this va1 Criterion just

921
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:45,720
States the alal frequency is more than

922
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:49,119
5% in the databases available at the

923
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:52,040
time um but for most disorders 5% cut

924
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:55,200
off is more than an order of magnitude

925
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:58,839
higher than necessary for most Mulan

926
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:01,280
conditions so for this m seven criteria

927
00:36:58,839 --> 00:37:03,160
they were actually able to specify based

928
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:05,359
on the frequency of dominant

929
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:07,920
cardiomyopathy its prevalence and the

930
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:11,800
genetic and alic heterogeneity of that

931
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:14,359
disorder that anything above a .1% alal

932
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:16,400
frequency in databases like NAD is

933
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:18,240
actually sufficient to classify that

934
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:21,599
variant as

935
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:23,839
benign so um clinten has a group called

936
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:26,359
the sequence variant interpretation

937
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:29,280
group that actually oversees all of

938
00:37:26,359 --> 00:37:32,240
these expert panels in specifying the

939
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:35,480
criteria appropriately but this group

940
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:37,319
also has published a lot of guidance on

941
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:41,720
more broad guidance on the use of

942
00:37:37,319 --> 00:37:44,480
specific codes both for example the pbs1

943
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:47,200
Criterion um what types of loss of

944
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:49,440
functions qualify for that what kind of

945
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:51,880
caveats are there to deciding something

946
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:54,560
as loss of function and how you might up

947
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:56,800
or down breade that Criterion based on

948
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,000
the type of variant you're seeing so all

949
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,560
of that information

950
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:03,720
is here on the svi website that you can

951
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:07,480
access and having spent all of this time

952
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:09,880
telling you about the um 2015 guideline

953
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:12,319
Criterion I will tell you that the SBI

954
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:14,280
is now working on the next iteration of

955
00:38:12,319 --> 00:38:17,040
sequence variant interpretation which is

956
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:20,000
going to change things up a bit so don't

957
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:22,040
try to memorize the pvs1 pm2 because all

958
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,359
of those code names are going away in

959
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:26,000
this next iteration um still in

960
00:38:24,359 --> 00:38:27,520
development so this is definitely not

961
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,760
final but the codes are going to be

962
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:32,200
renamed based on the type of evidence

963
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:34,720
that they reflect and it's going to be a

964
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:37,720
point space system in the future which

965
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:40,040
is great actually for us in terms of the

966
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:41,720
2015 guidelines it's very difficult if

967
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:43,720
you have conflicting pieces of

968
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:46,319
information both pathogenic and benign

969
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:48,119
to decide how to integrate that together

970
00:38:46,319 --> 00:38:49,880
but in this points space system you will

971
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:51,480
have some positive points some negative

972
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:53,359
points on the benign side and you can

973
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,480
just add those together to end up at a

974
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:56,880
final

975
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,680
classification um given that we spent

976
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,680
time talking about gen CC and I've

977
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:02,839
mentioned at clinvar a few times I just

978
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:04,960
want to highlight a little more that

979
00:39:02,839 --> 00:39:06,680
clinvar is a publicly accessible

980
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,440
database where many groups are

981
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:12,280
submitting their variant classification

982
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:14,359
information um the clingen expert panels

983
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:17,960
submit all of their classifications in

984
00:39:14,359 --> 00:39:20,760
kinbar but also the most variants within

985
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:24,000
kinbar are submitted by clinical Labs

986
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:26,160
about 96% at this point and if you

987
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,480
haven't looked in clinvar before this is

988
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:31,240
what you might see on clar variant page

989
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:33,400
at the top you get an aggregate

990
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:35,359
classification of what every lab has

991
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,800
submitted so for example for this

992
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:38,760
variant you can see the individual

993
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,520
submissions at the bottom there are

994
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:42,920
three Labs that are calling this variant

995
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:44,920
likely benign one lab calling it a

996
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:47,160
variant of Uncertain significance and

997
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:48,560
again as with Gen CC the existence of

998
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:50,640
all of this information with one

999
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:54,200
database has allowed some level of

1000
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:56,920
conflict resolution to go on over time

1001
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:58,880
um there is a star status so one of the

1002
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:02,280
biggest problems with clintar is that

1003
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:03,720
there's not really um a quality standard

1004
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:06,400
that has to be reached to get your

1005
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:07,960
information into clintar so there's very

1006
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,359
widely varying quality of

1007
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:12,720
interpretations within clintar but

1008
00:40:10,359 --> 00:40:15,800
they've tried to help us delineate some

1009
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:17,839
of that in that in this star status so

1010
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:19,400
um if a submitter has zero stars that

1011
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:22,280
means that submitter has actually not

1012
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:24,720
submitted their classification criteria

1013
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,960
that they use um to classify the variant

1014
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,560
so it's hard to know what they're

1015
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:29,800
integrating

1016
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:31,440
um once you get up to one star you've

1017
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:33,640
either submitted your classification

1018
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,720
criteria or this happens also at the

1019
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:38,240
aggregate level when you have multiple

1020
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:40,560
submitters that are disagreeing and then

1021
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:42,920
as concordance is reached the star

1022
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,800
status will go up so a two star variant

1023
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:47,160
has multiple Labs saying the same

1024
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,960
classification the expert panels get an

1025
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:50,680
extra star because they've really gone

1026
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,280
through this rigorous process and we

1027
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:55,480
believe those classifications a little

1028
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:59,800
bit more um this is an extremely

1029
00:40:55,480 --> 00:41:02,000
valuable database in terms of um

1030
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:05,040
bioinformatic processing of data in

1031
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:07,040
clinical Labs so we all Labs at this

1032
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:09,839
point virtually will be annotating their

1033
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:11,560
data with clinvar classifications as a

1034
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:13,720
means of pulling out previously

1035
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:16,839
classified pathogenic varant there

1036
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:18,800
problems with that clear the question

1037
00:41:16,839 --> 00:41:21,000
the previous slide after reading several

1038
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,920
kinwa and it seems like every lab

1039
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,760
adopted the guideline but what was the

1040
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:28,200
hesitant why they don't put in the codes

1041
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,800
in these report is it that they are they

1042
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:32,280
don't want to be bound but if they don't

1043
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:34,160
want to be bound it's it's sort of hard

1044
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:37,319
for people who read to know what exactly

1045
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:40,440
is going on yeah I agree so so there are

1046
00:41:37,319 --> 00:41:42,400
many answers to that so Labs overall are

1047
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:44,280
encouraged to submit their evidence and

1048
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,839
you can see an example of an Evidence

1049
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,480
summary here in that uncertain

1050
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:50,119
significance classification for this

1051
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:52,160
parent but it is not required for labs

1052
00:41:50,119 --> 00:41:54,960
to submit the evidence they've used to

1053
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:56,880
classify that variant um the reason that

1054
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,599
Labs don't do it honestly is that they

1055
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,760
often don't have that information

1056
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:02,760
structured in a way to easily be able to

1057
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:04,079
submit it on large scale to Clint bar

1058
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:07,079
it's a lot of work to get that

1059
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:08,560
information in so for the most part you

1060
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:10,119
know giving Labs the benefit of the

1061
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,720
doubt I think that is the biggest

1062
00:42:10,119 --> 00:42:15,440
barrier to getting this information into

1063
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:18,040
clintar um a lot of labs will have a

1064
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,839
contact button or there's emails for

1065
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:21,800
every submitter in clintar so you can go

1066
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:23,319
in and actually email that lab directly

1067
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:25,440
and say you know what kind of evidence

1068
00:42:23,319 --> 00:42:28,240
do you have for this I do this fairly

1069
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:30,359
frequently for like in D GDX which are

1070
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:32,400
massive lbs have a lot of data in there

1071
00:42:30,359 --> 00:42:33,800
and they will often respond and give you

1072
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,760
kind of a summary of we've seen this

1073
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:38,440
variant Den ELO and XR band um so when

1074
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:40,079
you have a very rare variant you have no

1075
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:42,920
other means of getting that information

1076
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:44,880
that's a good resource to try um but

1077
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:46,640
that being said again like it takes Labs

1078
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:49,599
time to respond to these kind of emails

1079
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:52,440
so it's not you know massively scalable

1080
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:52,440
it's a difficult

1081
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:59,160
problem are labs incentivized to because

1082
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:01,520
it's a lot of work to do that so are

1083
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:05,079
there any incentives great great

1084
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:07,839
question yes so we have found over time

1085
00:43:05,079 --> 00:43:10,040
that lab submitting to clintar is a

1086
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:11,720
great indication of the quality of their

1087
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:13,760
interpretation particularly as you can

1088
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:15,640
see when they're like just way off on

1089
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,599
the vast majority of their

1090
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:21,200
classifications so um clingen has

1091
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:24,880
actually developed they have a site

1092
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:27,119
where you can see a Labs that have um

1093
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:29,559
they have a classification system ENT

1094
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:31,480
ially for labs that um you get a higher

1095
00:43:29,559 --> 00:43:33,359
quality rating when youve submitted a

1096
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:35,319
percentage of your varant to Clint bar

1097
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:38,119
and you update it every year so you can

1098
00:43:35,319 --> 00:43:40,160
see updates over time so is there's this

1099
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:43,480
lab list that is developed as the

1100
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:45,640
incentive for labs to do that um how

1101
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:47,160
often people who order tests go and look

1102
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:49,680
at that lab list to decide where to

1103
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:51,680
order from I can't say heid you probably

1104
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:55,280
have some data on

1105
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:57,280
that um so as I was saying Clint bar is

1106
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:59,200
a great source of annotation but there

1107
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,760
are some problems with doing that and

1108
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:03,800
that again as I mentioned there's a lot

1109
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:05,920
of varying quality of data in kinbar so

1110
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:07,520
examp for example if I filter a genome

1111
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,400
for everything that's pathogenic in

1112
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:11,240
clinar you're going to get tons of hits

1113
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:13,800
many of which are way too frequent in

1114
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:15,880
the general population to be pathogenic

1115
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:20,119
some of those were submitted before EXO

1116
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:22,359
exac or NAD were available right um so

1117
00:44:20,119 --> 00:44:24,760
we really kind of need a way to clean up

1118
00:44:22,359 --> 00:44:27,200
the database to use it systematically in

1119
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:29,559
this way and that has been led by

1120
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:32,240
clingen um which is now Heidi has

1121
00:44:29,559 --> 00:44:35,839
spearheaded this clingen curation of

1122
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:37,960
clinvar produ project or CBC in which

1123
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:40,680
clingen cure readers now go in and

1124
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:43,319
review these conflicting um entries in

1125
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:46,079
clinar pick out for example the old ones

1126
00:44:43,319 --> 00:44:48,319
that are outliers and flag them so that

1127
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:50,400
they're no longer integrated into that

1128
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:52,800
aggregate classification that's at the

1129
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,760
top of the page um so this is something

1130
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:57,040
that can be crowdsourced so if you find

1131
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:59,200
errors in clinvar there's a link on the

1132
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:02,520
Len website where you can go and kind of

1133
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:04,280
flag them for review as well um so I

1134
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:05,680
just want to mention very briefly we

1135
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:07,200
talked about the evolution of the

1136
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:09,319
sequence variant interpretation

1137
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:11,200
guidelines there are also guidelines for

1138
00:45:09,319 --> 00:45:15,680
the interpretation of copy number

1139
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:19,160
variation in 2020 this paper came out um

1140
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:20,680
led by acmg and clingen and this is

1141
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:22,720
again a point space system for

1142
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:25,760
classification that takes into account

1143
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:28,119
genomic content overlap with established

1144
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:30,800
half was sufficient triplosensitivity

1145
00:45:28,119 --> 00:45:33,319
tripos sensitive regions number of

1146
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:35,079
protein coding genes Etc fortunately I

1147
00:45:33,319 --> 00:45:38,119
don't have time to go through that but

1148
00:45:35,079 --> 00:45:40,000
clingen has a great web series um that

1149
00:45:38,119 --> 00:45:41,680
walks through these criteria and how to

1150
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,720
apply them and I blink that at the

1151
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:46,520
bottom of this slide so overall

1152
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:48,960
hopefully the take-home message is that

1153
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:51,040
the design and interpretation of genetic

1154
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:53,559
test really requires a lot of detailed

1155
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:55,200
evaluation of genes and variant and that

1156
00:45:53,559 --> 00:45:57,000
the standards and guidelines that have

1157
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:59,160
been established even though they are

1158
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,599
timec consuming greatly improved

1159
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:03,760
classification um consistency and

1160
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:05,400
quality in the field I've listed out

1161
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:07,400
some of the guidelines that I've talked

1162
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:10,160
about as well as a couple extras that I

1163
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:12,280
didn't get to um and then finally that

1164
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:14,839
these public databases like linbar and

1165
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:17,040
gen CC are really critical to the field

1166
00:46:14,839 --> 00:46:20,160
creating transparency in crowdsourcing

1167
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:22,240
the work um so thank you to you all for

1168
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:24,440
listening a lot of my slides were still

1169
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:27,520
on from Stephen and Heidi so thank you

1170
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:28,920
to them for putting these together and a

1171
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,599
huge thank you to everyone that's

1172
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:32,760
involved in these clingen working groups

1173
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:35,760
and doing really the laborious work of

1174
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:35,760
curation
