10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,880
a few minutes to tell you about our

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,120
program startup Exchange was created

12
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:37,960
within MIT corpet relations to support

13
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:40,399
MIT connected startups grow expand and

14
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:43,120
solve The World's great challenges and

15
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:46,160
we do that by fostering collaborations

16
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:49,079
and Partnerships with industry such as

17
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:52,640
ILP carpet members as many of you are

18
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:55,800
and the MIT Innovation

19
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,840
ecosystem startup exchange we focus on

20
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,239
startups that have a strong connection

21
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,440
with the Institute and this connection

22
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,400
might come through the founding team the

23
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,920
technology as well as through their

24
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:10,080
affiliation to some of our peers on

25
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:13,799
campus who vet and support the startups

26
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,600
like start. Nano or MIT uh C sales

27
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,840
startup connect plus just to name a

28
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,600
couple um today our programs has a

29
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:24,600
network of about 1,000 startups

30
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,720
virtually working in any sector and this

31
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,159
is possible because the startups we

32
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:32,360
support they can come out from any part

33
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:36,119
of MIT any of the five schools and one

34
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:39,200
college uh some graduate from mbas other

35
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:42,880
courses and a considerable number of

36
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:45,439
companies they graduate from the MIT

37
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:48,520
entrepreneurship resources and there are

38
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:52,600
over 80 across campus you'll find most

39
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:54,399
of them listed at orbit. mit.edu that

40
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,119
our colleagues from The Martin trust

41
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,799
Center uh

42
00:01:56,119 --> 00:02:01,640
created um the other two data points I'd

43
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,159
like to make here is that besides sector

44
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:07,119
agnostic startup exchange is also

45
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,759
location agnostic I mean startups can be

46
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,760
literally located in any country to

47
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,680
benefit from the program and we

48
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,879
typically start working with them when

49
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:20,080
they have a technology or a product that

50
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:23,080
is ready to be tested or used in Real

51
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:26,120
Environment now everything we do at

52
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:29,160
startup exchange is to expose and

53
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,400
connect startups and carpets in a highly

54
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,080
creative way

55
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,160
and we also provide learning

56
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:38,280
opportunities for them um this includes

57
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,800
launching calls for startups throughout

58
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:44,000

59
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:47,680
challenges uh facilitating uh one-on-one

60
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,760
