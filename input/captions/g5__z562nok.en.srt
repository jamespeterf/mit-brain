00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,400
Hi everyone, welcome to Dimmitri

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,759
Bertimas's office. Dimmitri, would you

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,799
like to introduce yourself to the

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,200
audience?

5
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,759
>> Uh, hello everybody. My name is Dimmitri

6
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,519
Bertimas. I have been a professor at the

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,119
school Sloan School of Management since

8
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:20,480
1988, but I've been about 40 years at

9
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:22,960
MIT. In addition to being a professor at

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,439
the Sloan School as well as the faculty

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,080
director of master of business

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,039
analytics, the associate dean of the the

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:34,480
analytics myself. I'm also leading uh

14
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:38,719
the u I'm the vice provost for open

15
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:41,600
learning which is uh what MIT does in

16
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:44,160
education for non-residential

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,079
education.

18
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,680
Wonderful, Denitri. And wow, you've been

19
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,800
here for so long and you have so many

20
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,320
titles. Um, what is your favorite part

21
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,719
about MIT?

22
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:59,359
>> Favorite part about my is the students

23
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:01,039
uh far and away. So, uh, both um, my

24
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,680
doctoral students of which this year I

25
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,720
will have more than 100 graduating have

26
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,080
25 at the moment. And then the master of

27
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,400
business analytics students which

28
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,920
Michelle and I started 10 years ago. And

29
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,400
I have to admit even though I'm a person

30
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,320
who has high expectations, it exceeded

31
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,560
the already high expectations. We have

32
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,320
developed what I consider one of the

33
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,680
very best if not the very best program

34
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:26,000
in the world in the in the space of um

35
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,560
of business analytics.

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,560
>> Wow. So 25 doctoral students and then we

37
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,079
have 80 students in the program per

38
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,680
year. Um what makes a student stand out?

39
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,439
What do you look for in a student?

40
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,759
>> Uh a variety of things. First of all,

41
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,520
the students who both at at the PhD

42
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:45,119
level, the operational research center

43
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,880
or have 90 of those 25 m and 80 of the

44
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,320
master of business analytics are among

45
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,280
the very best students in their home

46
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,600
institutions. Typically the the top one,

47
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,240
two or three students. Uh the quality of

48
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,920
the students is exceptionally high. In

49
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,479
addition, the aspirations of the people,

50
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,479
the people we are attracted to MIT are

51
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,200
not random people of course, but in

52
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:08,160
addition their aspirations is to try to

53
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,959
improve the world and uh via

54
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,040
quantitative analytical techniques. And

55
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,840
um this combination of ability, high

56
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:19,280
aspirations and character makes what I

57
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,200
consider the the key ingredients of a

58
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,280
fantastic intellectual environment that

59
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,040
we have here at MIT.

60
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,560
>> Great. And could you tell us about some

61
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,080
of the research that you're doing with

62
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,120
the students?

63
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,519
>> Yep. Uh having um typically every year I

64
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,200
I as you heard I have about 25 doctoral

65
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,720
students and about five master of

66
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,200
business analyticians who do research

67
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:46,080
with me. I have a variety of topics. I

68
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:48,640
particularly work in uh applying AI um

69
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:52,800
gen AI but also more general purpose AI

70
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:56,160
in healthcare uh of which we have been

71
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,080
developing what is called multimodel AI

72
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,599
models models that utilize computer

73
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:05,120
vision language tabular data genomics

74
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:07,599
and time series a variety of data to try

75
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,640
to predict and prescribe treatments that

76
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:13,280
improve uh improve the condition of

77
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,519
patients. Another area of significance

78
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,239
is the climate. I have a also a working

79
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:21,760
group of where we utilize AI for

80
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:26,640
improving climate. We currently have um

81
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:29,440
a a product a research on u wildfires,

82
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:33,599
how to predict them and how to mobilize

83
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:36,640
resources to uh alleviate the effects. I

84
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,879
have another significant effort on

85
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,959
methodological methods. When you have

86
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,360
multimodel data, how do you do

87
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,680
prescriptions? How do you make decisions

88
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,840
in the in the presence of multimodel

89
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,879
data? And finally, a very significant

90
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:54,000
effort in my group is how to use genai

91
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:56,239
in education motivated by my role as the

92
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,159
as the as the vice pro profess of open

93
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:02,239
learning. We have developed together

94
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:05,840
with some of my students uh a tutor AI

95
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:07,760
tutor a guidance system where we we

96
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,760
basically advise students what next

97
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,200
classes to take. We currently work on

98
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,879
personalized education where we uh adapt

99
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,239
the educational environment to the

100
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:20,000
student um and many others of the sort.

101
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,560
So these are the three major areas

102
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,560
education, healthcare and the climate

103
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,919
that occupy my thinking.

104
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,160
>> Wow. Um, so an AI tutor. Are you

105
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:31,680
planning to use this tutor in one of

106
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,120
your future classes that you teach?

107
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,120
>> Yeah, we actually use it in one of the

108
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,120
Karen classes. Oh,

109
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,320
>> we I teach a class the analytics edge

110
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:43,680
for executive MBAs about 70 70 students

111
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:46,080
in the class and about 80 90% use it

112
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,360
already with good results. So next year

113
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,759
I'll be teaching the machine learning

114
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,919
under the model optimization lens. I'll

115
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:55,919
be using the tutor. I'm also planning to

116
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:58,080
have uh an online education for what's

117
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:01,360
called universal AI. This is trying to

118
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:04,000
teach AI for the for many people

119
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,600
including MIT students. So indeed uh

120
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,600
tutor is already in the classrooms and

121
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,600
hopefully will be even more so in many

122
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,680
significant ways.

123
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,600
>> Um and can you tell us more about this

124
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,680
course machine learning under a modern

125
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,560
optimization lens? I know that you

126
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,160
created the course.

127
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,240
>> Yeah. So this is a class um you know I I

128
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,560
have u I come from the area of

129
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,280
optimization. This is sort of my home

130
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,280
base so to speak. About maybe 15 years

131
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,440
ago I started learning more about

132
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,000
machine learning and AI and I have

133
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:37,680
observed that uh many machine learning

134
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:41,759
uh models are huristic in nature. So by

135
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:44,160
using optimization and the so we can we

136
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,720
developed a much more exact uh

137
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:51,039
methodologies that basically have much

138
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:54,560
higher performance and um and this the I

139
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:56,880
wrote a book in 2019

140
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:00,320
uh that actually won a major prize in

141
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,960
the my professional society that we use.

142
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:05,039
The the title of the book was machine

143
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,919
learning at the modern optimization lens

144
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:10,800
which is also the the name of the class

145
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,880
we teach here at MIT. It it is a it is a

146
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,280
class and a corresponding book with a

147
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,360
with a particular view that machine

148
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,520
learning needs to be much closer to

149
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,160
optimization as opposed to durability

150
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,000
and you can get the benefit of uh

151
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,479
significant uh improvement in

152
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,800
performance. And these days we have

153
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:31,120
augmented the material in the class with

154
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,120
more deep learning applications which I

155
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,039
in my opinion is the is the next

156
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,759
frontier where optimization can also

157
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,600
play a significant role.

158
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,600
>> Wonderful. And for those students out

159
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,600
there who are very interested in taking

160
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,400
this course or being your research

161
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:50,000
assistant or PhD student, how can they

162
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,520
best prepare um to to do this research

163
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,960
or to take your class?

164
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:57,199
>> Yep. Um I would say the class requires

165
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,280
some knowledge of linear algebra which

166
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:02,880
most of the students have but so please

167
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:05,520
uh review it and they need to know some

168
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:08,880
optimization at least uh the language of

169
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:11,440
optimization in terms of research uh

170
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:14,000
with me and so forth. I only I take

171
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,919
students from MIT. So you have to be

172
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,280
admitted in our programs or the PhD or

173
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:22,560
the mast's program. And typically I the

174
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,479
key criterion is uh to try to affect the

175
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,280
world. Every student at MIT are high

176
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:29,680
quality people. So uh what I look at

177
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,360
aspirations and character.

178
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,479
>> Thank you very much. Those are all my

179
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,639
questions.

180
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:37,280
>> Thank you many for many of you. I hope

181
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,479
to meet you in the near future in the

182
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,720
MIT campus.

183
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,639
>> Hi everyone. Thank you for watching. If

184
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,199
you like this video, check out our other

185
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:48,319
