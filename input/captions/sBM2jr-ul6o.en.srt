1
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,519
let's get

2
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,600
started so we're going to number the

3
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:18,760
classes as if when you have a

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,720
substantial thing to do over the weekend

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:23,160
as you did this time um that that counts

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,680
as a class when you watch me talk uh on

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,519
a screen so we'll call this class four

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,920
even though this is the third time we

9
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:32,040
get together and um last time we were

10
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,879
together I suppose this should be

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,879
penultimate class if I'm numbering the

12
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:38,440
other one we talked quite a bit about

13
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:40,160
what is a note right and um let's just

14
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:42,079
take a second to review because uh there

15
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,320
were a couple people who weren't here on

16
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,559
Friday um what what are some of the

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,520
things that are complicated when you're

18
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:48,520
talking about what is a

19
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,960
note quick hand and shout when it's

20
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:56,440
quiet or

21
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,079
just does it need a pitch does it need a

22
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,480
duration does it does it need a pitch

23
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,559
does it need a duration great um

24
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,559
what was the problem when I

25
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,560
went you couldn't tell if notes were

26
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:09,960
slur you couldn't tell if notes uh not

27
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,479
so much slurred you can tell what's the

28
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:16,200
other word he's looking for tide yeah

29
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:19,360
goes that could be four tied notes right

30
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:22,479
um depending on if we think of the

31
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,759
notation as one domain as our definition

32
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,520
of the note or if we think of what we

33
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,920
hear as a domain domain good anything

34
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:32,880
else that screwed up um our easy

35
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,720
conception of what a note

36
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:41,240
is remember or make up your

37
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:41,240
own you had 14 notes in a gando we

38
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:54,799
had yeah go

39
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:05,320
ahead well for us you have two notes and

40
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:08,879
you have to kind of between the two yeah

41
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:11,920
what was what was that called else yeah

42
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,239
John Trill a Trill yep Trill is one of

43
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,680
them and the other one that we talked

44
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:20,040
about was yep tremolo tremolo how many

45
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,680
notes does it take to write a Trill on a

46
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,280
on a St a standard

47
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,840
score one how many notes does it take to

48
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:29,959
write a tremolo two how many notes are

49
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,160
there in a trill

50
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:35,080
whole Gob right a lot lot of them as

51
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,599
many as you can put in yeah so so these

52
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,599
kinds of different representations we

53
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:40,440
did a lot on today we're going to be

54
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:42,560
talking more about not just what is a

55
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,040
note but how can we represent a note or

56
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,840
how can we represent something else for

57
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,560
a computer um you know

58
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,319
what I made really nice handouts that I

59
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,280
put online and didn't forgot to put them

60
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:57,800
out so I'm going to keep one for myself

61
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,319
and we'll try to do a group here going

62
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:04,000
this way a group here going this this

63
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:06,720
way and um in the back where I see

64
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,239
people the least um I see the fewest uh

65
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,959
name tag so if you don't mind I'd really

66
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:15,799
like to get to know everybody by by name

67
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,400
there's um some discussion of various uh

68
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:20,920
configuration problems and a few

69
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,319
Solutions and a few things still left

70
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:27,760
unsolved um on canvas if you'd like

71
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:29,599
stick around after class or um and we'll

72
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:33,159
talk through some of those things and

73
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:37,159
the was another question um who raised

74
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:39,599
it Hannah um no um about whether or not

75
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:41,360
the standard library is okay so the

76
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:44,640
standard Li and that includes things

77
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,599
like math and regex and things in Python

78
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,200
that some classes don't let you uh

79
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:51,760
import yes if it comes with python when

80
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,920
you download it you may use it on

81
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,959
anything so I'll unlock the entire

82
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,640
standard Library so go ahead and import

83
00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:00,200
math within the math Li Library some

84
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,280
people saw that there's a particularly

85
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,360
useful function in the math Library what

86
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,439
what's

87
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,000
that log log yeah the log when you're

88
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:10,319
dealing with frequencies and things

89
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,560
you'll see that the logarithm function

90
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:15,680
uh so if anybody reimplemented the

91
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:19,120
entire logarithm function um uh you

92
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:22,040
know uh you you we we can talk about uh

93
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,720
getting a life no no no you did great

94
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:27,720
super we can give extra um points on

95
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,360
that but but yeah um if it's something

96
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:33,440
that you have to download via pip

97
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,360
then always ask beforeand uh but I do

98
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,720
want to say at the end of the semester

99
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,600
when you have final projects it's

100
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,000
anything goes so if you can find it on

101
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:44,360
the Internet or you can build it uh you

102
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
can use it okay we're going to start uh

103
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,440
we're not as talkative as we were on

104
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,479
Friday Friday we were very very

105
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,960
energetic so maybe we'll we'll start

106
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:55,639
with um talking amongst ourselves um I

107
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,440
want you to you have one bite how many

108
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:00,639
bits are in a bite eight good so you

109
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:03,440
have you have eight positions where you

110
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:07,639
can have ones or

111
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:10,800
zeros um and I want you to try to

112
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:13,680
encode pitch and

113
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,000
duration so the two things that in one

114
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,800
representation one definition of a note

115
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,960
are two of the fundamental parts of it I

116
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:24,800
want you to try to encode a note in one

117
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:27,039
bite and then talk about what kinds of

118
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,840
things you've had to decide you're not

119
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:31,080
going to represent in order to make that

120
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:35,240
possible I'd like to do this in groups

121
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:37,160
of two so um it's very yeah everybody is

122
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,240
either at a desk with somebody else or

123
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,840
not at a desk with somebody else so if

124
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,240
you could just uh make that the group

125
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:46,960
and we'll give it about uh about three

126
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:50,720
minutes okay let's let's come together

127
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,880
and let's um see we'll we started middle

128
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:56,280
of the alphabet last time let's uh who's

129
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:58,000
a group um involving somebody with a

130
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:01,960
name toward the end of the alphabet I

131
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,199
don't think we have any z's X's y's

132
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:06,000
Vanessa and Adam either way I had

133
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:09,680
started this you guys would be going

134
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,319
first um what what's something that you

135
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,240
uh comp that you decided to encode and

136
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:15,880
what something you decided to compromise

137
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,880
on I think we decided that it was more

138
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:21,080
important to like preserve information

139
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:25,160
about Pitch than it was to information

140
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:29,759
okay so that's always

141
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:31,400
um a choice the so we're going to have a

142
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,160
lot more information or all the

143
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:36,319
information on Pitch rather than on

144
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,319
duration good so we we have to make a

145
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,919
compromise that even though I said these

146
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,400
two things maybe one of them is more

147
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,840
important than another great um going

148
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,800
alphabetically

149
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:49,240
backwards oh we should have started with

150
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:51,199
Vincent and Jake sorry uh yeah I think

151
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,919
what we decided first was that like M

152
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,479
group pitch is most important and so we

153
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:58,319
decided to like prioritize uh encoding

154
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,639
like the 12 discreet chromatic Western

155
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,879
pitches okay so we we've decided to

156
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:07,400
limit to Western pitches which is

157
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:10,400
already a compromise um losing all those

158
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:13,039
great microtones and we said we want 12

159
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:17,039
of them great how many how many bits is

160
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:20,840
it going to take to encode 12 distinct

161
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:23,960
things let's let's do

162
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:27,479
fingers good I see a lot of fours

163
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:31,840
because why why is it four uh Somebody

164
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:36,160
explain um anyone want

165
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:40,800
to yeah Jordan uh 2 4 is 16 so 2 to the

166
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:42,440
4 is 16 and what's I have to do with 12

167
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,120
you can have that many like combinations

168
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:47,120
I guess permutations you can have that

169
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:50,240
many permutations into there um what's

170
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:53,240
two to the um 2 to the 3 everybody eight

171
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:56,639
eight so it's said yeah that eight is

172
00:07:53,240 --> 00:08:00,000
less than or well no is less than 12 is

173
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:03,360
less than or equal to 16 therefore we

174
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,680
need 2 to the 4th so we need four bits

175
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:09,720
for that so we have four bits in one

176
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:11,159
thing for um for pitch class is that a

177
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:15,120
term that everybody knows it's not a

178
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:19,800
term taught in all of uh of 301 first

179
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:24,120
semester Theory it's um well say sort of

180
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:28,440
encoding c as zero C sharp or dlat as

181
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:31,280
One D as two or also I suppose C double

182
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:35,120
sharp or e flat um we don't really care

183
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:39,039
so we're going to use four things for

184
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:43,279
pitch class something like that

185
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:46,040
great and uh anybody else use um do

186
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:48,800
something like this any other groups

187
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:52,120
Jason and okay so quite a number of

188
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:54,160
groups um let's see uh yeah we'll go

189
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:58,120
with Phil and Angelica's group what what

190
00:08:54,160 --> 00:09:01,079
did you do with your other part oh we

191
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:05,240
try to like up with duration so

192
00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:08,040
sacrifice the like octave PES uhuh just

193
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:11,399
encod the duration so how many durations

194
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,399
can you encode with what's

195
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,200
remaining 16 16 what are some durations

196
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:22,120
that that you might have chosen to to

197
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:26,760
encode or we'll go move on to uh uh Lila

198
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:29,560
Leela Lila lla and John um we could do

199
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:32,760
whole notes half notes dotted four notes

200
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:34,480
Etc whole notes half notes dotted

201
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:37,880
quarter notes uh explain a little bit

202
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:40,760
more to your Etc oh yeah so you can have

203
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:43,399
like your basically like whole half

204
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:47,160
quarter then you like add the Dodge CU

205
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:51,760
we have 16 bits to work with Okay whole

206
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:53,120
half quarter and E eth and so how many

207
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,279
how many bits is going to take if we

208
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,800
just stop there only two only two

209
00:09:56,279 --> 00:10:00,160
because we have two to the two squared

210
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,680
is four right so we can put that into

211
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,160
there and then if we want to encode if

212
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:07,360
it has a DOT or

213
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:11,200
not is that another bit so then we have

214
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:13,839
dot or not what happens if we say h we

215
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:17,360
just put one more thing in we'll put in

216
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:19,680
16th what do we get as a

217
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,920
problem can we squeeze that into four

218
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,320
bit into two bits no so once you decide

219
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:27,120
that you're going to be able to encode

220
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:30,079
16th you might as well go and do your

221
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,640
32nd 64th

222
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,240
do we want to do 128th or breath double

223
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,320
whole note they're both both pretty

224
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,240
uncommon so so we're slightly wasting

225
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:42,399
some space on some pretty uncommon

226
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:45,279
things but we get the dot um so that's

227
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:47,079
three think about doing just 16th notes

228
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:50,079
as your base and then you can have all

229
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:52,680
like multiples of 16th okay you can have

230
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:55,440
multiples of 16th so you have 16th as a

231
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:58,240
base and then how um if you had like the

232
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:01,079
number two or one I guess you'd get like

233
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,120
Z would be note or I guess or maybe not

234
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:05,399
maybe You' want like maybe you'd want to

235
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,120
be able to have zero time but if you had

236
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:08,680
zero is 1/6th note then one would be

237
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,320
26th notes would be an eighth note and

238
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,760
then you can do like dots and stuff and

239
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,720
you can do all of that stuff and you can

240
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:17,680
encode up to something that has 16 16th

241
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,240
notes right with that way um which would

242
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,720
be a whole note so that's that's pretty

243
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:25,440
that's pretty great way um it does mean

244
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:29,639
we are spending quite a bit of uh energy

245
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:35,639
dealing with things that are uh a little

246
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:37,480
bit unusual but yeah anybody have any um

247
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:41,480
any ways that we didn't talk about very

248
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:44,000
much second El yeah uh we thought that

249
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:47,839
it was important to encode octave

250
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:51,800
information too uhhuh um so we spent six

251
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:54,639
bits encoding like the 6 or 64 of the

252
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:58,240
midi note numbers okay and then two bits

253
00:11:54,639 --> 00:12:02,120
on duration 64 mini notes so now we have

254
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:04,320
octave good 64 out of the 88 keys in the

255
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,800
keyboard um you decide to do just the

256
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,880
outside ones right and leave out the

257
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:11,320
ones in the middle okay good and um and

258
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:15,440
then two bits for uh for duration so we

259
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:16,880
get maybe whole half quarter eth not too

260
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,839
much more

261
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:23,720
great um super this great thinking

262
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:26,279
exercise why might you want to do that

263
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:28,600
well there's some people who use

264
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:30,720
oops that's the most confusing slide in

265
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,760
a while

266
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,279
there are quite a number of people who

267
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:39,399
are very interested in um not even one

268
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:41,600
bite but six bit

269
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:46,560
encodings and

270
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:49,000
um for instance in the Braille music

271
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:54,760
code one of the important things is

272
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:57,240
being able to encode um the seven dionic

273
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:59,240
notes because the dionic notes tend to

274
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,440
be used much more often and maybe

275
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,399
somewhere else you have something that

276
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:08,440
tells you the key signature the seven

277
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:11,720
dionic notes and eight durations in six

278
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:15,399
bits um how do they do that how do they

279
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:18,600
get eight durations they've doubled up

280
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:20,399
and said look if you're on 128th note

281
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,360
you're really unlikely to move to a

282
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,800
whole

283
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,480
note so that contextually you take

284
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,560
advantage of the fact that it's very

285
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:32,079
rare to have a whole note and then a 64

286
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:35,560
note

287
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:37,920
um and if if it's really really really

288
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:39,800
unclear fortunately they put in a space

289
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,040
uh the Braille music code it puts in a

290
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,920
space where um there's an end of a

291
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:46,279
measure so if you're really unclear like

292
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,360
I I wonder if these are all 128 no no

293
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:52,800
the measure ended okay they're they're

294
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:55,120
probably the long notes so that's one

295
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:58,040
one reason why you might be thinking of

296
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:01,480
very efficient encoding

297
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,959
um many things are lost there we'll take

298
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,440
I don't want to spend as much time on

299
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:08,279
this but get back in your same group and

300
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:11,279
talk about what you could do if now you

301
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:14,560
had three bytes on

302
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:16,600
average to encode your notes so that if

303
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,880
we have a typical score and I'll leave

304
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:22,320
you to think what a typical score uh

305
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,959
looks like that um you could be doing

306
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,279
sometimes you take a little bit more

307
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:27,959
sometimes a little bit less so just talk

308
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:29,959
through you don't need to come up with a

309
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:31,880
full representation

310
00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:35,000
like this for it but just what are some

311
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:37,240
of the things that you might

312
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,720
add okay let's come back together what

313
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:43,160
are some things we use this enormous

314
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:45,920
Bounty of space of three bytes to do

315
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:48,120
that you didn't do before um let let's

316
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,120
just go go around you can say pass but

317
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:53,079
we'll start over here in second row and

318
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:57,639
go um I guess left to

319
00:14:53,079 --> 00:15:00,560
right we say day for okay great we're

320
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:03,920
we've stopped leaving out o Ive for

321
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:07,279
everybody right um another

322
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,600
group Dots Dots okay we have dots in

323
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:13,759
here

324
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:16,800
great articulation articulation o yeah

325
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:19,360
um it's every note needed

326
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,079
articulation so this is where average

327
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,959
might come into play right you might

328
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:26,480
have something some sort of a flag

329
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:28,759
somewhere some condition that says uh

330
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,319
more information to come and then you

331
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:33,759
can use additional space great

332
00:15:30,319 --> 00:15:34,440
articulations other things uh we said do

333
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,880
like

334
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:39,839
Dynamics volume Dynamics or

335
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,880
volume

336
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:45,000
mix

337
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:47,120
volume just in case I forget to mention

338
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,800
it at some point a lot of people in the

339
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:52,079
computer Music World call the Dynamics

340
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:54,959
of volume the

341
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:58,199
velocity uh which is which really tells

342
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:59,480
you that the um that the piano was the

343
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:02,120
first instrument they were thinking of

344
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:04,360
encoding because it's how fast you hit

345
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,199
the note um how fast you hit the key on

346
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:08,839
the clarinet doesn't really make it any

347
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:12,639
um any louder um but velocity Dynamics

348
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:14,279
volume velocity uh good continue on I

349
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,000
guess you could do something like what

350
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:19,160
you just said for the flag where like if

351
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,959
it's an extreme range of a note or

352
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:25,880
extreme duration then you say like oh

353
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:29,319
this is an unusually long extreme

354
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:30,560
cases to follow right or something like

355
00:16:29,319 --> 00:16:34,800
that to

356
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:36,959
follow and yeah so that could be these

357
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:40,040
could be little

358
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:42,319
Flags suppose do people think flags look

359
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:47,160
yeah flags look better going left don't

360
00:16:42,319 --> 00:16:49,519
they good um other continuing around

361
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:54,079
other things to chose that aren't on

362
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:56,120
here so I think one thing was I guess

363
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:59,360
like time signature and stuff

364
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:03,120
because um it encoded with like just the

365
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,679
reference of the musical half notes yeah

366
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,280
information isn't necessarily stored

367
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:10,720
within

368
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:12,559
the I actually made um yeah I put in and

369
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,880
anything else on this slide that I

370
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,720
didn't put on the other one because yeah

371
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:20,039
I thought maybe time signature could go

372
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,360
in key signature other things to go at

373
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:24,079
the beginning what what else comes at

374
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,079
the beginning

375
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:32,160
piece so chout out key signature time

376
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:34,720
signature

377
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,000
Tempo name of the piece name of the

378
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,280
piece metadata name of the piece

379
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,600
metadata very

380
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:44,880
important who wrote

381
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:48,480
it Metadate sorry that was that was

382
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:50,480
yesterday's metadata now metadata um

383
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,799
yeah

384
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,000
CL good um quickly go through the front

385
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:57,480
row if you have something that you'd

386
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,760
like to throw onto this uh we'll

387
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:02,280
continue uh

388
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:05,760
was that Adam did you you guys just

389
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:07,320
smoke right no no did you because you

390
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,480
you you shouted out when I said anything

391
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:13,200
else you put in your encoding

392
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,919
Vanessa ties

393
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,679
good that lets you build a lot of things

394
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,240
Jordan Misha

395
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,760
anything

396
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,840
triet

397
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:24,520
triplets

398
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:30,240
yep

399
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:32,640
triplets yeah and I was just um

400
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,440
what's the generalization of triplets if

401
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:39,320
they're

402
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:43,320
not three anyone know term for tuplets

403
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:45,440
or tuplets or t more often tuplets in

404
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:47,840
the British pronunciation tlets more

405
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:52,520
often in the English um

406
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,520
pronunciation good um anything

407
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:58,039
else why would we want and so here are

408
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,240
some examples by the way of how the

409
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:03,679
braille code

410
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:08,000
uses an average of one B but allows for

411
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:10,280
or one cell six bits um but allows for

412
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,080
other things so if you have accidentals

413
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:14,559
we can be adding particular marks to say

414
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:17,840
hey there's going to be something else

415
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:21,480
coming next look up what this extended

416
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:24,039
Mark is or sometimes there is a sign

417
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:26,440
that you can use for saying hey I know

418
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:28,039
you'd think that I'm all in 302 notes

419
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,679
I'm probably going to jump to a 16th

420
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:33,440
note but actually I'm going to jump all

421
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:35,200
the way up to a a half note or something

422
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,679
so there is there are some cautionary

423
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,840
signs for that um and beams and things

424
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:43,679
of that sort can be put

425
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:47,880
in um yeah Adam is there a morse code

426
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:50,000
for music notation Morse code um not

427
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,640
that I know of not that I know the

428
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:57,400
Braille by the way music code

429
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:59,440
predates the um Braille text Lou bral um

430
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,919
invented the music code first first and

431
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,600
then decided to do it with text uh

432
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,880
before in part because um text is

433
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:09,520
already a little bit easier to read with

434
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,520
raised Impressions whereas music was

435
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,480
just impossible to read with raised

436
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:16,000
Impressions so there was more of a need

437
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,760
for reading music than there was um for

438
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,840
text at the

439
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:24,480
time um and just for a second let's just

440
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:27,159
think what could you

441
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:30,080
do that you couldn't do with this if you

442
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:34,080
had about a megabyte per

443
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,080
note that's a million

444
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,320
bytes people have thought of this all

445
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,840
the time and you've probably done it and

446
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:43,280
you're not even thinking of it you've

447
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,840
probably used a megabyte encoding per

448
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,760
note already

449
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:49,960
today I know that John

450
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,919
has

451
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:55,440
just I

452
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:58,159
see have like different like features

453
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,440
for like the output of the notes so like

454
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,799
like a stere mono sound stereo mono

455
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:05,919
sound or yeah you're getting getting

456
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:08,960
yeah Fidelity the Fidel just the the

457
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:11,200
audio wave of the note you can encode

458
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,880
the exact you know why do you need to

459
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,159
encode um is this a c or saying when you

460
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,039
can just hear it and you can also be

461
00:21:15,159 --> 00:21:20,039
encoding with that yeah the Fidelity the

462
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:22,320
mono thing you're encoding the in exact

463
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:24,760
instrument how it was performed you're

464
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:28,120
losing generality right because you're

465
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:30,840
encoding one performance of a particular

466
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:33,919
piece and not um every performance but

467
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:35,919
maybe maybe you can do one megabyte plus

468
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,480
um plus an average of three bytes to

469
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,520
also store what the note was supposed to

470
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:43,679
be so so we'll be able to get the best

471
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:46,520
of all worlds um okay what do we have

472
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:50,840
why do I care about efficiency it's in

473
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:52,320
part because we're at a point where um

474
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:55,159
we can start storing a lot of

475
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:58,120
information about notes uh you know most

476
00:21:55,159 --> 00:22:01,039
of us don't bat an eye anymore at the

477
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:03,880
notion were streaming in high def or 4K

478
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:05,799
or what whatever and you know gigabytes

479
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:08,240
of billions of did I said billions

480
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:10,880
before I meant Millions four billions of

481
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:13,039
bytes in an hour just to watch a movie

482
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:16,039
so why do we care about if we can store

483
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:19,000
one extra um thing in the note it's

484
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:21,559
because um almost entirely based on

485
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,960
history this is one of the earliest

486
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:26,760
encodings of um of a musical piece of

487
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,520
the dissertation from 1982 but this is

488
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:33,960
going in the 60s and things and we

489
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:36,320
started with um with Punch Cards and

490
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:39,080
punching cards takes a long time so the

491
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:41,559
more efficient you can get with your

492
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:44,240
encoding the fewer cards you're going to

493
00:22:41,559 --> 00:22:47,039
need and this has left consequences on

494
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,520
us um for today by the way I always

495
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,919
thought that oh punch card you can you

496
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:53,039
know you get 1 2 3 4 5 six seven 8 nine

497
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:54,799
10 you know you can you get 10 bits of

498
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:57,279
information it turns out you punch too

499
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,760
many holes in a punch card and you try

500
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:00,559
to put it through the punch card reader

501
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:04,000
and it jams so you actually have a

502
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:07,840
limited number of ones you can do per uh

503
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,880
bite or per per row in a punch card but

504
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:12,799
we're still so we're still having to

505
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:16,000
deal with some of the choices that were

506
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:19,159
made um in order back when computers

507
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,559
might have 4 kilobytes of of memory or

508
00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:24,240
16 kilobytes of memory for every single

509
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:26,080
thing so if you want to store um you

510
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,960
know 16 kilobytes of

511
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:31,600
16 16,000 bytes

512
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:34,240
you if you're storing 10 bytes per note

513
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,760
you only store 1,600 notes you can't get

514
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,799
through a whole piece but if you can get

515
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:43,080
it down to two matters and so we have a

516
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:45,000
lot of ways that are very compact

517
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:48,080
representations there are still out

518
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,480
there and that we're only over time

519
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:53,200
feeling like you know we can expand a

520
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,679
little bit this is your first file your

521
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,640
first encoding format that you've seen

522
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:59,520
in this class I believe right besides

523
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:02,200
stupid weird ones I make up on the on

524
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:06,000
the Fly this is um called Muse data this

525
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:09,760
was one of the first U major projects of

526
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,320
encoding uh yeah of encoding a lot of

527
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:15,799
music into things made uh by Walter huet

528
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:19,000
of huet Packard Fame and um let's try to

529
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:21,000
guess what some of the things might be

530
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,720
in this what um let's let's start with

531
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
something really obvious what do you

532
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,240
think this

533
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,919
means rest okay

534
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:33,120
good we're obviously already in a period

535
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:36,080
where we can afford four bytes to write

536
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,720
out rest rather than putting R in so

537
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,840
that's this tells you that this is a

538
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:42,559
little bit later than other things that

539
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:45,039
were happening um somebody else take a

540
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:48,799
guess what something else might

541
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:51,640
be y go ahead Z does q s for quarter Q

542
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:53,440
might s for quarter um let's see we we

543
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:55,840
we might find something that will help

544
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,600
us with that El I'll go easy measure

545
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,000
starts for measure and measure stands

546
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,919
for measure and one stands for one and

547
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,640
two stands for two right um is there

548
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:05,919
anything that would let you think that

549
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,880
QQ cube in one measure might be the

550
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:11,440
right

551
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:14,640
thing yeah t time signature T time

552
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:16,399
signature 34 right um every everybody's

553
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,360
notation teacher always told you never

554
00:25:16,399 --> 00:25:19,640
put a slash in a time signature when

555
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:22,000
you're writing on the page well in

556
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:23,919
computer stuff we always do because we

557
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,320
have nothing better to separate them

558
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:32,600
good Q's that

559
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:35,480
um you think these are notes notes good

560
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:38,159
good interesting thing is that they end

561
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:41,200
up encoding the duration

562
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:42,679
twice uh since this one I've tried to do

563
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,720
long time you know what do you think

564
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:46,799
that is and it's almost impossible to

565
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:49,720
get so you have the quarter note and you

566
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:50,799
also have something that says a quarter

567
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:54,720
takes

568
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:57,640
two something ticks maybe some things

569
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,559
like that and so you encode it twice

570
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:02,240
once

571
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:04,120
what's the difference between this two

572
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,960
that each quarter is two of something

573
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:10,520
and that this is a q who needs what for

574
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:12,200
what yeah what's printed on the page

575
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:14,039
versus what's played what's printed on

576
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:18,480
the page and what's played so that you

577
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:22,279
don't need to convert between Visual and

578
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:26,159
um and and time duration and this is a

579
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:29,039
function um in almost all modern uh

580
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:31,760
storage things uh still today

581
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:34,440
it's also helpful for um there are some

582
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:37,320
very weird cases that U that you'll run

583
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:39,640
into in one of the readings later where

584
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:42,520
composers have used durations to mean

585
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:46,559
something slightly different from what

586
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:49,679
uh they actually what they generally

587
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:51,200
are okay um so this is some of the

588
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,320
reasons why we went through efficiency

589
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,919
you're going to be um on the second

590
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:58,240
problem set the one that um you'll get

591
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:59,840
on Friday which will be done in groups

592
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:04,080
you're going to be coming up with your

593
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:07,559
own representation system for some sort

594
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:09,039
of thing that is music except for the

595
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:11,360
thing I'm just about to talk about

596
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:14,520
common western music notation so

597
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:17,200
something else besides normal scores

598
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:20,880
that we see all the time and you'll need

599
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:24,200
to make the same choices decisions

600
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:28,240
mistakes maybe that um that pioneering

601
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:31,320
people did uh in the 60s and 70s and um

602
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:34,840
hopefully um learn something about what

603
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,840
trade-offs happen along the

604
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:41,320
way so we're going to be talking uh oops

605
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:44,320
this slide's a little bit out of order

606
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:46,919
should be here this slide should be um

607
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:50,480
about something in the class which is

608
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:54,600
called common western music notation

609
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:56,679
often abbreviated to leave out one word

610
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:59,320
uh one letter either common western

611
00:27:56,679 --> 00:28:03,919
music notation common music notation

612
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:06,760
common Western notation some like that

613
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:09,399
um this is an example of what I think

614
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:13,320
most people would believe is common

615
00:28:09,399 --> 00:28:18,159
western music notation it uses notes

616
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:23,360
staves clefts things uh left to right

617
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:26,679
means earlier to later up to down

618
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,919
means higher to lower right so that

619
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:30,679
here's a whole bunch of high notes and

620
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:33,519
here's a whole bunch of low notes

621
00:28:30,679 --> 00:28:35,559
right no except for that there's certain

622
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:38,000
there's certain things that we say only

623
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:40,120
within a particular staff is higher and

624
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:44,279
lower and then we have divisions and we

625
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:47,200
move on to other systems and stuff so um

626
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:50,320
yeah so these are things that uh are

627
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:53,559
standard in common common western music

628
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:56,559
notation uh that was a piece by uh

629
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:59,760
Joseph bong the chaler Des s George this

630
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:03,360
is a piece by uh clar Shuman her Piano

631
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:05,960
Trio um Trio for piano violin and cello

632
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:08,399
and see some things that we consider to

633
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:09,399
be common western music notation

634
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:13,240
including

635
00:29:09,399 --> 00:29:14,440
slurs ties Grace notes beams all these

636
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:17,519
types of

637
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:20,440
things common western music notation can

638
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:24,039
represent a piece of music in multiple

639
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:28,559
ways this is an ARA from uh Wulf Kong

640
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:35,200
Mozart's Opera Don Giovani um

641
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:37,720
song in that IIM May by Dona and um we

642
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:41,000
have the top of each of these systems

643
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:45,440
voice part Italian translation to

644
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,440
English two two staves for

645
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:53,559
piano and then the exact

646
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:55,480
same music in some way here's her part

647
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:58,440
here except for the English is gone very

648
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:01,480
helpfully replaced with German and um

649
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:04,000
her nice trouble cff was nicely replaced

650
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:07,039
by soprano cff for ease of reading for

651
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:11,039
all of us because she's a soprano and

652
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:13,360
the piano is gone replaced with take a

653
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:16,320
guess what are these parts

654
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:18,840
for orchestra or Orchestra yeah so we

655
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,399
have we have um strings we have other

656
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:24,519
things going

657
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:27,559
on one of the questions would

658
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:30,919
be when we have multiple representations

659
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:33,279
of the same piece how do we translate

660
00:30:30,919 --> 00:30:36,080
from one to another is there a way that

661
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:38,519
we can go from this exact moment to that

662
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:41,679
exact moment and what kinds of

663
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:45,120
relationships would make that

664
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:47,960
possible um so jumping back to clar

665
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:52,600
schuman's Piano Trio um there are some

666
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:55,399
things that are that violate particular

667
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:56,440
Norms of common western music notation

668
00:30:55,399 --> 00:30:58,760
such

669
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:01,039
as well I mean there part of it but they

670
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:02,480
violate the basic basic principles what

671
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:08,200
are these things up

672
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:12,279
here not not Grace notes um let's say

673
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:15,519
a a quarter note takes one tick a half

674
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:18,000
note takes two ticks of some sort an

675
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:20,840
eighth note takes half a tick how much

676
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,840
does a Grace note

677
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:29,039
take yeah usually half the a lot of time

678
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:32,679
usually half the aot of time so so if I

679
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:36,039
put a that that's that's very true in

680
00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:38,720
one sense so correct absolutely correct

681
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:41,880
it's also not true in another sense so

682
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:47,200
if I have

683
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:50,720
44 and I put in a dotted half note and

684
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:53,480
then I put in a Grace note that takes

685
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:56,159
half of that so it's one qu so I still

686
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:59,039
have enough room

687
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:01,440
for that amount of space right can

688
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:05,120
everyone see from back here that's a

689
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:07,360
dotted what's what's wrong with this

690
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:09,000
representation Adam the grace note also

691
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,720
eats away at the actual time for the

692
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,679
note the grace yes so the grace note

693
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:17,320
steals

694
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:18,960
time from the note that it's next to or

695
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:23,240
it seals it sometimes from the one

696
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:25,559
before um so in terms of how how many

697
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:27,600
Grace notes can you how many Grace notes

698
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:29,840
can you put in a 44 measure let's put it

699
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,840
this way

700
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,600
this trick

701
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:39,799
question 16 no you can put as many in as

702
00:32:37,639 --> 00:32:42,679
you want because the Grace notes just

703
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:46,399
steal time so for instance here we're in

704
00:32:42,679 --> 00:32:48,440
68 so we have two dotted dotted um

705
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:50,279
eighth note beats and we have a dotted

706
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:52,240
cordin note so we have a dotted cordin

707
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:55,320
note here and the equivalent of a dotted

708
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:59,120
cord note here and we can squeeze in

709
00:32:55,320 --> 00:33:01,600
five gra notes there s 8

710
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:04,360
doesn't matter but where conceptually do

711
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:07,880
you play that and if we have this notion

712
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:10,159
that in Western uh common western music

713
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:13,159
everything that happens at the same time

714
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:14,760
is vertically aligned I hope your theory

715
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:17,600
teachers taught you that that's most

716
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:21,039
important rule in

717
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:23,799
general how do we know where to align

718
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:27,919
these notes with the Grace notes so

719
00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:30,559
that's um that's one violation thing the

720
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:34,240
limits of common western music notation

721
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:38,080
are not strictly defined this is a very

722
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:40,159
common p uh genre of music from uh

723
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:45,840
around 1700

724
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:47,840
1687 Elizabeth CLA jaet de ja de um very

725
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:50,679
interesting piece a lot of things that

726
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:52,480
look like common music notation until

727
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:54,360
you start

728
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,360
getting what is

729
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:59,919
this what are

730
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:01,880
these all the symbols of common western

731
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:04,519
music notation but used in a different

732
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:06,159
way these are um unmeasured preludes so

733
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:09,399
certain places that should be played in

734
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:12,359
time and certain other things that some

735
00:34:09,399 --> 00:34:14,480
most people believe um these tell you

736
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:16,960
play these notes for exactly how long

737
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:19,280
you want I kind of figure some other

738
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:22,480
people think maybe improvise something

739
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,480
on those notes

740
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:29,040
but it's common western music notation

741
00:34:26,919 --> 00:34:30,879
but it becomes a problem for the

742
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:33,440
computer what's the problem for the

743
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:36,159
computer when it's all handwritten and

744
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:39,800
so there's all kinds of ambiguity can

745
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:41,879
you you can tell that okay this is going

746
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:43,280
going and that's an A and that's a you

747
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:45,679
know that's an A and that's an e and

748
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:49,119
that's a c and oh that's either a d or

749
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:52,119
an e right we can conceive of a note

750
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:56,000
that is hard to read does your

751
00:34:52,119 --> 00:35:01,599
representation have a way of of notating

752
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:05,320
that so um musical um handwritten scores

753
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:07,880
also tend to contain lots of things that

754
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:11,320
um that don't that violate common music

755
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:12,720
notation I saw a bean manuscript once

756
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,400
where he was just going along going

757
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,839
along on two states then it became

758
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,920
obvious that the top part was just going

759
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:19,560
to repeat sorry the bottom part was just

760
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,920
going to repeat what it was doing so

761
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:23,920
goes along and just use the top one next

762
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,760
time he's drawing the next system and he

763
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,000
needs another staff oh and there's this

764
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,839
empty staff above so he go goes ahead

765
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,560
and uses it so you can be jumping

766
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:35,480
forward and backwards in time in the

767
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:39,800
same thing there are small almost every

768
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:44,079
composer um uh of of significance has

769
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:46,520
made uh their own tweaks to uh common

770
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:49,160
music notation this is by uh the 20th

771
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:52,280
Century composer Igor trinsky later in

772
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:53,920
his life he started to ask why do we um

773
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:56,400
when you have instruments that don't

774
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:59,040
play very much why do we waste all the

775
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,839
staff putting them out so it's really

776
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:04,319
easy to see what's resting if you just

777
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:06,119
start the staff where they come in and

778
00:36:04,319 --> 00:36:10,359
end it when they

779
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:12,800
end a little bit um there limits of

780
00:36:10,359 --> 00:36:15,560
common western music notation come out

781
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:18,240
in certain uh pieces this was I think my

782
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:21,079
freshman uh composition assignment uh

783
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:23,640
when I was trying to be a composer where

784
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:26,480
I've used some things that look like

785
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:28,000
normal notes but then at this point I

786
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,680
didn't want to calculate what the Tempo

787
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,680
was so just hold it for about 2 seconds

788
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:33,920
hold this for about 2 seconds and then

789
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:37,920
get to this point and this part should a

790
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:40,359
chill Rondo so we'll just show about how

791
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:43,160
kind of end like a 64th note is that

792
00:36:40,359 --> 00:36:46,240
part of common western music notation it

793
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:48,560
wasn't 50 years ago but there's quite a

794
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:52,599
number of scores that do it

795
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:55,480
now a lot of the music being written

796
00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:57,400
today are stretching common western

797
00:36:55,480 --> 00:37:00,839
music notation quite to the limits this

798
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:02,760
is uh uh Kate soer who's uh was a peer

799
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:05,920
priz finalist a few years back teaches

800
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:09,240
at Smith college one of her pieces from

801
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:13,040
uh part of iik SE her Opera um she

802
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:16,440
herself said it um where moves back and

803
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:19,200
forth in the voice between sung and

804
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:22,000
spoken and uses these other symbols to

805
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:26,160
tell you how much uh to open and close

806
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:29,520
the mouth and something a little bit odd

807
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,520
about the violin

808
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:34,800
lots of things odd I'm thinking about

809
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:37,839
the staff itself it's not a usual cluff

810
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:40,839
for the violin now we violin in

811
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:42,839
percussion cff with four lines what do

812
00:37:40,839 --> 00:37:45,000
you think those four lines represent

813
00:37:42,839 --> 00:37:47,720
what does a violin have four of strings

814
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,400
strings so just what string to play on

815
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,400
you'll figure out the

816
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:56,760
notes uh this is a piece by um Brian

817
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:59,800
ferow part of a compositional group

818
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:01,599
called new comp lexity uh which if we

819
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:03,960
look just at the first measure there's

820
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:06,079
almost nothing that violates common

821
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:08,200
western music notation principles that

822
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:09,880
we learn in our Theory classes but they

823
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:13,760
kind of take it to the extreme so for

824
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:16,680
instance first measure is 28 where um

825
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:19,119
we're going to put in in place of four

826
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:22,400
what the four 16th notes of 28 we'll put

827
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:25,160
s16th notes in within that um for most

828
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,680
of these we're going to put 21 30 second

829
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:28,920
notes in the place of the first 20 of

830
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:31,119
them or 2 and then within that we can

831
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:34,359
have triplets so that tuplets can be

832
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:36,119
nested almost indefinitely and there's

833
00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:37,359
no reason why our time signatures have

834
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:39,760
to be powers of

835
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:42,400
two so people are playing with things a

836
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:44,920
lot okay Professor stop talking about

837
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:47,599
the weird music this is all all strange

838
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:49,760
new music it's no nobody in the great

839
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:52,520
past like Mozart would do things like

840
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,960
this so this is we go back to Mozart um

841
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:56,839
this is again Don Giovani the end of the

842
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:59,760
First Act it's very cool moment if you

843
00:38:56,839 --> 00:39:02,720
don't know the Opera they go to a a very

844
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:04,599
very rich Ball and it's kind of like um

845
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:06,800
going to a club today with multiple

846
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:09,240
rooms and multiple multiple you know um

847
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:12,040
people uh DJs or whatever doing things

848
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:15,680
and so here at this big ball we're going

849
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:17,920
to have in one room in 34 a stately

850
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:20,240
Minette for the upper upper classes they

851
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:22,000
like their 34 dances at the time and

852
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,800
then in another room we're going to have

853
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,800
a dance in two four for sort of the

854
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,560
middle class uh cuz they like those

855
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:29,440
things and then for the farmers and

856
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:32,560
things uh we're going to have uh they

857
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:34,599
like they like their trible time 38 5 68

858
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:39,400
Dances all

859
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:41,599
together at the same time the bar lines

860
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:44,480
when you say um well let's start at

861
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:47,520
measure 22 you go I'm sorry my measure

862
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:52,440
22 or her measure 22 because you don't

863
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:52,440
have a concept that measures um are

864
00:39:53,920 --> 00:40:01,079
Universal this is um I think this is now

865
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:04,599
this is Revel or DBC I think it's I

866
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:07,200
think it's DBC the dance D um very very

867
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:09,839
common everything looks great everything

868
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:13,319
looks great

869
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:13,319
until what does that

870
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:20,400
mean we're in treble cff and trouble cff

871
00:40:16,839 --> 00:40:23,640
but we have a base cff um just just for

872
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:26,400
this one note does it also go here no

873
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:27,960
you can tell what this is what that

874
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,800
means just

875
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:32,680
better not to write a whole another

876
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:35,560
staff just for one note right but you

877
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:38,160
can have two CS simultaneously on the

878
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:40,640
same staff you can also uh there are

879
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:42,440
examples from Bach of two time

880
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:45,000
signatures uh in the same staff or

881
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:47,200
changing time signatures mid measure and

882
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,040
what does that mean so almost every

883
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:52,960
composer has pushed the limits in some

884
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:55,480
ways of conventional music

885
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,839
notation jump back to clar Schuman one

886
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:59,680
more time there's certain things that

887
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:02,480
might be very obvious to us but that can

888
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:04,119
be very difficult for uh encoding in

889
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,800
such a way that it's completely

890
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:09,240
unambiguous for a device as stupid as a

891
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:14,119
computer such

892
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:14,119
as where in the measure does this

893
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:23,640
begin you all are musicians you all know

894
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:25,359
that this line is continuing up to here

895
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:28,400
and that's why there's something empty

896
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:30,400
here and empty here

897
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:34,480
but how would you ever how would you

898
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:37,119
teach a computer to make that kind of

899
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:39,400
abstraction that lines can move from

900
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:42,480
staff to staff and therefore don't need

901
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:46,480
to be um filled

902
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:48,400
in so um any questions on this sorry on

903
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:50,000
on any of these things or any discussion

904
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,640
points and Adam we'll start with you

905
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,960
that rest supposed to be what is this

906
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:58,240
rest this at the beginning of the

907
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:00,760
there's a oh this one here uh this is

908
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:04,560
because your professor did not print a

909
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:08,319
PDF but took a really fast screenshot

910
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:11,079
from finale and so it's even it's even a

911
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:13,960
new thing that um our user interface so

912
00:42:11,079 --> 00:42:17,520
this is the user interface that says um

913
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:20,359
this is a hidden rest until we get to

914
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:22,520
this note that has to be added onto here

915
00:42:20,359 --> 00:42:24,960
super great no one's ever ever seen that

916
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:27,440
but yes the user interfaces also end up

917
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,480
being part of our conception of of

918
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,440
notation

919
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:34,839
today

920
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:34,839
good other points

921
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:43,079
or so where does common western music

922
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:47,839
notation end where does other things go

923
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:50,240
and um sorry

924
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:53,280
and what might we want to represent

925
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:55,520
that's not common western music notation

926
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:58,319
so this is a a type of thing I work on

927
00:42:55,520 --> 00:43:01,640
from time to time this is um church

928
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:04,839
music from uh I think the early 17th

929
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:08,680
century or or late late Sometime Late

930
00:43:04,839 --> 00:43:10,720
17th century maybe um and looks very

931
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:13,119
much like ours but

932
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:15,920
just the note shapes are a little bit

933
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:19,240
different common western music notation

934
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:23,480
just with a little little twist maybe

935
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:25,680
not sure but it's not too far off all of

936
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:27,480
our notation goes back and back and back

937
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:30,040
in time or it has come from things

938
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:32,079
decisions beave for let's start with

939
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:35,720
this is Western music notation this is

940
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:38,880
the first um music notation of Western

941
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:41,800
Europe from about the 9th century um

942
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:45,240
this is the chant for uh the mass on

943
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:47,520
East on Christmas day um and what these

944
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:50,520
things do is they tell you how many

945
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:55,160
notes there are and if they go this case

946
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:57,800
one 23 um and they go start low go high

947
00:43:55,160 --> 00:44:00,960
come back down about the same the same

948
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:02,839
higher note same thing we have up down

949
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,760
most of these go up and down here we

950
00:44:02,839 --> 00:44:08,720
have one two three notes going down

951
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:10,119
three notes going down um the height

952
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:12,800
means

953
00:44:10,119 --> 00:44:15,040
nothing it is

954
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:19,119
music might we want to represent this

955
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:20,880
and how might we want to and some of the

956
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:23,559
things people are always wondering we

957
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:25,280
have pages and pages and Pages thousands

958
00:44:23,559 --> 00:44:27,800
of pages of Music in this

959
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:30,040
notation how is it helpful for somebody

960
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:32,000
to know how many notes to sing and

961
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:33,079
whether they go up and down but not What

962
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,200
notes they

963
00:44:33,079 --> 00:44:40,319
are right so that's something a lot of

964
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:42,359
people out um wish we had met yesterday

965
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:44,359
be a little bit more obvious um this is

966
00:44:42,359 --> 00:44:50,440
a piece from around

967
00:44:44,359 --> 00:44:53,160
1420 uh B cordier um piece B bons uh in

968
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:57,079
the shape of a heart there something

969
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:58,920
about the the shape of the piece is that

970
00:44:57,079 --> 00:45:00,520
something we want to represent where

971
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:03,079
we're making our

972
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:04,839
representations about the same period

973
00:45:03,079 --> 00:45:07,319
it's a piece in the shape instead of a

974
00:45:04,839 --> 00:45:10,920
heart in know shape of a harp hard to

975
00:45:07,319 --> 00:45:12,559
say um where it's basically the music

976
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:15,920
notation of its time except that it's

977
00:45:12,559 --> 00:45:18,680
sideways but um we're writing on the

978
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:21,960
strings so we need twice as many strings

979
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:21,960
and we don't write anything on the

980
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:28,200
spaces getting back to more modern music

981
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:30,640
some of the things that

982
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:32,000
definitely violate almost every

983
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:34,280
principle of common western music

984
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:37,520
notation but use some of them this is a

985
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:39,960
Cornelius cardu piece Treatise which

986
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:44,559
uses a lot of notational symbols a lot

987
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:47,000
of things that look like music

988
00:45:44,559 --> 00:45:50,760
notation but it's up to you to interpret

989
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:52,680
them done differently every group

990
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:54,599
performs this quite

991
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:57,040
differently if you're going to have a

992
00:45:54,599 --> 00:45:59,400
graphical score where you use music

993
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:01,920
notation elements but they don't mean

994
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:04,680
anything maybe a musical score doesn't

995
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:07,359
necessarily need to have any uh elements

996
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:12,359
at all Earl Brown's folio from uh

997
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:12,359
December uh yeah uh December what is it

998
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:22,400
1962 that's all things that have come

999
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:24,640
out of the West um Japan China every uh

1000
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:28,920
many cultures around the world have

1001
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:28,920
developed their own notational systems

1002
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:35,960
um and then there are notational systems

1003
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:38,400
that have been made to try to study the

1004
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:43,160
physicality in this case of Inuit throat

1005
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:44,760
songs of um without using anything that

1006
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:49,920
might have the cultural baggage of

1007
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:52,800
Western mation so we start notating the

1008
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:55,040
um the actual you know the the

1009
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:58,839
spectrograms is that a form of music

1010
00:46:55,040 --> 00:47:03,720
notation and so how would do that um one

1011
00:46:58,839 --> 00:47:03,720
more of of

1012
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:09,040
taure just giving a sense of some of the

1013
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:13,440
notations that might be happening in the

1014
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:17,079
world in addition to notations that um

1015
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:20,000
that have been sort of created uh over

1016
00:47:17,079 --> 00:47:21,839
time by people um there are invented

1017
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,440
notations that tend to that have been

1018
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:26,440
found to be very useful times this is

1019
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:29,240
something called tubs if anybody has

1020
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:31,680
taken the time unit box system I think

1021
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:35,400
was invented around the 1970s I'll look

1022
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:37,839
up exact uh time later but the notion is

1023
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:40,680
kind of like I did with the um bits

1024
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:44,640
things that you can specify what the

1025
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:48,000
smallest tick you want to notate is and

1026
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:50,520
specify when somebody plays or if you

1027
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,319
need to specify different things they

1028
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:55,160
might play you can put that in the Box

1029
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:58,880
this has become a very uh useful and

1030
00:47:55,160 --> 00:48:02,480
used system uh especially uh in the

1031
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:02,480
notation of West African

1032
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:08,520
music lots of notational system

1033
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:10,839
representations have been created uh

1034
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:13,160
many of which have not been successful

1035
00:48:10,839 --> 00:48:15,200
this is the turntable list notation

1036
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:17,400
system because there's nothing that's

1037
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:19,880
greater and cooler than spinning at a

1038
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:23,000
bar while reading music notation right

1039
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:27,119
but it's it is a way of notating what

1040
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:28,640
somebody did for reproduction later

1041
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:31,839
let me see if I let me see if my sound

1042
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:33,480
is working before doing this I'll be

1043
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:37,580
very disappointing I should have checked

1044
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:50,050
that ahead of time give me one second

1045
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:50,050
[Music]

1046
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:04,640
so um but not all notation and

1047
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:06,319
representational systems end up being

1048
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:08,079
very successful I think this is super

1049
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:11,240
cool I don't know why I made a joke

1050
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:14,240
about it I think it's really Innovative

1051
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:18,079
uh the website has been down for about

1052
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:20,359
six years now so I assume uh it did not

1053
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:20,359
take

1054
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:26,760
off one of the earliest um mechanical

1055
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:29,559
notational representation systems that

1056
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:31,480
that's still very influential is the

1057
00:49:29,559 --> 00:49:35,760
player piano role or we just call it the

1058
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:39,400
piano role now where the actual punching

1059
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:43,160
of the of the notes on the staves

1060
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:46,680
becomes a very important uh part of how

1061
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:49,359
um well it encodes the notes so we get

1062
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:52,520
again the same kinds of Notions of up

1063
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:55,559
and down though side and side for height

1064
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:59,040
I guess sort of height turns sideways

1065
00:49:55,559 --> 00:50:00,799
and as the role progresses there's a a

1066
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:03,160
cursor there's this technical name for

1067
00:50:00,799 --> 00:50:06,680
it I can't remember in piano roles um

1068
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:08,799
that is reading at that moment what um

1069
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:10,599
what should be happening and or what is

1070
00:50:08,799 --> 00:50:13,599
happening at that moment there are other

1071
00:50:10,599 --> 00:50:15,720
ways of controlling usually on the side

1072
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:18,960
what the dynamic of the entire piano is

1073
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:22,440
but usually not of encoding what the

1074
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:24,480
dynamic of any individual note is and

1075
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:26,880
quite often written along the side

1076
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:28,880
though there will be the lyrics of the

1077
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:32,799
song written kind of like um when you're

1078
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:35,520
driving and it says like you know slow

1079
00:50:32,799 --> 00:50:37,440
Crossing pedestrian Crossing you WR read

1080
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:39,040
upside down so you learn to read it that

1081
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:42,200
way so that you can sing along with what

1082
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:45,440
the piano is playing very cool

1083
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:46,799
multimedia questions about about um

1084
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,559
things going forward or discussion or

1085
00:50:46,799 --> 00:50:49,280
just things you're thinking about um

1086
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:52,799
because you're going to be thinking

1087
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:54,400
about something to represent that isn't

1088
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:56,680
common western music

1089
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:58,319
notation over the next week yeah Adam

1090
00:50:56,680 --> 00:51:00,799
that abstract painting that you showed

1091
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:04,720
up the notes that reminds a bit of line

1092
00:51:00,799 --> 00:51:07,160
writer line writer oh yes the um the the

1093
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:09,359
game where you're riding on the you draw

1094
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:11,760
all the things and then you get to see

1095
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:14,440
how the um how the motorcycle jumps

1096
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:17,119
around is that one us some people have

1097
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:18,520
that composition in which line riter

1098
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:22,640
motions are synced to a piece of

1099
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:24,640
classical music very very very cool nice

1100
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:26,599
yeah I want to see that at some point

1101
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:31,839
yes is this just kind of like a big View

1102
00:51:26,599 --> 00:51:33,559
music books yeah P um it is but um often

1103
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:36,119
something that you could also attach to

1104
00:51:33,559 --> 00:51:38,680
your home piano so that you you have

1105
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:40,799
your home piano early on and then later

1106
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:43,240
they become or I might have my

1107
00:51:40,799 --> 00:51:46,799
chronology reversed but then they become

1108
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:49,440
um sort of things that um that become

1109
00:51:46,799 --> 00:51:52,160
standard loone objects um but there were

1110
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:54,280
there were um things that allowed people

1111
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:57,599
to feel more like they were playing the

1112
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:59,920
piano um by having you um pedal it and

1113
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:02,240
control the volume so you could do and

1114
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:04,200
control certain levels of softness kind

1115
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:06,400
of like using a Betty Crocker Bake Mix

1116
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:08,200
to bake your cake you get feeling that

1117
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:12,119
you really did something to make the

1118
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:14,760
music but not the really hard Parts um

1119
00:52:12,119 --> 00:52:16,720
yeah cool yeah these These are

1120
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:18,280
interesting we have um some of these

1121
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:20,160
over at the Lewis music library which

1122
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:23,040
I'm going to be talking more about uh

1123
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:25,440
later as we um go into representation

1124
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:27,079
things but the Lewis music library just

1125
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:30,079
over here um

1126
00:52:27,079 --> 00:52:33,720
has put as one of its um sort of

1127
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:35,680
long-term Visions to try to get um all

1128
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:39,200
of the different technologies that have

1129
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:41,559
been used to encode and playback music

1130
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:44,119
over time so there's wax cylinders and

1131
00:52:41,559 --> 00:52:46,480
piano rolls and stuff and real to reels

1132
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:48,200
and trying to make it so that there's

1133
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:50,640
some that are very valuable and need to

1134
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:53,319
be preserved and some that um we can

1135
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:55,599
just play with and you do wouldn't want

1136
00:52:53,319 --> 00:52:58,160
to have a problem but if you did end up

1137
00:52:55,599 --> 00:53:02,520
breaking the real tape it's okay we got

1138
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:04,480
we got more um yeah so definitely if you

1139
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:06,400
haven't been to lisis music library uh

1140
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:08,680
check out what they have

1141
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:10,720
there they also have a theramin if you

1142
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:12,359
want to play with that and and you might

1143
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:14,079
be using them at the end of the semester

1144
00:53:12,359 --> 00:53:17,359
when we make some videos because they

1145
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:21,319
have a nice podcast video recording um

1146
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:24,280
space for editing there okay so we've

1147
00:53:21,319 --> 00:53:26,760
been thinking uh a lot about the common

1148
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:28,599
western music notation in sort of in

1149
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:30,880
general terms now I want to think about

1150
00:53:28,599 --> 00:53:32,079
uh a little bit computer representations

1151
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:34,000
I don't know why I didn't write the word

1152
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:35,880
computer

1153
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,200
representations and again these are

1154
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:41,480
slides that I'm borrowing from a

1155
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:44,160
composition package named uh Bel Bon

1156
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:47,280
exactly the named after that um piece in

1157
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:50,240
the shape of the heart um things so we

1158
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:52,599
talked about this extremely fast on day

1159
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:56,040
one but I want to slow down a little bit

1160
00:53:52,599 --> 00:53:59,440
more um the two main ways that people

1161
00:53:56,040 --> 00:54:01,079
have ch chosen um generally to encode

1162
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:05,520
common western music notation for the

1163
00:54:01,079 --> 00:54:09,839
computer are in terms of the container

1164
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:12,720
based thing the Box based so you have a

1165
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:15,160
big box that might be the whole score um

1166
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:17,920
you know some kind of a uh thing and

1167
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:20,160
then you have smaller boxes that um you

1168
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:23,280
know that might be Parts within those

1169
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:26,240
you have measures and quite often um

1170
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:29,040
voices become things inside that and

1171
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:32,960
then going all the way down to

1172
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:37,160
notes so this um representation the

1173
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:41,640
other second one that is uh very common

1174
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:43,960
is the time sliced based container so

1175
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:46,760
everything that happens at a certain U

1176
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:52,400
moment in musical time is it in its own

1177
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:55,520
slot some people would not put um these

1178
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:56,960
in three different slots because or

1179
00:54:55,520 --> 00:55:00,000
these four things that in four different

1180
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:03,359
slots because all of these things happen

1181
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:07,680
musically at time zero right they the

1182
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:10,440
clef um you know there there is no um

1183
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:13,200
note or anything that there's no

1184
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:15,599
conceptual notion that the clef comes

1185
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:16,720
first and then the time sign then the

1186
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:18,720
key signature comes then the time

1187
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:20,119
signature comes then the first note

1188
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:22,200
except that we have to write them in

1189
00:55:20,119 --> 00:55:24,599
certain order on notation but all of

1190
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:27,839
them are present at the very beginning

1191
00:55:24,599 --> 00:55:30,520
of the score

1192
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:32,520
so I want to start talking about some of

1193
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:34,720
the reasons why you might want to use

1194
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:36,640
one of these and why they're all bad

1195
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:39,359
choices every choice you make is going

1196
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:42,680
to be a bad choice at some point so

1197
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:45,480
thinking about um the part-based

1198
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:48,520
representation you can immediately see

1199
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:51,280
certain problems uh anyone know an oia

1200
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:53,720
sta what you use that for Somebody

1201
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:55,599
explain that so Adam I think we've been

1202
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:57,119
really great but I want to hear a few

1203
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:57,839
more voices

1204
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:02,039
right

1205
00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:04,079
now anyone ever heard that term AIO

1206
00:56:02,039 --> 00:56:07,440
staff

1207
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:10,760
no it's a little

1208
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:12,839
stuff no no pianist violence see it

1209
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:14,480
quite often especially when you're

1210
00:56:12,839 --> 00:56:16,599
starting when you're playing a conero

1211
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:20,119
sign is in a really hard

1212
00:56:16,599 --> 00:56:22,480
part yeah Hannah alternative way to play

1213
00:56:20,119 --> 00:56:25,400
that yes it's an alternative way to play

1214
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:26,760
that measure this this is a hypothetical

1215
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:29,200
one because I don't think that would

1216
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:32,039
ever be an alternative way to play this

1217
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:33,640
but quite often if it goes too high um

1218
00:56:32,039 --> 00:56:36,720
for some people especially for singers

1219
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:38,160
actually singers see O is a lot because

1220
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:40,160
uh if something's not in your voice

1221
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:42,000
range some things they'll write a

1222
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:43,960
different different part yeah so you

1223
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,240
have a staff that just appears for a

1224
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:49,440
minute we said that our top level thing

1225
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:50,960
might be the parts beyond that sometimes

1226
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:54,760
for a piano thing you might have the

1227
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:56,799
part and then staff one and staff two

1228
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:59,799
but here we have a staff that just comes

1229
00:56:56,799 --> 00:57:03,079
up and if everything is in a box and one

1230
00:56:59,799 --> 00:57:03,079
of the lowest boxes is a

1231
00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:07,599
measure you have these

1232
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:12,640
problems what do you do when you want to

1233
00:57:10,119 --> 00:57:14,839
say if everything's in a box that a

1234
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:16,760
crescendo goes from the beginning to the

1235
00:57:14,839 --> 00:57:19,000
next how how might you solve some of

1236
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:19,000
that

1237
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:24,280
computationally when everything has to

1238
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:27,240
be in a box and think of a box as like

1239
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:29,599
an array or a to yeah go

1240
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:33,079
ahead have like a flag start something

1241
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:35,440
in one box and then CL yeah so

1242
00:57:33,079 --> 00:57:37,039
everything could have a start and an end

1243
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:39,920
or certain things might maybe a note

1244
00:57:37,039 --> 00:57:42,240
doesn't need to have a start and end but

1245
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:44,440
yeah you might have a flag for starts

1246
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:48,400
and ends so there are some ways around

1247
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:51,039
it um other possibilities

1248
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:52,640
anybody yeah go ahead maybe just put

1249
00:57:51,039 --> 00:57:54,680
them a higher level up like they don't

1250
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:57,079
belong inside measures maybe they belong

1251
00:57:54,680 --> 00:58:00,559
inside Parts yeah so you move move up

1252
00:57:57,079 --> 00:58:04,039
one level that's great um when you do

1253
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:06,799
that um that works quite often but then

1254
00:58:04,039 --> 00:58:08,160
you have a second problem that comes up

1255
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:10,480
and that don't worry this problem was

1256
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:12,880
going to come up anyhow um especially

1257
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:15,640
once Mozart brings his three bands to

1258
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:19,559
the page but you have maybe here's your

1259
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:23,000
part and you have your measures and

1260
00:58:19,559 --> 00:58:25,559
things and now you want to elevate the

1261
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:28,240
crescendo that went across two measures

1262
00:58:25,559 --> 00:58:32,400
you want to El elevate it up to the next

1263
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:32,400
part the next thing

1264
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:37,599
um let's assume that these are some sort

1265
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:39,799
of arrays so we're putting commas them

1266
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:43,039
then you might have the problem maybe

1267
00:58:39,799 --> 00:58:45,680
you put it here maybe you put it here

1268
00:58:43,039 --> 00:58:48,680
but suddenly the array is no longer

1269
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:52,400
sequential in other words that certain

1270
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:54,680
things can appear at points that are out

1271
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:56,799
of line and so we s call this the

1272
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:58,839
forward backwards cursor

1273
00:58:56,799 --> 00:59:01,440
so that we're at a certain point but we

1274
00:58:58,839 --> 00:59:03,039
need to look back or to look forward in

1275
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:05,720
order to see what's happening at that

1276
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:06,920
point but it's also a very good solution

1277
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:10,680
and it's something that happens quite

1278
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:12,880
often so two great Solutions any

1279
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:14,599
other doesn't even have to be that great

1280
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:17,079
those are like the two industry most

1281
00:59:14,599 --> 00:59:20,920
standard uh ways of getting around this

1282
00:59:17,079 --> 00:59:24,079
I can plant a better

1283
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:25,359
thing okay good that's that's fine I

1284
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:27,280
should have said those are two of the

1285
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:28,520
three great industry standard ways and

1286
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:30,960
one of you would have come up with a

1287
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:32,480
third way and invented something new

1288
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:36,480
never never say that there's no more

1289
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:37,920
possibilities to MIT student um here is

1290
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:40,119
one of the the problem that we were

1291
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:43,440
talking about this earlier with a Time

1292
00:59:40,119 --> 00:59:47,359
based system that Grace notes which take

1293
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:49,640
up no concept no no number of ticks in

1294
00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:53,520
the time signature but of course take up

1295
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:56,240
time um to play and take up space on the

1296
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:59,319
page how are they engraved and they they

1297
00:59:56,240 --> 01:00:01,280
end up being one of the great problems

1298
00:59:59,319 --> 01:00:05,799
of the time

1299
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:07,720
method so you could say hey I'm great

1300
01:00:05,799 --> 01:00:09,880
I'm not a bagpiper so I don't use Grace

1301
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:12,119
notes bagpipers use Grace notes all over

1302
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:14,599
the time so I can do the timebase system

1303
01:00:12,119 --> 01:00:16,640
or somebody else can say look my my

1304
01:00:14,599 --> 01:00:18,200
piece is forte from the beginning to end

1305
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:20,760
I'm never going to have a crescendo I

1306
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:22,599
don't need to worry about I can use the

1307
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:26,000
part

1308
01:00:22,599 --> 01:00:28,079
system the one of the things this class

1309
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,920
CL is not just is not computational

1310
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:31,960
representation but it's computational

1311
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:33,480
music theory and Analysis eventually

1312
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:35,319
we're going to be diving into our

1313
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:38,559
representations and doing musical

1314
01:00:35,319 --> 01:00:41,000
analysis on them right and there's

1315
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:44,160
certain things that we often like to do

1316
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:46,200
um we said uh first class Yahoo is

1317
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:49,440
written a parallel fifth almost every

1318
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:52,079
hand went up um that's we call Voice

1319
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:55,280
leading where we're looking at how

1320
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:58,160
certain chords or certain voices at one

1321
01:00:55,280 --> 01:01:01,480
moment move to something at another uh

1322
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:06,119
anybody have a have a professor who

1323
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:08,960
frowned on this do we know it yeah um

1324
01:01:06,119 --> 01:01:12,400
overlap they sometimes call this where

1325
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:14,839
the bottom note has jumped above the

1326
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:17,960
place where the top note had recently

1327
01:01:14,839 --> 01:01:19,880
vacated in certain styles of music it's

1328
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:22,799
not um very

1329
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:26,039
idiomatic well let's analyze how would

1330
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:29,079
we find overlap in the part base system

1331
01:01:26,039 --> 01:01:31,680
in the in the Box um system in the

1332
01:01:29,079 --> 01:01:34,440
container system we'd probably have

1333
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:36,200
there's one container for this part or

1334
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:38,760
measure and then there's going to be one

1335
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:42,480
container for the up stemed notes that's

1336
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:47,799
a voice one container for the down stem

1337
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:50,359
notes we need to know if at this moment

1338
01:01:47,799 --> 01:01:53,680
um at at this moment this note has

1339
01:01:50,359 --> 01:01:55,359
crossed over the previous notes in the

1340
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:57,039
other container so we have to be able to

1341
01:01:55,359 --> 01:01:59,400
jump back back and forth among

1342
01:01:57,039 --> 01:02:03,720
containers and that's it's not very good

1343
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:06,480
to do so the time slice we want to look

1344
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:08,880
at everything that's happening here and

1345
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:12,000
then everything that's happening

1346
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:14,400
here and then it becomes a problem of

1347
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,920
yes but but how does this note in the

1348
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:20,079
First Slice relate to the second so for

1349
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:23,440
voice leading problems uh to jump to the

1350
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:26,240
conclusion there neither system works

1351
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:28,920
well they both have problem they both

1352
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:31,440
have big conceptual difficulties that

1353
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:34,240
make voice leading one of the one of the

1354
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:36,839
hard problems that uh always needs to be

1355
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:40,039
solved specifically for music before any

1356
01:02:36,839 --> 01:02:41,279
deeper analysis can happen and it means

1357
01:02:40,039 --> 01:02:45,039
that generally speaking you're going to

1358
01:02:41,279 --> 01:02:48,319
be writing a system from moving from one

1359
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:52,079
representation to another from a time

1360
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:54,000
wise to a box wise and how to move back

1361
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:56,039
and forth and have your system be able

1362
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,799
to have multiple representations it's

1363
01:02:56,039 --> 01:02:58,799
one of the major

1364
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:05,319
problems last little topic for today and

1365
01:03:02,839 --> 01:03:06,480
I think we're done with slides so I can

1366
01:03:05,319 --> 01:03:11,119
put this

1367
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:12,799
up um is just some of the terms that

1368
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:14,480
you're going to come up actually two two

1369
01:03:12,799 --> 01:03:16,240
little things I'll always make sure

1370
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:20,119
because I don't like to keep anybody

1371
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:22,240
late I want to cover the last uh last

1372
01:03:20,119 --> 01:03:24,359
item on there um you will get problem

1373
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:26,079
set two on Friday after you turn in

1374
01:03:24,359 --> 01:03:30,039
problem set one it will also will be a

1375
01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:32,839
onewe assignment um there is one assign

1376
01:03:30,039 --> 01:03:35,720
one reading uh to add on it's about I

1377
01:03:32,839 --> 01:03:38,960
think 15 pages or so but uh 20 pages but

1378
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:42,000
most of its pictures um uh that you'll

1379
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:44,319
find on canvas it is a article by

1380
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,319
Nicholas cook uh who's one of the main

1381
01:03:44,319 --> 01:03:48,160
people in this field called uh

1382
01:03:46,319 --> 01:03:51,960
computational comparative and

1383
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:54,200
computational musicology and it is um

1384
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:56,480
it's one of the foundational texts in

1385
01:03:54,200 --> 01:04:00,559
this field um so I want read it it's

1386
01:03:56,480 --> 01:04:02,640
little it's uh 18 19 years old now so

1387
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:04,160
it's a little bit out of date you'll see

1388
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:06,400
some of the encoding some of the ways of

1389
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:08,960
writing computer code are are are a

1390
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:11,440
little um archaic now but what it says

1391
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:14,000
is still really really good um so you'll

1392
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:15,960
find that online and we'll discuss that

1393
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,279
there's certain questions uh to start

1394
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:19,920
thinking about you don't need to write

1395
01:04:17,279 --> 01:04:22,079
out answers to them but but maybe sketch

1396
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:26,400
down an answer to one or two of them so

1397
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:27,839
that you can um be quite participatory t

1398
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:31,400
on uh on

1399
01:04:27,839 --> 01:04:34,079
Friday and um if you've haven't been

1400
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:36,200
reading very many uh scholarly articles

1401
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:38,240
or this is your first time uh reading an

1402
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:40,839
article written for academics I have

1403
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:43,240
like a little six-minute optional video

1404
01:04:40,839 --> 01:04:46,000
on how I read these articles that maybe

1405
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:49,000
even if you are a master at uh you know

1406
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:51,119
great at doing this it might still be

1407
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:53,880
useful to see how a professor um doesn't

1408
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:56,240
read from the beginning to the end um in

1409
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:59,039
one set so if you want that

1410
01:04:56,240 --> 01:05:01,480
um that could that might be particularly

1411
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:03,319
useful so we have about four minutes for

1412
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:04,799
the last topic and the one thing that I

1413
01:05:03,319 --> 01:05:07,200
want uh that you'll probably want to

1414
01:05:04,799 --> 01:05:10,119
look at the outline for I usually put

1415
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:11,400
the outline for you to get later but um

1416
01:05:10,119 --> 01:05:15,559
something and it's

1417
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:17,400
about the different um music

1418
01:05:15,559 --> 01:05:20,200
representation some of the different

1419
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:24,920
terms that we're going to be using a

1420
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:27,920
lot um has anybody taken uh uh more than

1421
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:32,079
one or or a couple philosophy classes

1422
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:32,079
and come across this

1423
01:05:35,279 --> 01:05:41,680
term philosophy class what about in a CS

1424
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:42,880
class computer science anybody ever see

1425
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:45,240
I'm not going to ask for a definition

1426
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:50,839
right now unless you want to do it yeah

1427
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:54,160
great um so ontologies are sort of

1428
01:05:50,839 --> 01:05:57,599
this ontology is the study some people

1429
01:05:54,160 --> 01:06:01,480
say of essence of meaning of what it

1430
01:05:57,599 --> 01:06:04,200
means to mean something general uhu

1431
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:06,440
philosophy and computer science have two

1432
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:08,039
slightly different definitions of

1433
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:09,880
ontology so you're going to start seeing

1434
01:06:08,039 --> 01:06:11,440
the word ontology in a lot of

1435
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:14,920
representations it has to do with

1436
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:19,720
representation for for

1437
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:22,640
philosophy and this is I mean really

1438
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:25,920
philos

1439
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:29,039
so um your

1440
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:30,559
you're getting a lot about um what are

1441
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:32,160
the limits of something that Mak

1442
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:35,039
something no longer something so we did

1443
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:38,000
a lot of philosophical ontological

1444
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:40,400
discussions in the fir today and on um

1445
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:42,480
and last class right um what's what's

1446
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:46,480
something that we were trying to play

1447
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:50,799
find the limits of so

1448
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:50,799
much when something is no longer

1449
01:06:51,359 --> 01:06:58,079
something a a note yeah WR that there so

1450
01:06:54,880 --> 01:07:00,680
what's some things when is a note one

1451
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:04,880
note when is a note two notes when is a

1452
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:07,559
note six notes right we pl with that um

1453
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:11,920
when is common western music

1454
01:07:07,559 --> 01:07:14,480
notation no longer can does that apply I

1455
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:17,599
kind of you know uh did the the Frog

1456
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:19,720
boiling in hot water trick like kind of

1457
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:21,480
slowly slowly slowly moved out until

1458
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:23,640
finally it's like wait a second

1459
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:26,200
Professor that's a whole bunch of STS on

1460
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:27,520
a page right um but but we got there

1461
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:31,440
very very slowly how do we put a

1462
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:34,079
dividing line um so it's a philosophical

1463
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:35,720
definition and then and that's and we're

1464
01:07:34,079 --> 01:07:37,240
going to be using that one in this class

1465
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:38,960
because this is also a humani class

1466
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:40,839
we're be thinking about those types of

1467
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:44,599
things what is the limit of something

1468
01:07:40,839 --> 01:07:48,480
what is a note what is um C if a piece

1469
01:07:44,599 --> 01:07:50,799
of music is every note and every um and

1470
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:53,000
every duration that's in there how many

1471
01:07:50,799 --> 01:07:55,720
notes can you get wrong and still say

1472
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:58,160
that you're playing you know uh B to

1473
01:07:55,720 --> 01:08:02,440
Vince uh how C your

1474
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:04,640
Sonata 10% 5% one note wrong and it is

1475
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:06,200
not the piece these are some of the

1476
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:07,559
things that that the philosophical

1477
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:09,520
definition does we're not going to get

1478
01:08:07,559 --> 01:08:11,880
to the second half here but so just

1479
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:14,480
we'll end with the computer science

1480
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:17,480
usage which is also very very cool and

1481
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:20,159
related and that would be what are all

1482
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:23,880
of the

1483
01:08:20,159 --> 01:08:27,440
objects yeah disle

1484
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:27,440
objects names

1485
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:33,520
relationships used in a

1486
01:08:37,719 --> 01:08:44,359
representation so on on ontology of a

1487
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:46,759
file of of your computer's file system

1488
01:08:44,359 --> 01:08:47,839
might say that there are documents and

1489
01:08:46,759 --> 01:08:50,759
there are

1490
01:08:47,839 --> 01:08:54,480
folders can folders can documents go in

1491
01:08:50,759 --> 01:08:57,839
folders yes can folders go in documents

1492
01:08:54,480 --> 01:09:00,159
no can documents go in documents no can

1493
01:08:57,839 --> 01:09:02,040
folders go in folders okay so we're

1494
01:09:00,159 --> 01:09:04,359
starting to make some kind of

1495
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:06,640
representation of something can a a

1496
01:09:04,359 --> 01:09:09,719
document appear twice somewhere in your

1497
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:12,960
hard drive diff different operating

1498
01:09:09,719 --> 01:09:15,640
systems yes no they're ways of doing it

1499
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:17,719
um so these are all the decisions that

1500
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:19,679
make up the systems and objects and

1501
01:09:17,719 --> 01:09:22,199
representations in use we're going to

1502
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:24,159
start up again on Friday by talking

1503
01:09:22,199 --> 01:09:25,520
about some of the ontologies that we've

1504
01:09:24,159 --> 01:09:27,880
already been creating some of the

1505
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:29,560
relationships and some of the different

1506
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:30,960
ways starting to get back into

1507
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:33,920
programming we haven't really done that

1508
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:36,120
for a little bit in class um some of the

1509
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:38,319
ways that we might represent the

1510
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:41,679
relationships between notes and pitches

1511
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:41,679
and durations and so much

1512
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:58,360
else e
