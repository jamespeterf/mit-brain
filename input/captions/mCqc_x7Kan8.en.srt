00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm not sure I learned this when I was

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,639
at Apple, but I learned it based on the

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,800
data when I was at Apple. I now take a

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,400
longer term view on people. In other

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,320
words, when I see something not being

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,240
done

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,320
right, my first reaction isn't to go fix

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,680
it. We're building a team here and we're

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,720
going to do great stuff for the next

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,920
decade, not just the next year. And so

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:29,279
what do I need to do to help so that the

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:33,600
person that's screwing up learns versus

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:36,160
how do I fix the problem? And uh that's

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,399
painful sometimes. And my and I still

15
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,520
have that first instinct to go fix the

16
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,520
problem. But that's taking a longer term

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,760
view on people is probably the biggest

18
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,079
thing that's changed. For more MIT
