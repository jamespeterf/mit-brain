I am the Emily one. This is the Amelia

143
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,440
record. Yeah. Uh, we need to update your

144
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:34,199

145
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,960
Whatever. Keep going.

146
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:39,600
Okay. Uh, so we talked about it this

147
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,919
afternoon and, uh, we were like, we want

148
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,400
to get as much science in as fast as

149
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:47,199
possible. So, we're going to skip a lot

150
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:50,319
of the fun, entertaining anecdotes, but

151
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:52,319
if you saw that photo of us as children

152
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,639
and are interested to know the story of

153
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:58,960
the missing front teeth, please ask that

154
00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:01,240
in the Q&A. I tell the story in in my uh

155
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:04,000
most recent book, Come

156
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:07,360
Together. Okay. So, we're starting the

157
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:11,039
story with me because I'm a musician.

158
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:14,000
How did I come to co-write a book about

159
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:16,800
stress, especially like a socially and

160
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,639
scienceinformed book about stress? And

161
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,560
you can go ahead and and click the thing

162
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,360
because the answer is is that person

163
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:26,639
over there. Um, when I was in my

164
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:29,039
doctoral program, I uh was hospitalized

165
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,759
twice for stress induced illness. And

166
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:34,479
meanwhile, Emily was writing her first

167
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,160
book, Come as You Are, the secret to

168
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:39,199
whatever the thing subtitle is. I don't

169
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,720
even know. I'm so sorry. Uh when she

170
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,319
went all around the world talking to

171
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,919
women about the science of women's

172
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,360
sexuality, which is what that book is

173
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:49,199
about, they would come and say to her,

174
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:51,039
"Amelia, Emily, whoever you are, the all

175
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,400
that all that sex science is great, but

176
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,879
you know, the part that really

177
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,800
resonated, the part that meant so and

178
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,759
changed everything for me was that one

179
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:02,080
little part about emotions and stress

180
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,319
and processing your feelings." And she

181
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:07,879
was really surprised. She spent so much

182
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:11,599
time on the sex science. Uh, and

183
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:14,319
I was not surprised at all because I She

184
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:16,080
said, "No shit." Yeah. Because I

185
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,039
attended a conservatory and in my

186
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,879
musical training, I was taught

187
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:23,199
explicitly how to process and express

188
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:26,240
emotions for the purpose of performance

189
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:28,440
on stage. What I did not learn was that

190
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,960
that was the thing I could apply

191
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:34,959
daytoday. And when I did learn that

192
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:37,200
stuff, it saved my life twice. and she

193
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:39,279
said, "Oh, we should write a book about

194
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,919
that." So, if you click the slide again,

195
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:45,120
that book will appear. And there it is.

196
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,720
It's burnout is the result of that. Um,

197
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,880
so what we're going to talk about today,

198
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,959
click the slide again. Um, are those

199
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,760
things the things that I learned that

200
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:56,880
saved my life when I was the most burnt

201
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,399
out uh people get without dying. Uh, and

202
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,320
that's going to be seven concrete,

203
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,959
specific evidence-based things you can

204
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,640
do to feel better right now. Our goal is

205
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,279
that as you are sitting here with us

206
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,880
today, the way you feel now will be

207
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,120
improved by the time you leave this

208
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,560
room. Heck yeah. I'm hoping that's I'm

209
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,200
hoping that's a realistic goal. We're

210
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,760
also going to tell you, look, is there

211
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,120
anybody aware who already knows that

212
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,120
sleep is good for you? Did you do you

213
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,160
know sleep good for you? You already

214
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,440
knew. So, there's going to be

215
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:27,040
um some of this stuff is going to seem

216
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,720
obvious. So, we're going to talk about

217
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,440
why even though we know some of this

218
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,440
stuff, we're not already doing it. The

219
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,240
answer is not because otherwise we're

220
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:40,640
just up here like exercise, sleep,

221
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,640
right, friends. Yeah.

222
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,480
The problem is not that you're not

223
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,040
trying hard enough or that you're not

224
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:50,080
already working hard enough. You you are

225
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,959
already trying as hard as you can all

226
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,920
day every day. So why doesn't it work?

227
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,519
We're going to talk about what that

228
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,000
barrier is. And of course, because we

229
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,680
are focused on

230
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,519
solutions, how to overcome that barrier.

231
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,720
So we got to define our terms first.

232
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,080
We're going to talk about what burnout

233
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,320
is. And first we need to give our

234
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,240
definition of wellness which is wellness

235
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,519
is not a state of mind or a state of

236
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:14,160
being. It is the freedom to oscillate

237
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:18,120
through all the cycles of being human. A

238
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:21,279
state of action. So stress is not your

239
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:23,120
enemy. Getting stuck is your enemy when

240
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:25,040
you are no longer free to oscillate.

241
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,360
Which is why we're st starting here in

242
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:31,040
what looks like a deep dark cave. It's

243
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,040
not a cave. Turns out it's a

244
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:36,399
tunnel. So if you're going to get

245
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,560
unstuck and escape the tunnel, that's a

246
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,800
fantastic metaphor. As Emily says,

247
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,399
emotions are tunnels. You have to move

248
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,720
all the way through the darkness to get

249
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:48,079
to the light at the end. And yes, she

250
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:50,240
choreographed the thing. Yep. Um, so, so

251
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:52,640
how do we get unstuck? How do we get out

252
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,600
of the tunnel? Oh, can I do this whole

253
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,839
part? You got to do the whole thing.

254
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,200
Yeah. Excellent. Great. I'm probably I'm

255
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,560
probably gonna end up like standing up

256
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,600
and walking around. Both of us are

257
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:04,880
physically disabled by long COVID

258
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:06,480
because long co um but I often cannot

259
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:10,560
resist getting up and walking around

260
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:12,160
even. So um the most if you remember

261
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,839
nothing I'm going to say this multiple

262
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,560
times. If you remember nothing else,

263
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,640
remember this one thing.

264
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,720
The process of dealing with the stress

265
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,920
in your body is separate from the

266
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:26,480
process of dealing with the things that

267
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,839
activated the stress in your body.

268
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,560
There's your stress and then there's

269
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:32,240
your stress sores and the strategies for

270
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,120
dealing with the things that cause your

271
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,200
stress. So, for example, if you're I

272
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,760
don't know, maybe you're a woman for

273
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:44,079
example, couple of people here might be,

274
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:47,360
and maybe you have a boss who um isn't

275
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,360
always awesome.

276
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:53,040
The way you deal with your stress or is

277
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,040
you go

278
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,959
mhm. Thank you for that

279
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:03,120
feedback. And then and then you walk out

280
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,120
and you

281
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:12,440
go the first one. Thank you for that

282
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:14,240
feedback is dealing with the stress or

283
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,639
appropriately because you want to keep

284
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,639
your job. The second one is dealing with

285
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:21,680
the stress itself. So let's talk about

286
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:23,360
the stress itself because it turns out

287
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,519
because we are monkeys and we're

288
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,680
monkeys, not just apes because you can't

289
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:30,279
evolve out of a clay. That's a sentence

290
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:33,720
I can use here and it makes me

291
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:37,519
happy. Because we're monkeys,

292
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:40,519
our biology doesn't differentiate much.

293
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:44,240
It differentiates a little, but not much

294
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:46,560
between evolutionary stressors and

295
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,720
modernday stressors. So, we're going to

296
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,480
talk about what our body's physiological

297
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:55,120
response is. First thing that happens

298
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:57,200
is you are confronted with a stressor.

299
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,120
For example, being chased by a

300
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,279
saber-tooth tiger. These illustrations,

301
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,760
by the way, are by from Erica Men, the

302
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:07,440
cartoonist who also illustrated Come as

303
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:09,399
You Are. Um, and your whole body floods

304
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:13,279
with adrenaline and cortisol and

305
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:16,079
gluccocorticoids. Oh my. And the purpose

306
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:18,480
of all of this chemistry which results

307
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:20,639
in massive changes in your physiological

308
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,959
functioning. Your heart rate goes up and

309
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,720
your blood pressure goes up and your

310
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,800
digestive system gets suppressed and

311
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,560
your immune system gets suppressed and

312
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,120
blood moves away from the surface of

313
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:34,240
your skin because if you get cut you'll

314
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:37,440
bleed less that way like massive physio

315
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:41,360
attention changes so that you are

316
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:43,440
focused on like the here and now tunnel

317
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,079
vision I just need to fix this one

318
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,720
problem so you lose creativity when

319
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:51,040
you're stressed out all so that you And

320
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:54,240
what?

321
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:56,320
Yeah. And when you're being chased by a

322
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:00,480
saber-tooth tiger, what do you do to

323
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:02,000
survive? Run. You run. Yes. Absolutely.

324
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,519
And when you're being chased by a

325
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
saber-tooth tiger, Emily, they're

326
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,000
running as an

327
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:14,880
animation. At this point, there's only

328
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,600
two possible outcomes. Either you get

329
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:20,600
eaten by the saber-tooth tiger, in which

330
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:23,680
case none of the rest of this matters,

331
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:25,920
or you escape. So, let's imagine a world

332
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:30,240
where you manage to run back to your

333
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:33,760
village this very You're faster than a

334
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,760
saber-tooth tiger in this hypothetical

335
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,279
situation. And you like somebody sees

336
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,399
you coming and they wave you into the

337
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:41,199
door and you both stand with your

338
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,880
shoulders against the door and you roar

339
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:46,040
in the scraping at the door and

340
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:50,160
eventually this saber-tooth

341
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:54,120
tiger leaves up, walks away. It's going

342
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:56,800
to find somebody else to feed to her

343
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:59,600
children. And when you see the

344
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:01,839
saber-tooth tiger walk away, how do you

345
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,560
feel?

346
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:07,519
Relieved.

347
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:10,320
grateful to be alive. You love your

348
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:13,120
friends and family. The sun seems to

349
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:16,320
shine brighter. You want to tell this

350
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:20,240
story. And oh, are you going to tell

351
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:22,240
this story over and over and over again?

352
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,480
That is the complete stress response

353
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,040
cycle. And it's easy to think that it is

354
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,440
the running that completed the stress

355
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:31,120
response cycle. It's easy to think that

356
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,360
it is the disappearance of the

357
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,320
saber-tooth tiger, the dealing with the

358
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:39,279
stressor that got rid of the stress that

359
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:41,160
completed the stress response cycle. It

360
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:45,199
turns

361
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:46,720
out running is great. It is one of the

362
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,880
most effective and efficient strategies

363
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,800
for completing the stress response cycle

364
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:54,079
because when that stress response get

365
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:56,480
activated, it's for activating you to

366
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:58,800
escape, to survive as so many people

367
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,360
said. But uh running is not always

368
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:04,320
available to all of us all the time.

369
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,320
Fortunately, we

370
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:09,600
have more than seven concrete specific

371
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,680
evidence-based strategies for completing

372
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,160
the stress response cycle which will put

373
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:16,560
you in a good enough physical and mental

374
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,560
state to be able to deal with whatever

375
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:21,680
the stressor was in the first place.

376
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:26,240
Because alak alas, we are almost never

377
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:29,279
chased by saber-tooth tigers anymore.

378
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,759
in order to get unstuck because most of

379
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:34,160
us are walking around with countless

380
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,680
incomplete stress response cycles. The

381
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,639
beautiful thing about the human body is

382
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:40,560
it'll just hold on to it for us. Like it

383
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,480
gets activated and it's like, "Oh,

384
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,639
you're not going to you're not going to

385
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:48,000
do anything about this. Cool. I will

386
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:50,240
stuff this in another organ system."

387
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,639
Maybe it's your digestive system. Must

388
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:55,279
be it's your muscularkeeletal system.

389
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:58,079
You may have an intuition about which

390
00:16:55,279 --> 00:17:00,600
organ system your body chooses to put

391
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:03,440
your incomplete stress response

392
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:06,720
cycles. Fortunately, it will hold on to

393
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:10,240
that for you for as long as it needs to.

394
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:12,799
It will eventually cause disease, but

395
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,120
that's in the long term. You can get

396
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,720
unstuck. all of those incomplete stress

397
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,120
response cycles in your body, you can

398
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,079
get

399
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:23,679
unstuck if you deal with the stress

400
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:24,959
itself, which is a separate process from

401
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:28,000
dealing with the things that cause the

402
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,679
stress. Ready? Seven concrete specific

403
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,200
evidence-based strategies. We're going

404
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,360
to complete the cycle. We're going to go

405
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,919
through the tunnel. The first thing, as

406
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:38,400
Emily was saying, is physical. Who knew

407
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:40,720
that exercise is good? Good for you. You

408
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,720
did. You already knew. This is this is

409
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:47,440
the main reason why. And at a population

410
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:49,840
level, your body at a population level,

411
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,400
bodies learn that they have the capacity

412
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:57,039
to move you from danger to safety when

413
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:58,720
you move them. Um, Emily, my identical

414
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,799
twin, raised in the same house with me,

415
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,720
could go for a bike ride. We grew up in

416
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:05,600
Delaware. She could ride all the way

417
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:08,240
into Pennsylvania to the farmlands with

418
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,760
the cows and the sk and come back and

419
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,760
feel like the weight of the world is

420
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:15,280
lifted off her shoulders. And I thought

421
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:17,039
she was making it up because I identical

422
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,960
twin raised in the same household have

423
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:20,480
never had that experience because at a

424
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,240
population level, yes, it's the most

425
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,559
efficient thing. That doesn't mean it's

426
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,000
true for any one individual. Doesn't

427
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,440
mean that the science isn't right that

428
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,120
it's the most effective at a population

429
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,600
level. It just means it's not true for

430
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:34,160
everybody. And we are a great

431
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,880
illustration to show you don't know who

432
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,240
is going to respond to what. Um, there

433
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,760
are other limitations to physical

434
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,320
activity that people don't like to talk

435
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:44,080
about, like physical ability. I no

436
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:47,039
longer have access to the kinds of

437
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:49,200
physical activity that might even begin

438
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:52,080
to complete a stress response cycle in

439
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:55,600
my body because Yeah. Yeah. Um, it used

440
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:59,440
to be very [ __ ] effective for me. No,

441
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,799
now I can't do it. Yeah. Uh, in the Q&A,

442
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,799
feel free to ask me how I feel about

443
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:05,440
that.

444
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:07,360
Uh there might be other reasons like say

445
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,840
you know that going for a nice brisk

446
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:12,480
walk strut down the street you are going

447
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:14,000
to come back feeling like a new person

448
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,200
like you're ready for anything. You know

449
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,679
that you have passed through the

450
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,679
threshold of stressed out into a space

451
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:22,880
of

452
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:24,559
of readiness of certainty of a feeling

453
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,200
of safety and then you get catc

454
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,640
calledled on that walk. And now that

455
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,480
physical activity that was going to help

456
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,600
you manage your stress has become a

457
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,960
source of stress, right? You're trans

458
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,280
and you're gonna go use the gym, but

459
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,640
boy, if you choose to use a locker room,

460
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,840
you could be taking your life in your

461
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:44,080
hands. It's just more complicated than

462
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:46,400
exercise is good for your stress. It's

463
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,919
so much more complicated. But we have

464
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:51,919
six other concrete, specific,

465
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:53,919
evidence-based things you can do.

466
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:55,919
Emily is not going to give her one-hour

467
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,760
talk. This I have fully an hourlong talk

468
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,120
about sleep. I am not going to give it.

469
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,840
Sleep is good for you. There's a whole

470
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,840
chapter about

471
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:08,880
rest. College people, people under the

472
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:10,960
age of 25 in their adolescence. On

473
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,760
average, how many hours of sleep do

474
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,600
people in that age group require in

475
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,360
order for their body to get the rest

476
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,160
required to complete the stress response

477
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:22,320
cycle? cuz your body is doing amazing

478
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:24,080
stuff in the midst of sleep and you

479
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,640
don't even have to be there for it. It

480
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:29,840
is doing it for you. But how many hours

481
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:31,840
does a person sort of between 15 and 25

482
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,640
need?

483
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:37,120
Yeah, it's like nine and a quarter on

484
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,520
average, which means for some people it

485
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:41,679
is

486
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:44,480
more. And also people vary. 7 to nine is

487
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:46,720
the typical range for adults. Again,

488
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,960
identical twins, seven and a half hours

489
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,799
typically. Ameilia has always been a

490
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,280
nine hour sleeper. That was before I had

491
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:57,280
long co. Now it's 10 and a half1. Yeah,

492
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:59,400
cuz that's how much cuz people and for

493
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,600
like did you not have experiences of

494
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,440
feeling I learned in high school we

495
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,280
needed eight hours of sleep. I would

496
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:08,000
sleep eight hours and feel exhausted and

497
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,840
I thought I was lazy.

498
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,080
Nope. Just turns out I'm on the higher

499
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:14,240
end of average. Yeah. Turns out short

500
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,159
sleeper privilege is a real thing. Early

501
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,640
bird privilege is a real thing. That's

502
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:21,840
the schedule capitalism chose. Yeah,

503
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,600
100%. I am both a short sleeper and

504
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,880
you're talking about way too much about

505
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,640
sleep. You should talk about the stress

506
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,640
response thing and then move on. Sorry.

507
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,640
So, you're a good sister. There's

508
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,640
there's Okay, so we're going to talk

509
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,159
about in deep sleep. What happens is the

510
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,919
physical healing. If you're a person who

511
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:39,120
engages in physical activity and

512
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:41,600
benefits from it, uh if you do not get

513
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,280
adequate deep sleep in particular, your

514
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,120
body is not going to heal from the

515
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,640
damage you did to it with the physical

516
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,720
activity. So, you're not going to get

517
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,520
stronger. Physical activity is not

518
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,679
complete without sleep. If you study and

519
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,600
you don't sleep, your brain gets nice

520
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:58,159
and smooth and slippery and stuff

521
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:01,520
doesn't stick to it. So, it is not worth

522
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:03,039
studying if you're not going to sleep.

523
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,679
Allnighters are the I'm not going to

524
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:08,559
talk about

525
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:11,360
it. Ren sleep, which is the sort of like

526
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:14,400
dreaming uh hyperassociative phase of

527
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:16,400
sleep, is your emotion processing when

528
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,000
your brain is like putting together all

529
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,080
the emotional experiences you've ever

530
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,799
had in your entire life. My husband

531
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:26,559
texted me that he had a dream about

532
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:28,360
walking from Florida to Massachusetts

533
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:30,880
because he had to come take care of the

534
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:33,840
dogs because he's all alone right now

535
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:36,720
with the dogs. And the more he walked,

536
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,720
the further he got. Like that was his

537
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,280
brain working out his stress response.

538
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,280
What a gift it is that his body could

539
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:45,520
complete the stress response cycles in

540
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,039
his sleep. We got to We're done. Sleep

541
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,640
is really important. Get a lot of it.

542
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,080
Ask questions. Ask questions about

543
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,520
sleep. There's so much more that she

544
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,240
would love to be saying right now, but

545
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:56,480
I'm as a conductor, I'm trained really

546
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,320
firmly about keeping to a schedule. Like

547
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,080
my audience is usually instrumentalists

548
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,440
who are being paid by a union who So

549
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,520
like I'm I'm not being strict because

550
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,840
I'm a jerk. I'm being that's my that's

551
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:09,280
it's a strength I bring to this

552
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,880
relationship. The third concrete,

553
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,640
specific evidence-based thing you can do

554
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,640
to complete a stress response cycle is

555
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,120
engage your imagination. Because the

556
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,120
good news is your brain doesn't really

557
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,919
know the difference between doing a

558
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,840
thing with your body or imagining doing

559
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:26,159
that thing with your body. You put

560
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:28,240
famous research, you put a pianist in an

561
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:30,000
fMRI machine, have them play a little

562
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,760
electric keyboard, see where the brain

563
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,039
lights up, take away the keyboard, have

564
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,640
them imagine they're playing that

565
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,080
electric keyboard. Same parts of the

566
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,200
brain do the same work. Your brain

567
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,559
doesn't know the difference between

568
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,760
what's happening and what you're

569
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:43,120
imagining is happening. Not much. Um uh

570
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,880
that means that when you're sitting on

571
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:48,000
your couch with a controller on your

572
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:50,720
hand moving literally just your thumbs,

573
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,720
this is not an aerobic workout. And yet

574
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,039
when you are rescuing the princess from

575
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,440
the dragon or whatever, your heart is

576
00:23:55,039 --> 00:24:00,240
pounding. Your breath is coming faster.

577
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,720
You are experiencing all of the physical

578
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,960
experience of completing a hero's

579
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,880
journey of going from a state of danger

580
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,440
into a state of safety. So that when you

581
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,440
get to the end of the game or the movie

582
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,240
or the show or the book when you want to

583
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,200
like stand up and cheer at the end, your

584
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,480
body has gone through the physical

585
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:20,480
experience even though you didn't do

586
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,799
anything with your body. That's the

587
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,880
power of using your imagination to

588
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:27,120
complete a stress response cycle. I do

589
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,720
want to make this one little caveat

590
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,720
because it sounds like engaging with

591
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,640
entertainment does the thing. And there

592
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,080
is a difference between entertainment

593
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,720
that completes a stress response cycle

594
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:39,360
that makes you feel a thing that changes

595
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:43,520
your physical state versus entertainment

596
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:46,640
that is soothing uh that is numbing. So

597
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,480
if you can sit and stare, I play a game

598
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,559
where I just swipe on my phone, right?

599
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:54,120
We all have the phone swipe. We watch

600
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:56,880
the shows that make us go British big

601
00:24:54,120 --> 00:25:01,200
off. People being nice to each other for

602
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:03,760
low stakes, right? I love it. That is

603
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,080
numbing and it is an important part of

604
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:10,000
the process

605
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:12,159
cuz burnout, stress, like any wound

606
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,159
needs to be treated both with, you know,

607
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,240
cleaning out the wound and stitching up

608
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,960
the cut. And if the hospital sent you

609
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,880
home after just stitching it up when not

610
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,120
numbing anything, you would have

611
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,960
received poor health care. Not just

612
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,200
because you'd be like, "Ow, why are you

613
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:30,480
so mean?" But also because relieving

614
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:33,679
pain leads to better healing. Healing

615
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:36,320
itself can cause stress that slows sorry

616
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:39,600
pain itself can cause stress that slows

617
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:41,039
healing. So in the healing process of

618
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:44,559
dealing with burnout and stress

619
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:46,960
management if you need to eat a pint of

620
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:48,880
Ben & Jerry's using Pringles for a scoop

621
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,200
because that makes this moment here

622
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,120
tolerable and gets rid of the pain so

623
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,159
that you can live to do the next hard

624
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:58,159
thing you have to do. Yeah, do it.

625
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:02,000
There's research. Refined carbohydrate

626
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:03,360
is analesic. Yeah. Um, it is if you went

627
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,799
to the hospital and all they did was

628
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,000
numb you up and send you home and they

629
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,440
didn't clean out the wound and didn't

630
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,240
stitch it up, that would also be

631
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,799
terrible medical care. You got to do

632
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:15,279
both. Uh, but so entertainment can serve

633
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:17,120
as numbing potentially, but the one that

634
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:18,559
completes a stress response cycle is the

635
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,000
one that makes you want to stand up and

636
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:22,000
cheer, makes your heart rate faster,

637
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,279
gives you a physical experience of

638
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:28,159
having achieved something. Yeah, which

639
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:31,760
brings us to creative self-expression of

640
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:33,840
some kind. So, uh, for me it's writing.

641
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,480
Um, I had a particularly difficult day

642
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:38,480
at

643
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:42,080
work. That's all I need to say. Um, and

644
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:44,240
I needed to come home and trans like I'd

645
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:47,520
absorbed a whole lot of people's very

646
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:50,559
difficult emotions. Um, so I was writing

647
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:52,960
a romance novel. I skipped right to the

648
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:56,480
proposal scene of my romance novel. I

649
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:59,919
put my hero on his knees, begging to

650
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:04,080
deserve the love of my awesome heroine.

651
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:06,720
And I'm sobbing on my keyboard. And I

652
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:09,360
can feel my body transforming all of

653
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,679
that stress I absorbed from other people

654
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:14,080
into this story of the happily ever

655
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,600
after that I am creating. It's not going

656
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,360
to be writing for everybody. For some

657
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,840
people, it's going to be knitting little

658
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:23,520
booties of rage. It's going to be

659
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:28,200
painting or sculpting or theater. Oh my

660
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:31,760
god. Engage in any or playing in a band

661
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:35,760
music. So good for you. Engage in any

662
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:37,760
kind of storytelling in particular is so

663
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,039
good for you. And again, your brain

664
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,120
doesn't know the difference between a

665
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:44,240
fictional thing and a real thing. Not

666
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:48,159
much. Uh so using your imagination and

667
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:49,919
creativity in this way. Uh, one pro tip,

668
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:52,640
make it something you're never going to

669
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:55,840
be awesome at so that you're never

670
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:58,880
tempted to monetize it and turn it into

671
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:01,840
your job. Cuz there's no faster way to

672
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:04,320
make something you love to do that makes

673
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:06,640
you feel awesome. She gestures to the

674
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,960
professional musician. There's no faster

675
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,320
way to make your creative

676
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:11,919
self-expression no longer good for

677
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,919
managing your stress than to make it

678
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:16,240
your job.

679
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:18,559
That's real. That's real.

680
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,880
So, we are now on the 1, two, 3, four,

681
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:22,480
fifth concrete, specific, evidence-based

682
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,120
thing you can do to manage your stress

683
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:27,200
right now. And um probably there are

684
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,120
some of these you went, "Oh, yeah. I'm a

685
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,600
natural exerciser. I can go for a run. I

686
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:34,480
come home feeling great. I I play this

687
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:36,559
game and I know it helps me. I I I

688
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,559
belong to a drum circle and I whenever I

689
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:42,480
come back from the drum circle, I feel

690
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:44,080
safe and big ups, right? So, you

691
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,520
probably already know which of these

692
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,360
work for you and which of these are hard

693
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,039
for you. And this is another one where

694
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:51,440
we can illustrate the differences

695
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:54,159
because the next one is a big old cry.

696
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:56,159
And Emily could come home from high

697
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:59,760
school, high school, 15 years old,

698
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:01,840
auditioned for the play, did terribly,

699
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,600
came home, closed my bedroom door,

700
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:07,399
sobbed for 15 minutes, and I was over

701
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:11,520
it. and I had to be taught by my

702
00:29:07,399 --> 00:29:13,440
therapist in my in her office how to cry

703
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:16,000
when she was in grad school when I was

704
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:19,840
in my 30s. It took someone with a PhD

705
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,919
from Yale to teach me how to cry. Um so

706
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,760
if you are someone who knows that you

707
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:26,000
can like lock yourself in your car, so

708
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:28,399
for five minutes and feel much better,

709
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,840
do that. If you are someone who goes, I

710
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:32,240
never understood why that works for

711
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:34,399
people, there are techniques you can do.

712
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,840
Um, if pe there are people here who are

713
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:38,080
interested in knowing that, please ask

714
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,240
in the Q&A. Hey Amelia, how do I cry in

715
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:43,799
a way that doesn't just make me cry

716
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:46,600
non-stop forever?

717
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:49,919
Yeah. The next one is closely

718
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:51,360
related. Uh, just like a big old cry is

719
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:53,520
your body because the thing is like you

720
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,520
so you move through it, your body goes

721
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:57,679
through the tunnel and you come out at

722
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,720
the other end. People are afraid if they

723
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:01,279
start crying they're never going to

724
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:03,600
stop. That's just not how bodies work.

725
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:06,440
Um, laughter is another one of those

726
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:08,880
things where your body physiologically

727
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:11,480
releases just the stuff that you've been

728
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,520
holding on to. Oh my god, 10

729
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,960
minutes releases all the stuff you've

730
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,640
been holding on to. Now, we are not

731
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:21,159
talking about social

732
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:25,520
poised that kind of laughter. It is the

733
00:30:21,159 --> 00:30:27,600
helpless belly aching crying like it

734
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:29,679
hurts. You're laughing so hard

735
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:32,159
especially if you're laughing with other

736
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:33,919
people. Um, it can be laughing over a

737
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:35,760
shared memory or it can be just

738
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:36,880
remembering a time when your friend did

739
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,480
that. And the last thing that we're

740
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,600
going to talk about that's paper's

741
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,799
favorite thing. I'm sorry and we're

742
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,320
going faster. That's just all there is

743
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:44,159
to it. Um, and the last thing and

744
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:48,000
people's favorite thing is loving

745
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:49,760
connection. Uh, a 20 second hug. Not

746
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,360
about the 20 seconds. It's about the

747
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,760
time you and somebody you really love

748
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:56,159
and trust spend in close physical

749
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:59,919
contact. And you wait long enough that

750
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:02,720
your body shifts and you'll feel it.

751
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:04,080
Oh, that's right. I'm safe here. I

752
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,679
can't. And it doesn't have to be a

753
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,760
connection with another person. It can

754
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:09,760
be a connection with an animal, a loving

755
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:14,320
divine presence, your own inner child,

756
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:16,559
the ocean, the nature, uh connection.

757
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,320
And uh the unnamed barrier. Holy [ __ ]

758
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:20,159
we have 20 more 30 more minutes of

759
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,799
things to talk about. Can you do human

760
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:25,760
giver syndrome super fast? Yes. Um so

761
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:27,679
we've adapted a new language. This is

762
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,440
the barrier just to be clear. Yeah,

763
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:31,039
those are all the things like again

764
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,039
you're like, "Oh, friends are good for

765
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:35,600
me. Sleep is good for me. Exercise is

766
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:38,240
good for me. Why don't I do those

767
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:40,480
things? This is why it's because on the

768
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:43,360
day you were born,

769
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:45,760
uh people slapped a label on your body

770
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:48,240
and they cast you in a role that you are

771
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:50,559
supposed to play. Some of us, this is

772
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:54,000
like 99 point something percent of us

773
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:55,760
were cast either into the giver role and

774
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,120
you were given this handbook that taught

775
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:02,000
you to be pretty, happy, calm, generous,

776
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:06,399
attent, unfailingly attentive to the

777
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:08,799
needs of others, warm and playable,

778
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:10,720
regardless of the cost. And some of you

779
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:12,799
get cast in the role of the winner to be

780
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:15,600
strong, stoic, ambitious, competitive,

781
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:17,600
independent, infallible, and confident.

782
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:21,600
And I'm not saying anyone in particular

783
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,600
gets cast in any particular

784
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:26,799
role, except I am. And there are two

785
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,320
problems with this. One, if you get

786
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:30,559
taught that you only have certain

787
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:32,559
emotions available to you and you are

788
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:34,679
stuck in some stress response and you're

789
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:37,200
like, "But I don't have any rage,

790
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:39,039
Emily." Cuz you got taught from the day

791
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,799
you were born, you don't have any rage.

792
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:42,720
How are you going to complete the stress

793
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:44,399
response cycles associated with rage?

794
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:47,440
And if you get taught that you're not

795
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:49,760
ever lonely, how are you ever going to

796
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:52,000
know that you need connection? And the

797
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:54,159
other part about it is, oh yeah, so

798
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,840
these these are the only emotions you're

799
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:57,760
allowed. These are the emotions you get.

800
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,600
If you're a human winner, you are

801
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:02,480
allowed to be angry or allowed to go

802
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:04,559
faster. Winning horny, happy, grateful,

803
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,799
and supportive exclusively if you're a

804
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:09,200
human giver.

805
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:10,880
Okay. And this creates We hurried so

806
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:14,080
Ameilia could sing a song. I hurried so

807
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:15,279
I could get to Czechov's ukulele. Um cuz

808
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,039
this is how you're going to remember the

809
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:19,760
thing long term. Go ahead and hit the

810
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:21,279
thing. There's a is it is a gap between

811
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,799
who we are and who the world tells us

812
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:24,080
we're supposed to be. No, don't. It's

813
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:27,039
supposed to whatever. You can just leave

814
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:30,240
it. Song goes like this. Who does the

815
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:34,720
world say that I should be? And what do

816
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:38,320
I do if I don't agree? Rational me says

817
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:41,039
that I am enough. My primate brain says

818
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:44,399
not fitting is rough. Solutions are

819
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:47,279
clear. I should be myself and deal with

820
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:50,880
the world when it puts me through hell.

821
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:54,080
Or easier still is to be what they say.

822
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:56,640
That only requires I give my soul away

823
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,640
to the

824
00:33:57,159 --> 00:34:00,159
abyss.

825
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:07,360
Abyss. Two opposite goals here. ask you

826
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:10,480
to choose. Whichever you pick, there's

827
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:13,280
something to lose. But you're not alone.

828
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:16,000
We're all on this road. And going

829
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:18,240
together is a journey of hope through

830
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,240
the

831
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:21,839
abyss.

832
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:32,240
Abyss. There's a chasm. Yeah. Right.

833
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:34,760
between who you truly are and who the

834
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:37,159
world taught you you are supposed to

835
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:41,480
be. What do you

836
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:44,159
do? We're gonna skip the story metaphor.

837
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:45,760
Click. The answer is Hunger Games, but

838
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:47,280
we're not going to explicit that. And

839
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:50,639
we're just going to sing remember who

840
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:52,800
the real enemy is. Yeah. The real enemy

841
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:55,599
is not any of the children who are

842
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:58,560
trapped in the dome with you. It is the

843
00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:01,599
people who trapped us in this dome

844
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:04,240
together. And the solution, how that

845
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:06,359
looks in real life is that burnout is

846
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:08,320
not the cure for burnout. Cannot be

847
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:10,480
self-care. Because when you are trapped

848
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,040
in the arena, when you try to just fight

849
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:15,280
for your own

850
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:17,760
life, 90% everybody, one person's going

851
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:20,320
to die in the arena. And when we all

852
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:22,079
care for each other, nobody slips

853
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:25,800
through the cracks. But that means we

854
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:29,280
need to surround ourselves with those

855
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:33,839
people who are going to turn toward our

856
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:35,520
needs and say, not, "Oh, you got 9 hours

857
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:36,960
of sleep last night. Well, I was awake

858
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,480
till 3:00 a.m. baking cookies for

859
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:42,760
Becky's birthday party, but good for

860
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:44,960
you. 9 hours of sleep. Self-care is so

861
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:46,720
important." Instead, you surround

862
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,720
yourself with people who care about your

863
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,560
well-being as much as you care about

864
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,880
theirs. And there's a song about that,

865
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:55,839
too. That's much more fun than me just

866
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:58,240
doing the thing. Did you get the thing?

867
00:35:55,839 --> 00:36:02,640
Okay, sure. Just do it. Yeah. I want to

868
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:06,720
do and be everything that the world has

869
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:10,839
demanded of me. Sometimes I feel I don't

870
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:14,000
deserve love. Not until I'm productive

871
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:19,599
enough. That's when I need supplementary

872
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:21,640
help to reinforce my boundaries.

873
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:26,359
In the bubble of

874
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:29,010
[Music]

875
00:36:26,359 --> 00:36:33,240
love, I am

876
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:37,599
[Music]

877
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:37,599
enough in my bubble of

878
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:43,040
love. There are people who care about my

879
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,560
wellbeing as much as I care about

880
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:47,240
theirs. It's better when I sing it,

881
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:49,870
right? We guard each other from outside

882
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:51,000
messages, showing each other we

883
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:55,160
[Music]

884
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:58,599
care. Cuz I wanna want and like all the

885
00:36:55,160 --> 00:37:02,200
goals that the world has set for my

886
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:06,800
role. Sometimes I fear I don't deserve

887
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:09,920
love. Not until I'm successful enough.

888
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:12,220
That's when I need supplementary help to

889
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,320
mind what gives life

890
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:17,680
[Music]

891
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:17,680
meaning. In my bubble of

892
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:27,379
love, I am

893
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:27,379
[Music]

894
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:34,240
enough in my bubble of

895
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:35,599
love. I'm here to prove that you don't

896
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,040
have to be a professional musician to

897
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:43,119
sing in public.

898
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:44,560
[Applause]

899
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,480
Oh my god, we actually made it within

900
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:48,800
the last Oh god. Sort of. We did it.

901
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,640
Sort of. Sort of. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

902
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:53,839
Yeah. Please ask questions. We skipped

903
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:57,119
so much. Yeah. But also, we have a whole

904
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:59,040
page of questions. You do from one of

905
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:00,320
the ultimate badasses on the face of the

906
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,240
earth. So, it's going to be an amazing

907
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,000
conversation. Wellness, not a state of

908
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,440
being. State of action. Wellness is the

909
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,920
freedom to oscillate through all the

910
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:09,520
cycles of being human. Uh oh, we didn't

911
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,960
say explicitly, but here it is the

912
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,560
chance to say burnout's caused by

913
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,800
accumulating incomplete stress response

914
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,720
cycles that are imposed upon your body

915
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:19,839
by

916
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:21,920
unseasoned and unmeable goals.

917
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:24,000
And um to cure burnout, you got to

918
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:27,640
complete the stress response cycle with

919
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:30,000
movement, sleep, love, creativity,

920
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:32,000
imagination. Yeah. Uh and a near

921
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:36,000
universal barrier is the human giver

922
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:38,000
syndrome, aka the gender mirage. Mirage

923
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,359
because it seems like it's there. like

924
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,920
any mirage, it really seems real until

925
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:45,280
you get closer. And to defeat that, um,

926
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,440
you need to remember who the real enemy

927
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:50,240
is, not everybody else who's down here

928
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:53,440
fighting for resources that we've been

929
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:56,000
told are limited, even though we kind of

930
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:58,000
just invented most of them. Like money,

931
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,359
we made that up and we're going to claim

932
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,200
that it's limited. Oh, anyway. Get it?

933
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:04,560
And of course to be surrounded by the

934
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,920
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. surrounded by the

935
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,599
bubble of love and the people and the

936
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:10,839
magic trick we're gonna do when we talk

937
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:10,839
about meaning.

938
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:15,920
And that is the PowerPoint presentation

939
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:20,119
portion. Okay.

940
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:29,200
Wow. Wow. This was

941
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:30,720
incredible. So, I have lots of questions

942
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,800
about sleep. So, why don't we start

943
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:35,440
there? Yes. Okay. Take a break. Go

944
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:39,560
ahead. I'm ready. I'm actually just

945
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,560
kidding. Okay. Oh, man.

946
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,599
I have so much to say about sleep. It's

947
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,359
so important and there's so much

948
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:47,119
science.

949
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:49,359
I know you do. But we want everyone to

950
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:52,160
read the books. Yes. Yes. Yes. We want

951
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:54,960
everyone to read the books. So, I wanted

952
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:57,920
to start by asking a little bit about

953
00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:00,720
what you just talked about because I

954
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:04,400
read the book and I felt like it was so

955
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:07,200
helpful to me and I thought there are so

956
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:08,960
many quotes that I've been using since I

957
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,800
read the book. I've been talking a lot

958
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,560
about it and talking with you. So, I

959
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,720
thought I might throw out a few quotes

960
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:17,920
that I thought were great and just have

961
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:20,880
you talk about them. Great. Does that

962
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:23,680
sound good? Okay. So, we've talked a lot

963
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:26,079
about facing challenges and how so much

964
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:29,440
of it is about reconceptualizing how you

965
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:31,200
think about challenges. And so, what I

966
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,960
think, you know, my assertion, if I

967
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:35,839
understand this correctly, is that we

968
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:38,720
need to prioritize connection, meaning

969
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:42,480
making, and rest. See, I got that in

970
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:44,480
there. Okay. So, I'd like to ask you a

971
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:48,160
few questions about some of these

972
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:52,079
things. First is a quote. Meaning is

973
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:56,000
found. It's not found. It is made. I

974
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:58,400
have a song about that. Okay. Oh, the

975
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,960
song is the cabbage song. I don't play

976
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,720
this much because we say meaning is a

977
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,560
leafy green. And I've been told by Emily

978
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:07,480
that cabbage is not technically a leafy

979
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:10,319
green. It's a brassica. It's a brassica.

980
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:13,119
But the notes the word the letters c a

981
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:16,160
bb a ge r e. Can I do like two sentences

982
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:18,640
of introduction? All right. So when we

983
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:21,040
say meaning is made not found, it's

984
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,720
because you make meaning in your life by

985
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:25,440
engaging with something larger than

986
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:27,599
yourself. Um, and I was like, it's like

987
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,520
you have to eat the kale in order to get

988
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:31,520
the nutrients. You have to be in the

989
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:33,280
sunlight to make the vitamin D. You have

990
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:35,440
to engage with your something larger to

991
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:37,359
make the meaning. And I was like, so

992
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,200
it's like a leafy green. And I was like,

993
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:41,280
it's like cabbage, but then cabbage is a

994
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:43,359
brassica, but all the letters in

995
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,960
cabbages are notes on a keyboard. So

996
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:47,040
Ameilia wrote a song and the research

997
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,560
shows there are three ways to achieve

998
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,160
meaning through engaging with your

999
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:52,000
something larger. Three types of

1000
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,680
something larger and so I'm gonna sing

1001
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,880
them.

1007
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:12,960
by connect or sing with me. Emily, give

1008
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:17,520
me a one. One, no. Give me one. One,

1009
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:20,720
leaving a legacy behind. Two, or heeding

1010
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:23,400
the call to serve mankind.

1011
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:27,760
Or loving

1012
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:28,720
someone. Loving someone. That's enough.

B B B A A G E meaning is kind of a leafy

1016
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:40,960
green. So, what were the three?

1017
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:44,160
Leaving a legacy. Leaving a legacy

1018
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:46,490
behind serving service to serve mankind

1019
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:48,599
or loving

1020
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:50,880
[Music]

1021
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:53,119
someone. That's now you'll remember

1022
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:57,880
forever.

1023
00:42:53,119 --> 00:43:01,160
It's also in chapter four. Yes. No.

1024
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:04,640
Three. I wanted to call it vitamin

1025
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:07,200
Y. Get it? Cuz you But Emily thought

1026
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:09,760
that was cheesy.

1027
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:12,200
Okay.

1028
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:17,319
All right, moving on.

1029
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:19,839
So, another quote. Happiness versus joy.

1030
00:43:17,319 --> 00:43:22,280
Right. This isn't actually our quote.

1031
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:24,480
This is Britney Cooper. Britney Cooper

1032
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:27,359
stands, y'all. Right. More Britney

1033
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:28,720
Cooper stands. Bodies not apologies. The

1034
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:30,240
book that's highly recommended. No, no,

1035
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:34,400
no. Bodies not apologies. Sonia Renee

1036
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:36,800
Taylor. Oh my god. It's racist.

1037
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:39,920
I got him confused. I'm sorry. I forgot.

1038
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:41,040
Eloquent rage is eloquent rage. I sorry

1039
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,880
they're next to each other on my

1040
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:45,599
bookshelf and I what can I do? Yeah. So

1041
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:48,160
eloquent rage Britney Cooper writes that

1042
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:50,079
uh happiness is about happenings. It is

1043
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:52,599
the circumstances of your life whether

1044
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:56,079
or not life is going well.

1045
00:43:52,599 --> 00:43:58,800
Joy is about feeling a firm sense of

1046
00:43:56,079 --> 00:44:00,800
connection to your purpose in life. We

1047
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,560
just talked about three ways to engage

1048
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,640
with your something larger to have

1049
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:08,599
purpose. Most of that is going to come

1050
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:11,119
through connection with other people.

1051
00:44:08,599 --> 00:44:13,520
Um, I'm going to skip the long story

1052
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:16,160
part and just skip to it is a normal con

1053
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:20,000
part of the human condition to need to

1054
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:22,160
be told that you are enough and to need

1055
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:25,920
to remind the people you care about that

1056
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:27,839
you are enough. That reminder to each

1057
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,599
other, that kind of connection is a

1058
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:31,200
profound source. You meant reminding

1059
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:32,560
them that they are enough. That they are

1060
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,839
enough. That's what I meant. Thank you

1061
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:38,560
very much.

1062
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:40,480
Um, joy comes from the connection with

1063
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:43,359
something larger and your community

1064
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:45,119
which is much larger, deeper and because

1065
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:48,880
your source of meaning, your something

1066
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:51,119
larger resides within yourself. You c it

1067
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:54,160
can never be taken from you.

1068
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:58,280
Circumstances change.

1069
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:58,280
For real Z though, Moana.

1070
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:05,920
Yeah, for real Z though. um be anybody

1071
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:08,560
who's happy in the given circumstances

1072
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:12,319
of America um has been doing a really

1073
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:15,680
good job of not paying attention. Um but

1074
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:17,200
that does not reduce our access to joy

1075
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,800
because that's not about the present

1076
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:21,359
circumstances. It's about our connection

1077
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:25,200
to our sense of purpose.

1078
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:29,280
Love it. Okay. So speaking of joy, you

1079
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:31,839
tell this story about practicing singing

1080
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:33,680
with a chorus. Ah, and I really like

1081
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:36,800
that story because it's a difference

1082
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:39,760
between aiming for perfection Yeah.

1083
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:41,599
versus having the sound engineer feel

1084
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:45,119
joy. Yeah. Yeah. Nobody hears a

1085
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:47,599
perfectionist. Right. Right. Yeah. So,

1086
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:49,520
uh, this story is about dealing not with

1087
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:52,079
the stress in your body and not dealing

1088
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:53,760
with a stressor that you can change or

1089
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:54,960
control. Well, no, it is about dealing

1090
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:57,240
with a stress or you can change and

1091
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:59,760
control. Um, it's about changing the

1092
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:01,680
goal so that you're not trying to do a

1093
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:04,000
thing that's perfect. Because like in

1094
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:06,480
coral singing for example, there just is

1095
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:10,400
literally no such thing as perfect. It's

1096
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:12,960
not 1 plus 1 is two. It is

1097
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:15,040
embody the spirit of the conduct of the

1098
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,920
composers. It's not there's no such

1099
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:19,599
thing as perfect. So, how do you feel

1100
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:22,040
satisfied when you are singing in a

1101
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:27,040
recording session where you sing three

1102
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:29,760
measures over and over and o and it gets

1103
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:32,480
so tedious and you need to be alive in

1104
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:35,599
your body and connected to the intention

1105
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:38,240
every time over and over and not make it

1106
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:41,280
mechanical and bored. You need to set a

1107
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:45,800
a goal. Good goals need to be something

1108
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:48,480
that is soon certain, specific,

1109
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:50,079
concrete, positive, and personal. It's

1110
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,680
chapter two. It's chapter two. I'm not

1111
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:53,760
going to go in detail, but I will tell

1112
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:56,640
you that I've seen this work when you

1113
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:58,400
change the goal um in a recording

1114
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:00,400
session when we were having this like

1115
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:02,720
just drilling this same thing over and

1116
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:04,160
over again. And I was like, "Okay, we're

1117
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:06,640
going to change the goal. Instead of

1118
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:08,480
trying to be perfect in every take, we

1119
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:11,880
are going to change the goal to filling

1120
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:14,240
Andrew. Andrew was this very cutie

1121
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:16,160
patootie recording producer who'd come

1122
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:18,200
in and move cables around and adjust the

1123
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:20,319
microphones. And then he's listening

1124
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:21,839
backstage. Thank you, choir. That was

1125
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:24,079
lovely. I need you to take from measure

1126
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:25,359
two again, beat three. Yeah. The breath

1127
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:27,760
there was a little loud and I heard a

1128
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:32,319
page turn. Can we try it again?

1129
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:34,800
And our goal was to fill Andrew with joy

1130
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:36,800
so that when he listens he goes choir

1131
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:39,280
that was really lovely. Thank you. We

1132
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:41,119
wanted to get that response from him. Um

1133
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:42,480
and so instead of thinking like we have

1134
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:44,319
to do this right every time we're

1135
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:46,560
thinking about this person who we all

1136
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:48,880
admire who we know is listening and the

1137
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:51,119
effect we'll have on him Grammy award

1138
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:52,960
experience. It's such a more meaningful.

1139
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:56,160
It was soon certain, specific, concrete,

1140
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:58,880
positive, and personal. And it changed

1141
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:00,800
how everyone felt in the recording

1142
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:02,160
session. Not trying to be perfect

1143
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:05,599
anymore, just trying to do something

1144
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:07,920
that was important in that moment.

1145
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:10,319
So much so that like you I mean like it

1146
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:12,520
gets boring. But eventually the soprano

1147
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:16,079
is like,

1148
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:18,720
"Andrew, are you filled with joy?" And

1149
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:20,560
he actually went, "Yeah, yeah, I really

1150
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:22,480
am."

1151
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:24,960
changes everything.

1152
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:28,800
I really love that example. It's great.

1153
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:30,720
A completely true thing. 100%. Yeah. So,

1154
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:33,440
I wanted you to talk a little bit about

1155
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:36,240
this idea of perfectionism

1156
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:37,920
and you talked about toxic perfectionism

1157
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:39,200
and I thought maybe you could say a

1158
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,640
little bit about that because you know

1159
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:42,200
because we use the term perfectionism

1160
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:44,800
and I'm a perfectionist. We use that

1161
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:47,200
colloquially to mean I'm really

1162
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:49,280
interested in doing things as well as I

1163
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:51,200
possibly can and I don't feel really

1164
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:52,720
proud of thing until I know I've put my

1165
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,319
best effort into it. And there is

1166
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:56,319
nothing toxic about having high

1167
00:48:54,319 --> 00:49:00,520
standards and being detail oriented.

1168
00:48:56,319 --> 00:49:02,800
Yeah. But when your idea of achieving

1169
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:06,240
perfection leads you to believe that if

1170
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:08,000
a thing is not perfect, it is worthless.

1171
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:09,119
That imperfection, something that's

1172
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,440
going to be imperfect, you shouldn't

1173
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:15,040
even bother starting. That is when

1174
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:17,520
perfectionism starts to stop you from

1175
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,559
feeling joy and uh connecting with your

1176
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:21,680
something larger. Connecting with your

1177
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:23,920
something larger and the the cure for to

1178
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:25,359
talk that kind of toxic perfectionism is

1179
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:26,960
self-compassion. And I don't know if you

1180
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:28,960
want to talk about that separately or if

1181
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:30,240
Emily should do a whole thing. Well, I

1182
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:32,880
was actually going to ask about that

1183
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:35,760
next. So, it's

1184
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:37,280
Yeah. So uh when you are uh the kind of

1185
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:39,680
perfectionist who feels like it has to

1186
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:41,440
be perfect or it is absolutely worthless

1187
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:44,319
or the kind of perfectionist where you

1188
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:46,480
feel outside pressure to succeed at

1189
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:48,240
every single thing you do. That's

1190
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:51,359
probably not familiar to anybody in this

1191
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:52,640
room. No, not at all. Right. Um then you

1192
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:54,880
end up having a lot of harsh

1193
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:56,400
self-criticism. You have uh in the in

1194
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:58,640
the chapter we call it the mad woman in

1195
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:01,599
the attic which is Peggy Macintosh's

1196
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:03,920
language from the 80s. Um, as people

1197
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:05,720
with multiple diagnosed mental health

1198
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:08,880
issues, we feel comfortable reclaiming

1199
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:11,920
Madwoman. Um, which is that voice in

1200
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:15,200
your head that beats the crap out of you

1201
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:19,520
for being such a terrible failure of a

1202
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:21,440
human being. Um, one of the anecdo uh

1203
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:23,680
that's her lashing herself. This is so

1204
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:25,839
we grew up our father grew up Catholic.

1205
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:27,839
So, this is the like hair, shirt, and

1206
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:29,760
lash of like beating the crap out of

1207
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:31,680
yourself and inflicting wounds on

1208
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:34,240
yourself because you feel like you need

1209
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:36,400
to punish yourself for falling short of

1210
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:38,559
someone else's standard of who you're

1211
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:41,359
supposed to be. In the abyss, the mad

1212
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:43,839
woman arises out of the abyss and only

1213
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:46,800
has two potential objects. Either she

1214
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:48,720
can be incandescent with rage at you for

1215
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,839
falling short, in which case you beat

1216
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:52,480
the crap out of yourself, or

1217
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:55,599
incandescent with rage at the world for

1218
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:57,200
having these bogus expectations.

1219
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:58,160
Sorry, I didn't think you'd say bogus. I

1220
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:00,160
thought you were going to say something

1221
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:03,520
else. I'm I'm really trying to like not

1222
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:07,359
swear. Not. Yeah,

1223
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:09,280
it was hurtful. Um, so the mad woman

1224
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:10,880
decides, is it your fault of not

1225
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:13,680
achieving what the world told you to do,

1226
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:16,640
or is it the world's fault? So, y'all

1227
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:18,480
can imagine I had a speaking gig on a

1228
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:20,880
Sunday. Emily was actually visiting over

1229
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:22,319
the weekend that this happened. Um,

1230
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:24,960
snowing. Yeah, it was snowing. There was

1231
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:26,800
like a foot of snow on the ground and I

1232
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:30,480
get a text from saying, "Hey, Emily,

1233
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:31,920
we're ready. Where are you?"

1234
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:36,200
Because I had put the event in my

1235
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:38,640
calendar for Sunday and the event was on

1236
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:40,880
Saturday and I was supposed to be there.

1237
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:46,400
I was at home in my pajamas under a foot

1238
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:48,119
of snow, no less than an hour away from

1239
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:51,440
the

1240
00:51:48,119 --> 00:51:51,440
event. That

1241
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:57,839
expression, so

1242
00:51:54,599 --> 00:51:59,760
so I followed my own advice in this

1243
00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:02,559
moment like you have. I have just

1244
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:05,040
screwed up royally. This is the only

1245
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:07,920
thing I have ever fully just missed.

1246
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:11,040
I've done a bad job sometimes, but I

1247
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:13,760
missed it. Uh, and so like the mad woman

1248
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:15,359
in my head, uh, whom I we Moana came out

1249
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:17,800
while we were watching it, and when I

1250
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:22,240
saw Takah the lava

1251
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:26,640
monster throwing balls of lava at Moana,

1252
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:29,680
I was like, it me, my mad woman is Tea,

1253
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:32,839
the lava monster. But what does Moana do

1254
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:37,240
when she sees Tea the lava monster?

1255
00:52:32,839 --> 00:52:39,680
Okay, TLDDR spoilers for

1256
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:41,280
Moana. Moana is given the heart of

1257
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:42,720
Teiti, which is a glowing green stone

1258
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:44,240
with the squirrel in it. And she has to

1259
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:46,160
restore the heart of Teiti. She has to

1260
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:48,079
cross the horizon, find the demigod

1261
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:52,160
Maui, and restore the heart of Teiti.

1262
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:55,359
And her last worst enemy is Tea, the

1263
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:58,800
lava monster. And because all Disney and

1264
00:52:55,359 --> 00:53:01,119
Pixar stories now are like the journey

1265
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:03,839
of an individual human through her own

1266
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:05,680
psyche, which is what all Yungian

1267
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:08,079
storytelling interpretation and dream

1268
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:10,640
interpretation is. It's actually Moana

1269
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:13,040
has to go deep and confront the worst

1270
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:15,520
most difficult part of herself to

1271
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:17,440
restore the heart of Teiti. And what she

1272
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:19,839
notices is that the swirl at the center

1273
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:22,319
of the stone of the heart of teiti

1274
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:25,440
matches the swirl on the center of the

1275
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:28,480
chest of tea the lava monster. So

1276
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:30,880
instead of fighting which is what Maui

1277
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:33,200
does. Maui gets in full haka mode and is

1278
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:35,440
like I'm going to I'm a tiny demigod but

1279
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:37,839
I'm going to get this lava monster. But

1280
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:39,839
what Moana does Moana's superpowers she

1281
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:42,640
can see below the surface. She holds up

1282
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:44,720
the heart. I have crossed the horizon to

1283
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:47,200
find you. She says to the ocean, "Let

1284
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:51,119
her come to me. I know your name." She

1285
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:54,599
strides toward the lava monster. I have

1286
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:58,160
stolen the heart with her hair.

1287
00:53:54,599 --> 00:54:01,040
Waving. And she stands bravely in front

1288
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:05,960
of Tekk, the lava monster.

1289
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:12,160
And she says, "This is not who you

1290
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:14,559
are. You know who you are." She turns

1291
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:15,480
toward the lava monster with kindness

1292
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:18,480
and

1293
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:22,000
compassion and she says, "You know who

1294
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:24,800
you truly are." And she stands forehead

1295
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:27,359
to forehead with her worst most

1296
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:29,920
dangerous enemy that lives inside of

1297
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:34,160
her. And she puts the stone at the heart

1298
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:38,559
of Tikka and all of the lava drops away.

1299
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:42,000
And this monster transforms into Teiti,

1300
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:43,760
the goddess of abundance and life. The

1301
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,520
moral of the story is I was sitting here

1302
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:49,359
beating the [ __ ] out of myself this

1303
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:51,599
January in western Massachusetts and I

1304
00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:54,160
turned toward Tea and I was like, "What

1305
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:56,960
do you have to tell me? What do you need

1306
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:58,960
from me? I know you're trying to help.

1307
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:01,119
This is not who you are. I'm not gonna

1308
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:02,240
beat you up. I'm not gonna beat myself

1309
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:04,319
up. We're gonna get through this

1310
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:06,960
together. what do you need from me? And

1311
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:09,280
she said, "My lava monster come." I'm

1312
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:12,000
like breathing breath together with her.

1313
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:13,599
She says, "If you because you have made

1314
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,359
this mistake, you're never going to get

1315
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:17,920
another job. They're going to know that

1316
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:20,760
you're a total fake and a loser and

1317
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:24,040
you're going to die

1318
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:27,359
alone. I'm trying to keep you

1319
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:30,800
safe." She was trying to keep me safe.

1320
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:33,720
And I thanked her. I recognized that she

1321
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:36,000
was working really hard and it must be

1322
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:38,240
exhausting to have to work that hard.

1323
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,559
I'm literally just sitting in the living

1324
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:42,559
room sobbing imagining this. This is

1325
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:44,960
internal family systems work for people

1326
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:46,960
who are interested. Yeah. Parts work.

1327
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:48,880
Yay. We're going to quote Moana Moana

1328
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:51,520
and several therapeutic modalities. Yes,

1329
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:54,400
that's just what you get. This is this

1330
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:56,319
it sounds like whackadoodle nonsense.

1331
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:58,480
Storytelling Moana. I'm talking to

1332
00:55:56,319 --> 00:56:00,400
myself. But uh this normally science

1333
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:02,400
based. There is like there was so many

1334
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:04,720
references for this. I had to cut a full

1335
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:07,359
paragraph of like different therapeutic

1336
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:11,240
modalities that do this kind of work cuz

1337
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:14,079
the editor was like this is very

1338
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:15,799
boring. But it's totally evidence-based.

1339
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:18,799
The point of it is that

1340
00:56:15,799 --> 00:56:20,280
self-compassion is the intervention that

1341
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:22,720
is the opposite of the harsh

1342
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:25,280
self-criticism that is so dangerous. It

1343
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:27,040
is so easy to believe. Another Oh god, I

1344
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:30,599
should stop talking. One more. One more.

1345
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:33,680
One more. Okay. So, when the mail

1346
00:56:30,599 --> 00:56:36,000
carrier drops off the mail, our dog goes

1347
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:38,000
bananas. And then the mail carrier goes

1348
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:41,480
away. And our dog is convinced that the

1349
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:44,559
mail carrier goes away because she went

1350
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:46,680
bananas. Here's the thing. The mail

1351
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:50,240
carrier was going to go away anyway,

1352
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:52,319
right? So many of us believe like, I

1353
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:54,480
have gotten so far in life. Anyone in

1354
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:56,640
this room has accomplished so much in

1355
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:59,280
life. It is really easy to believe that

1356
00:56:56,640 --> 00:57:00,760
we got this far in life because we beat

1357
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:02,559
the crap out of

1358
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:05,119
ourselves. We were going to do it

1359
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:07,599
anyway. Imagine if we had been working

1360
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:09,680
this hard and we had not been inflicting

1361
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:12,559
injuries on our own psyches this whole

1362
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:16,040
time and having to work with those

1363
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:19,200
injuries and do the healing from those

1364
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:21,440
injuries. What if what if we were not

1365
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:24,359
beating? What if we were so strong

1366
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:26,960
because we were not

1367
00:57:24,359 --> 00:57:29,359
constantly opening wounds that we're

1368
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:31,200
trying to close? And a key difference in

1369
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:34,319
what the research shows this turning

1370
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:36,240
toward your inner mad woman is different

1371
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:38,559
from like the popular notion which is

1372
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:40,000
like just shut off that inner voice and

1373
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:42,000
ignore it. You don't need all that hate

1374
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:45,440
in your brain. Tell it to go away. Yeah.

1375
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:47,119
If if you just tell tea to go away that

1376
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:49,920
tea is going to get even more mad at

1377
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:51,280
you. Right. the that's what happens in

1378
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:54,799
the story and it turns out that that's

1379
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:56,200
not an effective way to deal with to it

1380
00:57:54,799 --> 00:57:58,160
doesn't give you the benefits of

1381
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:59,920
self-compassion that when instead of

1382
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:01,839
just like shutting down that inner

1383
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:03,599
critic or ignoring it pretending it

1384
00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:06,160
doesn't exist and trying to move forward

1385
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:08,559
like you that's still in there the

1386
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:11,119
effective thing to do is to turn toward

1387
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:13,520
it to turn and face the strange and be

1388
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:18,079
like this is a hard thing to confront

1389
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:20,319
and doing that in a many situations

1390
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:23,240
turning toward the hard thing is what's

1391
00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:25,359
going to get you to healing and

1392
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:26,960
recovery. This is the last chapter

1393
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:29,960
because it is the hardest thing to do.

1394
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:29,960
Yeah.

1395
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:34,720
Wow. So, I I want to take that in for a

1396
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:36,720
moment because I want to skip around to

1397
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:39,040
a question that I think is connected to

1398
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:41,760
this that I think speaks to this because

1399
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:43,520
I think it's pretty deep because this

1400
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:45,200
all makes perfect sense to me as a

1401
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,119
therapist and referencing these

1402
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:49,680
different

1403
00:58:46,119 --> 00:58:54,119
modalities. Um, so it's this concept of

1404
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:56,640
knowing what's true and facing what's

1405
00:58:54,119 --> 00:59:00,880
uncomfortable and how that's different

1406
00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:03,640
from acceptance. Mhm. So that really

1407
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:06,160
struck me as a really important

1408
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:08,960
distinction and connected to what you're

1409
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:11,440
talking about now. Yeah. Do you agree?

1410
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:13,079
Is that true? Is it is that all part of

1411
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:16,160
what you're saying?

1412
00:59:13,079 --> 00:59:18,240
100%. My bad day was related to being

1413
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:20,400
confronted with multiple people's trauma

1414
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:22,240
in a day. Uh I trained as a therapist. I

1415
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:24,400
did not become a therapist because I

1416
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:26,720
don't have the magical thing that it

1417
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:29,760
takes to sit with people in pain over

1418
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:29,760
and over and say

1419
00:59:30,359 --> 00:59:35,440
uh what was that like for

1420
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:37,280
you? I like I don't have that magical

1421
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:41,040
thing. Um I'm an educator by

1422
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:43,319
temperament. Uh some people can do both.

1423
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:48,079
Uh

1424
00:59:43,319 --> 00:59:51,200
so helping do education around trauma

1425
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:52,720
stuff is what I got confronted by

1426
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:54,960
students with the idea of like

1427
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:56,799
acceptance which in like Buddhist

1428
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:59,040
practice as it gets translated into

1429
00:59:56,799 --> 01:00:03,559
English the word acceptance gets used

1430
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:07,359
and that feels like accept that this is

1431
01:00:03,559 --> 01:00:09,680
true and will always be true forever and

1432
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:11,599
that's not actually what it means. So,

1433
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:14,480
uh, instead I use the phrase

1434
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:16,799
observational distance. If you can, if

1435
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:18,799
you're like in the stream, if you're in

1436
01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:21,839
the rushing river of your own internal

1437
01:00:18,799 --> 01:00:25,119
experience, if you can take one step out

1438
01:00:21,839 --> 01:00:26,920
of the rushing stream and witness it

1439
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:29,680
instead of being in

1440
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:31,520
it, you can know that that is like this

1441
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:34,400
is the thing that's happening right now.

1442
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:36,799
And you have to acknowledge the given

1443
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:39,040
circumstances. Nothing James Baldwin

1444
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:42,119
famously nothing uh can be changed until

1445
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:44,799
it is faced but nothing

1446
01:00:42,119 --> 01:00:47,839
uh that is not faced can ever be

1447
01:00:44,799 --> 01:00:51,040
changed. Um

1448
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:53,280
and our job is to acknowledge what's

1449
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:57,359
actually happening in the here and now.

1450
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:57,359
That is not the same

1451
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:04,559
as believing that we can't change it.

1452
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:08,640
In fact, the only way you can change it

1453
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:10,400
is to recognize 100% of what is true.

1454
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:12,400
This also comes from my work as a sex

1455
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:13,839
educator where I I tell people I teach

1456
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:15,280
people to live with confidence and joy

1457
01:01:13,839 --> 01:01:16,480
inside their bodies. And a student

1458
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:17,960
raised her hand and said, "Can you

1459
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:20,160
please define those

1460
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:23,280
terms?" And I was like, "I'll get back

1461
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:25,040
to you next week." Um, and what I

1462
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:26,480
figured out, and indeed this is very

1463
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:28,559
parallel to the work of Sonia Renee

1464
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:30,640
Taylor, confidence is knowing what is

1465
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:31,839
true about your body and the world and

1466
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:35,680
the things that you've been taught about

1467
01:01:31,839 --> 01:01:39,280
all those things. Um, and joy is the

1468
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:42,720
hard part. Joy is loving what's true

1469
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:48,359
about your body and the world and what

1470
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:51,359
it's like to live in this moment. Um, so

1471
01:01:48,359 --> 01:01:53,520
that's the hard thing is recognizing all

1472
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:55,119
the things that are true. The things

1473
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:57,359
you've been told should be true. I'm

1474
01:01:55,119 --> 01:02:00,319
going to add an active practice, a thing

1475
01:01:57,359 --> 01:02:01,760
that people can do, and that is I uh I

1476
01:02:00,319 --> 01:02:02,960
started learning Taichi is one of the

1477
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:04,559
first things I did to help myself

1478
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:06,559
recover from the burnout that put me in

1479
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:07,760
the hospital. Let's do a thing. Huh? So,

1480
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:08,720
if you can sit in whatever way is

1481
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:10,240
comfortable for you, I'm going to sit

1482
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:11,599
forward. If you want to like rub your

1483
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:13,440
hands together and get like a little bit

1484
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:15,119
activated in your body and aware of the

1485
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:17,359
energy that's happening inside you,

1486
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:19,280
you're gonna reach out to the world in

1487
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:20,880
front of you, scoop up some of the

1488
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:24,559
universe and like look at it in front of

1489
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:26,880
your face. And this is we're at MIT. We

1490
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:28,799
are on the North American continent on

1491
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:30,960
the planet Earth in this the solar

1492
01:02:28,799 --> 01:02:32,720
galaxy in the universe as infinite as it

1493
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:33,839
might be. Look at all of that. And then

1494
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:35,040
we're going to just like settle back

1495
01:02:33,839 --> 01:02:36,480
into a comfortable position. I'm going

1496
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:38,240
to let my hands kind of hang here like

1497
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:39,760
this. And this is we're going to call

1498
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:41,920
this mountain pose. It feels comfortable

1499
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:43,119
and stable and sturdy. And then we're

1500
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:44,960
going to like reach out and scoop out

1501
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:47,520
and grab some more of the universe and

1502
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:50,000
look at it as it is like America as it

1503
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:52,319
is and our bodies as they are and you

1504
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:54,160
know our day as it has been. Um and you

1505
01:02:52,319 --> 01:02:56,720
know what is also in this scoop is is

1506
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:58,960
the past history as it has always been.

1507
01:02:56,720 --> 01:03:00,400
And in this scoop is also the future of

1508
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:02,400
what is possible that's going to happen

1509
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:04,480
next. and we look at it and we're going

1510
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:06,319
to we're going to call this tiger and

1511
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:08,319
we're going to like okay let that go and

1512
01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:09,599
like return to mountain and then we're

1513
01:03:08,319 --> 01:03:10,640
going to scoop up some more of the

1514
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:14,400
universe. So, we're going to take a look

1515
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:17,119
at it. The tiger as as violent and scary

1516
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:19,760
and also like a a nurturing parent could

1517
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:22,160
be a thing that a tiger is and soft and

1518
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:23,920
cute and fuzzy and also really sharp

1519
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:25,039
teeth and all the things that a tiger

1520
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:27,280
can be and we're going to be like,

1521
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:28,960
"Yeah, I'm going to embrace everything

1522
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:31,200
that a tiger can be and I'm going to

1523
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:32,559
return to mountain." And in Taichi, like

1524
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:34,240
there's a lot of gestures that could be

1525
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:35,839
associated with this. This is kind of

1526
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:37,920
like scoop up the universe and look at

1527
01:03:35,839 --> 01:03:39,920
it and then return to mountain. Embrace

1528
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:42,160
Tiger return a mountain is a active

1529
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:45,440
practice for teaching your brain that it

1530
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:47,680
doesn't need to react to fear and and

1531
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:49,599
uncertainty with a fight orflight

1532
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:52,640
response every single time you can look

1533
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:54,720
at oh my god that's really dangerous oh

1534
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:58,200
look I have access to mountains still

1535
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:58,200
does that make sense

1536
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:05,000
oh it does it not only made sense but it

1537
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:07,359
felt really nice okay

1538
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:09,119
good talking about dark things but Our

1539
01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:12,559
goal is for you to feel better by the

1540
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:14,559
end. Yes. And with that in mind, I have

1541
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:18,480
one last question before we open it up

1542
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:22,640
to the group. It's about the practice of

1543
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:25,760
practicing gratitude. Oh yeah. So

1544
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:28,880
gratitude everybody. I would like you to

1545
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:31,160
talk a little bit about your ideas about

1546
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:34,160
practicing gratitude because a lot of

1547
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:36,319
people practice expressing gratitude.

1548
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:39,200
They write about gratitude. They journal

1549
01:04:36,319 --> 01:04:41,359
about gratitude, but you had a a new

1550
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:43,760
take on it that I really appreciated and

1551
01:04:41,359 --> 01:04:46,640
have incorporated into my own practice.

1552
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:48,880
Yeah. I was hoping that first you could

1553
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:51,680
share it with everyone. And then second,

1554
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:53,760
I wanted to express my own gratitude for

1555
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:55,599
being able to meet both of you and for

1556
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:58,839
your work. That was both very nice and

1557
01:04:55,599 --> 01:04:58,839
very smooth.

1558
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:04,799
Can I ask content and excellent rhetoric

1559
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:07,200
like just what is the thing that you've

1560
01:05:04,799 --> 01:05:08,559
incorporated? Well, I love the way that

1561
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:11,280
you were talking about being more

1562
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:13,760
specific. So, when I think about

1563
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:15,440
gratitude, you know, you've been I don't

1564
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:17,440
know sort of indoctrinated in the world

1565
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:20,559
that this is a good thing to do, but

1566
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:22,319
it's also it's done in generalities.

1567
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:24,000
And so, the way that you all talked

1568
01:05:22,319 --> 01:05:26,240
about it was it really does need to be

1569
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:28,640
specific and detailed around your own

1570
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:30,480
life. And that really helped me to think

1571
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:32,400
about every day and also in terms of

1572
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:35,119
setting an intention for the day. Yeah.

1573
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:36,960
Yeah. And the the thing about our new

1574
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:38,559
take is that our take is just reporting

1575
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:40,400
what the research into gratitude

1576
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:42,720
actually says as opposed to just doing

1577
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:44,319
like the popular version of like keep

1578
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:45,599
track of what you're grateful for. It

1579
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:47,920
turns out that's not what the research

1580
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:50,799
says is an effective intervention. And

1581
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:51,799
when I tried doing it that way, I felt

1582
01:05:50,799 --> 01:05:54,319
like an

1583
01:05:51,799 --> 01:05:56,640
[ __ ] Look at all this stuff I have.

1584
01:05:54,319 --> 01:05:59,599
Why am I not more grateful all the time?

1585
01:05:56,640 --> 01:06:01,680
And also like like yeah, I'm really

1586
01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:03,839
grateful to have a roof over my head and

1587
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:05,839
also this apartment is enormously

1588
01:06:03,839 --> 01:06:07,680
overpriced and I'm going into debt for

1589
01:06:05,839 --> 01:06:09,839
it while I'm getting this degree that

1590
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:12,799
I'm so fortunate to be able to get, but

1591
01:06:09,839 --> 01:06:15,680
I am exhausted all the time from this

1592
01:06:12,799 --> 01:06:17,119
degree. So I like I couldn't I I hated I

1593
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:18,960
hated gratitude. And then I read the

1594
01:06:17,119 --> 01:06:22,000
research and I was like, "Oh, that's

1595
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:24,079
different." So there's two. Um, one is

1596
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:26,720
gratitude for who you have is one is

1597
01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:28,559
gratitude for how things happen.

1598
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:32,520
Gratitude for who you have is the easy

1599
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:34,880
one. It is

1600
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:36,880
like especially if you can write it

1601
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:39,200
down. Write a letter to a person who has

1602
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:41,200
been really important and impactful for

1603
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:43,920
you, who has provided you with

1604
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:47,760
resources, who has provided you with

1605
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:49,520
emotional support, instrumental support.

1606
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:51,200
I wrote a gratitude letter to my

1607
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:52,960
clinical depression because it taught me

1608
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:54,400
so much.

1609
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:55,760
I don't want anybody to have to feel

1610
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:58,200
like I should be grateful for things

1611
01:06:55,760 --> 01:07:02,160
that caused me to suffer,

1612
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:04,000
but it's a thing that's possible.

1613
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:05,680
Millia actually sings a song called

1614
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:08,319
Gratitude and she sings it to her

1615
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:11,200
depression.

1616
01:07:08,319 --> 01:07:14,160
It's very moving and effective. Yeah. Um

1617
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:17,039
so that's one. And boy, if you want like

1618
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:18,799
a big shot of well-being that will last

1619
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:21,119
a long time for you and the other

1620
01:07:18,799 --> 01:07:23,200
person, read that letter out loud to

1621
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:26,240
that other person. Can we do the magic

1622
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:28,319
trick? Uh, let me say the uh how things

1623
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:31,039
happen. So, what the research actually

1624
01:07:28,319 --> 01:07:32,720
says about like gratitude for like life

1625
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:34,799
events is like what's a thing that

1626
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:37,039
happened today that you're grateful for?

1627
01:07:34,799 --> 01:07:39,200
What are the circumstances surrounding

1628
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:41,920
it that made it possible for this to

1629
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:44,480
happen? Like I'm grateful to have a roof

1630
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:47,160
over my head. How did this happen? Oh,

1631
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:49,760
we could buy a house because my

1632
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:54,000
husband's excellent human being of a

1633
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:55,599
father died and we got enough money to

1634
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:59,440
be able to put a down payment on a

1635
01:07:55,599 --> 01:08:01,520
house. Like we Oh. And suddenly I'm

1636
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:04,000
grateful to have a roof over my head is

1637
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:06,799
I am profoundly grateful for the human

1638
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:09,200
being responsible at least in part for

1639
01:08:06,799 --> 01:08:11,440
raising this excellent human being who

1640
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:13,520
is my favorite person on earth. So it's

1641
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:15,599
not about the roof anymore. It's about

1642
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:17,759
like the generations of humans who

1643
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:20,400
created the human who shares a home with

1644
01:08:17,759 --> 01:08:21,920
me. Um and that's in the last chapter

1645
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:23,839
like there's the full details of like

1646
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:26,719
the step by step. You do it every day.

1647
01:08:23,839 --> 01:08:28,640
It changes your brain. Yeah. Magic

1648
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:30,319
trick. I thought maybe we could end

1649
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:31,839
really with the magic trick because okay

1650
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:34,480
so the thing we talk about as the magic

1651
01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:36,319
trick is a combination of many things

1652
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:40,319
we've talked about already today which

1653
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:42,080
is moving your body in time and space in

1654
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:44,400
connection with other people toward a

1655
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:46,159
shared goal. Um and we're going to count

1656
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:48,560
backwards from 10. That's our shared

1657
01:08:46,159 --> 01:08:51,199
goal. But we're going to do it by going

1658
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:52,960
10 98 72 and then going 10 with your

1659
01:08:51,199 --> 01:08:54,080
other hand and 10 with your foot and 10

1660
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:55,600
with your other foot. You can stand up

1661
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:56,880
if makes you happy to do that. I'm gonna

1662
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:59,120
do it sitting down because standing up

1663
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:01,759
makes me fall over. I'm gonna stand up

1664
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:04,239
with my cane. Okay. Um, so we're gonna

1665
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:06,400
do it and then we'll go from nine. And

1666
01:09:04,239 --> 01:09:08,719
here's the trick. You have to do it in

1667
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:10,000
your good news voice. Like you have good

1668
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:11,440
news for somebody who's way over there

1669
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:14,080
and you go, I have good news. Can you

1670
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:15,279
all say good news? Good news. In your

1671
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:18,159
good news voice, you're going to count

1672
01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:24,719
backwards from 10 and shake. Go. 10 9 8

1673
01:09:18,159 --> 01:09:31,400

[Applause]

1686
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:35,120
moving in time with others toward a

1687
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:37,920
shared goal. That one's called the

1688
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:39,320
countdown shake, but dancing, singing,

1689
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:41,920
marching in a

1690
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:43,679
protest, worshiping together, that these

1691
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:45,120
are all things that hook into going to a

1692
01:10:43,679 --> 01:10:46,320
concert where you all sing a lot. It's

1693
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:48,640
these are all ways to hook into that

1694
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:51,800
same like Yeah. Does anybody feel better

1695
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:55,920
now than when we started? Y.

1696
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:58,000
Okay. Mission accomplish.

1697
01:10:55,920 --> 01:11:01,120
So, we have questions, I'm sure, from

1698
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:03,040
the audience and also virtually. And so,

1699
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:04,800
we have Sylvia in the back. Do you want

1700
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:06,640
to start? And please raise your hand if

1701
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:10,440
you would like to ask a question. We

1702
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:10,440
have a question in the front.

1703
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:14,159
I'm gonna start over there. Oh, thank

1704
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:16,560
you. Oh, I'm sorry. And there's Emily as

1705
01:11:14,159 --> 01:11:19,280
well. Thank you, Emily. Thank you so so

1706
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:21,280
much for being here and for this talk

1707
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:23,280
and for the conversation and for the

1708
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:26,159
book. I enjoyed all of it very

1709
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:27,760
thoroughly. So, and very very humorous

1710
01:11:26,159 --> 01:11:29,040
conversation. So, I really enjoyed. So,

1711
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:32,560
thank you so much. We talk about the

1712
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:34,640
patriarchy a lot. So

1713
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:37,360
um in the book I really really

1714
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:39,520
appreciated the notion of how important

1715
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:42,320
it is to find meaning and how that can

1716
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:44,960
be very helpful and also I really was

1717
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:46,960
intrigued by and appreciated the idea of

1718
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:49,440
how we can find meaning from experiences

1719
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:51,920
that are sought after and desirable and

1720
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:53,600
that are pleasant and at the same time

1721
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:55,679
while there are experiences that we

1722
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:57,440
didn't desire and didn't want it's still

1723
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:59,120
possible to make meaning from those and

1724
01:11:57,440 --> 01:12:01,440
how that can be really really helpful to

1725
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:03,280
do. I'd love to hear any further

1726
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:04,960
thoughts you might have on that or any

1727
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:06,800
examples or anecdotes you might have

1728
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:09,440
from people you've worked with or things

1729
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:12,080
you've witnessed. Yeah. So, I feel

1730
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:13,280
inclined to tell the story. Uh, anybody

1731
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:17,199
here willing to say they were old enough

1732
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:20,480
to vote in the 2004 election?

1733
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:21,840
Oh, yeah. Many for that. So, I was in

1734
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:24,159
grad school at the time. I'm a sex

1735
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:26,800
educator. Uh, my work was directly and

1736
01:12:24,159 --> 01:12:30,080
immediately impacted by the policies of

1737
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:33,199
the federal government. Um, uh, the 2000

1738
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:35,040
election was was the first time I was

1739
01:12:33,199 --> 01:12:37,280
like, "Oh [ __ ] our democracy is

1740
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:40,159
crumbling. I should maybe do something."

1741
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:42,320
So, I invested a lot in the 2004

1742
01:12:40,159 --> 01:12:43,760
election. Um, I got trained in how

1743
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:45,440
elections happened. I considered

1744
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:47,920
dropping out of grad school and working

1745
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:50,000
for a political campaign instead. Um,

1746
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:53,360
but so I spent a week leading up to the

1747
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:57,920
election volunteering in Ohio, a crucial

1748
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:59,840
swing state in 2004. Uh, and I like I

1749
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:01,760
drove home on election night. The

1750
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:04,239
results were coming in. It was sounding

1751
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:07,199
really good. I woke up the next morning

1752
01:13:04,239 --> 01:13:09,840
like I had put so like two years of my

1753
01:13:07,199 --> 01:13:11,600
life invested in this election. And what

1754
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:13,760
everybody told me was that if I work

1755
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:15,679
really hard, if everybody just does

1756
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:20,640
everything they can, we're going to make

1757
01:13:15,679 --> 01:13:23,760
this happen. And I John Kerry, but like

1758
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:28,159
like let's make John Kerry happen. Uh,

1759
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:30,000
and I woke up and I went to my best

1760
01:13:28,159 --> 01:13:31,600
friend's house and he was sitting in the

1761
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:34,159
living room watching the news and I was

1762
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:38,159
like, "It's it's bad." And he was like,

1763
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:40,719
"It's 100% all the way bad." And I uh

1764
01:13:38,159 --> 01:13:42,880
cried the kind of crying that like

1765
01:13:40,719 --> 01:13:45,840
fluids are dripping from every orifice

1766
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:48,000
in your face like can't breathe. Uh

1767
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:50,040
despair because I had done everything

1768
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:55,719
they told me I was supposed to

1769
01:13:50,040 --> 01:14:00,719
do in order to accomplish a goal. And

1770
01:13:55,719 --> 01:14:04,320
I was crushed and got as depressed as

1771
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:07,520
I've ever been in my life. Um, I didn't

1772
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:10,400
know what to do next. And the question

1773
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:12,159
was about like, how do you find meaning

1774
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:16,000
in the really terrible things that can

1775
01:14:12,159 --> 01:14:19,679
happen? Um, and it took me several

1776
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:23,360
months to figure it out. But I figured

1777
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:27,360
out that my job as a sex educator, as a

1778
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:28,800
health educator, was to help people, to

1779
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:30,960
teach people to live with confidence and

1780
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:33,679
joy inside their bodies, to be able to

1781
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:36,320
experience pleasure inside their bodies,

1782
01:14:33,679 --> 01:14:39,840
to have access to full bodily autonomy.

1783
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:42,960
And every day that I do that work is a

1784
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:44,880
day that I am doing something about

1785
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:46,800
whatever is going to happen over the

1786
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:48,239
next four years because whatever was

1787
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:51,679
about to happen over the next four years

1788
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:53,600
was really bad. It was just as bad as we

1789
01:14:51,679 --> 01:14:56,960
expected and what's happening now is

1790
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:59,360
even worse. Um, and again, I invested

1791
01:14:56,960 --> 01:15:02,159
real hard. But this time, I knew that

1792
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:04,000
even me doing the absolute most I could

1793
01:15:02,159 --> 01:15:05,679
do, and the most I could do this year

1794
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,840
was so much more than what I could do

1795
01:15:05,679 --> 01:15:11,040
when I was a grad student, and it still

1796
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:14,000
wasn't enough. But because I am still

1797
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:18,880
anchored to my something larger, it's

1798
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:20,440
inside me. It's like the tide always

1799
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:22,560
falling and

1800
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:24,320
rising. Your sense of connection with

1801
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:26,880
your something larger. I am fortunate to

1802
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:29,280
be able to articulate specifically why

1803
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:30,560
I'm on earth is to teach people to live

1804
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:33,360
with confidence and joy inside their

1805
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:34,960
bodies. And any day I do that, some days

1806
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:37,199
it's easier to access. It's like the

1807
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:40,320
tide. It's always falling and rising.

1808
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:42,560
Some days it is more difficult. But any

1809
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:46,960
day that I have access to that is a day

1810
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:49,920
that I have led a meaningful life. What

1811
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:52,760
meaning does is enhance and enrich the

1812
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:57,280
good times in your life and give you an

1813
01:15:52,760 --> 01:16:00,159
anchor to continuing to exist through

1814
01:15:57,280 --> 01:16:02,719
even the worst of circumstances. You'll

1815
01:16:00,159 --> 01:16:06,679
probably remember uh the story from

1816
01:16:02,719 --> 01:16:09,679
World War II, a journalist traveling

1817
01:16:06,679 --> 01:16:13,920
post-war through the countries that had

1818
01:16:09,679 --> 01:16:16,360
been invaded by uh Germany.

1819
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:19,440
This journalist wandered into a basement

1820
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:22,400
where a family of Jews had been hiding

1821
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:24,640
through the entire war. And on the wall,

1822
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:27,480
written obviously in German was, "I

1823
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:30,239
believe in the sun even when it's not

1824
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:33,120
shining. I believe in love even when I

1825
01:16:30,239 --> 01:16:35,920
don't feel it. I believe in God even

1826
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:37,440
when he is silent." Which of course has

1827
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:38,640
been turned into a song that is like,

1828
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:41,280
it's been said to music several times.

1829
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:43,920
Several times. And it's like crushing.

1830
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:46,000
Uh but I I think about that a lot and I

1831
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:48,440
think about like just because I don't

1832
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:51,760
feel contact with my something larger

1833
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:54,040
today doesn't mean it's not there. I can

1834
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:58,080
find it again and it will give me a

1835
01:16:54,040 --> 01:17:00,640
reason to continue doing the work that I

1836
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:02,800
do. Does that make sense? And at the

1837
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:05,840
same time we can remember that nobody on

1838
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:10,480
Moana's island gave two bits about the

1839
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:13,360
ocean. She felt called by the ocean and

1840
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:16,080
everybody around her was like, "No, no,

1841
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:18,159
and no one leaves what that we all

1842
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:21,120
belong here. We all have a role to play.

1843
01:17:18,159 --> 01:17:22,719
This is what we're all a part of here on

1844
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:24,640
the island and she felt called by the

1845
01:17:22,719 --> 01:17:27,120
ocean." And despite nobody else being

1846
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:29,440
supportive of that, she went on her

1847
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:30,719
journey and did the thing. So sometimes

1848
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:32,000
you're not going to get the support, but

1849
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:34,880
you're going to get the connection you

1850
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:36,239
need from the meeting itself.

1851
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:37,840
Thank you so much. I want to check and

1852
01:17:36,239 --> 01:17:40,080
see if there are any questions from the

1853
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:43,280
virtual audience. Yes. Amelia, how do

1854
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:45,360
you cry? Uh Amelia, how do you cry? Is

1855
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:47,360
question was the how do you cry? Uh

1856
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:49,360
okay, so here's what you do. You're

1857
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:52,640
overwhelmed by the feeling. Something

1858
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:54,480
terrible happened and you are sobbing.

1859
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:57,120
What you think is uncontrollably you

1860
01:17:54,480 --> 01:18:01,080
it's just taken you over and the crying

1861
01:17:57,120 --> 01:18:04,080
starts to happen. And if you're me, you

1862
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:06,960
think, I'm going to feel like this until

1863
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:09,360
the problem is solved. I'm I feel like

1864
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:12,080
this because of the circumstances that

1865
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:13,360
occurred. And so you keep thinking, I

1866
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:15,199
can't believe he did that. I can't

1867
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:18,719
believe she said that. And the crying

1868
01:18:15,199 --> 01:18:23,000
keeps happening. And h why would it ever

1869
01:18:18,719 --> 01:18:25,360
stop until that changes? Turns out like

1870
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:28,080
stress, whatever emotion caused the

1871
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:30,480
crying is a cycle with a beginning, a

1872
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:32,159
middle, and an end. And if you let it,

1873
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:34,960
it just ends. And here's how you do

1874
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:37,199
that. You take the thing that in that

1875
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:38,800
initiated the crying, and you put it on

1876
01:18:37,199 --> 01:18:41,040
a little shelf, and you think about that

1877
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:43,360
later. That's the stressor. You're going

1878
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:45,199
to deal with that in a separate process.

1879
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:49,040
to deal with this process right here.

1880
01:18:45,199 --> 01:18:50,120
You turn toward the discomfort of crying

1881
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:53,320
and you

1882
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:55,600
just notice without judgment or

1883
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:57,040
evaluation. Okay, how hot do I feel

1884
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:58,960
right now while I'm crying? You know,

1885
01:18:57,040 --> 01:19:00,960
how many ounces of fluid are dripping

1886
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:02,600
out of my face right now? And where is

1887
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:05,120
there tension in my

1888
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:06,719
body? You're crying and you're noticing.

1889
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:08,880
And you're crying and you're noticing

1890
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:10,560
and the thoughts will come out of your

1891
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:12,239
mouth. And the thoughts will come, I

1892
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:13,840
can't believe he said that to me. What

1893
01:19:12,239 --> 01:19:15,360
an [ __ ] and you put it on a shelf

1894
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:17,199
and you're going to deal with it later,

1895
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:20,280
but you're the feelings are all you're

1896
01:19:17,199 --> 01:19:22,400
dealing with right here, right now. And

1897
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:24,080
eventually you're trying to find the

1898
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:26,239
feelings and there's no more feelings

1899
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:28,320
because the feelings are a cycle with a

1900
01:19:26,239 --> 01:19:31,040
beginning, a middle, and an end and they

1901
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:34,560
and they end you. The the trick is to

1902
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:36,480
not feeding the crying with additional

1903
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:38,800
thoughts about the thing. The key is

1904
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:41,360
dealing with the stress and the stressor

1905
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:43,440
in separate processes. Would you say you

1906
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:45,520
create observational distance between

1907
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:47,920
yourself and the experience or I'd say

1908
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:50,800
you turn to face a difficult thing with

1909
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:53,120
observational distance? Yes. You step

1910
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:55,120
out of the river. I want to check in

1911
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:57,120
with I to see are there any questions?

1912
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:59,040
Not flow like

1913
01:19:57,120 --> 01:20:00,719
Okay, perfect. Sylvia, um, is there

1914
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:03,199
anyone on this side? I thought I saw a

1915
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:06,159
hand. Excellent.

1916
01:20:03,199 --> 01:20:09,640
No one's going to ask about sleep.

1917
01:20:06,159 --> 01:20:09,640
I'm going to

1918
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:14,320
your favorite. So, it's actually like

1919
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:16,239
sort of related to the crying question

1920
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:18,960
where like sometimes when I'm stressed

1921
01:20:16,239 --> 01:20:22,480
out, it's really hard to sleep.

1922
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:23,840
And the number one indicator, like the

1923
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:25,199
number one reason people don't get

1924
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:27,120
enough sleep is cuz they're worried

1925
01:20:25,199 --> 01:20:28,640
about not sleeping.

1926
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:30,560
But I think also just like when you're

1927
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:32,239
stressed out, the brain is so active and

1928
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:33,760
like, you know, it's just one of those

1929
01:20:32,239 --> 01:20:36,239
days where the meditation won't work,

1930
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:38,400
the music won't work, the old towel or

1931
01:20:36,239 --> 01:20:40,320
whatever else. Um, so yeah, I just

1932
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:42,000
wanted to hear your thoughts on that.

1933
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:44,320
Yeah. So, how do you fall asleep

1934
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:46,159
basically? Um, one, do as much as you

1935
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:48,640
can during the day to complete the str.

1936
01:20:46,159 --> 01:20:52,040
So, how often does stress get activated

1937
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:52,040
in your body?

1938
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:56,640
At least every day. Yeah. So, how often

1939
01:20:55,199 --> 01:20:59,040
do you have to do stuff to complete the

1940
01:20:56,640 --> 01:21:02,159
stress response cycle? Every day. Yeah.

1941
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:04,480
Like every day. Wax on, wax off. You

1942
01:21:02,159 --> 01:21:07,120
just have to keep doing it. Um, there

1943
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:10,320
will be days when the stress outpaces

1944
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:12,159
your ability to drain it off. Um, so if

1945
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:13,840
you get in bed when your body is still

1946
01:21:12,159 --> 01:21:15,440
like this, if your body's like, I'm

1947
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:19,040
being chased by a saber-tooth tiger

1948
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:20,440
right now, or if you wake up at say 3:00

1949
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:23,120
in the morning

1950
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:24,880
and like as soon as you wake up, your

1951
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:26,640
body's like, I'm being chased. Is being

1952
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:28,880
chased by a saber-tooth tiger a really

1953
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:32,480
good time to be asleep?

1954
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:35,040
No. Yeah. So what you do is you

1955
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:37,199
recognize, oh wait, my body's in a state

1956
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:40,000
where it's trying to help me out by

1957
01:21:37,199 --> 01:21:44,000
keeping me alive, by keeping me vigilant

1958
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:46,360
so I don't get eaten. Am I actually

1959
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:51,480
being chased by a lion right

1960
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:53,760
now? Am I actually now in

1961
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:56,520
danger? And sometimes the answer to that

1962
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:59,719
question is yes.

1963
01:21:56,520 --> 01:22:03,840
Usually the answer is I can get through

1964
01:21:59,719 --> 01:22:06,080
tonight. I'm safe enough tonight. And a

1965
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:09,520
gratitude practice can be incredibly

1966
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:12,400
helpful to ground you in like the ways

1967
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:15,040
that you are safe. There are two uh

1968
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:17,520
additional ways of uh doing a gratitude

1969
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:19,280
practice. One is gratitude for safety.

1970
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:21,760
What are the resources available to you

1971
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:24,800
in the here and now that are protecting

1972
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:27,120
you? Sometimes it is a locked door.

1973
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:29,360
Sometimes it is your best friends.

1974
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:31,600
Sometimes it is the meal you ate today.

1975
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:34,400
People with a history of food insecurity

1976
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:36,880
are going to be like, "I ate today. I

1977
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:38,239
ate right before I got in bed because my

1978
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:39,920
stomach will keep me awake if I don't

1979
01:22:38,239 --> 01:22:42,800
have food in my stomach when I go to

1980
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:44,880
bed." Um, so one is gratitude for

1981
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:46,360
safety. What is it that's keeping me

1982
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:48,880
safe? And the other is gratitude for

1983
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:50,639
pleasure. You think about like what

1984
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:52,719
happened during the day. Pleasure is the

1985
01:22:50,639 --> 01:22:57,040
thing your brain only has access to when

1986
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:58,560
you are safe enough. Um, so by tuning,

1987
01:22:57,040 --> 01:23:00,639
first of all, if you're regularly

1988
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:02,560
practicing either one of these, it will

1989
01:23:00,639 --> 01:23:04,560
tune your brain to what are the things

1990
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:06,239
around me that are keeping me safe and

1991
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:08,960
what are the things around me that are

1992
01:23:06,239 --> 01:23:10,880
granting me access to pleasure. Which

1993
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:13,520
means that when you lie down and you're

1994
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:15,760
like, am I safe enough? Does my brain

1995
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:17,920
have access to pleasure? You can dwell

1996
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:19,679
on those things. Here's a really cheesy

1997
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:22,040
recommendations. There's a podcast

1998
01:23:19,679 --> 01:23:26,159
called Nothing Much

1999
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:29,440
Happens Fans. Uh it's narrated by this

2000
01:23:26,159 --> 01:23:30,960
Michigander lesbian. Her little bit of

2001
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:33,199
Midwest accent because I lived in

2002
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:35,199
Indiana for so long. Uh it just like

2003
01:23:33,199 --> 01:23:38,639
feels like home to me. And it's these

2004
01:23:35,199 --> 01:23:40,520
like very quiet. She's a yoga teacher.

2005
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:43,760
She tells stories about

2006
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:46,880
like we went for a muddy walk with the

2007
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:51,520
pets and then we washed the dog's feet

2008
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:55,120
and that's the whole story. Um her goal

2009
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:58,239
so she the goal is to transition you out

2010
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:59,600
of the default mode network which is

2011
01:23:58,239 --> 01:24:00,560
like a bad place to be when you're

2012
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:04,480
trying to fall asleep and you're

2013
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:06,080
stressed out into a task focused mode by

2014
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:08,800
paying attention to the story. There's a

2015
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:10,639
reason why we read children to sleep at

2016
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:13,199
night because it's this like very gentle

2017
01:24:10,639 --> 01:24:15,600
task that their brain can focus on and

2018
01:24:13,199 --> 01:24:18,639
slide into sleep instead of letting it

2019
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:20,719
do its own thing because with the way

2020
01:24:18,639 --> 01:24:23,120
our brains are being stimulated lately,

2021
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:26,159
bad things happen if we let our brains

2022
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:28,080
to their own devices. Does that help? I

2023
01:24:26,159 --> 01:24:30,159
had a student who had this brilliant

2024
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:35,000
trick. She would lie in bed and she

2025
01:24:30,159 --> 01:24:38,360
would imagine a field of stars and she

2026
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:41,600
would make the stars go

2027
01:24:38,360 --> 01:24:44,000
out and before she got all the stars to

2028
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:46,800
go out she would fall asleep. You had

2029
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:48,159
that other student who would when she

2030
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:49,440
couldn't sleep right against it she

2031
01:24:48,159 --> 01:24:51,120
would imagine the times that she was

2032
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:53,679
sitting in class like you know this

2033
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:56,400
happens.

2034
01:24:53,679 --> 01:24:58,400
So she'd imagine that experience. How

2035
01:24:56,400 --> 01:25:00,880
cruel is it that you're sitting in class

2036
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:03,560
and you're like like I want my education

2037
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:06,560
and like your brain is like no

2038
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:08,120
no and when you lie down and ready to go

2039
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:10,120
to bed suddenly you're

2040
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:14,560
[Laughter]

2041
01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:16,639
like so uh this this genius genius idea

2042
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:20,159
of just remember really viscerally and

2043
01:25:16,639 --> 01:25:22,880
vividly what it felt like to fight sleep

2044
01:25:20,159 --> 01:25:24,400
that time that you had to fight sleep.

2045
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:26,560
It works. It's called the ironic

2046
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:28,080
process.

2047
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:29,280
Thank you so much for that. We want to

2048
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:32,000
check and see. I think there's time for

2049
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:33,280
one more question. We have a raffle. Um

2050
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,560
and then we're going to wrap up and I

2051
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:36,560
need to make an amendment. The books

2052
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:38,080
have been pre-signed, so there will not

2053
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:41,199
be a book signing immediately following

2054
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:43,760
our event. I see a hand up. Please go

2055
01:25:41,199 --> 01:25:45,520
right ahead. Two hands.

2056
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:46,639
Um thank you so much. I'm so excited

2057
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:48,480
you're here. I love your book. I've read

2058
01:25:46,639 --> 01:25:50,719
it too many times. But I wanted to ask

2059
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:52,800
you about the Star Trek metaphor, which

2060
01:25:50,719 --> 01:25:54,760
like changed my life. um and like the

2061
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:56,719
unwinable game, but I find that like if

2062
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:58,480
you're Yeah. Yeah. If you're not like

2063
01:25:56,719 --> 01:25:59,679
holding it yet, I can remember the word,

2064
01:25:58,480 --> 01:26:01,920
but if you're not holding it in your

2065
01:25:59,679 --> 01:26:03,120
mind, it's really easy to like to lose

2066
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:05,199
it. You know what I mean? So, I was

2067
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:06,880
wondering if you have like some like

2068
01:26:05,199 --> 01:26:08,560
real world examples of like how to

2069
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:10,719
center yourself when you're like in that

2070
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:12,400
place of like nothing I'm doing is going

2071
01:26:10,719 --> 01:26:14,600
right, everything is wrong and it's all

2072
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:17,120
my fault or whatever. Like how

2073
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:20,560
to just some I guess real world examples

2074
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:24,000
or anecdotes of that.

2075
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:25,280
between that library.

2076
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:28,320
I can't think of any real world

2077
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:30,080
examples. Oh, of like actually doing it

2078
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:32,239
right here. I do think about the

2079
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:34,239
Kobayashi Maru all the time. The

2080
01:26:32,239 --> 01:26:36,239
Kobayashi Maru in Star Trek is part of

2081
01:26:34,239 --> 01:26:37,520
this training at the Starfleet Academy.

2082
01:26:36,239 --> 01:26:39,280
The captains go through this thing

2083
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:41,360
called the Kobayashimi Maru, which is an

2084
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:43,360
unwininnable scenario. And the goal is

2085
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:45,920
not to win the scenario. It's to see how

2086
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:47,880
the captain acts in the event of an

2087
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:51,520
unwinable scenario. How well do you

2088
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:54,159
lose? Right? Um, I think about it all

2089
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:58,080
the time, but I can't think of any real

2090
01:26:54,159 --> 01:27:00,880
life. Oh, okay. You got Yeah. Go. It's

2091
01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:03,760
called death.

2092
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:05,520
We're all going to die. Sorry to be

2093
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:07,360
confronting. I mean, that's why I think

2094
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:08,480
about the Kobe Hashimu all the time. I

2095
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:11,360
didn't feel like that was like a

2096
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:13,840
practical life. Okay.

2097
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:16,239
I mean, unless you have a different kind

2098
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:19,280
of faith belief than I have, like life

2099
01:27:16,239 --> 01:27:20,280
is an unwinable game. It is not you're

2100
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:25,120
not going to

2101
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:28,719
win. So it's about how you lose, how you

2102
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:31,360
play it every day. Um thinking at a

2103
01:27:28,719 --> 01:27:32,800
larger especially so remember when I was

2104
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:35,760
talking about when the stress response

2105
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:37,600
gets activated your thinking shrinks and

2106
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:39,840
narrows down to just like I've got a

2107
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:42,159
hammer which means every problem in

2108
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:43,920
ahead of me is a nail and I'm just going

2109
01:27:42,159 --> 01:27:46,239
to do this one thing and if it doesn't

2110
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:48,239
work I'm just going to do it harder. as

2111
01:27:46,239 --> 01:27:50,080
opposed to when you can step out of the

2112
01:27:48,239 --> 01:27:51,920
when you're not activated in the stress

2113
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:54,560
response cycle, you can be much more

2114
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:57,520
creative and think uh at a much larger

2115
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:59,280
scale to contextualized. So like yeah,

2116
01:27:57,520 --> 01:28:01,120
there's those times when you're like

2117
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:03,120
everything is terrible and going wrong

2118
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:04,880
and there's like the mad woman in your

2119
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:06,840
brain being like and it's all your

2120
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:10,080
fault, you

2121
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:12,560
loser. And like take a step back and be

2122
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:16,880
like this is an unwininnable game. It's

2123
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:19,199
about how I play and like what are your

2124
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:20,880
priorities and values? What are the

2125
01:28:19,199 --> 01:28:23,360
things that matter to you about the way

2126
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:26,000
you navigate this unwinable scenario?

2127
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:28,080
Um, our dad's uh not an awesome human

2128
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:30,400
being. He's a terrible human being. The

2129
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:34,480
one really excellent piece of advice he

2130
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:37,719
gave us was the point of uh education is

2131
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:42,159
to learn how to make them let you

2132
01:28:37,719 --> 01:28:44,639
out. We both have three degrees.

2133
01:28:42,159 --> 01:28:46,639
So like we love school, we are good at

2134
01:28:44,639 --> 01:28:50,080
school. But school is about navigating a

2135
01:28:46,639 --> 01:28:53,199
system in a way to like earn your degree

2136
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:54,800
so that you can jet. Uh so when you are

2137
01:28:53,199 --> 01:28:57,480
confronting problems whether it is in a

2138
01:28:54,800 --> 01:29:00,840
workplace or in a school

2139
01:28:57,480 --> 01:29:03,040
setting, none of this the capitalist

2140
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:05,760
ciseteropatriarchal systems through

2141
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:09,760
which we are all navigating uh are

2142
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:12,800
designed for us to win. It's unwinable.

2143
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:14,639
There's a reason why the character that

2144
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:16,719
we gave the narrative I know I'm talking

2145
01:29:14,639 --> 01:29:20,639
too much too much. There's a reason why

2146
01:29:16,719 --> 01:29:24,080
we gave that narrative of being a Star

2147
01:29:20,639 --> 01:29:29,000
Trek fan and finding meaning in the Star

2148
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:32,840
Trek fandom. Um, that character is a fat

2149
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:35,679
black cisgender woman

2150
01:29:32,840 --> 01:29:37,040
because it's an unwinable game. The odds

2151
01:29:35,679 --> 01:29:38,880
are stacked against you. It's about how

2152
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:40,719
you play. There are composite stories in

2153
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:42,159
the book so that every chapter something

2154
01:29:40,719 --> 01:29:43,600
happens to each of these composite

2155
01:29:42,159 --> 01:29:45,280
characters and you follow a single

2156
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:46,639
individual through each of the things

2157
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:48,000
that's in the chapter. That's what she's

2158
01:29:46,639 --> 01:29:50,000
referring to. Sophie is one of those

2159
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:52,239
characters. And what she does by

2160
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:56,080
following like the meaning that she gets

2161
01:29:52,239 --> 01:29:58,320
from Star Trek is like what matters to

2162
01:29:56,080 --> 01:30:00,159
her in playing this unwinable game is

2163
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:02,800
making sure that the people who come

2164
01:30:00,159 --> 01:30:05,280
behind her don't have to play the same

2165
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:08,560
unwinable game. they play a slightly

2166
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:11,360
easier and more fun winnable game. So

2167
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:14,199
like for me, the people who come behind

2168
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:17,360
me have a slightly more

2169
01:30:14,199 --> 01:30:19,080
fun, more enjoyable, unwinable game to

2170
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:21,440
play like

2171
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:23,440
Tetris, right? Does that make sense?

2172
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:25,040
Does that help at all? It was a long

2173
01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:27,760
answer for it not to be helpful, so I

2174
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:29,440
hope it was. Can we do Well, I know

2175
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:31,040
we're so out of time. We Yeah, we're

2176
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:32,880
running behind, but we just we want to

2177
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:35,920
thank you all so much. This was so

2178
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:37,679
delightful. Thank you Emily and Amelia

2179
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:39,480
and Karen for such a wonderful

2180
01:30:37,679 --> 01:30:42,320
conversation.

2181
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:43,920
Yes. Thank you so much for questioning.

2182
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:45,840
Thank you all for putting on pants

2183
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:48,239
tonight and coming out. We know that's

2184
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:50,239
hard. Hold on because we actually have

2185
01:30:48,239 --> 01:30:54,800
the raffles and so I can't recall how

2186
01:30:50,239 --> 01:30:54,800
many um workbooks do we have? All

2187
01:30:57,080 --> 01:31:04,000
right, Mary

2188
01:30:59,719 --> 01:31:06,320
Prosco. All right. Oh,

2189
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:07,600
can we get a slight bribe? If you get a

2190
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:08,800
workbook, tell us one important thing

2191
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:10,480
you learned. Doesn't have to be the most

2192
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:13,239
important. Just one important thing. Oh

2193
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:15,280
my god.

2194
01:31:13,239 --> 01:31:16,880
Sorry. I wanted to make sure you were

2195
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:19,280
heard.

2196
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:22,800
Oh, I don't know if we need that. Uh,

2197
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:24,480
people. Yeah. Oh, perfect. Uh, that last

2198
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:26,639
question and discussion was incredibly

2199
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:28,560
powerful for me and just I can't wait to

2200
01:31:26,639 --> 01:31:30,560
carry that. We're all going to die.

2201
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:32,400
Yeah. think I would know that already,

2202
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:35,040
but sometimes you need to be reminded.

2203
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:39,159
Thank you. Thank you. Next up is Anna

2204
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:39,159
Cabria. Y

2205
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:45,760
the book is 80,000 words with 26 pages

2206
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:46,960
of references. The workbook is for

2207
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:49,280
people who don't need receipts. They

2208
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:50,880
just want results.

2209
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:52,560
Thank you so much. Something that really

2210
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:55,920
resonates to me was like the difference

2211
01:31:52,560 --> 01:32:00,000
between joy and happiness and happiness

2212
01:31:55,920 --> 01:32:03,440
being the h happenings. So, thank you so

2213
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:05,520
much for that. Thank Britney Cooper.

2214
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:09,159
Yeah, Britney Cooper,

2215
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:09,159
Wendell Coburn.

2216
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:20,400
Uh I I love the unwininnable game and uh

2217
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:23,840
just the reminder that we get like

2218
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:26,320
really small uh hyperfocus when we don't

2219
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:28,719
remember that. Yeah. Uh can we think

2220
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:30,560
about that one for a while? Yeah, thank

2221
01:32:28,719 --> 01:32:33,199
you so much. Thank you for humoring me

2222
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:36,320
with the like wonderful. Oh, absolutely.

2223
01:32:33,199 --> 01:32:39,040
Haley Miller,

2224
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:40,960
it's just like just this is like Oprah

2225
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:44,760
like I don't know what what did you do

2226
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:44,760
this side of the room.

2227
01:32:45,679 --> 01:32:50,560
Um, I think for me the main thing was

2228
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:52,480
just like when you were talking about

2229
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:54,320
how uh you both require different

2230
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:56,800
amounts of sleep, just how we're all

2231
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:58,320
different and I'm like, "Oh yeah, I'm a

2232
01:32:56,800 --> 01:33:00,560
little bit different from like the

2233
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:04,920
average in a lot of different ways and

2234
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:04,920
that's okay." Yes, 100%.

2235
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:11,280
Mary Francis uh

2236
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:18,880
Gadi on the other side of the room.

2237
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:21,440
You're welcome. Thank you so much. Being

2238
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:23,440
on Oprah. I love this. It was actually

2239
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:25,520
the whole even when I listened to the

2240
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:27,679
audio book. I didn't read the book, but

2241
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:31,040
and I liked hearing your voices in the

2242
01:33:27,679 --> 01:33:32,960
audio book. um how often we're stuck in

2243
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:34,639
the stress cycle and not completing it

2244
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:36,080
and not having realized that we didn't

2245
01:33:34,639 --> 01:33:38,320
complete it and that was really

2246
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:41,760
revolutionary for me. So, thanks. Me,

2247
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:44,480
too. Yeah, it was Amelia's thing.

2248
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:47,000
And our last person this evening is Ree

2249
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:49,600
Canoe.

2250
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:52,960
Hey, I had to sit in the second row to

2251
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:56,600
get a book apparently.

2252
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:59,199
Um, importance of sleep.

2253
01:33:56,600 --> 01:34:01,360
Yeah. What a strong way to bring us

2254
01:33:59,199 --> 01:34:03,040
home. Thank you so much again for those

2255
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:04,639
of you all who are here in person and

2256
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:06,800
you would like to enjoy something to

2257
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:09,360
eat. We have dinner for you. To those

2258
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:12,080
who are virtually, thank you so much for

2259
01:34:09,360 --> 01:34:15,520
logging on. This concludes our season

2260
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:18,320
for MIT Reads. Happy finals, happy

2261
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:20,480
studying. We look forward to seeing you

2262
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:22,800
who will be coming back either online or

2263
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:25,280
in person next fall. And thank you all

2264
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:28,480
again for such an amazing Thank you.

2265
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:28,480
Thank you. Thank you.
