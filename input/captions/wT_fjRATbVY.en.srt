1
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,840
my name is Noah Trish and I am going to

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,719
be presenting the first part of the

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,280
primer on

4
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:16,920
using uh Advanced molecular Dynamic

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,800
simulation techniques or MD uh to

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,000
characterize large scale confirmational

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,439
Transitions and

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,720
Transporters that includes both uh

9
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:28,720
confirmational Dynamics uh and also uh

10
00:00:28,759 --> 00:00:34,160
energetics um

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:36,960
so before I get into that say that cells

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,800
are surrounded by membranes membranes

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,559
protect the cell from their external

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:44,000
environment um they're mostly

15
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,960
impermeable to most substances but it is

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,680
necessary for substances to cross the

17
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,879
membrane in order to support the all the

18
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:54,079
functions that happen uh within the cell

19
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:57,480
um and one of the main classes of

20
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:59,199
proteins that facilitate transport of

21
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,879
primarily small molecules across

22
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,040
membranes are

23
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,479
Transporters um

24
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:07,880
Transporters uh the substances that

25
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:11,400
Transporters transport are called their

26
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:13,479
substrate um and they at a fundamental

27
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,439
level operate through the alternating

28
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:17,080
access

29
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:19,799
mechanism um in the alternating access

30
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:22,040
mechanism Transporters go uh the

31
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:23,439
accessibility of bound substrate is

32
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,799
accessible from only one side of the

33
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:29,280
membrane at a time um Transporters

34
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:32,759
undergo transitions from inward facing

35
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:36,000
or high F states to outward facing or o

36
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:39,479
States Transporters can be bound which

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,799
is this subscript b or APO which means

38
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:44,240
nothing is bound to them is this

39
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:46,479
subscript a and it can also be partially

40
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:50,560
bound um in between these

41
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:52,360
two um because of their Central role in

42
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,520
cellular function transporter

43
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:57,960
malfunction is often associated with

44
00:01:54,520 --> 00:02:00,799
disease and they also are common uh

45
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:03,039
targets of pharmaceutical drugs

46
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,960
the Transporters are very diverse uh set

47
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:08,200
of proteins they realize the alternating

48
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,239
access mechanism varies widely from

49
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:14,879
transporter to transporter this

50
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:18,120
schematic is uh showing uh most of the

51
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:20,040
common classes of realizations of the uh

52
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,920
an alternating access

53
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,000
mechanism

54
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,959
um it's not important to know the exact

55
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,920
details of each of these mechanisms

56
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,440
right now we'll introduce uh more about

57
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,080
the details later on when they become

58
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:37,160
more important um but what I will say is

59
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,480
that uh common feature of all these

60
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:42,159
different uh transport mechanisms is the

61
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,800
involvement of large scale structural

62
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:46,599
changes um in order to switch this

63
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,680
substrate accessibility from one side of

64
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:50,200
the membrane to another There is almost

65
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,760
always some sort of large- scale

66
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:58,599
structural change and uh this is what we

67
00:02:52,760 --> 00:03:00,680
want to uh probe understand uh with the

68
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:02,800
uh approach that I'm going to that we're

69
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:05,840
going to be talking about uh the

70
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,040
particular technique that we use to uh

71
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,640
look into this is called molecular

72
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:13,080
Dynamics

73
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:17,519
simulations um or

74
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:20,680
MD uh within a molecular Dynamics

75
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,840
simulation it's a physics based approach

76
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,680
where you first Define a potential

77
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,120
energy function which we call a force

78
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:30,000
field there are various terms within the

79
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,599
force field that represent uh as meant

80
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,120
to empirically represent the

81
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:38,640
interactions between bonded sets of

82
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:43,280
atoms and non-bonded sets of atoms um

83
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:44,799
and uh the idea is to represent all the

84
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,040
interactions between all the atoms

85
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:50,200
within the system uh with all these

86
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,959
interaction all these interactions

87
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:55,720
defined uh we can determine all the

88
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:58,760
forces that uh are exerted on all the

89
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:01,120
atoms in the system and then uh

90
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,920
iteratively numeric ly integrate uh

91
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,799
Newton's equations of motion to

92
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:07,480
determine how the positions of the atoms

93
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:11,840
change as a function of

94
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:14,400
time um these Atomic Dynamics

95
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,400
collectively give rise to molecular

96
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,799
Dynamics uh you can end up with

97
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:22,479
simulations uh that visually look

98
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:22,479
something like

99
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,639
this

100
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:29,479
[Music]

101
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,639
um MD simulations have been around for a

102
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:35,280
long long time they've been maturing

103
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:37,479
over time uh and it's been there's lots

104
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:42,000
of examples out there of them having

105
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:45,280
success in predicting and capturing uh

106
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,960
what the Dynamics of molecules look like

107
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,880
um but uh they also have their own

108
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,479
limitations and the most important

109
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,960
limitation for the purposes of this

110
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:56,160
presentation is the time skills that are

111
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,680
accessible to molecular Dynamics

112
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,759
simulations um as algorithms have

113
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,199
improved and especially as Hardware has

114
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:06,479
improved uh longer and longer time

115
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,880
scales are accessible to MD simulations

116
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:13,120
nowadays it's pretty common place to uh

117
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:14,440
find MD simulations uh that run for uh

118
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,880
on the order of

119
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:21,759
microseconds but um this still is not

120
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:23,680
long enough to capture in in general uh

121
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,360
the spontaneous transition of

122
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,840
Transporters between inward facing and

123
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,960
outward facing

124
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:32,919
States um these uh transitions can take

125
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,400
usually on the order of milliseconds

126
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:36,440
they can also last all the way up to

127
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:40,199
minutes and this is just not something

128
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:41,360
that uh we can access with uh vanilla

129
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:44,360
and

130
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:47,360
these and so with this problem in mind

131
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:51,759
uh in the lab ofad PID where I'm

132
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:54,240
currently a postto um we there was a

133
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,039
method that was developed that put

134
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,000
together um a series of advanced

135
00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:01,680
molecular Dynamic simulation

136
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:05,120
techniques uh in order to specifically

137
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,680
probe uh the confirmational Dynamics of

138
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,440
these large scale transitions within

139
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,000
Transporters within the modou cores lab

140
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:14,280
there was a method developed to tackle

141
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,840
this composed of multiple Advanced

142
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:19,919
molecular Dynamics simulation

143
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:21,039
techniques um we're going to go in the

144
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,319
rest of the primer we're going to go

145
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,560
through each of these steps in more

146
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,520
detail uh right now I'll say the overall

147
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,880
approach um just to give an overview uh

148
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,000
within this approach we start by

149
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,800
identifying structures that represent

150
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,080
the end States of uh the transition of

151
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,639
Interest usually representing an inward

152
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,759
facing and an outward facing State we

153
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,800
Define uh Collective variables which are

154
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:45,919
mathematical mathematical descriptions

155
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:48,280
of reaction coordinates uh that capture

156
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,479
are meant to capture the all of the

157
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,160
major structural differences between uh

158
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,319
the two states of

159
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,080
interest uh using these Collective

160
00:06:54,319 --> 00:07:00,120
variable definitions we run a series of

161
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:02,360
driven MD simulations uh to explore

162
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,560
different pathways through uh the

163
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:07,400
collective variable

164
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,520
space uh after we've identified a

165
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:14,360
sufficiently optimal transition pathway

166
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:15,840
uh we can uh relax it structurally uh

167
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:19,840
using a technique called the string

168
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:24,720
method with SWS of trajectories or

169
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:26,680
smws um then uh we to enhance sampling

170
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,080
along the transition pathway we run a

171
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,759
simulation called bias exchange umbrella

172
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:33,000
sampling or

173
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:35,879
be uh and then finally from that

174
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,160
simulation we can extract a free energy

175
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:40,039
profile using techniques like the

176
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,680
weighted histogram analysis method or

177
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:45,080
Wham or the multi-state vet acceptance

178
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:47,840
ratio M

179
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:49,520
Bar um so before I start talking about

180
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,400
those steps in more detail I just want

181
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,639
to say a little bit of little something

182
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:57,680
about where this uh technique comes from

183
00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:00,680
it was developed by Mahmud Madi and Imad

184
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:05,240
Tash kid when uh off mood was a postto

185
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:08,039
in a mods lab um this approach draws on

186
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:11,120
previously wellestablished techniques

187
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:14,520
within the MD field uh namely driven MD

188
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:18,840
string method umbrella sampling and Wham

189
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:21,599
um and then it develops them further and

190
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:23,120
uh targets them towards specifically

191
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,479
understanding uh these large scale

192
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,360
structural Transitions and

193
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:31,560
Transporters um I'll also say that this

194
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:34,519
approach is imp imped in using the MD

195
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:37,320
engine namd uh and also makes heavy use

196
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:39,360
of the collective variables module which

197
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,919
is uh externally

198
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,440
developed um namd was originally

199
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,279
developed in CL schuon's lab uh but

200
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,800
since he passed away it's continued to

201
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:49,880
be developed in aad Tash Cori's lab so

202
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,080
there's always been a close

203
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:54,399
collaboration between uh the research

204
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,240
scientists in these Labs uh which we've

205
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:59,880
always shared lab space um and the devel

206
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:02,200
developers of Nami which is also uh

207
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:04,000
contributed to the development of this

208
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:06,399
uh method

209
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,959
overall okay so with that I'll start

210
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,279
going into each of these steps in a

211
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:13,160
little bit more detail starting with

212
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:14,760
identifying the uh start and end states

213
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:18,200
of the transition of

214
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:20,399
interest um so transport Cycles in

215
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:23,399
general are composed of a series of

216
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,240
transitions U between major functional

217
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:27,720
States like uh the inward facing and

218
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,519
outward facing State generally we're

219
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:32,040
interested in these types of transitions

220
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:35,200
you can also uh generalize the approach

221
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:37,560
a little bit to apply it to uh binding

222
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:41,079
and unbinding events uh sometimes

223
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:42,880
there's also um a transiently stable

224
00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:44,959
intermediate State that's relevant for a

225
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,360
particular transporter and you can look

226
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,680
at uh transitions between these major

227
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,839
States and that uh intermediate as

228
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,920
well um so first you have to pick which

229
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:56,839
transition you want to look at um once

230
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:59,640
you've done that you need structures to

231
00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:03,200
represent uh both of the end States of

232
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:05,760
transition of interest uh the best uh

233
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,720
source for structures is our high

234
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,760
resolution structures that come from

235
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:12,880
experimental techniques like x-ray

236
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:15,360
crystallography or cryoem uh but it's

237
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,079
also an option to use modeling uh

238
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,320
techniques from a variety of sources

239
00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:21,279
like alphafold standard topology

240
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,440
modeling and also or specialized

241
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:26,200
modeling that are specific uh to

242
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:30,040
Transporters I'm also I will also say at

243
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:32,880
this point that in order to uh do the

244
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:35,519
advanced MD simulations we also need to

245
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:40,000
build an MD simulation system that

246
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:42,920
includes uh the protein lipids water

247
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,519
ions uh and everything that want to

248
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:47,160
include within the system um there are

249
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,480
standard tools within the field for

250
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:52,399
doing this uh charm GUI is particularly

251
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:55,920
popular for uh preparing uh simulation

252
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:59,560
systems for M uh MD simulations of

253
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:02,320
membrane uh proteins like transporters

254
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:08,040
and then sometimes there are

255
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:11,560
also uh there are very um established uh

256
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:14,720
parameters for standard amino acid

257
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:17,240
residues nucleic acid bases lipids water

258
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,079
ions but small molecules are much more

259
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,880
diverse and so if you want to look at

260
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:25,040
transitions involving uh substrates or

261
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:27,399
bound Inhibitors that might be drugs

262
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,560
then uh you will need to generate

263
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:31,560
generally need to generate parameters uh

264
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:34,200
for those and there are standardized

265
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:37,720
tools to do that as

266
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:39,160
well okay next step is defining

267
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,920
Collective

268
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,320
variables um Collective variables as I

269
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,880
said before are mathematical

270
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,240
descriptions of reaction coordinates uh

271
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:50,040
these Collective variables that you

272
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:52,560
defined are meant to uh fully capture

273
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:55,279
the major structural differences between

274
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:58,600
uh end states of your transition of

275
00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:02,680
interest um this example which is coming

276
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:05,600
from the paper that uh established the

277
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:08,800
approach uh you have uh Collective

278
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,519
variables representing the angles uh

279
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,839
between major protein domains like the

280
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,800
red and the blue domains and two

281
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:18,160
different uh viewpoints and also the

282
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,800
yellow and green domains and then a

283
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,639
distance as well between these yellow

284
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:24,120
and green domain there are many

285
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,720
different uh kinds of collective

286
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:29,000
variables that are defined within the

287
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,959
collective variable module used by namd

288
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,519
um

289
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:35,279
and I want to say a little bit of

290
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:38,440
something about two of the most common

291
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:41,279
ones first distance distance is very

292
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:43,360
simple it measures distance between the

293
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:45,920
centers of mass of two selections of

294
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,000
atoms so in this example Center of mass

295
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,320
of this green domain and the yellow

296
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,760
domain uh you can either use the full

297
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,480
distance it's also common to project the

298
00:12:52,760 --> 00:13:00,320
distance along a particular user

299
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:02,880
specified um U axis of uh of

300
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,880
interest um and then orientation is the

301
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:08,240
second common Collective variable that I

302
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:11,079
want to comment on um there is

303
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:15,240
established theory that says that uh

304
00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:17,480
when a any kind of rigid body moves

305
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:20,680
throughout space tumbles in any kind of

306
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:22,160
way um at the beginning if you have um I

307
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:24,320
think the reference at the beginning of

308
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:27,519
that tumbling motion at and at the end

309
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:30,600
of that tumbling motion you superpose

310
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:34,720
the uh centers of mass of the rigid

311
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:38,240
bodies you can find and calculate a

312
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:40,320
rotation about a particular uh amount of

313
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,360
rotation about a particular rotation

314
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:47,360
axis that passes through the center of

315
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:51,160
mass of that rigid body um and this idea

316
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:54,600
of having particular uh rotation a axis

317
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:56,560
and rotation amount um allows you

318
00:13:54,600 --> 00:14:00,560
relative to reference coordinates allows

319
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:05,120
you to represent any General orientation

320
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:06,600
of a collection of atoms in a protein um

321
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,120
throughout your

322
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:11,240
simulation

323
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:13,000
um I will also say because it comes up

324
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:16,639
in literature and also in our

325
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:19,680
presentations that um the collective

326
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:22,079
variables module represents orientation

327
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:25,519
using a quaternion format that looks

328
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:28,320
like this uh there's nothing special

329
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:30,519
about this representation scientifically

330
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,040
it has some convenient mathematical and

331
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:36,040
computational properties which is why

332
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:37,639
it's used um but and it's also not

333
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,920
exactly straightforward to understand

334
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:41,959
what's going on uh from a human

335
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,360
perspective in this format so usually

336
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:46,839
people will convert it to something that

337
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:49,160
makes more sense in the physical world

338
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:52,320
like in this example angles between

339
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:52,320
these uh individual

340
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:59,800
dos okay next is step of running driven

341
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:02,959
MD simulations

342
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:05,880
um the way that this works U from the

343
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:08,720
perspective of MD you go back you to the

344
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:12,040
original formulation you still have the

345
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:15,959
same uh potential energy force field um

346
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:19,639
and then when you want to add biases you

347
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:21,480
end up adding uh an extra biasing term

348
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:24,600
uh to your total potential energy

349
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:27,800
function for Collective variables that

350
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:30,279
are scalar uh this takes the form of a

351
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:32,519
harmonic uh

352
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:35,319
and for quaternion the situation is a

353
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:37,160
little bit different um and then once

354
00:15:35,319 --> 00:15:39,240
you have this definition of the

355
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:41,240
collective variables and of the harmonic

356
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:44,319
uh restraint you go through the same

357
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:47,480
steps of calculating the gradient of the

358
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:50,720
total potential energy function forces

359
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:54,480
then uh iteratively

360
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:57,600
demeric um for static restraints you can

361
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,519
have a moving Target which is this uh Z

362
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:03,639
not of I

363
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:07,360
um uh but for driven MD simulations this

364
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:09,279
target value moves as a function of time

365
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,399
and so you have a moving harmonic

366
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:14,040
restraint and with the uh by applying

367
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:17,800
movement to these harmonic restraints

368
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:21,480
you can induce uh processes to happen uh

369
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:24,639
at time scales that are quicker than uh

370
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,639
they happen in nature

371
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:30,720
oops uh so I'd like to say that the

372
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,639
process of defining Collective variables

373
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,079
and running these driven MD simulations

374
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:37,480
is inherently

375
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:39,240
iterative um there are a lot of uh

376
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,480
considerations and options that you have

377
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,920
when you're defining Collective

378
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,360
variables and also biasing protocols um

379
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,680
you have to choose your Collective

380
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,600
variables carefully like I said there

381
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,600
are a lot of them that are defined in

382
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,240
the

383
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:55,279
module uh you have to make choices about

384
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:58,600
which atoms to add to your Collective

385
00:16:55,279 --> 00:17:02,199
variables for example you could uh do

386
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:04,839
the oh one sec um you can select the

387
00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:07,559
entire uh domain here or you might want

388
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:10,520
to exclude certain Hees there as

389
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:11,919
well could you uh describe just

390
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:15,360
basically what's happening in the

391
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:18,880
animation in terms of driving a

392
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:21,480
transition yeah so uh there are two

393
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:24,480
Collective variables defined here which

394
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:27,280
are changing this orientation drawn it

395
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:30,160
schematically on left uh changing the

396
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:32,240
orientation of the trans for of the uh

397
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:36,480
this blue domain relative to the purple

398
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:39,799
domain then also inducing a a drive um

399
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:42,280
in changing the center of mass uh it's

400
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:43,480
depicted schematically as uh straight up

401
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,480
and down it's a little bit more

402
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:47,559
complicated in three dimensions but

403
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:54,039
those are the two things that are being

404
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:54,039
driven in order to uh create this movie

405
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:06,799
uh could you further uh elaborate how do

406
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:09,120
you make the decision like which part of

407
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,559
the transporter to use for Collective

408
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,520
variable and like which Collective

409
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:16,039
variable to use like how do you make

410
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:19,000
this position yeah so that that's

411
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:21,360
um that comes with experience is what I

412
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,679
would say U we say in general that it's

413
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:27,880
an empirical definition um and uh this

414
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:30,799
is also where this iterative process of

415
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:32,440
trying so you have an idea of what start

416
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:35,039
and end looks like you want to get from

417
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:37,720
point A to point B um and you want to do

418
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:40,000
it in a way that's um not perturbing the

419
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,520
system in an unnatural way these are

420
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,320
these uh criteria that I'm looking I'm

421
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:46,000
listing over here you don't want the

422
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,200
protein to unfold you don't want water

423
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,919
pores to form you don't want membrane

424
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:53,360
deformations to happen you want the

425
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:57,480
final state to match the end State and

426
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:59,440
so um you when you're starting out you

427
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,080
sort of draw from the literature

428
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,200
uh when you have more experience you

429
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:06,200
draw from your own experience to say uh

430
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:10,039
which Collective variables to choose and

431
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:13,280
how to uh combine them to

432
00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:15,200
uh to induce what you want to

433
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,440
induce last thing I wanted to say on

434
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:22,520
this slide was a lot of these options

435
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:25,840
are straightforward to um see if there's

436
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:29,919
an issue and uh iteratively refine what

437
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:32,080
you're doing um the only one uh based on

438
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:35,400
uh analysis of the the trajectory that

439
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:37,600
you get up get out at the end the one

440
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:40,799
that is not so

441
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,600
straightforward um is choosing a path uh

442
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:45,200
to take through the collective variable

443
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:47,360
space and so to explain why that is I

444
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:51,960
think it's helpful to switch to an

445
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:54,320
analogy um what we're doing here uh in

446
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:57,320
especially in the later parts of of the

447
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:59,200
overall uh approach is trying to find an

448
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,960
optimal pathway

449
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,840
uh through a rugged mountainous

450
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,120
landscape the mountains representing are

451
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:08,640
representing uh barriers within the free

452
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,640
energy surface

453
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:14,039
um and uh sort of north south east west

454
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,960
is representing uh the collective

455
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:20,400
variables that you chosen um uh to

456
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:22,679
represent the uh the differences between

457
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,679
the inward facing and the outward facing

458
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:25,679
States

459
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:32,559
um starting from

460
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:34,039
an initial uh or a a direct drive from

461
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:37,400
the inward facing state to the outward

462
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:39,600
facing state it could be the case that

463
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:41,440
uh this is pretty close to the optimal

464
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:44,559
pathway uh for this particular

465
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:47,919
transporter but you don't know that and

466
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:52,200
uh the next step in this uh uh protocol

467
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:56,080
string method is um a local structural

468
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:58,039
refinement uh algorithm and so if it's

469
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,799
if the direct drive is close to the

470
00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:01,960
optimal path pathway the string method

471
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:04,880
will turn out a relaxed pathway that's

472
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:06,320
close to that optimal pathway um but you

473
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,080
could be in a situation with your

474
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,679
transporter where this uh direct drive

475
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:13,240
from the inward facing to outward facing

476
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:15,760
state is kind of pushing you right over

477
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:18,440
the top of a mountain a really high free

478
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:21,679
energy barrier the string method will

479
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:25,039
still uh relax this pathway for you but

480
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:26,760
it uh will not be uh close to the

481
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:30,039
optimal pathway through this Collective

482
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:34,480
variable space and so So within the

483
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:36,760
traditional uh method the way that we um

484
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:40,520
approach this is we run a lot of driven

485
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:43,360
MD simulations to uh cover a lot of the

486
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:46,080
important Collective variable space and

487
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:48,440
we evaluate these different Pathways for

488
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,200
uh their degree of optimality to

489
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,600
identify which pathway we want to

490
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,720
proceed forward uh with relaxation with

491
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,960
the string

492
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:59,799
method um the way that we evaluate

493
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:02,880
optimality of Pathways um with driven MD

494
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:06,080
simulations is using work profiles that

495
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:08,679
look like this work being um a measure

496
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:11,440
of how difficult it is to induce

497
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:14,279
transitions along the particular chosen

498
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,720
Pathways um and this is showing the

499
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:18,919
example that I showed previously uh from

500
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:22,440
the paper that established uh this

501
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:24,159
approach overall um and in

502
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:28,320
this

503
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:30,840
uh um approach oh the question yeah are

504
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,200
these work profiles a kinetic barrier or

505
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:34,240
are they

506
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:36,679
energetic

507
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:40,400
thermodynamic

508
00:22:36,679 --> 00:22:42,520
work like if there's a a a steep hill

509
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,480
that prevents things from going down One

510
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:47,679
path even though it's the lowest energy

511
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:52,159
path will that will that kinetic barrier

512
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,159
still uh cause a lot of work in

513
00:22:52,640 --> 00:23:00,440
this it's thermodynamic

514
00:22:56,279 --> 00:23:00,440
okay um okay so in this

515
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:04,480
example

516
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:08,760
uh the different Pathways that were

517
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:10,919
chosen were uh corresponding to driving

518
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:12,200
changes in different Collective

519
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:15,039
variables for this particular

520
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:20,360
transporter in different orders

521
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:22,120
um uh it's important that these uh work

522
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:24,960
profiles represent averages over

523
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:27,120
multiple MD simulations um because work

524
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,600
values can vary significantly based on

525
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,120
what's happening within the environment

526
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:35,200
of the M

527
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:37,039
simulation um and so uh by exploring

528
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,320
different Pathways we're able to look at

529
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:44,200
these work profiles and identify um a

530
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:46,880
pathway uh which is uh the most optimal

531
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:50,559
um that you can find in the the end of

532
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:52,080
the day and uh for this example uh this

533
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:54,159
particular order of changes in

534
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,520
Collective variables were the one that

535
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:59,240
uh require the least amount of work and

536
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:03,039
was selected for um additional

537
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:05,320
refinement um with string method and so

538
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:07,799
with that I'm G to pass it over to ashon

539
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:11,000
who's going to talk about the second the

540
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:14,520
uh next steps also talk about uh

541
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,440
comparisons to other methods um uh that

542
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:19,720
are exist within the field and also

543
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:22,080
generalizations of um and uh

544
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:24,240
perspectives on the overall approach

545
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:27,880
thank you so much uh thanks Noah for

546
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:30,120
your excellent talk my name is Ash and

547
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:33,559
I'm a post stock at theoretical and

548
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:35,880
computational biophysics group bman

549
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:39,399
Institute University of Illinois and I'm

550
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:41,480
also a visiting scholar at University of

551
00:24:39,399 --> 00:24:44,640
arkans I'm going to talk about the

552
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:47,720
second second part of our strategy to

553
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,760
study confirmational transition mainly

554
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:52,640
focus

555
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:55,679
on um string method and the path

556
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,760
sampling part string method and free

557
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:59,200
energy

558
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:01,520
calculations uh I will a little bit into

559
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,720
the details technical details of this

560
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:06,760
approach and also try to bring up some

561
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:09,000
alternative ones and uh talk about my

562
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:12,760
own

563
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:15,159
perspective uh proteins are uh

564
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:18,159
confirmation hetrogeneous if you want to

565
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:20,720
Define design a drug for them you have

566
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:25,320
to consider it and their confirmational

567
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:28,559
space is very complex uh there are many

568
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:32,000
uh midle stable St States local call

569
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:35,520
Minima and go from one state let's say

570
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:38,880
this state to this state we uh need to

571
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:41,399
consider different pathway and uh a

572
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:45,120
great tool here is molecular dyamic as

573
00:25:41,399 --> 00:25:47,080
Noah mentioned molecular Dynamic has uh

574
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:50,200
uh time scale

575
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:52,480
problem and uh what is known as sampling

576
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:56,200
problem to resolve that sampling problem

577
00:25:52,480 --> 00:26:00,159
we use statistical physics based

578
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:02,399
approaches uh I saw of divide these two

579
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:05,919
techniques to two different

580
00:26:02,399 --> 00:26:08,200
categor uh let's imagine that this is uh

581
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:12,000
the projection of the

582
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:15,159
previous the confirmational landscape on

583
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,919
uh one uh Dimension this is the reaction

584
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:20,200
coordinate our pathway and this is the

585
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:22,720
free enery our system is fluctuating

586
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:26,120
here we want to go from here to here

587
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:28,520
this free energy is not known priority

588
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,399
and we are trying to reconstruct this

589
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:32,200
one in

590
00:26:29,399 --> 00:26:34,720
our uh as I mentioned there are

591
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:37,640
technically two different

592
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:39,440
strategy uh first one are the one that

593
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:42,720
they use

594
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:46,520
force uh potential force or potential

595
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:48,919
external force of potential to uh bu a

596
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:50,840
sample and these are the one that we use

597
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:53,240
and I will talk about them in the next

598
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:57,080
couple of slid there are other methods

599
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:59,440
that are uh basically try to uh disturb

600
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:03,360
our sampling Direct I call them

601
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:06,320
statistically bios for in or sometimes

602
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:08,919
people call them adaptively uh sampling

603
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:11,279
method it's like uh let's imagine we

604
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:13,679
have we run several different

605
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:16,360
simulations here some of them they move

606
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:18,880
to the a little bit different State uh

607
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:22,480
with some approach we duplicate the one

608
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:24,480
that they are able to pass and kill the

609
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,039
other ones and repeat this approach

610
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,960
until we go to the

611
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:31,000
other each one of these approach has

612
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,799
their own advantage and

613
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:37,480
disadvantage uh here and the main

614
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:40,120
problem as you guess is using force uh

615
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:44,120
makes our system to go to the states

616
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:48,039
that are not natural to our system

617
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:51,360
uh but we prefer these these set of

618
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:54,000
approaches because uh they increase our

619
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:58,279
chance to go to the others exponential

620
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:02,080
because we use force or uh potential so

621
00:27:58,279 --> 00:28:06,519
of the example for uh these set of uh

622
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:09,320
methods are steered MD uh or targeted MD

623
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:12,360
these are group of I group them in a

624
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:17,640
non-equilibrium work the deren MD that

625
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:20,559
Noah was talking about is in this Set uh

626
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:23,320
here let's say that we push our system

627
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:25,120
with some Force go to the others we

628
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:28,360
calculate the amount of work the work

629
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:31,840
that Noah was showing in in his part and

630
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:34,320
convert that work to free energy uh this

631
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:37,559
approach is not very common these days

632
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:39,440
for calculating the free energy uh

633
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:41,799
because to get something accurate we

634
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:45,120
need to do several different

635
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:48,039
simulations another class of method is

636
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:50,399
uh the gradient based me the one that an

637
00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:53,840
example of them is adaptive biasing

638
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:54,720
force uh let's say that uh We've be in

639
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,880
this

640
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:00,919
space our simulation is here our system

641
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:05,519
is here uh we calculate the force that

642
00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:09,240
is um experiencing by our system

643
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:11,720
um export exactly opposite force on our

644
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:15,840
system and push it a little bit forward

645
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:17,279
and then uh we convert this Force to uh

646
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:20,640
derivative of

647
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:23,279
freeer and taking the uh integral from

648
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:26,279
that derivative we get the free energy

649
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:29,360
another class is histogram basement

650
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:32,000
umbrella sampling and metod Dynamics are

651
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:34,960
two example of this class umbrella

652
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:39,080
sampling is the one that we use in our

653
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:42,480
uh uh sampling in our confirmational

654
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:45,279
transition uh technique uh it is

655
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:48,679
basically works by restraining our

656
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:51,880
simulation to different region um making

657
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:54,240
sure that we are sampling all the this

658
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:56,880
difference barriers and then combining

659
00:29:54,240 --> 00:30:00,000
all of them together to get the fre

660
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:05,440
another popular method is metod dnamic

661
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:08,720
um metad dnamic is working by adding uh

662
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:11,720
small external potential to our system

663
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:13,799
usually in form of gaan bringing our

664
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:16,200
system up to pass the barrier and go to

665
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:19,279
the others and then inversing that

666
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:22,799
potential to get the free energy I have

667
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:25,039
used meod dnamic during my PhD a lot uh

668
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:27,240
it's a very good approach but the main

669
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:29,559
problem with metod dnamic is when we

670
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:32,519
have a lot of Collective variables is

671
00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:36,200
very slow and this is the case for

672
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:36,200
studying uh meming

673
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:42,440
transport uh yes uh can you comment on

674
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,919
what type of sampling methods are

675
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:46,880
suitable for different types of protein

676
00:30:44,919 --> 00:30:49,279
I understand that the topic here today

677
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:51,000
is the transmembrane protein but then

678
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:53,399
there are disordered proteins there are

679
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,480
more folded proteins do you recommend

680
00:30:53,399 --> 00:30:57,600
different type of sampling for different

681
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:00,480
types of protein yes it it really

682
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:06,039
depends on your system and accuracy that

683
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:08,960
you want uh I generally suggest uh the

684
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:12,080
first two for small system like DNA

685
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:14,639
peptide and that kind of but for larger

686
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:17,720
systems I recommend umbrella sampling

687
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:20,080
and metod dnamic even for metod dnamic I

688
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:23,440
I think uh it's not generally a good

689
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:27,159
approach because it uh for large system

690
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:30,440
you need uh to consider a a large number

691
00:31:27,159 --> 00:31:34,200
of collective Vari Ables and it makes uh

692
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:34,200
your computation pretty

693
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:44,200
slow uh sorry uh so as Noah mentioned

694
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:47,840
our uh strategy is to combine these

695
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:52,080
biing sampling methods with pth sampling

696
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:56,399
Al and uh the reason behind that is uh

697
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:58,559
probably can see better here in this um

698
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:01,720
uh toy model this is a

699
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:04,799
from potential a 2d

700
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:07,880
potential uh let's uh assume that this

701
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:10,440
is the uh the free energy that we don't

702
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:13,440
know and it's related to that uh system

703
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:16,200
I showed in the first slide uh we can

704
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:18,679
try to sample the whole area the red

705
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:21,480
area is correspond to high energy

706
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:23,519
barriers the blue one is the low energy

707
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:26,360
barriers we can try to sample the whole

708
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:28,639
area or we can focus on some important

709
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:32,760
part and the interesting part the

710
00:32:28,639 --> 00:32:36,519
transition go from here to here and uh

711
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:41,360
this is the procedure this is known as P

712
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:44,960
sampling um pass sampling

713
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:48,039
um as Noah mention we generally use der

714
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:52,559
MD to go from one state to other state

715
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:56,639
and then uh to try to refine that path

716
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:59,880
we cannot generally generate many paths

717
00:32:56,639 --> 00:33:01,880
sometimes we do have to but um our

718
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:04,519
approach is to focus on the most

719
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:07,519
important the one that we think are more

720
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:11,159
important for our case

721
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:14,360
uh to refine or relax that path we use a

722
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:17,919
technique called string method uh string

723
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:20,760
method uh like other past sampling

724
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:24,159
algorithm has routine transition p

725
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:29,159
through it was introduced around 20

726
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:34,039
years ago and it works by um

727
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:38,000
uh discretizing an initial path who uh

728
00:33:34,039 --> 00:33:41,279
set of let's say images that are full

729
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,440
copy of our system these images that are

730
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:46,240
in equal distance from each

731
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:48,159
other and we can identify them with a

732
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,440
set of collective variables let's say

733
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:52,320
these are our Collective variables and

734
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:55,559
uh they are related to our each one of

735
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:58,840
our system then we refine this path in

736
00:33:55,559 --> 00:34:02,159
iterative manner According to some rules

737
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:05,279
until we end up with something convert

738
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:09,159
and the main rule here is that we assume

739
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:11,079
our systems are evolving according to

740
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:15,960
this over damp

741
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:18,639
langine uh equation that has diffusion

742
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:21,240
and also free energy diffusion and

743
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:25,399
free

744
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:28,119
uh uh we want the final pass

745
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:31,280
um we want to end up with a pass pass

746
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:33,599
that doesn't have any drift at the end

747
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:38,320
except along the path if our system if

748
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:41,800
we start the system um somewhere here um

749
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:44,200
our system only can evolve along the

750
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:47,879
pass it doesn't move orthogonal to these

751
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:50,440
paths and this is called Zero D path a

752
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:53,440
string method tries to identify these

753
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:57,960
paths it's not necessarily the minimum

754
00:34:53,440 --> 00:35:00,440
free energy path that um we are ultimate

755
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:02,839
looking for it or the most popular path

756
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:05,240
that our system are going to take it's

757
00:35:02,839 --> 00:35:07,880
just uh a path that we think it's

758
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:10,160
important for us there are different

759
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:12,560
version of a string method zero

760
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:15,640
temperature string method was uh the

761
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,960
first one it was not considering the uh

762
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:20,119
temperature and

763
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:22,640
entropy uh then final temperature uh

764
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:25,760
string method came up the one that we

765
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:28,920
use is string method with swarms of

766
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:32,839
trajectory and it works by by

767
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:36,200
um assigning T tens of copy to each

768
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:39,400
image each copy of our system each

769
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:43,280
system that we have

770
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:46,760
um the algorithm conceptually is simple

771
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:50,520
it's like uh we disc criticize this

772
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:55,240
path uh then we

773
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:58,280
um um assign copies to it uh restrain

774
00:35:55,240 --> 00:36:03,000
those copies to be close to the images

775
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:04,920
then uh release uh um our system to move

776
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,880
a little bit in a short time let's say

777
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:08,839
they for this image they move here for

778
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:11,160
the other one they move here calculate

779
00:36:08,839 --> 00:36:14,640
the average distance move them to the

780
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:16,760
new places and then next step is to make

781
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:19,400
sure that they have equal distance from

782
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:22,359
each other this is particularly

783
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:23,920
important because close to the minimum

784
00:36:22,359 --> 00:36:27,000
they tend to get very close to each

785
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:29,520
other otherwise uh everything goes

786
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,480
inside to that minimum so we keep the

787
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:35,000
distances equal from each other and we

788
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:38,680
repeat this procedure until we

789
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:41,200
converge this animation shows uh how the

790
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:44,240
string method works the pass the initial

791
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:47,000
pass was starting from here and it is

792
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:48,880
getting uh converged to this new pass

793
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,400
after some number of

794
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:54,200
iterations the important thing here is

795
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:56,680
that our string method the passes that

796
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:58,200
we get from string method are not unique

797
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:01,319
and they are really depend on the

798
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:04,280
parameters that we use for our uh

799
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:08,880
approach for instance if we go with a

800
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:10,839
short number of images um we end up with

801
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:14,560
a pass like this let's say the initial

802
00:37:10,839 --> 00:37:17,400
pass was from here to here and if I go

803
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:21,040
with only five images I lose a lot of

804
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:24,119
information for uh my calculation this

805
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:26,200
example is for 20 the the path seems to

806
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:29,160
be reasonable if I increase the number

807
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:31,440
of images to something very large uh I

808
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:34,880
end up with that pass that has a lot of

809
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:38,680
inks and loops and it's not a real pass

810
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:42,040
for or another problem here is that uh

811
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:46,800
if I start with the initial pass that is

812
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:52,079
um just um from here to here I I cannot

813
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:55,000
sample and go here my pass is just uh a

814
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:58,400
refin pass locally and this happens a

815
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,960
lot in our cases because particularly

816
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:03,440
when we work with experimental people

817
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:06,319
they come up and give us some structure

818
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:08,480
some endpoint structure they say okay

819
00:38:06,319 --> 00:38:11,000
this is your structure here and they

820
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:13,240
gave us this structure after a little

821
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,359
bit they come and say that okay the the

822
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:18,680
actual structure was this one so we need

823
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:21,480
to repeat this one more time and go from

824
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:24,800
um for all of these steps one more time

825
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:28,079
and uh my point here is that this method

826
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:33,400
cannot give us some final struct we need

827
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:33,400
to have uh the end point for our

828
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:40,640
path uh now let's say that we have the

829
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:44,000
path the next step is to uh calculate

830
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:46,480
the free energy along that path uh the

831
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,680
method that we use for calculating free

832
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:51,920
energy along the path is umbrella

833
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:53,960
sampling umbrella sampling is uh

834
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:57,520
probably the oldest method for free

835
00:38:53,960 --> 00:39:01,160
energy calculation but yet in my opinion

836
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:03,400
at least the most successful it works by

837
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:06,720
uh biasing our

838
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:11,079
system and uh through different Windows

839
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:14,599
um getting fire sample from our system

840
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:17,720
beaning those fire sample to and getting

841
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:20,079
distribution of Bio uh samples

842
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:22,400
converting those bio sample combining

843
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:24,119
and converting them together through

844
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,319
different reweighing techniques the

845
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:29,240
conventional one is called weighted

846
00:39:26,319 --> 00:39:33,040
histogram analysis spam and then

847
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:34,440
calculate our fre energy uh one problem

848
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:37,040
here is

849
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:40,359
that calculating free energy with

850
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:43,079
umbrella sampling it's like when we are

851
00:39:40,359 --> 00:39:43,880
uh on our path it's like we don't have

852
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:46,839
any

853
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:50,480
diffusion one way to resolve this uh

854
00:39:46,839 --> 00:39:53,920
problem is um pass the information

855
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:56,480
between this different different Windows

856
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,960
a technique for that is called uh

857
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:02,040
replica EX

858
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:04,520
change it passes information any kind of

859
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:07,280
information between two windows every uh

860
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:10,040
couple of steps and sort of through this

861
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,920
we sort of make our uh pass our

862
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:13,119
information to diffuse and we have some

863
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:16,000
sort of

864
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:19,040
diffusion uh we call this one this

865
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:22,280
approach bias exchange umbrella sampling

866
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:24,640
uh again works by considering set of

867
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:27,000
Windows images that we got from the

868
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:30,800
previous step assigning them different

869
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:33,280
copy piece and uh calculating the uh

870
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:35,640
free energy for that one this is my

871
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:39,359
converge path

872
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:41,880
um with 20 different windows or images I

873
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:45,359
do umbrella sampling for each one of

874
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:48,359
these and when I'm converg my

875
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:50,280
simulations are converged I combine them

876
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:54,880
through a little bit different approach

877
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:57,920
called a nonparametric approach uh and

878
00:40:54,880 --> 00:41:00,880
calculate my free energy uh we use this

879
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:04,160
non-parametric approach

880
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:06,760
because uh it allows us to not only

881
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:08,920
calculate the free energy along the uh

882
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:11,720
Collective variables that we initially

883
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:15,079
bias our system but also other

884
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:18,079
Collective variables that uh we think we

885
00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:20,400
have sampled them enough this would be

886
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:22,520
uh the free energy from these path along

887
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:25,240
these path this minimum is corresponding

888
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:27,599
to that point along the path when we go

889
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:30,760
little bit higher we have a barrier then

890
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:34,720
we have sort of a middle stable State

891
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:37,119
here and then my final minimum is uh

892
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,119
would be

893
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:44,680
here okay now having all the different

894
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:45,839
part of this puzzle together um putting

895
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:49,280
them all

896
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:53,200
together I sort of uh

897
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:54,800
summarize our sampling we start with a

898
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,599
identifying a set of collective

899
00:41:54,800 --> 00:42:00,079
variables for our system this is

900
00:41:56,599 --> 00:42:04,839
basically knowledge based and sometimes

901
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:07,640
data deriv based and then uh we steer

902
00:42:04,839 --> 00:42:10,640
our system we induce the transition to

903
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:15,200
go from one state to other state but

904
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:17,920
since we use force uh we try to refine

905
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:20,920
and relax our system through a string

906
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,920
method

907
00:42:24,359 --> 00:42:31,680
um yeah here for instance for the first

908
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:34,960
step um this is the collective variables

909
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:37,640
for distance the other one is uh Theta

910
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,839
for the angle the schematic is showing

911
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:43,359
that the The Next Step was calculating

912
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:46,960
the amount of work and then refining the

913
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:50,200
path and finally calculating the um free

914
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:52,559
energy along the path and when we have

915
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:57,359
all of these we sort of try to detect

916
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:59,440
the area that did not sample

917
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:02,760
and we sometimes have to go through this

918
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:05,440
step uh again we have to for instance go

919
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:08,720
from here back to the previous step but

920
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:10,319
the whole procedure is something like

921
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:13,400
this

922
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:16,400
uh having those now I want to talk about

923
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:20,359
some of the recent advances in our

924
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:22,400
approach uh the package that we use namd

925
00:43:20,359 --> 00:43:26,119
for our molecular Dynamic

926
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:29,599
simulations uh now supports gpus it

927
00:43:26,119 --> 00:43:33,160
improves our uh simulation performance

928
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:36,760
of our simulation uh let's say from uh

929
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:40,200
almost from my experience 10 times from

930
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:43,400
like couple of nanc per day to couple of

931
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:45,480
100 nanc per day sometimes on the other

932
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:48,359
hand for free energy calculations we use

933
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:52,559
cold bar modules these two now can work

934
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:54,079
together and improve our um sampling

935
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:58,640
approach

936
00:43:54,079 --> 00:44:01,319
uh another uh Improvement here is using

937
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:03,400
uh data deriven approaches I already

938
00:44:01,319 --> 00:44:06,800
said that there are methods at least for

939
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:10,359
toy model uh they they use time like

940
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:12,960
Auto encoders to reconstruct better

941
00:44:10,359 --> 00:44:16,040
Collective variables but as I mentioned

942
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:18,240
one problem here is that uh to define a

943
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:21,640
good Collective variables we need to

944
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:25,480
have good trajectory initial inputs and

945
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:28,119
for having those initial inputs uh we

946
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:31,640
have to bias our system and this is kind

947
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:34,640
of like a um

948
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:37,880
um iterative procedure here that we need

949
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:41,240
to go through it uh over the years

950
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:43,599
different flavors have been added to

951
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:45,800
these sampling techniques for instance

952
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:48,760
people combine bias exchange and string

953
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:51,640
method uh bias exchange with a string

954
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:53,960
method or they come up with adaptive

955
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:57,520
some sort of adaptive umbrella

956
00:44:53,960 --> 00:45:01,839
s uh I want to now talk about about one

957
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:05,000
of the newer approach that we uh are

958
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:07,280
using and to not only calculate the

959
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:11,359
thermodynamic but also

960
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:14,000
kinetic and one problem that we had one

961
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:18,079
problem that we had from our approach

962
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:19,960
was uh that we only consider a single

963
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:22,599
pass everything end up with a single

964
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:24,400
pass we can instead of a single path

965
00:45:22,599 --> 00:45:27,119
calculating everything along a single

966
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:30,240
path we can consider a tube of path let

967
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:33,559
say uh we we end up with this converge

968
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:35,760
path from here to here and then run some

969
00:45:33,559 --> 00:45:38,599
equilibrium

970
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:41,280
simulations um and then count the number

971
00:45:38,599 --> 00:45:44,160
of transition between different images

972
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:47,040
from that we can build a transition

973
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:50,520
Matrix having that transition Matrix we

974
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:52,640
can calculate the free energy and also

975
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:57,359
let's say rate of transition that is

976
00:45:52,640 --> 00:46:00,040
experimentally very important uh but and

977
00:45:57,359 --> 00:46:02,400
this usually is not really good for

978
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:05,920
continuous model like

979
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:09,640
molecular uh systems

980
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:11,880
and uh for instead of using this we

981
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:14,960
suggest using a different Matrix called

982
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:18,559
rate or uh generator Matrix which is

983
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:20,480
based on this previous transition Matrix

984
00:46:18,559 --> 00:46:23,760
but for instance it's La time

985
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:26,319
independent the time that we save our

986
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:29,200
information and resolve some of the

987
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:31,839
problem from this one when we have this

988
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:34,240
approach it's like we use some

989
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:37,200
estimators to go from this one to that

990
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:38,480
one when we have that one uh we can

991
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:41,520
calculate the

992
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:43,720
diffusion and also free energy having

993
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:46,520
diffusion and free energy both we can

994
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:50,720
calculate the mean first passage time

995
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:54,359
the time that um it takes an average to

996
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:56,359
go from here to here and then uh

997
00:46:54,359 --> 00:46:58,839
converting that one to rate of our

998
00:46:56,359 --> 00:46:58,839
transition

999
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:07,000
um okay finally I want to summarize the

1000
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:09,880
main feature of our

1001
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:13,400
sampling uh our approach is by

1002
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:15,800
definition an ad hog man we uh search

1003
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:18,319
for Collective variables iteratively

1004
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:20,960
improve our approach we start with a

1005
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:23,280
deran MD steered MD targeted MD to

1006
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:25,680
induce a transition refine that

1007
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:29,240
transition calculate the free energy

1008
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:32,400
along that uh transition pathway with bi

1009
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:35,079
exchange umbrella sampling our method

1010
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:38,680
works on high dimensional

1011
00:47:35,079 --> 00:47:42,480
Collective uh on unlike other methods

1012
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:44,680
that are uh they are limited by number

1013
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:47,119
of collective variables we can consider

1014
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:49,559
High number of collective variables that

1015
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:52,920
we we're going to talk about them in the

1016
00:47:49,559 --> 00:47:54,559
next part and uh you will see uh the

1017
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:58,520
number of collective variables that we

1018
00:47:54,559 --> 00:48:00,920
use for our system uh they are efficient

1019
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:04,119
for sampling high energy barriers this

1020
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:06,400
is particularly the case uh because we

1021
00:48:04,119 --> 00:48:10,240
are we using Umbrella sampling and

1022
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:14,960
restraining our simulation even to high

1023
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:17,800
barriers and our approach uh scales

1024
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:20,359
efficiently because both string method

1025
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:23,440
and bias exchange umbrella sampling are

1026
00:48:20,359 --> 00:48:27,119
loely coupled multicopy

1027
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:29,280
approaches and finally they are suit

1028
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:31,880
this approach is suitable for larger

1029
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:34,520
scale confirmational trans and the

1030
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:37,240
reason behind that is we have tested on

1031
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:40,599
several different system there are many

1032
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:42,839
many different methods uh available

1033
00:48:40,599 --> 00:48:45,599
currently and they are they work

1034
00:48:42,839 --> 00:48:47,559
perfectly fine on to models but when you

1035
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:50,520
apply them to real model you will see

1036
00:48:47,559 --> 00:48:52,760
that they do not work uh here we have

1037
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:54,520
test arm uh approach or sampling

1038
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:56,880
approach on three different system the

1039
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:59,720
top ones are the one that we already

1040
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:03,119
have some result or uh already published

1041
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:06,880
or uh the one that um

1042
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:09,200
are um in know a good uh stage and the

1043
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:12,359
bottom ones are the the one that we we

1044
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:12,359
are currently working

1045
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:23,960
on hello back uh for seminar part one uh

1046
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:25,960
which is going to be talking about uh

1047
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:31,440
applying the approach that we introduced

1048
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:34,720
in the primer to uh a transporter called

1049
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:38,400
na um Na

1050
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:41,599
is uh well is a metabolite transporter

1051
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:47,520
specifically transporter of citrate um

1052
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:50,160
and it was first uh became interesting

1053
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:52,960
for the most part to researchers uh in

1054
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:54,640
2000 when experiments on a related

1055
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:58,920
transporter in

1056
00:49:54,640 --> 00:50:00,960
flies um well the researchers performed

1057
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:02,880
experiments where they mutated uh this

1058
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:04,960
trans the gene that encodes this

1059
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:07,079
transporter to make the transporter

1060
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,960
function less efficiently and when they

1061
00:50:07,079 --> 00:50:12,400
did that the mutant

1062
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:15,599
organisms uh were shown to uh live

1063
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:19,119
longer than the wild type uh

1064
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:23,359
organisms um following that follow on

1065
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:27,200
experiments uh on the na transporter

1066
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:32,240
within mice showed that knocking out uh

1067
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:34,480
Na and mice causes the uh mice to store

1068
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:36,400
less body fat and also become less

1069
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:39,799
resistant to

1070
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:43,319
insulin and so since these experiments

1071
00:50:39,799 --> 00:50:45,319
were performed na has been uh thought to

1072
00:50:43,319 --> 00:50:47,920
be a potential drug Target for treatment

1073
00:50:45,319 --> 00:50:52,960
of obesity and type two

1074
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:54,359
diabetes um Na operates through the

1075
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:56,839
elevator What's called the elevator

1076
00:50:54,359 --> 00:50:59,880
transport mechanism uh in the this

1077
00:50:56,839 --> 00:51:02,440
mechanism transport is achieved when a

1078
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:04,799
transport domain shown in blue rotates

1079
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:07,119
and translates relative to a stationary

1080
00:51:04,799 --> 00:51:09,880
scaffold domain in order to change

1081
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:11,720
accessibility of uh the substrate from

1082
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:14,160
one side of the membrane to the

1083
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:18,200
other

1084
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:21,599
um uh this protein is called a homodimer

1085
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:23,559
so it's composed of two uh subunits to

1086
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:28,359
completely independent proteins actually

1087
00:51:23,559 --> 00:51:32,400
that form oblate diers um

1088
00:51:28,359 --> 00:51:35,280
um yeah uh so there's been a

1089
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:38,960
longterm uh collaboration between the

1090
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:43,200
Tash corid labs and uh the Wong lab uh

1091
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:44,720
that works on these uh this family of

1092
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:48,000
Transporters

1093
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:50,760
uh within uh our lab focuses on running

1094
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:55,520
MD simulations uh and then the Wong lab

1095
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:58,400
focuses on uh doing structural biology

1096
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:59,280
so solving structur of these related

1097
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,839
sets of

1098
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:03,960
Transporters uh both using X-ray

1099
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:07,000
crystallography and cryoelectron

1100
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:11,200
microscopy uh they solved the first uh

1101
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:15,559
structure of Na in 20 2021 in an bound

1102
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:18,200
inward facing State and uh more recently

1103
00:52:15,559 --> 00:52:20,440
they came to us and said that they had

1104
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:24,880
additionally solved new structures uh

1105
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:27,040
which are currently unpublished um of an

1106
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:29,720
APO inward facing stage so so completely

1107
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:32,559
Unbound inward basing State and also uh

1108
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:35,599
an APO outward basing State and so with

1109
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:38,480
this set of structures we're now primed

1110
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:40,839
to apply the uh approach that we

1111
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:44,760
introduced in the primer uh to look at

1112
00:52:40,839 --> 00:52:44,760
this APO transition in N

1113
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:51,160
act um so I'm going to rest of my part

1114
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:53,319
of the seminar uh I'm going to talk

1115
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:55,000
about the application of each of these

1116
00:52:53,319 --> 00:52:58,440
steps to

1117
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,440
na um

1118
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:03,359
this is an active project it's a work in

1119
00:53:01,079 --> 00:53:06,720
progress I have not uh gotten through

1120
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:09,200
all these steps yet and so what I want

1121
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:11,119
to do is talk about some of the

1122
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:14,559
considerations that I've went through

1123
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:16,319
when I in the application of these uh

1124
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:19,559
each of these steps to sort of give you

1125
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:22,680
a flavor of what it's like to actually

1126
00:53:19,559 --> 00:53:24,680
apply this uh technique to uh in the

1127
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:27,079
real world to an actual

1128
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:28,280
project so with that start with the

1129
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:32,839
first

1130
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:35,280
step um first step as I said before is

1131
00:53:32,839 --> 00:53:37,200
choosing uh transition to study and

1132
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:39,720
having structures available for that

1133
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:40,559
that transition of interest uh we have

1134
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:42,359
these

1135
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:44,200
highresolution uh structures of the

1136
00:53:42,359 --> 00:53:48,920
inward facing outward facing state so

1137
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:51,480
that um makes it a prime candidate for

1138
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:55,640
uh for study and application of that

1139
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:58,280
approach um you'll notice that in this

1140
00:53:55,640 --> 00:54:01,240
schematic both I have BR both transport

1141
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:04,119
domains in uh symmetrical inward facing

1142
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:06,920
or outward facing States um but this

1143
00:54:04,119 --> 00:54:12,040
structure is in a mixed state uh there's

1144
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:13,880
a large uh body of evidence um that from

1145
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:15,680
multiple different kinds of experiments

1146
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:18,040
performed on multiple different

1147
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:20,480
Transporters that

1148
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:22,079
um uh indicates that elevator

1149
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:25,400
Transporters like

1150
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:27,040
na uh the individual transport domains

1151
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:29,960
within the transporter operate

1152
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:33,119
completely independently of one another

1153
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:36,760
um and additional experiments have

1154
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:40,000
indicated that the transitions uh for na

1155
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:43,400
happen uh quickly and then the or

1156
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,960
relatively quickly and then the uh

1157
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:48,520
transporter

1158
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:50,839
um dwells in individual if or o States

1159
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:52,880
for a far greater amount of time what

1160
00:54:50,839 --> 00:54:55,119
this means is that uh a transition of a

1161
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:57,599
single transport domain is more common

1162
00:54:55,119 --> 00:55:00,079
to happen in nature than both of them

1163
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:03,359
exactly at the same time um and for this

1164
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:05,760
reason I decided to uh only induce the

1165
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:08,680
transition look at the transport uh in

1166
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:11,599
in one protomer at a

1167
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:14,839
time okay next step is defining

1168
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:16,559
Collective variables running driven MD

1169
00:55:14,839 --> 00:55:19,640
simulations

1170
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:22,480
um in past work which has been published

1171
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:25,440
a collaborative work with the Wong lab

1172
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:28,720
um I had established a biasing protocol

1173
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:31,319
for uh Rel ated bacterial um

1174
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:34,319
transporter um and so this was

1175
00:55:31,319 --> 00:55:37,799
immediately generalizable to

1176
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:40,079
na uh so did that generalization applied

1177
00:55:37,799 --> 00:55:42,200
the biasing protocol this was the result

1178
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:44,680
resulting um MD simulation that I

1179
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:47,079
obtained uh within this biasing protocol

1180
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:50,880
I have two Collective variables uh the

1181
00:55:47,079 --> 00:55:54,319
transport domain rotates um about um a

1182
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:56,920
particular defined axis uh and then it

1183
00:55:54,319 --> 00:55:59,720
also a transition is

1184
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:01,760
vises are added to induce a change in

1185
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:03,440
the position of the center of mass of

1186
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:05,880
the transport domain relative to the

1187
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:11,039
scaffold

1188
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:13,440
domain um within this uh uh this driven

1189
00:56:11,039 --> 00:56:15,920
MD simulation there were some things

1190
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:19,119
that I saw as I looked at the simulation

1191
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:20,240
and analyzed it further uh that I didn't

1192
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:21,960
think

1193
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:23,839
were

1194
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:26,760
ideal

1195
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:30,119
um these Transporters are thought

1196
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:32,000
to uh have the transport domain move as

1197
00:56:30,119 --> 00:56:34,960
a rigid body relative to the scaffold

1198
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:37,160
domain this is supported by the actual

1199
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:38,160
cryoem structures of the O and if States

1200
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:42,000
for

1201
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:45,240
na um structural superposition is shown

1202
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:47,920
here uh in our field we use uh a metric

1203
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:50,680
called root mean Square displacement or

1204
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:52,960
rmsd uh to measure overall structural

1205
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:56,359
similarity the formula for this is shown

1206
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:59,640
here it's root mean Square displacement

1207
00:56:56,359 --> 00:57:01,559
of um Atomic coordinates within a uh

1208
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:04,839
selection of atoms relative to a

1209
00:57:01,559 --> 00:57:07,480
reference set of atomic coordinates um

1210
00:57:04,839 --> 00:57:10,039
so aristy is low for the pair of cryoem

1211
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:13,039
structures within the initial protocol

1212
00:57:10,039 --> 00:57:15,880
that I used uh you can see visually

1213
00:57:13,039 --> 00:57:19,520
structural uh similarity is not looking

1214
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:22,200
so good higher armist value and so this

1215
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:25,599
was straight forward to correct uh what

1216
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:27,160
I had to do is add arsd uh restraints to

1217
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:29,280
the arms

1218
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:31,000
um both internally within the transport

1219
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:33,319
domain and also within the scaffold

1220
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:36,039
domain um by adding those restraints was

1221
00:57:33,319 --> 00:57:40,400
able to get at the end of the

1222
00:57:36,039 --> 00:57:44,000
transition um transport domain that uh

1223
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:47,000
matched what I was hoping it would look

1224
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:49,440
like the second issue that I saw was

1225
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:51,559
that um both the position and

1226
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:54,599
orientation of the transport domain at

1227
00:57:51,559 --> 00:57:57,119
the end of the uh transition was not

1228
00:57:54,599 --> 00:58:00,440
matching what it was supposed to the

1229
00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:04,680
ideal cryoem Target that I was looking

1230
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:06,520
for this was confusing to me for a while

1231
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:08,359
because this is what my Collective

1232
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:11,200
variables were specifically designed to

1233
00:58:08,359 --> 00:58:14,680
do um I thought about it for a few days

1234
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:17,839
and uh eventually figured out that while

1235
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:20,280
I'm inducing a rotation specifically

1236
00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:22,200
about this rotation axis and a

1237
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:25,520
displacement specifically along this

1238
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:26,880
displacement access axis um I wasn't

1239
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:28,680
restraining

1240
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:33,240
um sort of wobbling of the transport

1241
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:35,880
domain around other uh axes of rotation

1242
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:39,839
wasn't preventing um drift of the

1243
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:43,160
transport domain well um sort of around

1244
00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:46,319
laterally around this uh this placement

1245
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:49,640
axis um and so I had to change the

1246
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:53,480
collective variables I was using um so

1247
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:56,520
that these uh off- pathway uh movements

1248
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:59,559
would not happen anymore uh when I did

1249
00:58:56,520 --> 00:59:01,920
that uh the result of the protocol ended

1250
00:58:59,559 --> 00:59:07,119
up getting a final state that matches

1251
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:07,119
the desired crym or outward facing

1252
00:59:07,319 --> 00:59:11,359
structure okay so I did these

1253
00:59:09,079 --> 00:59:14,160
refinements applied The Driven ND

1254
00:59:11,359 --> 00:59:16,680
simulation uh this is a result of what

1255
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:18,200
this looks like this is a direct drive

1256
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:19,440
from the inward facing state to the

1257
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:22,799
outward facing

1258
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:26,240
State um direct drive within the

1259
00:59:22,799 --> 00:59:29,240
collective variable space um this this

1260
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:31,920
is the point of the uh method where

1261
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:34,400
ordinarily I would start looking for

1262
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:36,960
testing other uh Pathways throughout the

1263
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:40,480
collective variable space try and find

1264
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:45,319
um more What U might be the most optimal

1265
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:45,319
pathway through the space but my

1266
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:51,119
particular excuse me circumstances um

1267
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:52,400
allowed me to sort of approach this a

1268
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:55,799
little bit

1269
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:56,640
differently um so as ashon mentioned in

1270
00:59:55,799 --> 01:00:00,319
the

1271
00:59:56,640 --> 01:00:03,280
primer um there's a new uh meth mode

1272
01:00:00,319 --> 01:00:07,200
within computation mode within namdi

1273
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:11,640
that allows most computation to happen

1274
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:13,760
on uh a GPU um previously uh

1275
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:16,720
namdi most of the computation would

1276
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:19,079
happen on the CPU GPU was only used as a

1277
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:22,400
co-processor um so these computations on

1278
01:00:19,079 --> 01:00:26,720
the GPU are inherently faster um then

1279
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:29,039
Additionally the recent uh

1280
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:32,440
Improvement in uh GPU performance has

1281
01:00:29,039 --> 01:00:35,880
also increased uh sampling quite a bit

1282
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:39,039
um and so what this means is that uh

1283
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:41,359
with the same Hardware that we've had uh

1284
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:45,520
all along we can now get a lot more

1285
01:00:41,359 --> 01:00:48,599
sampling with nami uh at the same time

1286
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:50,880
uh the Taj cored lab was awarded a large

1287
01:00:48,599 --> 01:00:53,119
uh allocation on Summit uh which is

1288
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:54,799
housed at Oakridge National Lab it's one

1289
01:00:53,119 --> 01:01:00,079
of the largest supercomputers in the

1290
01:00:54,799 --> 01:01:03,000
world um um and so this improved

1291
01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:05,160
sampling by namdi combined with a large

1292
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,640
allocation means that string method

1293
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:09,000
simulations umbrella sampling

1294
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:11,760
simulations which historically have been

1295
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:16,760
really expensive uh from the perspective

1296
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:18,839
of uh standard MD simulation uh

1297
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:21,520
practitioners uh they're actually really

1298
01:01:18,839 --> 01:01:26,160
cheap in the context of this uh large

1299
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:28,720
allocation and so what I decided to do

1300
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:31,280
was to run a string method simulation

1301
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:34,680
from this initial uh direct drive

1302
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:37,960
Pathway to see what would come out of

1303
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:40,559
that and try and use that to inform uh

1304
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:43,839
how I was going to try and explore uh

1305
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:43,839
the collective variable

1306
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:50,960
space um so uh the within the driven MD

1307
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:56,319
simulations I had two Collective

1308
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:58,599
variables um but the uh position and

1309
01:01:56,319 --> 01:02:00,599
orientation of two rigid bodies relative

1310
01:01:58,599 --> 01:02:02,920
to one another like the transport domain

1311
01:02:00,599 --> 01:02:05,680
relative to the scaffold domain uh is

1312
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:08,359
inherently six dimensional there's three

1313
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:10,960
rotational degrees of freedom three uh

1314
01:02:08,359 --> 01:02:12,559
positional degrees of freedom um and I

1315
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:15,359
wanted within the string method to be

1316
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:18,039
able to account for all six of these

1317
01:02:15,359 --> 01:02:20,400
degrees of freedom um so I set it up in

1318
01:02:18,039 --> 01:02:22,799
that way uh when you're setting up a

1319
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:26,559
string Methods uh simulation you also

1320
01:02:22,799 --> 01:02:29,760
have to choose um certain parameters

1321
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:32,599
um for a couple of them I uh selected

1322
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:34,119
parameters based on uh other simulations

1323
01:02:32,599 --> 01:02:38,599
similar simulations that have been

1324
01:02:34,119 --> 01:02:41,799
performed in the literature um but uh

1325
01:02:38,599 --> 01:02:44,000
this is as you recall is an iterative

1326
01:02:41,799 --> 01:02:47,160
approach um and

1327
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:49,720
so uh I decided to increase the amount

1328
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:52,279
of time spent in each duration uh

1329
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:54,440
compared to what's been done in the past

1330
01:02:52,279 --> 01:02:58,680
this is newly possible because of the

1331
01:02:54,440 --> 01:03:01,319
increased sampling time within DD um and

1332
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:05,160
it also has benefits

1333
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:08,000
algorithmically uh longer uh iteration

1334
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:09,960
times has been shown to up to a

1335
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:14,440
increasing uh these iteration times up

1336
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:16,640
to a point has been shown to uh speed up

1337
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:19,839
uh iteration of the algor or uh

1338
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:22,039
convergence of the algorithm um it also

1339
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:24,160
reduces the amount of communication

1340
01:03:22,039 --> 01:03:26,520
between individual replicas which allows

1341
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:28,839
the algorithm to run more efficiently on

1342
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:31,400
the supercomputer and also reduces the

1343
01:03:28,839 --> 01:03:33,760
amount of uh data that you need to store

1344
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:38,079
um from the

1345
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:41,279
simulation so these are the results so

1346
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:43,880
far of the string uh simulation applied

1347
01:03:41,279 --> 01:03:46,200
to the direct drive um from the inward

1348
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:47,839
facing state to the outward facing State

1349
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:49,480
uh you can see the evolution of the

1350
01:03:47,839 --> 01:03:51,520
pathway in all six of the degrees of

1351
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:53,200
freedom that I talked about

1352
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:56,960
previously

1353
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:59,319
um interestingly uh there are three

1354
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:01,559
degrees of freedom where I you could see

1355
01:03:59,319 --> 01:04:02,960
that there was a large change from the

1356
01:04:01,559 --> 01:04:06,279
inward facing state to the outward

1357
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:09,480
facing State uh the other three the uh

1358
01:04:06,279 --> 01:04:11,359
start and end states are pretty similar

1359
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:15,480
um but interestingly you see that there

1360
01:04:11,359 --> 01:04:17,640
are large uh features um that are uh

1361
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:21,319
relaxation features that are uh

1362
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:24,559
happening in these uh degrees of freedom

1363
01:04:21,319 --> 01:04:26,680
um which is saying that all six of these

1364
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:29,319
degrees of freedom seem to be important

1365
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:31,440
for uh this particular transporter um

1366
01:04:29,319 --> 01:04:35,319
and you can see how these six degrees of

1367
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:38,240
freedom work together uh within the

1368
01:04:35,319 --> 01:04:39,960
simulation um over in this movie over

1369
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:41,960
here it's showing the transport domain

1370
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:43,720
sort of behind the scaffold domain so

1371
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:47,559
you're looking through the scaffold

1372
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:49,319
domain and uh it's coming together in a

1373
01:04:47,559 --> 01:04:51,119
complex

1374
01:04:49,319 --> 01:04:53,000
uh um

1375
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:56,640
transition

1376
01:04:53,000 --> 01:05:00,319
um I haven't analyzed this simulation

1377
01:04:56,640 --> 01:05:02,440
fully because it hasn't converged uh yet

1378
01:05:00,319 --> 01:05:04,720
uh you can look at convergence by

1379
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:08,119
looking at uh the evolution of the

1380
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:10,599
centers of the Swarms as a function of

1381
01:05:08,119 --> 01:05:14,119
iteration um so these plots over here

1382
01:05:10,599 --> 01:05:17,520
are showing uh the evolution of the

1383
01:05:14,119 --> 01:05:19,880
Swarm uh near this dip here this plot

1384
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:22,480
and the same point uh in this degree of

1385
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:25,079
Freedom it's continuously moving down

1386
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:27,279
continuously moving up uh we want to see

1387
01:05:25,079 --> 01:05:31,039
for convers we want to see for all these

1388
01:05:27,279 --> 01:05:34,559
swarm centers uh stable values that are

1389
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:36,680
remain the same for several

1390
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:39,279
iterations um so that's still running

1391
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:43,760
but it did what I wanted to tell me

1392
01:05:39,279 --> 01:05:47,559
something about um how I wanted to

1393
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:49,720
explore the uh uh Collective variable

1394
01:05:47,559 --> 01:05:52,039
space with driven MD

1395
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:56,440
simulations uh what I ended up deciding

1396
01:05:52,039 --> 01:05:59,000
to do was to induce a series of uh

1397
01:05:56,440 --> 01:06:00,960
transitions along circular arcs um

1398
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:04,039
between the inward facing and outward

1399
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:04,880
facing State uh within this original two

1400
01:06:04,039 --> 01:06:07,480
uh

1401
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:09,839
two-dimensional um with these original

1402
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:12,480
two Collective variables so this is

1403
01:06:09,839 --> 01:06:15,640
forming a two-dimensional dis within the

1404
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:17,960
uh six-dimensional space um what you're

1405
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:20,400
seeing in this plot are uh data points

1406
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:23,039
along these driven uh from these driven

1407
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:25,400
MD simulations along uh these Target

1408
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:27,160
Pathways represented by the dashed lines

1409
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:29,640
um you see that the simulations are

1410
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:32,200
overlapping with one another so um

1411
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:34,680
they're sampling quite a bit of this

1412
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:37,400
space these simulations are also

1413
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:39,200
currently running on Summit um you see

1414
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:41,400
sort of at the ends here along these

1415
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:43,200
longest Pathways uh there's not sampling

1416
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:47,599
here because these simulations just

1417
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:49,359
haven't finished yet um so but in the

1418
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:52,920
meantime while we're waiting for them to

1419
01:06:49,359 --> 01:06:56,079
finish we can look at the work profiles

1420
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:58,480
uh like I talked about in the primer to

1421
01:06:56,079 --> 01:07:01,240
see which different what it says about

1422
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:04,440
which Pathways may be more or less

1423
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:06,559
optimal uh relative to one another um

1424
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:09,760
this is breaking up those work profiles

1425
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:13,160
into equally spaced segments and they uh

1426
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:16,079
the values of uh the amount of work that

1427
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:18,920
increases or decreases uh within each

1428
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:22,200
segment segment is represented by uh the

1429
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:25,520
colors the plot and so what this is

1430
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:27,880
saying is that it looks like uh inducing

1431
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:29,640
translation uh before any kind of

1432
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:31,680
rotation of the transport domain

1433
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:33,760
relative to the scaffold domain uh

1434
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:36,319
that's disfavored there's higher values

1435
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:40,559
of work over in these

1436
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:43,680
parts um of the uh driven MD simulations

1437
01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:46,599
similarly if you do all most of your

1438
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:48,680
rotation first followed by translation

1439
01:07:46,599 --> 01:07:51,599
that also seems to be

1440
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:53,319
disfavored um and so actually starting

1441
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:54,720
from this direct drive from the inward

1442
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:57,000
facing to outward facing state is

1443
01:07:54,720 --> 01:08:00,160
looking like a reasonable um starting

1444
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:02,880
place for uh refinement with the string

1445
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:04,079
method was forms of trajectories um the

1446
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:07,480
relaxed

1447
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:09,039
pathway uh from that uh direct drive

1448
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:12,599
from the string method applied to that

1449
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:15,760
direct drive is uh overlaid with these

1450
01:08:12,599 --> 01:08:18,960
white and red dots on Top This is a

1451
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:22,159
projection from the six dimensional path

1452
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:25,520
taken uh with by this relaxed pathway

1453
01:08:22,159 --> 01:08:27,719
back onto that this two-dimensional disc

1454
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:31,759
and then the colors are representing the

1455
01:08:27,719 --> 01:08:35,440
uh distance um that that uh relaxed

1456
01:08:31,759 --> 01:08:37,239
pathway relaxed away from that dis uh in

1457
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:39,679
units of uh the length of these

1458
01:08:37,239 --> 01:08:42,719
individual segments that are that each

1459
01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:46,080
have a different color with plot and so

1460
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:48,440
this is saying that uh the distance that

1461
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:53,319
the pathway is relaxing away from this

1462
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:56,000
dis is pretty far um and it calls into

1463
01:08:53,319 --> 01:08:59,759
question just how relevant

1464
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:02,719
uh these work profiles actually are for

1465
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:04,799
what uh a natural pathway for what the

1466
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:08,759
optimal natural pathway might actually

1467
01:09:04,799 --> 01:09:12,400
be um so this is as far as I've gotten

1468
01:09:08,759 --> 01:09:14,880
right now uh my plan going forward is to

1469
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:17,080
relax more of these Pathways using the

1470
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:19,920
string method with forms of trajectories

1471
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:23,719
uh maybe all of the pathways

1472
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:26,600
um and then continue on with uh the the

1473
01:09:23,719 --> 01:09:29,239
application of the approach so running

1474
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:32,000
uh driven additional driven MD

1475
01:09:29,239 --> 01:09:33,920
simulations eventually running umbrella

1476
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:36,440
sampling simulations getting work uh

1477
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:38,679
free energy profiles and then connecting

1478
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:41,520
this back to the original structure of

1479
01:09:38,679 --> 01:09:43,319
the protein to understand what the

1480
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:45,679
connection is between structural

1481
01:09:43,319 --> 01:09:50,799
Dynamics and function of n

1482
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:53,640
act um also interested in looking

1483
01:09:50,799 --> 01:09:55,880
at this transition under different

1484
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:58,000
conditions so this is uh the APO

1485
01:09:55,880 --> 01:10:00,400
transition nothing is bound be

1486
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:02,880
interesting to see how binding of

1487
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:05,080
substrate and ions affects this uh

1488
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:07,360
there's also a published structure with

1489
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:10,040
a drug-like inhibitor bound um it'd be

1490
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:11,679
interesting to look at how that affects

1491
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:14,520
the transition as

1492
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:17,280
well and so with that I'd like to

1493
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:19,920
acknowledge my adviser and M tou kid uh

1494
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:21,840
my collaborators Donnie Wong and Yan Lee

1495
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:23,640
and all the members of the nah resource

1496
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:26,840
for macromolecular modeling and

1497
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:30,239
visualization um both pass and present

1498
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:32,920
uh special thanks to mahm moradi who

1499
01:10:30,239 --> 01:10:36,280
taught me this approach and he was still

1500
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:38,120
postto in mods lab acknow I'd like to

1501
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:39,600
acknowledge funding and uh Computing

1502
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:41,679
resources that allowed me to complete

1503
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:44,679
this work and with that I will toss it

1504
01:10:41,679 --> 01:10:49,520
over to ashcon for second half of the

1505
01:10:44,679 --> 01:10:51,120
seminar my turn for um the seminar

1506
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:56,040
part

1507
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:58,520
uh here I brought two examples uh

1508
01:10:56,040 --> 01:11:00,520
similar to what Noah mentioned they have

1509
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:02,960
a little bit different stories I thought

1510
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:06,480
that they are useful one of them is a

1511
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:11,400
glutamate transporter for this one uh we

1512
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:15,440
did a 2d two-dimensional free energy

1513
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:21,159
calculations um the other one glycerol 3

1514
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:24,360
fosfate transporter this one um we use

1515
01:11:21,159 --> 01:11:29,120
this model for calculating the kinetic

1516
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:32,080
the uh very last part of our strategy in

1517
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:34,360
my previous section that I discussed we

1518
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:37,960
tested on this

1519
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:39,480
model uh let's start with the first one

1520
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:42,760
gluto

1521
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:45,800
transporter um glut toate Transporters

1522
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:49,440
let's talk a little bit about the uh

1523
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:52,199
importance of this model are the

1524
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:54,760
glutamate Transporters or excitatory

1525
01:11:52,199 --> 01:11:57,440
amino acid Transporters are responsible

1526
01:11:54,760 --> 01:12:00,280
to transport

1527
01:11:57,440 --> 01:12:03,800
glutamate uh an important

1528
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:06,080
neurotransmitter in our neural cell

1529
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:10,679
their disregulation cause different

1530
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:14,120
diseases such as Parkinson Alzheimer and

1531
01:12:10,679 --> 01:12:16,760
depression uh glutamate Transporters are

1532
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:20,199
secondary active Transporters they

1533
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:23,239
transport glutamate and or aspartate

1534
01:12:20,199 --> 01:12:27,440
with three sodium ions the pottassium

1535
01:12:23,239 --> 01:12:31,440
inside the cell they take one uh sorry

1536
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:33,679
one proton inside the cell and uh one

1537
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:37,600
potassium outside the cell at the same

1538
01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:41,360
time they work as a coloroid

1539
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:43,600
Chanel uh I'm currently working on this

1540
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:48,600
type of system the ones that are known

1541
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:52,520
as eats but for today I want to focus on

1542
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:55,960
the Aral homologue of the system gltph

1543
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:58,800
gltph is a little bit simpler than and

1544
01:12:55,960 --> 01:13:01,639
eats the glutamate Transporters actual

1545
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:03,280
glutamate Transporters it just transport

1546
01:13:01,639 --> 01:13:06,080
glutamate and

1547
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:09,360
aspartate uh with three sodium ions

1548
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:12,400
doesn't need proton or

1549
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:16,480
potassium uh the this is the structure

1550
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:19,920
of gluto Transport there it's a

1551
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:22,960
tri has three protom three units that

1552
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:25,159
are kind of similar uh these Brown parts

1553
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:27,239
and the green part the green part is

1554
01:13:25,159 --> 01:13:30,639
known as a scaffold domain it doesn't

1555
01:13:27,239 --> 01:13:34,120
move a lot uh the brown part is the

1556
01:13:30,639 --> 01:13:37,400
transport domain that is moving trans

1557
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:41,840
transporting the substrates and

1558
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:45,960
ions it has been uh the uh crystalize in

1559
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:49,800
three different form outward facing

1560
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:53,480
inward facing and intermediate

1561
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:55,920
State uh the transport mechanism in this

1562
01:13:53,480 --> 01:13:59,400
type of Transporter is sort of like

1563
01:13:55,920 --> 01:14:02,840
elevator it is known as elevator like

1564
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:06,239
alternating access uh mechanism it's

1565
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:08,679
like uh ions and substrates get into

1566
01:14:06,239 --> 01:14:12,000
this BR part the transport domain

1567
01:14:08,679 --> 01:14:15,080
transport domain moves translate moves a

1568
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:19,920
little bit down and rotate and then ions

1569
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:23,239
and substrate leave the transport

1570
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:25,800
there this is sort of a complex picture

1571
01:14:23,239 --> 01:14:28,320
our strategies is to break down this

1572
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:31,480
kind of complex movement to different

1573
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:36,159
pieces can consider a cycle like this

1574
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:39,679
it's like ions in um substrates get into

1575
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:42,440
into the transporter these are uh

1576
01:14:39,679 --> 01:14:45,560
helical her pin that sort of acting like

1577
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:49,120
a gate and then the transporter gets

1578
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:52,639
full fully bound and then we have the

1579
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:56,880
translation confirmational change and

1580
01:14:52,639 --> 01:15:01,880
releasing the ions and substrate

1581
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:06,400
uh we focus on the vertical part of this

1582
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:08,920
cycle uh from outward facing empty or

1583
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:11,960
aole to inward facing

1584
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:15,080
aole uh in other cases when we have one

1585
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:19,000
ion we wanted to know if uh this

1586
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:21,520
transition is possible or the uh

1587
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:25,480
transporter has to go through a cycle

1588
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:27,600
like this and the third scenario is when

1589
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:31,480
we have the full

1590
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:34,639
one uh there are other scenarios here as

1591
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:38,280
well that let's say we have two ions or

1592
01:15:34,639 --> 01:15:41,920
we have substrate with ions as well but

1593
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:47,239
uh for this case we just focus on these

1594
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:47,239
three conditions this one this one this

1595
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:56,960
one we start with equilibrium simulation

1596
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:59,480
we put our system in a explicit membrane

1597
01:15:56,960 --> 01:16:02,000
environment uh try to see if we see

1598
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:04,520
anything interesting generally

1599
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:08,440
equilibrium simulation just provide us

1600
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:12,159
with some uh local changes it does not

1601
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:14,800
give us the actual information about the

1602
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:19,040
transport itself for

1603
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:21,320
instance uh we know that if we're on

1604
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:24,960
equilibrium simulation one of the ions

1605
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:29,639
is done the stable inside get released

1606
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:32,719
then this Gates this gate it opens and

1607
01:16:29,639 --> 01:16:36,000
then soft releases as

1608
01:16:32,719 --> 01:16:38,440
well this equilibrium run uh was

1609
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:42,360
interesting provide us some information

1610
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:46,239
but not too much information about the

1611
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:48,320
transport itself so uh we went through

1612
01:16:46,239 --> 01:16:52,440
our procedure to study the largest

1613
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:55,880
Square larg scale uh confirmational

1614
01:16:52,440 --> 01:17:01,000
transission uh to go from this outward

1615
01:16:55,880 --> 01:17:03,480
facing inward facing we consider uh two

1616
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:06,840
sets of collective Val one of them was

1617
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:08,280
related to the distance of these uh

1618
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:11,880
transport

1619
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:14,679
domain going from up here to down move

1620
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:19,760
translating a little bit and then

1621
01:17:14,679 --> 01:17:22,600
another one is angle uh for rotation and

1622
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:26,440
uh similar to Noah's case for rotation

1623
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:31,040
we use uh coion Collective

1624
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:34,880
variables uh for the quion uh we

1625
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:39,360
consider the quion that are unit um

1626
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:42,000
coion have four components um since they

1627
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:44,600
are unit three of them are independent

1628
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:47,880
three degrees of freedom there plus one

1629
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:51,440
degrees one degree for this one four for

1630
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:53,600
each unit time 3 12 degrees of freedom

1631
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:56,960
so our Collective variable space is 12

1632
01:17:53,600 --> 01:18:00,400
degrees of freedom has uh is a has 12

1633
01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:04,400
degrees of comparing outward facing with

1634
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:09,080
inward facing we noted that uh we need

1635
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:11,280
12 degrees 12 angr translation and 32

1636
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:13,360
Dees

1637
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:15,760
orientation having these Collective

1638
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:20,480
variables we induce the

1639
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:23,320
transition uh with d MD and this

1640
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:26,760
animation shows this translation we were

1641
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:26,760
able to do this

1642
01:18:27,159 --> 01:18:34,639
translation uh now this slide shows the

1643
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:40,120
whole procedure of our

1644
01:18:34,639 --> 01:18:44,600
sampling um this is sort of Step by Step

1645
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:48,199
uh on sble base uh enhan sampling

1646
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:51,320
strategy the story starts here uh

1647
01:18:48,199 --> 01:18:56,120
outward facing inward facing with a

1648
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:58,600
targeted MD or steered MD we ran six set

1649
01:18:56,120 --> 01:19:02,159
of simulation with different Force

1650
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:05,199
conent to induce a transition noted that

1651
01:19:02,159 --> 01:19:07,840
for all of them the amount of work that

1652
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:11,080
they generate is pretty high so we

1653
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:14,199
decided to sample the whole confirmation

1654
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:18,440
on the space in terms of those two

1655
01:19:14,199 --> 01:19:23,199
Collective variables the translation and

1656
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:26,280
orientation uh this provided us with a

1657
01:19:23,199 --> 01:19:30,159
2d free energy that I'm going to show in

1658
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:32,400
the next slide but here i' like to pay

1659
01:19:30,159 --> 01:19:34,360
your attention to the number of replica

1660
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:37,440
number of simulations copy of

1661
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:41,639
simulations that we are

1662
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:47,080
doing um after doing the 2d3 energy we

1663
01:19:41,639 --> 01:19:49,840
went to uh calculate the path from going

1664
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:51,920
to outward facing to inward

1665
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:56,080
facing

1666
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:58,440
uh we generate a path uh based on the

1667
01:19:56,080 --> 01:20:00,639
information that we had from bias

1668
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:03,760
exchange umbrella sampling the 2D bias

1669
01:20:00,639 --> 01:20:07,320
exchange umbrella sampling an initial

1670
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:10,679
path with a method called post uh post

1671
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:12,600
hawkk string method it is just having

1672
01:20:10,679 --> 01:20:15,480
the information from the

1673
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:18,120
translation and generating an initial

1674
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:20,400
path for us then having that initial

1675
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:25,840
path we use a string

1676
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:28,159
method to refine that pass e stage

1677
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:31,480
everything up to here was related to one

1678
01:20:28,159 --> 01:20:34,480
of our cases the very first one the

1679
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:39,360
fully bound one this is probably similar

1680
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:43,560
to the question you mentioned um

1681
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:46,159
Somaya that sometimes we have different

1682
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:49,639
conditions for our system having the

1683
01:20:46,159 --> 01:20:52,440
initial uh or a refined path for one of

1684
01:20:49,639 --> 01:20:57,080
them we use that path for the other

1685
01:20:52,440 --> 01:21:00,159
cases the AIL one and uh the the other

1686
01:20:57,080 --> 01:21:01,920
case that we had one only single ion The

1687
01:21:00,159 --> 01:21:04,719
partially bound

1688
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:07,400
one having all of these passes these

1689
01:21:04,719 --> 01:21:11,679
three passes we calculated free energy

1690
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:13,800
along each one of these paths and uh we

1691
01:21:11,679 --> 01:21:17,000
got the free energy from

1692
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:20,880
that the total aggregated simulation

1693
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:24,679
time for this the whole procedure was

1694
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:29,520
0.1 millisecond which is as far as I

1695
01:21:24,679 --> 01:21:33,280
know in terms of uh memory transporter

1696
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:33,280
is probably the largest amount of

1697
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:41,239
simulation uh here uh I mentioned in

1698
01:21:38,159 --> 01:21:44,800
this part was a little bit complex we

1699
01:21:41,239 --> 01:21:47,560
did a 2d I want to now focus on this

1700
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:50,480
part the 2D free energy

1701
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:53,239
calculation this is translation and this

1702
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:58,040
one is orientation the outward facing is

1703
01:21:53,239 --> 01:22:03,000
here this is is my inward

1704
01:21:58,040 --> 01:22:05,360
facing as I mentioned we started with uh

1705
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:07,679
six different of six different set of

1706
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:10,719
simulation from going here to here let's

1707
01:22:07,679 --> 01:22:12,960
say different path from here to here

1708
01:22:10,719 --> 01:22:15,639
from this path and the other path would

1709
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:19,199
be this one all of this generated very

1710
01:22:15,639 --> 01:22:22,800
large amount of work so we decided to

1711
01:22:19,199 --> 01:22:27,560
branch of new simulation from these and

1712
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:33,120
Sample the old space here this made for

1713
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:37,840
us a two 32 by 32 gr Point space this

1714
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:41,159
step we repeat this step to make our uh

1715
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:43,480
samples prepare our sample and cover the

1716
01:22:41,159 --> 01:22:46,760
whole

1717
01:22:43,480 --> 01:22:48,760
Space having these uh samples initial

1718
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:53,000
samples to cover the whole space with

1719
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:55,679
did a 2d bi exchange umbrella

1720
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:59,360
sampling uh and this is the free energy

1721
01:22:55,679 --> 01:23:02,159
for that uh case the outward facing is

1722
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:04,960
somewhere here the inward facing is

1723
01:23:02,159 --> 01:23:08,360
here we can see that the outward facing

1724
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:11,760
has a minimum but the inward facing is

1725
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:14,280
basically is missing its minimum so we

1726
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:19,159
repeat this stage one more

1727
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:22,600
time and made our um points closer to

1728
01:23:19,159 --> 01:23:24,560
each other made a our sampling refiner

1729
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:28,760
did another set of fire Exchange

1730
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:32,239
umbrella samply end up with this um map

1731
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:35,800
that is showing the inward facing here

1732
01:23:32,239 --> 01:23:39,760
and outward facing here and you can see

1733
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:42,560
that seems our system is going from sort

1734
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:45,639
of this path the green one is the

1735
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:50,920
initial pass that we generated with post

1736
01:23:45,639 --> 01:23:53,520
HW shring method and running uh actual

1737
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:56,639
simulation string method with swarms of

1738
01:23:53,520 --> 01:24:00,960
trajectory with up with this

1739
01:23:56,639 --> 01:24:04,679
um uh black one and as I mentioned this

1740
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:07,679
was just for uh fully bound the

1741
01:24:04,679 --> 01:24:10,360
condition that uh we have the ions and

1742
01:24:07,679 --> 01:24:13,080
substrate everything all

1743
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:16,840
together we repeated the simulation for

1744
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:21,679
the apole in uh the the one that only

1745
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:24,600
has one ions one ion and uh did the free

1746
01:24:21,679 --> 01:24:26,400
energy calculation along these path and

1747
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:29,560
these are the maps for the free energy

1748
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:32,199
for each one of those cases let's focus

1749
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:35,719
on uh the first one this says for the

1750
01:24:32,199 --> 01:24:38,480
fully bound one outward facing inward

1751
01:24:35,719 --> 01:24:41,800
facing is here now we have some minimum

1752
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:45,520
for inward facing there's some sort of

1753
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:49,159
intermediate State here uh the scenario

1754
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:50,880
for AO one is sort of similar to fully

1755
01:24:49,159 --> 01:24:54,159
bound

1756
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:57,719
one uh a little bit different moved a

1757
01:24:54,159 --> 01:24:59,719
little little bit for right but the

1758
01:24:57,719 --> 01:25:03,600
interesting thing is here the partially

1759
01:24:59,719 --> 01:25:06,159
bound one uh this is the outward facing

1760
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:09,520
inward facing is missing it seems the

1761
01:25:06,159 --> 01:25:11,760
transporter doesn't want to transport

1762
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:15,480
one single iron it doesn't want to waste

1763
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:21,800
the cycle for just transporting one

1764
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:25,080
ion and this is the uh GRE energy uh

1765
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:28,440
projected in One D here it's the outward

1766
01:25:25,080 --> 01:25:31,360
facing inward facing is here the fully

1767
01:25:28,440 --> 01:25:33,800
bound one our transporter is taking a

1768
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:37,719
path going through these barriers in our

1769
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:43,159
free energy and then going back in APO

1770
01:25:37,719 --> 01:25:45,280
form empty from sort of a separate pass

1771
01:25:43,159 --> 01:25:49,480
having this barrier this two different

1772
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:52,760
barrier it is clear that or it's a sign

1773
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:54,920
that um our transporting is taking two

1774
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:57,400
different paths and we find an

1775
01:25:54,920 --> 01:26:01,320
intermediate State correspond to this

1776
01:25:57,400 --> 01:26:05,639
one that we think is important

1777
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:10,159
particularly that the uh experimentally

1778
01:26:05,639 --> 01:26:10,159
we cannot we we do not have this

1779
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:18,560
state having the free energy and the

1780
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:19,639
path to go from outward facing the to

1781
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:23,840
inward

1782
01:26:19,639 --> 01:26:26,520
facing uh we uh characterize that path

1783
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:28,719
and and try to find the interesting

1784
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:32,600
things some of the interesting things

1785
01:26:28,719 --> 01:26:34,639
here are for instance we noted that

1786
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:37,000
going from outward facing to inward

1787
01:26:34,639 --> 01:26:41,320
facing this scaffold domain is sort of

1788
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:41,320
moving like a pistone

1789
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:49,679
um sorry I don't know uh why this movie

1790
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:52,760
is not showing and

1791
01:26:49,679 --> 01:26:56,400
the uh scaffold domain is sort of

1792
01:26:52,760 --> 01:26:58,440
getting uh dis this engage from the

1793
01:26:56,400 --> 01:27:01,960
transport domain and the salt bridge is

1794
01:26:58,440 --> 01:27:01,960
breaking during this

1795
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:09,159
transport now I want to talk about the

1796
01:27:06,199 --> 01:27:11,560
second example the glycerol three

1797
01:27:09,159 --> 01:27:14,440
phosphate transporter

1798
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:19,000
glpt this is a transporter from a

1799
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:23,440
bacteria and transport phosphates

1800
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:25,239
transport and uh organic phosphate with

1801
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:28,960
in organic

1802
01:27:25,239 --> 01:27:31,800
phosphate uh and in absence of that

1803
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:34,679
organic phosphate is just exchanged to

1804
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:37,880
inorganic phosphate this structure was

1805
01:27:34,679 --> 01:27:41,360
only crystallized in out inward

1806
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:43,159
facing and the transport mechanism for

1807
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:46,320
this was a little bit different from the

1808
01:27:43,159 --> 01:27:47,679
previous one like a rocker Su it's like

1809
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:53,639
it's

1810
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:57,880
taking one uh it's anti porting uh the

1811
01:27:53,639 --> 01:28:01,600
the organic phosphate with the inorganic

1812
01:27:57,880 --> 01:28:06,159
phosphate again uh breaking down this

1813
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:08,560
one to Pieces we study this cycle indeed

1814
01:28:06,159 --> 01:28:12,520
this structure was previously study in

1815
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:17,159
our group um with Dr moradi when he was

1816
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:19,320
a postart and uh he uh found that by

1817
01:28:17,159 --> 01:28:22,560
pulling this two domain of the

1818
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:25,000
transporter he can induce a

1819
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:28,159
transition um

1820
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:31,480
uh and then uh this is the free energy

1821
01:28:28,159 --> 01:28:35,320
landscape for this one going from inward

1822
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:39,040
facing to outward facing when it's April

1823
01:28:35,320 --> 01:28:41,639
the pass it seems to be having some

1824
01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:45,320
barrier it's difficult to pass through

1825
01:28:41,639 --> 01:28:48,719
these barriers here but for the case

1826
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:53,119
when we have only

1827
01:28:48,719 --> 01:28:57,080
um uh the trans uh we have the phosphate

1828
01:28:53,119 --> 01:29:03,040
in it barrier is kind of lower and the

1829
01:28:57,080 --> 01:29:03,040
pass is uh kind of easier for uh the

1830
01:29:03,320 --> 01:29:10,480
transporter for this case uh having this

1831
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:14,560
we wanted to test our new

1832
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:17,000
strategy calculating the kinetic and

1833
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:20,639
thermodynamic with the method that I

1834
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:23,280
mentioned uh through uh studying a tube

1835
01:29:20,639 --> 01:29:26,800
of pass instead of a single pass for

1836
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:29,960
this part for this one we focus only on

1837
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:33,080
translation from going to from here

1838
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:35,520
outward facing to this inward facing

1839
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:35,520
which would

1840
01:29:36,679 --> 01:29:41,960
be correspond to these points in our

1841
01:29:39,719 --> 01:29:41,960
free

1842
01:29:42,159 --> 01:29:48,400
energy we having the images from or uh

1843
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:50,159
structures from that pth we run

1844
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:54,199
equilibrium

1845
01:29:50,159 --> 01:29:56,840
simulations um for 40 different images

1846
01:29:54,199 --> 01:29:59,480
between different copies for each one of

1847
01:29:56,840 --> 01:30:02,840
them count the number of transition

1848
01:29:59,480 --> 01:30:05,520
between different images for a

1849
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:08,800
particular La time and build a

1850
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:12,760
transition Matrix having that transition

1851
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:14,920
Matrix we build our rate Matrix and

1852
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:19,280
having that rate Matrix we calculated

1853
01:30:14,920 --> 01:30:21,639
the free energy and the fusion and here

1854
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:24,840
in this slide I'm comparing these two

1855
01:30:21,639 --> 01:30:27,199
methods the green one is the one that

1856
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:30,159
uh we got it from our new method

1857
01:30:27,199 --> 01:30:33,199
calculation along the path unbiased

1858
01:30:30,159 --> 01:30:35,800
equilibrium simulation along the pass

1859
01:30:33,199 --> 01:30:38,960
and the green one is the one from enhan

1860
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:42,000
sampling the bias

1861
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:45,119
one the interesting thing is that both

1862
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:48,040
meals are providing a similar for energy

1863
01:30:45,119 --> 01:30:50,159
uh profile like one of them is just a

1864
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:53,600
scale of the other ones just going a

1865
01:30:50,159 --> 01:30:54,639
little bit down the minimum are the same

1866
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:57,760
place

1867
01:30:54,639 --> 01:30:59,880
uh only the barriers are different and

1868
01:30:57,760 --> 01:31:01,960
these are the structure corresponding to

1869
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:06,280
those

1870
01:31:01,960 --> 01:31:10,719
um interesting or difficult part here is

1871
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:13,440
to um have the right uh lack time the

1872
01:31:10,719 --> 01:31:17,400
time that we save our information and

1873
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:21,159
the radius for the distance of our

1874
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:23,119
images how we measure that a particular

1875
01:31:21,159 --> 01:31:25,360
structure is corresponding to which

1876
01:31:23,119 --> 01:31:27,760
image

1877
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:33,679
these are the

1878
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:37,199
um different life time and rce of uh our

1879
01:31:33,679 --> 01:31:39,440
images the distance from uh our images

1880
01:31:37,199 --> 01:31:43,719
and showing that they all are providing

1881
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:46,719
similar result but with a different

1882
01:31:43,719 --> 01:31:46,719
barriers

1883
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:55,199
um if we make our

1884
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:57,600
um radius very small like we end up with

1885
01:31:55,199 --> 01:32:02,000
a single pass the one that we already

1886
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:05,400
had for um bias exchange umbrella samply

1887
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:08,440
if we make our pass or our tube the

1888
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:12,080
radius of our tube pretty large gets

1889
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:14,840
very far and our data gets very noisy

1890
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:18,000
and our approximation are even

1891
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:22,199
wrong and this is the yellow one is for

1892
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:24,239
the case that it's um the LA time um and

1893
01:32:22,199 --> 01:32:26,440
the radius is very large and other one

1894
01:32:24,239 --> 01:32:30,280
is for the other case and they are

1895
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:32,520
smaller one parameter here is time the

1896
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:35,719
other parameter is distance we need to

1897
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:39,520
play with both of these uh the

1898
01:32:35,719 --> 01:32:43,360
experimental activation energy uh for

1899
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:46,159
this case was 8.4 the one that we got

1900
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:49,760
from bias exchange umbrella sampling the

1901
01:32:46,159 --> 01:32:50,760
method that uh we usually take was

1902
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:54,960
giving us

1903
01:32:50,760 --> 01:32:57,639
9.6 our newer method is giving us

1904
01:32:54,960 --> 01:33:00,880
only

1905
01:32:57,639 --> 01:33:02,480
s and the experimental value seems to be

1906
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:04,280
somewhere near there so we need to

1907
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:05,480
improve our methods a little bit to get

1908
01:33:04,280 --> 01:33:09,239
closer to

1909
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:11,719
that uh but the thing that is

1910
01:33:09,239 --> 01:33:15,119
interesting here is the transition rate

1911
01:33:11,719 --> 01:33:17,719
the time that it takes to go from this

1912
01:33:15,119 --> 01:33:21,880
state to this state on

1913
01:33:17,719 --> 01:33:25,320
average uh this time depends on La time

1914
01:33:21,880 --> 01:33:28,440
but the value that we converge is

1915
01:33:25,320 --> 01:33:32,520
59.2 uh which is seven times larger than

1916
01:33:28,440 --> 01:33:35,360
the experimental value uh this one is

1917
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:37,600
only for transporting the inorganic

1918
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:41,199
phosphate the experimental one is for

1919
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:43,480
the organic phosphate but they are at

1920
01:33:41,199 --> 01:33:46,400
least in order of magnitude similar to

1921
01:33:43,480 --> 01:33:49,159
each other we still need to work on this

1922
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:49,159
and improve

1923
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:56,840
it and uh finally this is my

1924
01:33:53,040 --> 01:34:00,080
acknowledgement page um this is my

1925
01:33:56,840 --> 01:34:02,800
supervisor similar to what Noah showed

1926
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:05,679
and this is Dr Madi uh I'm currently

1927
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:07,840
working with Dr moradi in his lab

1928
01:34:05,679 --> 01:34:11,800
collaborating with him and this is a

1929
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:15,600
picture of our group I'm not there and

1930
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:20,320
uh these are the source of uh phone that

1931
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:20,320
I'm using to do my calculations
