1
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:16,560
so today we are going to uh talk about

2
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,760
where consumer decisions come from

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,720
remember last lecture we built a supply

4
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,680
curve and demand curve and I just sort

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,920
of made them up and I said now we're

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,000
going to start to go back and build up

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,840
where they come from and today we'll

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,560
start with the demand curve and start by

9
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:33,280
talking about consumer preferences okay

10
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,600
so um the first thing we're going to do

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,079
is we're going to understand how

12
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,879
consumers make choices now essentially

13
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,120
as I mentioned last time consumers make

14
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,280
constrained choices they essentially

15
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:47,239
make themselves as well as off as

16
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,399
possible subject to a limited budget

17
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:50,239
what we're going to start with today is

18
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,239
forget the limited budget imagine we

19
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,160
just all won the Mega Millions okay

20
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,879
there's no budget we're just going to

21
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,719
ask what to Consumers want and not worry

22
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,640
about how they're going to pay for it

23
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,960
okay so today we're going to talk about

24
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,400
preferences we're talk about what

25
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,320
consumers want and how we translate

26
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,799
those wants and desires into a

27
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:13,560
mathematical formulation that allows us

28
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:14,920
to derive demand curves okay the so

29
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,640
basically we're going to do this we're

30
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:19,880
going to ultimately for Consumer demand

31
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,360
proceed in three steps the first step is

32
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:24,079
we're going to write down our underlying

33
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,240
assumptions about consumer preferences

34
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:28,079
we're going to talk about how consumers

35
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,439
talk about a set of axioms that

36
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:32,040
determine the rules of consumer

37
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:34,799
preferences across

38
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:37,399
Goods we'll then translate those set of

39
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,920
a into a mathematical function we call

40
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:42,520
the utility function which is a

41
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,240
mathematical expression of consumer

42
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:47,759
preferences and then next time we'll

43
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:50,119
introduce the budget constraint and talk

44
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,040
about how consumers make choices given

45
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:54,240
this mathematical utility function and

46
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,560
given the budget constraint they face

47
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,840
okay so that's the road map of where

48
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:01,680
we're going okay so today we're going to

49
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:05,960
talk about pref es axiomatic rules of

50
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:07,439
preferences and how they translate into

51
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,479
the mathematical rules that govern

52
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,560
individual

53
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:14,040
decisions so do this let's start by

54
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,840
talking about

55
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:20,760
preferences and let's talk about the

56
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:23,000
key assumptions we are going to make in

57
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:26,280
modeling consumer

58
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,360
preferences so remember all models make

59
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:31,400
simplifying assumptions we're going to

60
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,519
make um inexact models make simplifying

61
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,879
assumptions we're going to make three

62
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:37,440
assumptions here the first assumption

63
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:39,400
we're going to make so what are the key

64
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,200
assumptions the first assumption we're

65
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,200
going to make is

66
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:50,680
completeness that is we are going to

67
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:53,159
assume that when consumers are faced

68
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:56,640
with two choices they're either going to

69
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:58,560
prefer one or prefer the other or be

70
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,680
indiff but they're going to have an

71
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,879
opinion they're not going to say I don't

72
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,640
know

73
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,879
okay consumers will have opinions over

74
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,400
all possible choices they'll like one by

75
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,840
another they'll be indifferent but

76
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,200
they'll have opinions over all possible

77
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,319
choices it's a complete set of

78
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,280
preferences the second thing is the same

79
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,280
ass subject we've been making since

80
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,519
kindergarten in all our math classes

81
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,519
which is

82
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,239
transitivity okay which is the classic

83
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,720
if you prefer a to B and B to C you must

84
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,879
prefer a to c I'm pretty sure all MIT

85
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,480
students know transitivity by now okay

86
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:31,840
um so that is uh the second key

87
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,840
assumption which is once again not a

88
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,640
great not a big deal the third

89
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,000
assumption is where economics gets its

90
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:40,799
power the third assumption is a new one

91
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,439
which we call the Assumption of nons

92
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,280
satiation or new to you the Assumption

93
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,000
of

94
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,400
non-satiation or basically more is

95
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,879
always

96
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,760
better okay the third assumption so

97
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,640
these assumptions are standard

98
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,239
assumptions make in math class complete

99
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:58,959
Choice sets transitivity nons satiation

100
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:01,760
is new to you that's the assumption that

101
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:04,720
basically more is always better now it

102
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:07,079
doesn't mean more makes you equally

103
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,000
happy it doesn't mean the 10th thing

104
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:10,640
makes you as happy is the ninth thing it

105
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,280
just means the 10th thing is always

106
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:17,239
better than not having it more is always

107
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,759
better okay so basically if you're

108
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:20,519
offered something for free you'll always

109
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:22,120
take it okay it's always better than not

110
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,040
having it that's because we live in a

111
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,320
world of goods you might be thinking to

112
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,000
yourself well if someone offered me for

113
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,840
free you know to stick me in the eye

114
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,560
with a needle I wouldn't take that and

115
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:33,120
you're right cuz that's a bad

116
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,840
for most people I guess but uh we're

117
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,639
going to operate in the world of goods

118
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,600
so as long as things are Goods we always

119
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,960
want

120
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:44,680
more now with those in mind we can

121
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,759
develop what we call indifference curves

122
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,919
which are

123
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,840
essentially preference Maps we're going

124
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:53,400
to map people's preferences into a set

125
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,800
of what we call indifference curves so

126
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:58,000
to do this let's start with a simple

127
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,520
example okay imagine at the beginning of

128
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,560
semester and your parents

129
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,440
are going to give you some money to buy

130
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,919
the two things you care about slice of

131
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,759
pizza and cookies that's all you care

132
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,280
about in this world once again as

133
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,560
someone asked last time work was

134
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,720
simplifying two-dimensional assumptions

135
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,840
in reality of course you care about

136
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,360
buying 20 different things but the

137
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:19,319
underlying logic won't change the math

138
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,800
will just get harder and the graphs will

139
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,240
become multi-dimensional hard to see so

140
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,440
we're going to start with two goods but

141
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,440
everything we do here works with three

142
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,919
four five six Etc Goods okay just harder

143
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:31,319
math and Graphics so so let's say have

144
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:34,479
two goods and let's say you're going to

145
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:38,680
face three choices choice a is you can

146
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:41,000
have two slices of pizza and one cookie

147
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,800
Choice B is you can have two cookies you

148
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,280
can have I'm sorry one slice of pizza

149
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:51,199
and two cookies or Choice C is you can

150
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:53,240
have two slices of pizza and two cookies

151
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:56,720
those are your three choices you're

152
00:05:53,240 --> 00:06:00,160
facing okay and let's

153
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,240
assume given my preferences that I'm

154
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,720
indifferent between A and

155
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,960
B let's assume that given my preference

156
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,880
I'm indifferent between those two now

157
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,120
where does that come from well we are

158
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,479
going to take preferences as Primitives

159
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,000
we're not going to question where

160
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,800
preferences come from people going to

161
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,919
have their preferences it's genetics or

162
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,120
nature nurture whatever that's something

163
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,880
we deep delve more deeply into when we

164
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,919
think about deeper economics but for now

165
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,800
for this class preference is given so I

166
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:28,000
have a set of preferences such that I'm

167
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:31,720
indifferent between those two choices

168
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,520
but I prefer opt C to both okay I'm a

169
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,880
different between A and B but I prefer C

170
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,440
okay so we can now graph my preferences

171
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,000
Andrew can I get a copy the

172
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,960
handout uh so we can now graph my

173
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,800
preferences and the graph of my

174
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,759
preferences is shown in figure

175
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,800
21 okay everyone should have a handout

176
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:49,680
remember they'll always be in the back

177
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,840
when you come in please make sure you

178
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:56,800
grab them as you come in figure 2 one is

179
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:59,800
a map of my preferences okay on the x

180
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,080
axis okay is I believe let me just I'm

181
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,120
going to look at yours for a second you

182
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:06,840
can look at your neighbors on the x-

183
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:09,680
axis is cookies on the y axis is slices

184
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:12,120
of pizza okay so indiff maps are

185
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,080
essentially maps of how you choose

186
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:17,240
between two goods you're choosing from

187
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:19,440
okay so basically this is your

188
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,879
indifference map thank you um this is

189
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,680
your indifference map and what you see

190
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:26,160
is we have mapped the three points a b

191
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:29,840
and

192
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,520
c a is one uh two slice of pizza in one

193
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,479
cookie B is two cookies and one slice of

194
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:37,560
pizza C is two of both and we have drawn

195
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:39,639
a curve between A and B we label this an

196
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,960
indifference curve it's an indifference

197
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:45,000
curve because I said you're indifferent

198
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:46,680
between A and B so there's a one

199
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,039
indifference curve goes through both A

200
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,520
and B because you're indifferent between

201
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:53,479
those choices remember completeness says

202
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:55,240
you can't not care complet completeness

203
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:59,520
says you have to choose but it's okay to

204
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:01,440
be indiff okay but Point C is on a

205
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,080
higher indifference curve because you

206
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,360
prefer Point C to

207
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:07,159
both okay so there's going to be four

208
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,199
properties of indifference curves these

209
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:09,720
indifference curs which you're going to

210
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:13,520
work with extensively throughout the

211
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,520
semester are going to have four

212
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:25,919
properties properties of indifference

213
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:30,840
curves first property okay is consumers

214
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:30,840
prefer higher indifference curves

215
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,919
so the further out the indifference

216
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:39,640
curve is the more preferred it is okay

217
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:42,120
and that just follows from non-satiation

218
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:44,920
more is better so quantities that are

219
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:48,480
further out away from the away from the

220
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:51,680
uh uh away from the origin are better

221
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:54,760
okay the second property is indifference

222
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,760
curves are downward

223
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,519
sloping we're not say anything about the

224
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,720
sheet yet just the slope that

225
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:08,640
indifference curves are downward

226
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:10,640
sloping and once again this follows from

227
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,079
non-satiation why because if

228
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,120
indifference curves were upward sloping

229
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:16,959
it wouldn't sat you wouldn't satisfy

230
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,200
non-satiation look at figure 2 two with

231
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,839
an upward sloping indifference curve an

232
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,079
upward this is just one particular kind

233
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:24,000
of upward sloping IND difference curve

234
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:25,320
but true for all of them if the differ

235
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,600
curve is upward sloping that mean you'll

236
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,920
be a different between one cookie and

237
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,200
one slice of pizza and two cookies and

238
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:33,120
two slices a pizza that would violate

239
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,200
non-satiation you can't be indifferent

240
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,440
between less and more you have to always

241
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,800
like more better so difference cures

242
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,440
have to be downward sloping through

243
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,560
non-satiation

244
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,880
Okay the third is indifference curves

245
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,880
never

246
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:54,839
cross indifference curves never

247
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:57,600
cross and the reason because the

248
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:59,920
difference curves can't cross is because

249
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,760
that would violate transitivity and more

250
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,600
is better so let's look at figure 2

251
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,120
three with Crossing indifference

252
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:09,760
curves

253
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:12,160
okay in this graph figure 2 three A and

254
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,720
B are on the same indifference curve and

255
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,800
A and C are on the same indifference

256
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:18,120
curve that means you must be a different

257
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,360
between a and b and different between a

258
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,000
and C well if you're different between A

259
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,920
and B and A and C by transitivity you

260
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,920
must be IND different between B and C

261
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,760
but that can't be true you can't be

262
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,839
different B and C because B is more than

263
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,880
C okay B is is a dominant you get the

264
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,519
same amount of cookies and more pizza so

265
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,680
you by definition have to like B better

266
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:40,959
than C so you can't be you violates

267
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:43,639
jointly transitivity and

268
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:47,760
non-satiation okay so that's the third

269
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:51,800
property and the fourth property is

270
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:55,600
basically completeness which is which we

271
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:57,720
express as only one indifference curve

272
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,920
through any given point you can't have

273
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,800
two indifference curves that cross

274
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:03,320
through one Point okay so one I see

275
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:07,959
through any given

276
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:09,000
point per Point per precise allocation

277
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:11,480
going be one because otherwise you

278
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,720
wouldn't know how to feel okay there has

279
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,639
to be one IND difference curve through

280
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,680
precise

281
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:18,920
Point

282
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,600
okay so let's with these rules in mind

283
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,920
let's talk about how you can use IND

284
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,959
difference curves here's how I learned

285
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,560
about difference curves when I was

286
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,800
student in 1401 here's how I learned

287
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,959
difference curves actually a semester

288
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,839
later I still didn't quite understand

289
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:32,399
how I left 1401 cuz I was as smart as

290
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,600
you all okay but I had a year op and my

291
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,639
year op was with a graduate student and

292
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,720
this graduate student was trying to

293
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:39,000
decide on where to go for their job and

294
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,360
they said to me look we can express it

295
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,600
in difference curve this is one of a few

296
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,320
graphs I'll draw for you this semester

297
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,760
he said look there's two things I care

298
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:49,920
about I care about school quality like

299
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,800
how highly ranked is where I'm going to

300
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:55,320
go are my colleagues the smartest Etc

301
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:59,600
and I care about location which is how's

302
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:02,880
the weather really this is weather

303
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:06,680
okay and he had two choices his choices

304
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:09,880
were Princeton great quality mediocre

305
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:11,680
weather or Santa Cruz not as good

306
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,800
quality great weather to Santa Cruz I

307
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,440
don't know how anybody studies there you

308
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,839
can like walk out steps out and surf

309
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,880
okay and he basically said look at this

310
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:21,600
point I'm

311
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,720
indifferent I'm indifferent between

312
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,279
better job at Princeton but you know

313
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:28,240
mediocre weather and a worst job at

314
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:29,560
Santa Cruz no offense to Santa Cruz

315
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,760
Princeton's an amazing place Santa Cruz

316
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:34,040
is still a great place but it's not

317
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:35,639
Princeton okay a worst job at Santa Cruz

318
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,680
uh and awesome weather and being able to

319
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:39,240
Surf every

320
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:40,760
day so he said I'm indifferent he said

321
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,600
in the end what did he decide to do in

322
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,600
the end he decided to go to a place

323
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,839
called The

324
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,240
IMF which is not the thing from the Tom

325
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,560
Cruz movies but actually uh the

326
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,519
international monetary fund because that

327
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:55,600
was in DC which had better

328
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:57,399
weather and was so it wasn't as good a

329
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,279
job as Princeton this is Princeton this

330
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:00,600
is Santa Cruz

331
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,920
but it was better weather it wasn't as

332
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,519
good weather as Santa Cruz but it was a

333
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,560
better job and he decided that

334
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,880
combination made him happier is he right

335
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,639
no he's not right there's no sense of

336
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,800
right preferences or your

337
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,240
preferences okay you might all feel very

338
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,079
differently about this set of choices

339
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,040
does anybody's preferences are correct

340
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:18,399
or wrong okay this is just how we

341
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,079
thought about this job choice and how we

342
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:24,600
used an indifference map to explain

343
00:13:21,079 --> 00:13:26,199
it okay questions about

344
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:30,199
that question about how these

345
00:13:26,199 --> 00:13:33,560
indifference curves work yeah

346
00:13:30,199 --> 00:13:33,560
speak loudly so everyone can hear

347
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,560
thanks that's a great question so

348
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,760
basically once again the the question is

349
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:45,160
how do you put quality into this

350
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,639
framework well essentially what you

351
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,160
would do is you would say then I have

352
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,360
two Dimensions be quality and quantity

353
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,560
of one good you'd have to add either a

354
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,079
third dimension or you say it's a

355
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,959
different choice so it we'll do a lot in

356
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:55,959
this course you could think of

357
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:58,800
sequential choices so let's say for

358
00:13:55,959 --> 00:14:01,519
example you want to decide between uh

359
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:03,320
cook and pizza you decide and now within

360
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,959
cookies you want to decide you decide I

361
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:09,440
want to allocate $6 to cookies now I say

362
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:11,920
my choice is one unbelievable $6 cookie

363
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,360
or six terrible $1 cookies that's a new

364
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,680
indifference curve you've already

365
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,600
decided first how many you're going to

366
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:18,720
spend on cookies then you decide so

367
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,600
that's we can always break any monster

368
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,360
decision to a set of sequential

369
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:26,120
two-dimensional decisions so that's how

370
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:30,120
you do it okay good question other

371
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:30,120
questions yeah

372
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,800
yeah yeah I I always get that question

373
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,399
it's technically different but

374
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,399
effectively the

375
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:45,079
same okay good if I don't see your hand

376
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:47,120
by the way shout out it's a big

377
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:49,920
classroom okay so now we're going to

378
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:54,279
move on move on from preferences and go

379
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,279
on to talking about utility

380
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:10,320
okay point two topic two utility okay so

381
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:13,560
basically underlying where preferences

382
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:16,639
come from is a mathematical function we

383
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:19,720
call the utility function it's basically

384
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:21,720
how we mathematically represent these

385
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:25,880
graphical indifference

386
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:27,839
curves okay so it set so for example a

387
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:30,360
common form of utility function will use

388
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:33,079
a lot this semester

389
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:35,160
okay is is the log utility function

390
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:37,800
which is the which we express the form

391
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:40,839
utility is the square root in this case

392
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:43,160
of pizza slices times the number of

393
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:45,079
cookies that is a mathematical

394
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:48,399
representation of preferences it says my

395
00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:50,800
utility is a square root of the number

396
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,319
of slices of pizza times the number of

397
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,880
cookies s stands for pizza because it's

398
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:57,759
slices because we use P Elsewhere for

399
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:59,720
prices I don't be confusing okay so that

400
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,279
says note this is consistent with what I

401
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,759
wrote up there about indifference

402
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:06,079
curse two slice of pizza and one cookie

403
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,360
gives me square root of two utility one

404
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,079
slice of pizza and two cookies gives me

405
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,160
square root of two utility so I'm

406
00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:13,279
indifferent two slice pizza in two

407
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,680
cookies gives me two utility so I'm

408
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:18,519
happier so this is consistent with the

409
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,519
indifference curves

410
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,600
yeah that's a different IND that you

411
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,880
could write down like I said I'm not

412
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,880
judging anybody's preferences but that

413
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,839
would be a different mathematical

414
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:29,319
function this is one of an infinite set

415
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,560
of mathematical functions right down

416
00:16:29,319 --> 00:16:34,079
this is not a true representation this

417
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:35,000
is an example you can write any utility

418
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,120
function you guys want to think of we

419
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,680
can write it down and we'll write down

420
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,880
many of them this semester but I need to

421
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,040
work with this one first till we

422
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,040
understand the rules

423
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,839
yeah what well no but it shows your

424
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:54,639
indiffer between s and C but it would

425
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:57,959
show that you it would show that you are

426
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:59,279
you prefer uh more of both but it's true

427
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:02,319
it shows you're indifferent between s

428
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,319
time C that's absolutely

429
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,799
right between

430
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:13,360
what same as

431
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,520
what oh oh that's a great Point uh

432
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,039
that's an excellent point the reason

433
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,720
we're going to need square root is

434
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:31,360
because it's going to it's it's a form

435
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:32,960
of preferences that's it's a a a rule on

436
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,559
preference going to help us do a lot of

437
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,679
things well in this semester I'll

438
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,799
explain that in one minute it's a good

439
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:40,400
question now I understand thank you yes

440
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:42,160
in fact that question leads to a natural

441
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,280
next question which is what the hell is

442
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:48,799
utility what does it mean and the answer

443
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:50,799
is utility means nothing cardinally it

444
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:53,160
only is meanings ordinally that's what I

445
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:56,400
mean is a utility of three is a

446
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:58,400
meaningless concept utility only matters

447
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,280
in an ordinal sense in the sense of

448
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,200
ranking choices so utility functions

449
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,400
will simply be mappings that we use to

450
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,320
rank choices not mappings that we used

451
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,480
say this choice is 50% better than that

452
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,080
choice it's only for ranking so the

453
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,400
number itself doesn't matter and by that

454
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,679
same question well the ranking of s time

455
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,000
C was the same as ranking of square s

456
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,960
time C so why do we write it that way

457
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,679
okay and the reason we write it that way

458
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:23,159
is because the utility functions of this

459
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:26,360
general form of this power form of less

460
00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:28,840
than one um will deliver an important

461
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:32,679
rear World consequence and we see that

462
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,679
through the notion of marginal

463
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:41,039
utility okay so once again this is just

464
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,400
one form of preferences the question is

465
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:46,039
absolutely right this mapping would work

466
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:47,200
just fine as s time C or S2 time c s or

467
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:49,200
s to the millionth time C to the

468
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,400
millionth because the because the

469
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,600
numbers don't matter it's the ranking

470
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,679
that matters all those little the same

471
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,400
ranking but those functions deliver

472
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,320
something very different which would

473
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:00,159
violate the way we think about the real

474
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:02,760
world which is that basically the

475
00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:04,080
fundamental driver of all consumer

476
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,200
decision will make this semester

477
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,799
remember I said everything I'm going to

478
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,760
tell you a hundred times things are

479
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,200
really important this is really

480
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:15,280
important okay the fundamental driver is

481
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:15,280
the key assumption that we make of

482
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:21,960
diminishing margin

483
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:24,799
utility that is we assume more is

484
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:27,120
better but the next unit is not quite as

485
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:29,760
good as the one before we assume

486
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,720
marginal utility diminishes we assume

487
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,520
each additional unit makes you less

488
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,400
happy than the one before which wouldn't

489
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:38,760
be true if we didn't have the square

490
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:41,720
root function there okay why do we

491
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:44,000
assume that because it makes sense okay

492
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:45,880
it makes sense that basically 10th slice

493
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,559
of pizza makes you less happy in the

494
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:50,000
ninth slice of pizza it makes sense that

495
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,799
the fifth cookie makes you less happy in

496
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,159
the fourth cookie it makes sense that

497
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:55,039
your fifth favorite movie makes you less

498
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:57,240
happy than your fourth favorite movie

499
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:59,360
now it could be tiny increments between

500
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:02,520
them but it makes sense that when you

501
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:05,559
rank things the next one is worth less

502
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:08,600
okay so for example let's go to figure

503
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:10,280
24 and let's hold the number of pizza

504
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,840
slices by the way Andrew we should

505
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:14,440
change that instead of holding pizza say

506
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:17,559
hold pizza slices okay let's change the

507
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:19,360
number of pizza slices constant at two

508
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:21,440
let's assume you you for sure decide you

509
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,280
want two slices of pizza now you're

510
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,240
going to ask yourself how does my

511
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:28,400
utility vary as I uh have additional

512
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,200
cookies the answer is if I have one

513
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,280
cookie

514
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:34,520
my utility is 1.4 of two if I have two

515
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:38,919
cookies my utility is two if I have

516
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:41,240
three cookies it's 2.45 and so on okay

517
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:43,200
basically what you see is that the

518
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:46,400
incremental utility from each additional

519
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:50,000
cookie is falling that's shown in figure

520
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:53,320
2-5 figure 2-5 illustrates diminishing

521
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,520
margin utility each additional cookie

522
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,880
makes you less happy holding constant

523
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,240
the number of

524
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,520
pizzas okay

525
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:04,200
so

526
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:06,280
basically this is an enormously

527
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,679
sensible uh assumption it's an

528
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:10,960
assumption as I said no one can tell you

529
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:13,600
what your preferences should be but it

530
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,960
turns out we think most in we think most

531
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,480
people's preferences satisfy the

532
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,919
principle of diminishing margin utility

533
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,039
and that is going to drive a lot of the

534
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:22,240
mathematics we're going to do this

535
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:24,559
semester it's not we will we will give

536
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,919
you examples where it's not true we'll

537
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:28,120
give you examples of increasing margin

538
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,679
utility and constant margin utility and

539
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:32,880
have you discuss them but we're going to

540
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,880
generally soon diminishing

541
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:50,720
question that's a great question that

542
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:51,960
would be that's um essentially in this

543
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,120
with these

544
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:56,080
preferences it would say that

545
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,799
essentially your preferen are such that

546
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,559
if you can't have a cookie you don't

547
00:21:57,799 --> 00:22:02,279
care how much pizza get that doesn't

548
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:04,919
violate non-satiation because basically

549
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:06,760
that is uh non-satiation says more of

550
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:08,240
everything is better it doesn't say more

551
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,640
of one thing is better more of any one

552
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,200
thing is better non says more of

553
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,120
everything is better it can't be true

554
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,559
that you get more of everything you're

555
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,720
better off it can be true getting more

556
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:18,039
one thing doesn't make you better off so

557
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,600
think about left shoes and right shoes

558
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:20,760
okay it doesn't matter how many once you

559
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,760
have if you only have one left shoe it

560
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,600
doesn't matter how many right shoes you

561
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,240
have so it doesn't violate more as

562
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,400
better it's just but you'll be better

563
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,559
off with two left shoes and two right

564
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,760
shoes than one left shoe and one right

565
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:31,919
shoe

566
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,720
yeah good question good I love these

567
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:37,919
questions thank you so much okay so

568
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:40,799
basically with that in mind let's talk

569
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:42,720
about how do we can now go back and ask

570
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,720
well what drives the shape and slope of

571
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,480
indifference

572
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:49,600
curves okay so what is the slope of the

573
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:51,720
indifference curve the slope of the

574
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,760
indifference curve is the rate at which

575
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:55,919
we're willing to trade off just

576
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:58,840
definitionally mathematically the rate

577
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,640
which we're willing to trade off slices

578
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:03,720
of pizza for

579
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,159
cookies okay the rate which you're

580
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:07,840
willing to trade

581
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:11,279
off trade off basically one good for

582
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:14,559
another okay so we'll call that Delta s

583
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:16,799
Delta C is the slope at any point that's

584
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,919
the slope of the indifference curve the

585
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,080
rate at which you're willing to trade

586
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:21,520
the good on the Y AIS for the good on

587
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,840
the x-axis we're going to just Define it

588
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,480
this way for convenience obviously you

589
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,559
can invert it doesn't change anything

590
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,120
but for convenience we'll always think

591
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:30,200
of it this way the rate at which you're

592
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:33,039
willing to trade the good on the y- axis

593
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,559
for the good on the x- axis okay and

594
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:39,120
we're going to call

595
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:41,679
this the marginal rate of

596
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:45,799
substitution the mrss a key concept for

597
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:48,480
this class the mrss the marginal rate of

598
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:50,159
substitution okay that is the rate at

599
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,919
which you're willing to trade off the

600
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:56,640
good on the y- axis for the good on the

601
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:58,679
x-axis okay now you're not really

602
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:01,120
trading we're not in some ancient barter

603
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:03,880
system where you're trading pizza for

604
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:06,559
cookies but effectively you are because

605
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,880
of opportunity cost given a budget we

606
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:10,440
haven't given you a budget yet but next

607
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:12,400
time we will given a budget any money

608
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:14,840
you spend on Pizza you can't spend on

609
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,159
cookies and vice versa so effectively

610
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:18,919
it's a trade by buying a slice of pizza

611
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:20,000
you're essentially trading away cookies

612
00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:21,400
not the only trading away but you're

613
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
trading away the money you could use to

614
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:26,399
buy cookies okay so in the world with

615
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,399
only two goods whenever you buy one

616
00:24:26,399 --> 00:24:29,480
you're trading away the other now

617
00:24:28,399 --> 00:24:31,080
doesn't operate directly operates

618
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,600
through the budget constraint but that's

619
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:35,799
the way to think about it so you're

620
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,840
substituting pizza for cookies now how

621
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:39,120
does this

622
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:42,200
relate to the utility function well

623
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:44,600
here's what's kind of cool okay think

624
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,600
about an incremental Move Along an

625
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,720
indifference

626
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:50,200
curve an incremental Move Along

627
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:52,159
indifference curve is essentially you're

628
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,880
giving up a little slice a little slice

629
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,720
of piece to get a little more cookie on

630
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:59,399
the margin so that's saying you are you

631
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:02,799
give up Delta

632
00:24:59,399 --> 00:25:04,960
s times the Marg utility of slice so you

633
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,760
give up a little bit of slice of pizza

634
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,440
which you liked mu that's your margin

635
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:11,320
utility for

636
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:13,320
pizza and you're getting a little more

637
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:15,399
cookie which you value at your margin

638
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:17,320
utility for cookies okay that's the

639
00:25:15,399 --> 00:25:20,279
equation of that's a Delta along that

640
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:23,000
curve okay you give up a little pizza

641
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:24,720
which cost you margin utility of pizza

642
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,279
you get some cookies which which gains

643
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,720
you marginality of cookies okay

644
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:35,640
rewriting this we get get

645
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:35,640
that Delta s Delta C which I said is the

646
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:46,640
mrss is equal to minus

647
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:49,159
mu C over muu the mrss is the ratio of

648
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:52,120
margin utilities that is the slope of

649
00:25:49,159 --> 00:25:53,960
the indifference curve is the ratio of

650
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:56,799
the margin utilities and that's how we

651
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:59,039
tie the math and the graph

652
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:00,840
together that's how the math the graph

653
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:04,000
together that basically the slope of the

654
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:06,960
indifference curve is the mrss is the

655
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,799
negative opposite of the ratio of margin

656
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:12,799
utilities now this is very tricky here's

657
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:15,120
the one thing you need to keep in mind

658
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:17,480
which is to remember that Marg the

659
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,840
reason there's a negative sign is that

660
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:21,320
margin utilities are negative functions

661
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:24,440
of

662
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:26,760
quantity the more you get the lower your

663
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:28,799
margin utility is utility is a positive

664
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:30,880
function of quantity but because of

665
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:32,279
diminishing margin utility margin

666
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,840
utility is a negative function of

667
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:37,279
quantity got to keep embed that in your

668
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:39,120
brain okay moris better says utility is

669
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:40,240
a positive function of quantity except

670
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,480
of course in this important case was

671
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,159
pointed out there positive function of

672
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:46,840
both things going up but margin utility

673
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,679
is a negative function of quantity okay

674
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,960
you're less Happy by the next

675
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:54,760
incremental unit than you were by the

676
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:58,360
ones before okay so basically as you get

677
00:26:54,760 --> 00:27:01,320
fewer slices and more cookies what is

678
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:02,080
happening well the Marg ility of slices

679
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,440
is

680
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,480
rising you're giving up pizza slices so

681
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:08,960
your Marg utility is going up the

682
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:11,919
marginality of cookies is

683
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:15,360
falling okay so what you get is

684
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:18,880
basically a decline in the value of the

685
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:21,440
mrss the margil of pizzas is slightly

686
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:24,799
Rising okay margil cookies is slightly

687
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:27,159
falling this ratio Falls so the mrss

688
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:30,919
Falls so you get this downward

689
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:32,559
sloping indifference curve okay so this

690
00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:33,799
is sort of hard so let's see this

691
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:35,960
mathematically and graphically let's

692
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:37,720
start with the math okay let's start

693
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:41,679
with the

694
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:45,919
math okay we said utility is the square

695
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:47,200
root of s * C okay so what is the margin

696
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,960
utility of cookies well we're just going

697
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:52,200
to differentiate this with respect to C

698
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:56,480
differentiate this function with respect

699
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:58,880
to C what do you get so Delta U Delta C

700
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:01,240
you get 0.5

701
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:04,880
time the number of slices of pizza over

702
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,880
the square root of s *

703
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:13,919
C okay what is the margin utility of

704
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:15,600
pizza slice of pizza you get

705
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:21,679
du

706
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:23,880
DS equals 0.5 * C over Square < TK of s

707
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:26,559
* C and once again I apologize for the

708
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:28,919
handwriting please ask if it's not clear

709
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:30,640
okay so I'm just differing this function

710
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:34,159
to get the two Marge

711
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:37,120
utilities okay if I take based on these

712
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:41,919
two Marge utilities the mrss which is

713
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:46,399
the the negative of the ratio the

714
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:47,919
mrss equals minus s over C for this

715
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:49,880
particular example don't these aren't

716
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:53,240
general rules I'm deriving here for this

717
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:56,720
example the mrss is minus s over

718
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:58,600
C so basically what the Mrs is showing

719
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:02,399
you is

720
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:04,600
that the mrss for slice of cookies for

721
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:06,360
slice of pizza opposed to cookies is

722
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:08,480
rising as you get more slices and foll

723
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:10,960
as you get more cookies so let's see

724
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:14,799
this in figure

725
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:17,360
26 okay figure 26 shows the indifference

726
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:19,399
curve again but now with the mrss is

727
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,559
plotted remember the indifference curve

728
00:29:19,399 --> 00:29:23,559
is not linear in this case so mrss

729
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:25,159
changes along the indifference curve so

730
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:27,320
I'm giving you local

731
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:28,679
approximations to the mrss at different

732
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:30,360
points to the indiference curve but it's

733
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:32,720
very important to remember this is key

734
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:35,279
because the DI Mission utility you are

735
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,279
going to get

736
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,880
yeah

737
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:52,320
right yeah yeah figure 2.5 is just

738
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,480
giving you local approximations those

739
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,600
points are solved by differentiation but

740
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:59,840
those are local

741
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:01,039
approximations okay yep so basically um

742
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,240
that's the thing our graphs are never

743
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:03,799
going to be as precise as our math

744
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,240
because we of because we essentially

745
00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:07,240
want to use linear mathematics for

746
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:08,320
nonlinear for nonlinear graphs and so

747
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,519
we're going to end up with a lot of

748
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:12,240
local local

749
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:13,960
approximations okay so basically in

750
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:19,640
other words at Point

751
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:22,200
a okay um at Point a um you have four

752
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:23,919
slices of pizza in one cookies at point

753
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,279
B you have two of each and at Point C

754
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:27,480
you have four cookies and one slice of

755
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:29,480
pizza and according to this utility

756
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:31,880
function you're indifferent right all

757
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:33,919
those give two as the utility all those

758
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:38,039
combinations give utility of two you're

759
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:39,120
indifferent okay now but at Point a even

760
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:40,720
though you're different between all

761
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:44,679
three points they have very different

762
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:47,080
mrs's at Point a the mrss is minus four

763
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:49,880
you would be willing to give up four

764
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:53,559
slices of pizza to get one

765
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:55,880
cookie at Point C the mrss is minus

766
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:58,760
one4 you'd be willing to give up only

767
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:00,399
one slice of pizza to get four cooked

768
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:03,080
why what's changed between points A and

769
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:04,720
C why is the Mrs changed so radically

770
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:07,000
between points A and

771
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:09,039
C

772
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,080
yeah what

773
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:14,120
sorry you have you have fewer slices of

774
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:15,880
pizza exactly so basically what's

775
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:17,200
happening is as your slice of pizza

776
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:19,840
Falls and then by definition your

777
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:22,000
cookies goes up your margin utility of

778
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,840
pizza Rises and your Mar utility cookies

779
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,519
fall when you're point a you really want

780
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,679
pizza you're happy to give cookies to

781
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,960
get pizza because you get I'm sorry you

782
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:30,480
really want want cookies I'm sorry my

783
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,880
bad at Point a you really want cookies

784
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,399
you got four slices of pizza you're full

785
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:36,240
already you want a cookie okay when

786
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:37,519
you're at Point C it's like what do you

787
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,600
do with four cookies you're not going to

788
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,320
have enough protein in your dinner your

789
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:42,679
mom will be upset okay so you basically

790
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:46,039
want to trade some of those cookies back

791
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:48,240
for some pizza okay and then at point B

792
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:49,600
you see the mrss is minus one because

793
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,919
given this utility function at that

794
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,399
point you're essentially

795
00:31:50,919 --> 00:31:58,159
indifferent you're indifferent between

796
00:31:53,399 --> 00:32:01,559
pizza and cookies at point B Okay so so

797
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:05,159
that that is why we

798
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:08,159
graph we graph the um we graph the

799
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:10,320
indifference curves uh in this way as

800
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:13,039
concave uh as concave indifference

801
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:16,480
curves concave to the origin because

802
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:17,799
basically we want um we want to satisfy

803
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,480
this principle diminishing marginal rate

804
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:20,480
of substitution for those you who really

805
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:23,639
want to be

806
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:25,240
technical the real technical definition

807
00:32:23,639 --> 00:32:26,440
is diminishing margin substitution you

808
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:28,440
don't always have to have diminishing

809
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:30,080
utility we generally you could write

810
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,440
down functions which don't have dimin

811
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:34,360
utility but do have diminishing Margate

812
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:36,360
of substitution if you are so inclined

813
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:38,399
the technical definition is is that what

814
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:40,000
drives what what drives utility theory

815
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:41,559
is diminishing margin R of substitution

816
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,159
but almost always we'll have diminishing

817
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:44,200
margin utility as well that's all I'll

818
00:32:43,159 --> 00:32:46,880
say about it you can forget it if you

819
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:48,240
want but if it's bugging you that's why

820
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,799
okay

821
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,760
now consider what would be like I'm

822
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:54,799
sorry so it's it's convex to the origin

823
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:57,080
my bad I'm sorry convex to the origin in

824
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:58,399
difference curves convex in difference

825
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:00,000
curves consider what would be like with

826
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:02,519
a concave to the origin and difference

827
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,720
curve as in figure

828
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:07,559
27 consider what life would be like we

829
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:09,679
often do proes by the negative okay this

830
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:12,639
is for the utility function figure 27 is

831
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:16,240
for is drawn for the utility function

832
00:33:12,639 --> 00:33:19,080
X2 plus y^2 =

833
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:22,679
65 that's utility function that's graph

834
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:25,159
there well uh I should say S2 Plus I

835
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:30,480
shouldn't say X and Y I should say

836
00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:33,919
S2 S2 Plus C s equal

837
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:36,320
65 okay now once again you can't tell me

838
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:38,919
that utility function is wrong people

839
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:41,360
have different preferences but it

840
00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:43,760
doesn't satisfy what we could think is a

841
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:47,159
common sense principle which is that

842
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:49,360
would say that when you have eight

843
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:52,600
slices of pizza in one

844
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:55,399
cookie you you'd be willing to give up

845
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:58,279
um when you have eight slices of pizza

846
00:33:55,399 --> 00:33:59,919
uh and one cookie you would give up only

847
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:01,799
an eighth of a slice of pizza to get a

848
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:04,000
cookie so you really wouldn't give up

849
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:05,519
much pizza to get a cookie and yet when

850
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,399
you're down all the way of having seven

851
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,879
cookies and four slices of pizza then

852
00:34:07,399 --> 00:34:10,760
you give up almost two slices of pizza

853
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:13,320
to have a cookie it doesn't make sense

854
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:15,159
why would you give up more pizza when

855
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:16,839
you have less Pizza when you already

856
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:19,240
have eight slices of pizza why are you

857
00:34:16,839 --> 00:34:21,599
less L of a a pizza for a cookie than

858
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:22,960
when you have more slices of pizza uh

859
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:25,320
when you have fewer slices of pizza and

860
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:27,839
more cookies it doesn't make sense

861
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:29,919
that's why we gener now it doesn't make

862
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:32,679
sense let's be clear I'm not saying it's

863
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:34,480
inconsistent with reality okay like I

864
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:37,440
said we don't have strict laws like

865
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:39,079
equal MC s in this class there's someone

866
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,960
out there who has these preferences I

867
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:44,359
guarantee it what I'm saying is most

868
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,879
people do not and so we're going to try

869
00:34:44,359 --> 00:34:48,079
to in this class like I said make a

870
00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:49,720
series of simplifying assumptions that

871
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:51,760
explain most of reality even they

872
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:54,639
explain 100% of reality okay and

873
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:57,760
diminishing mrss is one of those

874
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:59,839
assumptions okay and that's why um

875
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,640
diminishing mrss makes

876
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:05,400
sense uh because it delivers the fact

877
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,839
that the more you have of one good the

878
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:09,800
less you care about having the next unit

879
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:11,240
of it okay let me stop there questions

880
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:13,920
about that this is really really

881
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:14,920
important for all of consumer Theory

882
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,280
it's actually going to be important for

883
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:18,720
production Theory too this General

884
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:20,520
notion of diminishing production the we

885
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,440
call it diminishing marginal product but

886
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:23,839
it's going to be the same sort of thing

887
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:26,240
so questions about how this where this

888
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:26,240
all comes

889
00:35:26,359 --> 00:35:30,720
from okay

890
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:32,440
you know throughout this class you want

891
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,200
to ask yourself does this pass the mom

892
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:36,680
test that is could you go home and

893
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,800
explain this to your non-economist mom

894
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,320
and you should understand this well

895
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:41,119
enough that you can I don't know if

896
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:42,359
she'd be interested but it doesn't

897
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:45,000
matter she's your mom she has to listen

898
00:35:42,359 --> 00:35:47,960
to you so basically make sure you

899
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:52,200
understand it that well okay now let's

900
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:52,200
go to an example yeah I'm sorry go

901
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:57,040
ahead uh the only point of a concave

902
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:59,000
disc would to represent the set of

903
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:01,280
preferences I wrot there I mean there's

904
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,280
no there's no point or not point it's

905
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,920
just simply saying that there exists

906
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,040
someone in the world who has that

907
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:08,119
utility function this is their

908
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:11,359
preferences but you won't generally ever

909
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:13,319
see one does that make

910
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:16,760
sense all

911
00:36:13,319 --> 00:36:18,440
right okay so let's go to an example

912
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,920
there's actually a wonderful example of

913
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:21,319
diminishing margin utility and how it

914
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:25,440
operates in the real

915
00:36:21,319 --> 00:36:28,720
world which is um different

916
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:31,079
sizes of consumer goods of consumer uh

917
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:33,560
consumption Goods so for example at

918
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:36,000
Starbucks according to Alex's detailed

919
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:37,440
research you can get a tall ice coffee

920
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,480
for

921
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:42,119
$455 or you can get twice as much coffee

922
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,960
whatever the hell they call the big one

923
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:47,480
for 90 more cents so $455 for the

924
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:50,839
smallest 90 cents more to double your

925
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:52,599
amount of coffee or McDonald's a small

926
00:36:50,839 --> 00:36:55,000
Coke is

927
00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:58,400
229 a large Coke which is more than

928
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:01,079
twice as big is 299

929
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:04,200
so essentially you are paying much less

930
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:08,560
to increase the quantity why is

931
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:08,560
that yeah loudly so we can here go

932
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:15,400
ahead exactly so you think about

933
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:19,359
yourself walking to McDonald's on a on a

934
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:21,760
hot day okay or Starbucks on a cold day

935
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:23,240
and you really need to be saded you're

936
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,760
you're you're either very very cold or

937
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:28,040
very hot you need to be SED but a small

938
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:31,079
will get you most of the way there now a

939
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:32,880
large is better buy more is better but

940
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:34,599
it's not as much better you just needed

941
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:37,200
to be Sav you need to make sure you got

942
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:39,400
your your liquids in so you're not

943
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:42,000
willing to pay as much for the

944
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:45,560
incremental quantity you're not willing

945
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:50,359
to pay as much and the key thing is that

946
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:53,040
basically um uh that companies recognize

947
00:37:50,359 --> 00:37:54,520
this and this is where we start to dip

948
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,720
into producer

949
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:58,440
Theory companies are making their

950
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,960
business decision

951
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:02,119
based on what they know about consumer

952
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:03,920
preferences this is why someone asked

953
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:05,200
you know why we ever have a concave

954
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:07,640
indifference curve this is why companies

955
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,000
don't believe they're concave uh uh

956
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:11,640
concave indifference curves because they

957
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:15,119
price this way they know that most

958
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:17,839
people care less about the additional 16

959
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:19,560
ounces they do about the first 16 ounces

960
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:20,839
now if if maybe you all thought that was

961
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:23,560
common sense or maybe you never thought

962
00:38:20,839 --> 00:38:25,480
about why that is but this is once again

963
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:27,079
an illustration of how a common

964
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:28,119
phenomenon in society that exists

965
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:30,160
everywhere

966
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:31,880
can be explained by what's an incredibly

967
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,680
simple model remember we came into this

968
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:35,359
class knowing nothing about utility and

969
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,599
all that stuff we' already got an

970
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:39,000
explained an incredibly important

971
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:40,920
phenomenon in the world and there's many

972
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,640
other choices and things that you'll see

973
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:46,319
that that can be explained by this model

974
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:49,319
OKAY questions about

975
00:38:46,319 --> 00:38:49,319
that

976
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:55,480
yeah great question someone to answer

977
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:59,440
that how does it benefit Starbucks and

978
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:59,440
McDonald's yeah

979
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:04,520
Yeah so basically if they McDonald's if

980
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:05,760
if they price essentially the

981
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:07,920
calculation we ar going to producer

982
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,880
Theory yet but I'll give you a heads up

983
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:13,040
the calculation McDonald's and Starbucks

984
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:15,400
are doing are I want to you're right the

985
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,839
next let's say the next let's say the

986
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,119
first I mean the cost the inputs of

987
00:39:16,839 --> 00:39:20,440
stuff is so cheap I mean you'd be

988
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:23,560
disgusted how McDonald's for their sodas

989
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:25,000
it's like probably about three three to

990
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:27,000
four cents for them to make a soda in

991
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,359
terms of the marginal cost of a soda

992
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,480
Okay so let's say it's 3 cents for a

993
00:39:28,359 --> 00:39:34,119
small and 4 cents for a large okay so

994
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:36,119
basically they're if if they couldn't

995
00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:37,839
get if preferences were such and you can

996
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:39,440
write preference this way where I never

997
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:40,800
want anything more than a small like

998
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,520
literally our stomachs can't hold more

999
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,839
than a small then they nobody pay a

1000
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:48,000
penny more for a large and they wouldn't

1001
00:39:44,839 --> 00:39:49,920
make it but nobody's that way every most

1002
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,359
people pay a penny more for a large so

1003
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,240
then your question is how much more can

1004
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:55,319
I charge before people don't want the

1005
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:57,160
larges anymore and that's essentially

1006
00:39:55,319 --> 00:39:59,119
the calculation they're doing is there

1007
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:00,400
they comput and they've got people

1008
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:04,040
hundreds of people doing this all the

1009
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:05,680
time saying look if we charge 69 cents

1010
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:07,800
people buy the large if we buy if we

1011
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:10,520
charge 70 cents people buy a couple

1012
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:12,240
fewer larges but we make one cent more

1013
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:14,079
but once it go about 71 no longer makes

1014
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,319
sense and that's essentially the

1015
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:17,280
business decision making we'll talk

1016
00:40:15,319 --> 00:40:18,720
about in a few lectures which is how to

1017
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,839
businesses decide how to set their

1018
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,960
prices here we're just showing this set

1019
00:40:20,839 --> 00:40:24,520
their prices and response to a principle

1020
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,520
we now know is generally true which

1021
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:27,800
diminishing marginal rate of

1022
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:30,599
substitution

1023
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:32,599
other questions good question other

1024
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:34,839
questions all right well let's stop

1025
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:37,240
there um we will it's a little early but

1026
00:40:34,839 --> 00:40:39,240
that's all I got for today so we will uh

1027
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:40,400
come back on Wednesday and we'll talk

1028
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:44,400
about what happens when you actually

1029
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,400
have a limit on how much you can spend
