1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,570

2
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:11,700
All right, so my
name is Bill Green.

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,660
I'm the Director of the
MIT Energy Initiative.

4
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,843
I want to thank you all for
coming to our first seminar

5
00:00:17,843 --> 00:00:18,510
of the semester.

6
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,760

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,160
The MIT Energy Initiative
sponsors this speaker series

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,850
to try to help the
people on campus

9
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:32,780
keep informed about
what's happening,

10
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,680
to try to decarbonize
our energy system,

11
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:41,410
and also to help people
recognize the urgency of motion

12
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,193
to try to make change happen.

13
00:00:44,193 --> 00:00:45,610
And we have a
speaker today that's

14
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:48,010
going to talk about some
pretty urgent work going on

15
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:50,360
to try to make change happen
here in Massachusetts.

16
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:54,030

17
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:59,820
The MIT Energy Initiative is the
hub of energy research at MIT.

18
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:07,920
And one of its roles is to bring
leaders of industry, government,

19
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,120
non-profits, and academia
to come to campus

20
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,200
to talk to the community, and
also to participate in workshops

21
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,690
and research projects
and conferences

22
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:23,080
with the people actively working
on the energy transition here.

23
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:27,260
The global energy system is,
of course, super complicated.

24
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:31,270
It's complicated with
today's fossil fuel system.

25
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:33,130
It's going to be
complicated in the future

26
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,950
with a coming clean
energy system.

27
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,820
And there's many,
many different parts.

28
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,362
And today we're going to hear
about one really important part

29
00:01:40,362 --> 00:01:43,630
that's particularly important
for Massachusetts is offshore

30
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:44,710
wind.

31
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:48,040
So different parts of the
world have different resources

32
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,730
and different situations.

33
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:52,690
And one resource we've got
plenty of here is wind.

34
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:56,770
And particularly in the
south coast of Massachusetts,

35
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:57,760
it's really windy.

36
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,395
And it's really fantastic for
providing clean energy here.

37
00:02:01,395 --> 00:02:04,660

38
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:08,720
The entire energy system is, of
course, extremely complicated,

39
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,740
as I said.

40
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:13,010
And one part of it is
providing electricity.

41
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:16,300
And that's what we're
going to hear about today.

42
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,280
Today we use fossil fuels
for many, many, many things,

43
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,320
not just to make electricity.

44
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,630
And so many people on
campus are doing research

45
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:29,080
on all sorts of other
parts of the energy system

46
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,280
because we have to
really change everything.

47
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,880
And so the scientists
and engineers

48
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,400
here have a really
big role to play

49
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,860
to help develop the
technologies that

50
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,570
will become the real
industries of the future.

51
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:44,180
Today we're going to hear
about industry of the present,

52
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:47,410
I guess is like the time is
now to put in the windmills.

53
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,570
And we'll hear about that.

54
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,370
But we have many
other technologies

55
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:54,910
that are under development
here at MIT or from startups

56
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:57,850
or technology that's
spun out of MIT that's

57
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:03,050
going to help to change
other sectors of the economy

58
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,445
and clean up the other sectors.

59
00:03:04,445 --> 00:03:06,980

60
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:10,100
But here in Massachusetts,
offshore wind

61
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,900
is the really big story.

62
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,830
So the legislature has
decided that that's really

63
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:20,150
the biggest future contributor
to clean energy in the state

64
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:23,990
and has passed some special
laws to try to help that along.

65
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:27,630
And in response to that,
a lot of companies,

66
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:30,080
including Vineyard
Offshore, which

67
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,120
we're going to hear
about today, are

68
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,640
working to try to
actually make that real,

69
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,350
to get the windmills out
there, get the wires connected,

70
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:42,920
get the electrons flowing to
power MIT, to power Boston,

71
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,110
to power the whole state.

72
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:47,000

73
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,480
Today's speaker
is Alicia Barton.

74
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,690
She's the CEO of Vineyard
Offshore, which is currently

75
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:56,450
involved in offshore wind
projects here in New England

76
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:00,020
and also in California and
I think maybe off New York

77
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,790
as well.

78
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:05,120
Before Alicia took
her present position

79
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,680
leading Vineyard Offshore,
she worked in other parts

80
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,380
of the clean energy sphere.

81
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:15,500
She was previously the CEO of
the Massachusetts Clean Energy

82
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,670
Center.

83
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:19,820
And she was president and CEO
of the New York State Energy

84
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,920
Research and
Development Authority.

85
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:26,630
And even more recently, she was
CEO of Firstlight Power, which

86
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:29,900
is a New England Based clean
energy producer and storage

87
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,610
company.

88
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:35,590
As CEO, Alicia is
responsible for developing

89
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:40,120
Vineyard Offshore's portfolio of
six gigawatts of offshore wind

90
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,220
projects, which
currently includes

91
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,530
a site 15 miles
south of Nantucket

92
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,880
and Martha's Vineyard
in Massachusetts,

93
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,960
and a second site
proposed for 29 miles

94
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,690
off the shore of
Nantucket, and also

95
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:56,270
another proposed site off the
shore of Long Island, and then

96
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:00,560
a different site off
the shore of California.

97
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,300
During the presentation,
you can submit questions

98
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,230
that we'll ask the
speaker after the talk.

99
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:10,880
You can submit them
electronically using

100
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,390
the QR code.

101
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,150
Is it on the screen?

102
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,700
Not yet.

103
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,130
It will be on the screen.

104
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:21,320
Or else you can just type the
letters Poll, capital P-O-L-L,

105
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:27,147
ev.com/mitei, M-I-T-E-I. And
then you go to that link.

106
00:05:27,147 --> 00:05:28,730
And you'll be able
to submit questions

107
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:34,250
for the Q&A. So please join
me now in gratefully welcoming

108
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,780
Alicia Barton.

109
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:36,833
Thank you.

110
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:38,125
I'm going to grab this clicker.

111
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:44,710

112
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,780
OK, maybe I'll
stand here to start.

113
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,380
And then we'll go there for Q&A.
Is that what you want to do?

114
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,080
Great.

115
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,170
Well, good afternoon,
good evening, everyone.

116
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,770
So nice to see people
here interested to talk

117
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:59,650
about offshore wind, which
certainly is an incredibly

118
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:05,080
important topic to the energy
future of Massachusetts,

119
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,130
and certainly well beyond.

120
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:09,320
I really appreciate that
generous introduction.

121
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,070
Bill, thank you also for
inviting me to be here

122
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,840
to talk about this topic.

123
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,410
I'm going to fast forward here.

124
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:18,740
You did a great job
highlighting our portfolio.

125
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,200
And I have a map,
which maybe will

126
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:24,100
make it a little bit
easier for folks to digest.

127
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,970
And so again, just a little
bit about Vineyard Offshore.

128
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:32,320
Maybe Bill didn't
mention, we're 100% owned

129
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,240
by Copenhagen Infrastructure
Partners, which

130
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,530
is a private equity fund
based in Copenhagen,

131
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:37,930
as the name implies.

132
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:41,420
That is actually the
largest private equity fund

133
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:44,000
that's solely dedicated to
greenfield renewable energy

134
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,610
development.

135
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:45,930
It's about 10 years old.

136
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:48,440
Offshore wind is a core
part of their business.

137
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,180
And we serve as the US
offshore wind development arm.

138
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,490
The US being one of their
larger global markets.

139
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:56,360
But they have projects
all over Europe and Asia

140
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,420
and truly all over the world
in offshore wind, as well as

141
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,940
other clean energy
infrastructure.

142
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:04,170
So our portfolio, as
Bill was outlining,

143
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,848
includes the Vineyard
Wind One project,

144
00:07:05,848 --> 00:07:07,640
which I'm going to talk
a little bit about.

145
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,280
And that's a project that's
under construction, which

146
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,560
is incredibly exciting milestone
to be able to say finally

147
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:19,250
after many years of many
people working very hard to see

148
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,110
that day come to New England.

149
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,820
And then we have the
site further offshore,

150
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:27,950
which we have proposed as our
Vineyard Wind Two project, which

151
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:31,617
was recently awarded a new
contract from Massachusetts.

152
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,450
And I can talk a little
bit more about that.

153
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:35,160
We have our Excelsior
Wind Project,

154
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,580
which is off the coast of
New York and New Jersey

155
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,830
and plan to interconnect
onto Long Island.

156
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:45,020
So helping in that case New
York meet its very aggressive

157
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:49,040
clean energy and offshore
wind specific targets.

158
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,520
And then we have this
project in California.

159
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,900
And that's on up on the
northern coast of California.

160
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,025
It's maybe a little bit
hard to tell from this map.

161
00:07:57,025 --> 00:08:00,150
But it's actually pretty close
up there near the Oregon border.

162
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:04,700
And that is a project
that, unlike the other ones

163
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:09,110
on the East Coast, will
be deployment of floating

164
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:10,620
offshore wind technology.

165
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,530
So on the East
Coast, we're talking

166
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:14,610
about all fixed
bottom offshore wind.

167
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:16,610
I'm going to assume if
you came to this lecture,

168
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:19,590
you know generally
what offshore wind is.

169
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,290
You know that
there's a lot that's

170
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:22,790
been deployed in
Europe and globally

171
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:25,400
and not very much that's
been deployed here.

172
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,290
And that's kind of
the story that I

173
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:28,470
wanted to start by telling.

174
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,800
And then I really would
prefer to spend more time

175
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,260
in conversation with you, Bill,
and taking audience questions.

176
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:39,679
But I think thinking about
the topic of the talk

177
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,760
and finding a new
era of success,

178
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,770
the way I was thinking
about this story is really

179
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:48,410
to zoom out from
necessarily our projects

180
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:50,930
and talk about the arc of
offshore wind in the US

181
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,080
and where we are
today, what's hard,

182
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,620
and what's been challenging,
and where we're struggling,

183
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,940
and then also where
we're succeeding.

184
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,948
And I do think there's actually
a lot of exciting things

185
00:09:03,948 --> 00:09:06,240
that are going to happen in
the not too distant future.

186
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,550
I didn't bring any other
substantive slides.

187
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,660
I just brought some nice
pictures of our projects.

188
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,750
I love these pictures.

189
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:16,520
So just indulge me
in sharing them.

190
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,260
And I'm not going to share
all the captions or anything.

191
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,430
But these are real
world pictures

192
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,240
of the Vineyard Wind Project.

193
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,740
So Vineyard Wind is 800
megawatts and as I said,

194
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,250
is in the midst of construction.

195
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,870
Some of you probably
also read that we

196
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:35,090
did have a construction
accident over the summer

197
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:36,180
with a blade that broke.

198
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,660
I can talk more about that.

199
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:42,823
But generally speaking, I would
say prior to the blade incident

200
00:09:42,823 --> 00:09:44,240
getting a lot of
attention, really

201
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,520
known for being the first
large scale offshore wind

202
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:50,190
project in the US to move
forward to construction.

203
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,980
And it really has been
a long time coming.

204
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:57,020
So thinking about, again, that
arc of offshore wind progress

205
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,760
in the US, I was
thinking about it

206
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:02,630
in my own personal history
working on offshore wind, which

207
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:06,920
goes back 15 years, which for
the US is quite a long time.

208
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,068
15 years ago there
weren't that many people

209
00:10:09,068 --> 00:10:10,110
working on offshore wind.

210
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,110
There weren't that many
people talking about it.

211
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:14,450
But Massachusetts was.

212
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:17,850
And so I was thinking about
this in a few chapters.

213
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,320
And the first
chapter, I would say,

214
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,827
was really Massachusetts'
initial efforts

215
00:10:21,827 --> 00:10:23,660
to launch offshore wind,
which were centered

216
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:27,350
on a prior project called
Cape Wind, which some of you

217
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:28,350
may recall.

218
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:31,770
It was extremely well known
and extremely controversial,

219
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:34,730
had significant political
opposition and local opposition

220
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:38,270
on Cape Cod, including from
significant political figures,

221
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,850
like Ted Kennedy amongst
others, as well as

222
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:43,580
opposition from well known
people, like the Koch

223
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,732
brothers and the like.

224
00:10:45,732 --> 00:10:47,690
There literally have been
many books and movies

225
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,080
written about that project.

226
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,440
So you guys can check that out
if you want to dig a bit deeper.

227
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,320
But what Massachusetts
was doing at the time

228
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,200
was really placing
a bet that if we

229
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,370
could get one project launched,
then the rest of the projects

230
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,130
would follow.

231
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:03,980
And that was a strategy.

232
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,912
It was a purposeful strategy of
saying, we just need to get one.

233
00:11:06,912 --> 00:11:08,120
We need to show this as real.

234
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,490
And then things will take off.

235
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:14,280
And so I won't belabor
all the details.

236
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,690
But the utilities in the
state were essentially

237
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:23,030
coerced or encouraged to
enter into long-term contracts

238
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,670
with that project to
make it financeable.

239
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:29,510
More significantly, I
think, as we sit here

240
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:36,050
today, the state made a
very long-term effort,

241
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:39,590
sort of took the long view and
made a significant investment

242
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:42,660
in the first offshore wind
port facility in the US.

243
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,588
So this is in New
Bedford, Massachusetts.

244
00:11:44,588 --> 00:11:45,630
Maybe you've heard of it.

245
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:46,380
Maybe you haven't.

246
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:49,940
But back then, when I was CEO of
the Massachusetts Clean Energy

247
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,590
Center, we on behalf
of the Commonwealth

248
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:55,610
took state bond funding
and invested at the time

249
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:59,180
$130 million into a
port in New Bedford

250
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:02,510
to renovate it to be the first
purpose built offshore wind

251
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:04,700
facility in the US.

252
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:09,300
The offshore wind requires very,
very specialized capabilities,

253
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,163
including heavy
loads for the cranes

254
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:12,830
and the size and scale
of the components

255
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:13,950
that we're talking about.

256
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,820
So that project, just
to place it in context

257
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,850
to this first chapter, I'm
talking about Cape Wind.

258
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:23,270
Think of it as
2007 to 2015 or so.

259
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:27,140
We finished the New Bedford
Marine Commerce Terminal

260
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,810
construction in January of 2015.

261
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:34,310
Cape Wind failed and canceled
its project in January of 2015

262
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:34,860
as well.

263
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,820
And so that was a
very painful episode

264
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:42,200
and an extremely clear to
some of us that were there

265
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:47,160
growing pain of the industry
and one that at the time,

266
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,120
many people said, will there
be offshore wind in the US?

267
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:50,820
We tried.

268
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,110
We had this strategy.

269
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,550
We were going to
build a project.

270
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,630
That project failed.

271
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,040
Has the whole strategy failed?

272
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,440
And I think that was an
open question for some time.

273
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,140
But then we entered what
was the second chapter.

274
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,930
And it really was,
I think, a lot

275
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:06,620
of work amongst
policymakers, stakeholders

276
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:11,580
to think about, OK, this isn't
really just about one project.

277
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,110
This is about our
climate targets.

278
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,930
This is about the
fact that this is

279
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:17,010
a mature technology in Europe.

280
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:19,312
This is about jobs
that can be created.

281
00:13:19,312 --> 00:13:20,520
And that started to catch on.

282
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,810
So when I was the CEO
of Mass CEC from 2012

283
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:27,260
through the end of 2015, it
was a very lonely conversation

284
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,900
when I would talk to my
peers in other states.

285
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,963
And I would go to New
York, for example,

286
00:13:31,963 --> 00:13:34,380
and say, you guys should really
think about offshore wind.

287
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,755
And they're kind
of like, yeah, I

288
00:13:35,755 --> 00:13:39,290
think we'll watch how it goes
for you guys first and think

289
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:40,620
about that a little bit later.

290
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:44,030
But then in that next phase,
the Massachusetts legislature

291
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,750
passed a bill in 2016.

292
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,960
And now I'm thinking
about basically 2016

293
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,410
through 2020 as this next
chapter, passed the first bill

294
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:53,280
that set up a procurement.

295
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,690
So this was a
different strategy.

296
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:55,770
We're going to have competition.

297
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,840
We're going to invite
multiple parties to bid.

298
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,960
We're going to see
what the prices are,

299
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,350
see if we can imagine this
power being affordable.

300
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:08,250
That was a big concern at the
time and run that playbook.

301
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:11,600
And as they started doing
that, some other states

302
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,320
started paying
attention as well.

303
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,500
New York called me
back and said, OK, we

304
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,590
want to do offshore wind.

305
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,590
Would you want to come
over here and work on it?

306
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:21,410
And that's when I went to
take the job at NYSERDA,

307
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:23,580
leading New York's
climate efforts.

308
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:26,677
And a lot of exciting
things happen.

309
00:14:26,677 --> 00:14:28,760
I mentioned Massachusetts
passing that legislation

310
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,910
that set up the procurement.

311
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,160
That was the procurement
that led to the Vineyard Wind

312
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:32,760
Project.

313
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,940
So that was a PPA that
was awarded back in 2017.

314
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:39,500
So again, just keeping
the time horizons in mind,

315
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,150
Vineyard Wind would
ultimately start

316
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:44,640
using the New Bedford Marine
Commerce Terminal in 2023,

317
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,720
so eight years after we
finished the construction.

318
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,670
So we were definitely
early on that.

319
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:57,410
And another six years after
the initial procurement

320
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:59,760
to give them the
contract to get going.

321
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,390
But New York passed a
landmark climate law

322
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:06,380
that I'm extremely proud
of to require the state

323
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,660
to fully decarbonize its grid.

324
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:11,250
We were picking up
momentum in this time.

325
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,320
And it wasn't just
Massachusetts and New York.

326
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,695
It's the other
New England states

327
00:15:14,695 --> 00:15:18,710
had started issuing contracts
as well down into Maryland

328
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,860
and Virginia.

329
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,600
And we started to see momentum.

330
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,850
But real progress was still a
little bit elusive in this 2016

331
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:29,010
to 2020 time period.

332
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,690
And it may be intuitive.

333
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:33,770
But that also coincides
with the first presidency

334
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:38,090
of Donald Trump, who is
not a fan of offshore wind

335
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:42,140
as presumably many
of you are aware.

336
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,580
So we had the states
moving forward.

337
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:47,228
But we lacked a partner
at the federal government

338
00:15:47,228 --> 00:15:49,020
that was really going
to help us get there.

339
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:52,670
And I was trying to get
new leases issued off

340
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,590
the coast of New York
in my role on behalf

341
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:55,710
of the state of New York.

342
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:58,410
And we were frankly running
into brick walls there.

343
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:01,508
Vineyard Wind had its
power contract now.

344
00:16:01,508 --> 00:16:03,300
Massachusetts came up
with this new policy.

345
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:03,883
They competed.

346
00:16:03,883 --> 00:16:05,000
They won.

347
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
And yet still they couldn't
get their permits out

348
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,390
of the federal government.

349
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:12,830
And so some of you may remember
during that time towards the end

350
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:16,760
of the Trump presidency, had
to withdraw their permits

351
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,220
essentially and undertake
a fairly risky strategy

352
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:22,860
to try and bet on a
future administration.

353
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:26,180
And so we then went
into what was definitely

354
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:29,160
the most exciting time we've
had for offshore wind in the US.

355
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,370
So when President Biden
takes office in 2021,

356
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:34,460
he issues the New
York Bight leases.

357
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,280
He starts issuing permits,
including very soon

358
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,810
after taking office the
permit for Vineyard Wind

359
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:42,190
to allow the project
to go forward.

360
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:46,467
And so in 2021, 2022,
and starting into 2023,

361
00:16:46,467 --> 00:16:47,800
all these things were happening.

362
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,370
We started to get a
massive number of projects

363
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:54,900
contracted for power with states
up and down the East Coast.

364
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:59,130
We started to see the federal
government issuing new leases,

365
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:00,245
record prices.

366
00:17:00,245 --> 00:17:01,620
The New York Bight
lease, the one

367
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,859
that I had tried to extract
from the Trump administration

368
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:08,010
on behalf of New
York, ultimately

369
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:12,121
cleared many billions
of dollars in revenue

370
00:17:12,121 --> 00:17:13,329
when they ran the lease sale.

371
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:17,579
And it was more than any
offshore oil and gas leasing

372
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,540
effort previous in history.

373
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:23,250
So that was incredibly exciting
and validating for the fact

374
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,079
that not only, again, is
this a climate initiative.

375
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,370
We know that there's
real capital that's

376
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:31,920
ready to work to do this.

377
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:36,010
And then amidst all these
positive things happening,

378
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:37,830
including Vineyard
Wind finally getting

379
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:41,250
to financial close, which
is a critical milestone

380
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:45,330
to allow projects to move
forward and start construction.

381
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:48,030
We ran into the
story that everybody

382
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:53,520
knows around interest rates,
inflation, global supply chain

383
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:59,820
crunch, and, again, started
to hit more of a down cycle

384
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,230
for sure.

385
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:04,980
And that really came
to a head in 2023.

386
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,800
And then here into
2024, we saw projects

387
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,550
canceling their
PPAs with states.

388
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:14,730
They were saying, essentially,
we contracted this previously

389
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,980
at prices that we can no
longer deliver on when

390
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,220
we go to the supply chain.

391
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:20,173
It's extremely crowded globally.

392
00:18:20,173 --> 00:18:21,840
And one thing people
should keep in mind

393
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,750
is that we're a new
market here in the US.

394
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,970
And we're competing
against projects

395
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:28,450
in a global marketplace.

396
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:30,450
So when we want to place
an order for turbines

397
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:35,260
or high voltage
electrical equipment,

398
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,660
we are competing against
projects all over the world.

399
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,720
And the US candidly is
viewed as a risky market.

400
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,320
We're newer.

401
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,680
We don't have a
significant track record.

402
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,790
We have, unfortunately, ongoing
political risk with change

403
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,090
in administration risk.

404
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:52,840
So those things tend to
drive up the costs as well.

405
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,460
So we saw a lot of
contracts canceled.

406
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:58,530
We also saw-- and this has been
super unfortunate, I think--

407
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:03,400
the number of commitments for
supply chain manufacturing,

408
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,770
domestic manufacturing in
the US backtrack away from--

409
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:13,380
that's been one of the
policy goals of advocates

410
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,990
of offshore wind has been
to set up a domestic supply

411
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:18,900
chain to create the jobs,
not only in construction

412
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,520
but manufacturing jobs as well.

413
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,610
And there's strong long-term
rationale for that.

414
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:26,950
The components that we're
talking about are so massive,

415
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,650
it really does make
sense to manufacture

416
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:31,050
them close to where they will
be deployed rather than shipping

417
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:33,480
them all over the world on
highly specialized vessels that

418
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,850
are extremely scarce.

419
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:42,470
But we saw, for example, in
New York, for my company,

420
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:45,920
we'd contracted with GE to
build a next generation turbine.

421
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,650
And they were going to do
manufacturing for blades

422
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:51,320
and the cells of the wind
turbines in Upstate New York

423
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,780
and decided that they
couldn't make that work

424
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,700
and had to cancel
those plans, which

425
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,410
led to further power
contract cancellations,

426
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:00,800
including our project.

427
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:07,520
And so, I think, to me, it's a
very clear story of two steps

428
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,070
forward, one step back.

429
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:13,970
Every time we're making progress
we've found a new growing pain

430
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:18,440
for an early industry, found
additional challenges that maybe

431
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,428
sometimes could have been
foreseen, maybe they couldn't.

432
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:23,720
One of those challenges, and
I touched on this already,

433
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:27,950
was also, as the first large
project to go to construction,

434
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:29,630
we did have a
construction accident

435
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:34,310
this summer where we had one of
the blades on a single turbine

436
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:39,120
fail catastrophically and break
and shed debris into the water.

437
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,080
This is not something
that's super common

438
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,830
in the global offshore
wind industry.

439
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:45,080
It has been pretty
common in onshore wind.

440
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:49,030
There are quite a lot of
blades that break historically.

441
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:52,720
But when that happens
on land, the debris

442
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,670
lands and settles
in a certain spot

443
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:58,930
rather than being carried
to many places, which

444
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:00,650
is what occurred with
us over the summer,

445
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:03,370
where we had debris washing
up on the shores of Nantucket

446
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:06,460
and Cape Cod particularly.

447
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:09,730
I think that incident
has gotten what

448
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:14,940
I would say is maybe a bit
outsized attention everywhere

449
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,440
I go.

450
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,300
But, of course, people know
what I do for a living.

451
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:21,325
It comes up a lot.

452
00:21:21,325 --> 00:21:24,772
I want to put the impacts
of that incident in context.

453
00:21:24,772 --> 00:21:26,230
I think it's
important because I do

454
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:30,130
think the media has been a bit
misleading on this at times.

455
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:31,670
So there were no injuries.

456
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:33,320
There was no private
property damage.

457
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,810
Our blade was damaged but no
private property, no vessels,

458
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:37,700
no docks, nothing like that.

459
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:43,500
We have no evidence of any
species being injured or, again,

460
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:47,420
sort of killed or anything
like that you see.

461
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:51,410
We did have one day of beach
closures on part of Nantucket

462
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:52,770
in an abundance of caution.

463
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:55,020
But they were reopened
the next morning.

464
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:59,250
And we've been hard at work
with debris recovery ever since.

465
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,880
So, again, when you
put that in context

466
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,530
of the environmental damage,
I think, from, frankly,

467
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:11,180
any fossil fuel plant that
is constantly emitting--

468
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:14,000
well, you know what
fossil fuel plants emit.

469
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,830
Let alone oil
spills and the like,

470
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:19,710
I think it's important to just
keep this relativity in context.

471
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:22,130
But at the same
time, we're new here.

472
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:24,690
We're the new industry,
and all eyes are on us.

473
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:28,670
And, undoubtedly, this was a
setback in a learning experience

474
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:31,460
that hopefully will make
the industry stronger

475
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:35,070
and that we will learn from
as we go to this next chapter.

476
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:38,940
Now, this is the part that
I'm really excited to share.

477
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,440
And it's easy to
lose track of it.

478
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,570
So, again, you kind of, I
think, hear about offshore wind.

479
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,120
You hear, OK,
Vineyard Wind's going

480
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,600
to construction, that's great.

481
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,730
All these contracts are
getting canceled over here.

482
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:49,375
That doesn't sound so great.

483
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:51,140
What's really happening?

484
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,600
If you look at the pipeline
of offshore wind projects

485
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,150
in the US, this next
chapter is going

486
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:58,640
to start in 2025, which,
of course, coincidentally

487
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,590
coincides with the start of a
new presidential administration.

488
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,840
And we don't know which
administration that will be.

489
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:08,600
But whichever administration
it is, we have, essentially,

490
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:12,920
8,000 megawatts or 8 gigawatts
of projects that have

491
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,290
their federal permits,
have power contracts,

492
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:18,510
and are reaching financial
close and going to construction.

493
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:23,545
So next year, in the first
term of either Trump or Harris,

494
00:23:23,545 --> 00:23:25,170
whoever ends up taking
the White House,

495
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:28,400
we will have 8,000 megawatts of
offshore wind under construction

496
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:34,310
in this country, which is just
an extraordinary maturation

497
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:37,970
and finally catching up to where
we've hoped to be all of these

498
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:38,580
years.

499
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:41,330
And it's sort of--

500
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:43,870
there's a weight to
that as an industry that

501
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:45,430
is very, very
different than what

502
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:47,000
we've confronted in the past.

503
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,560
And so I get a lot of
questions about what

504
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,580
happens if Trump gets elected.

505
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:55,040
Does that mean offshore wind
will never happen in the US?

506
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,170
And I would say, absolutely not.

507
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:59,380
And, again, we're going to
have 8,000 megawatts under

508
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,557
construction, which
is extremely sizable.

509
00:24:01,557 --> 00:24:03,640
I mean, that's enough power
for four million homes

510
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:07,030
just to give you a sense of it.

511
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:11,710
And I think it'll
be hard for anyone

512
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:15,280
to want to slow
down or curtail jobs

513
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:19,810
that are actively going for
folks in the construction

514
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:20,750
industry.

515
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:23,590
The Vineyard Wind Project,
some great statistics--

516
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:26,870
we've already created just on
our one 800-megawatt project,

517
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:30,410
so, again, about 10% of what
I'm talking about for next year,

518
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:36,280
1,200 union jobs and closer
to 5,000 total jobs in terms

519
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,850
of the construction
of that project.

520
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:40,000
And we do rigorous
tracking of the jobs

521
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,960
because it's a really important
part of the validation of why

522
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,510
states are investing in this
technology and supporting it.

523
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:52,430
So I think that's
a game changer.

524
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:54,960
I don't mean to suggest that
it doesn't matter, though.

525
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,730
And I think if you
look at, again,

526
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:58,430
that sort of arc and
the story that I'm

527
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:01,970
telling, having committed
public policy that

528
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:05,730
makes long-term investments
is really critical.

529
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:07,850
And that's been part of
what's been successful,

530
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:12,660
Massachusetts investing in
New Bedford over a decade ago.

531
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:17,460
But realizing the benefits of
that now, where, for example,

532
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,970
we have multiple other
offshore wind ports

533
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:23,510
that are now being constructed
or under construction

534
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:26,068
and soon to be completed
in Massachusetts to support

535
00:25:26,068 --> 00:25:28,610
the offshore wind industry-- so
we made the first investment,

536
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,470
and others have followed.

537
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:33,390
And, again, you see that
up and down the East Coast.

538
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:37,430
And I can go into specifics for
other states if it's helpful.

539
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:42,385
And so I think with a supportive
federal administration

540
00:25:42,385 --> 00:25:45,010
and supportive states-- and we
aren't seeing states really slow

541
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:45,790
down.

542
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:48,070
Part of the reason I think
they're not slowing down

543
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:50,470
on offshore wind is
that there aren't

544
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:54,310
a lot of good alternatives
to decarbonize dense load

545
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:57,295
centers on the East Coast
of the United States.

546
00:25:57,295 --> 00:25:59,900
I think we could talk
about possibilities.

547
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,163
But the way I look at it
and have spent a lot of time

548
00:26:02,163 --> 00:26:03,580
looking at it over
the years, I do

549
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:06,460
think offshore wind is
absolutely needed in order

550
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,680
for us to be able to get
to a clean electricity

551
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:12,550
grid from New England down
through the mid-Atlantic

552
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:14,260
for sure.

553
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:17,890
So there's a lot to
be positive about even

554
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:21,890
despite the challenges that
we continue to navigate.

555
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:27,310
And I'm really excited to see
so many people paying attention

556
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,460
to the industry.

557
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:32,560
It's a joy to try and paint
a picture of what's really

558
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,420
happening for people,
sharing pictures

559
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,580
like these that are reality.

560
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,740
Maybe some of you have
driven by a New Bedford,

561
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,950
and you've seen these things.

562
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:41,180
I mean, they're massive.

563
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:45,460
The other one is if you take
the Acela between New York

564
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,980
and Boston, you see
the New London Pier.

565
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:50,830
And they have offshore wind
turbine components there

566
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:51,440
in and out.

567
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,080
And it's really fun to see.

568
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,490
When I'm on the
Acela with my kid,

569
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:57,430
I'm pressing my face
up against the glass.

570
00:26:57,430 --> 00:27:00,550
And everybody's like, what
the heck are they looking at?

571
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:04,030
But these are tangible
signs that we are actually

572
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:07,250
taking steps to decarbonize the
electric grid for the future.

573
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,370
It's not happening fast enough.

574
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:11,870
And we have definitely had
setbacks along the way.

575
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:15,077
But we're starting to
put the pieces together.

576
00:27:15,077 --> 00:27:16,660
And I have a lot of
thoughts about how

577
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:20,290
we can make this next chapter
the one where we do things

578
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:23,950
faster and don't have so
many of the same challenges

579
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:24,620
that we've had.

580
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,710
But I think I'll leave
it there and maybe

581
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:28,270
get into the discussion.

582
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:28,780
All right.

583
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:29,903
Thank you.

584
00:27:29,903 --> 00:27:33,284
[APPLAUSE]

585
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:34,250

586
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:36,230
OK, thanks.

587
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:39,680
So we're going to sit in the
front here and do a little chat.

588
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:45,620
And please email in--

589
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,000
I don't know where the--

590
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,470
the QR code up there to--

591
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:51,413
you can show how to do--

592
00:27:51,413 --> 00:27:52,080
I think it was--

593
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:52,872
--with your phones.

594
00:27:52,872 --> 00:27:53,820
--back here, right?

595
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:54,580
There we go.

596
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:55,300
Look at that.

597
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,320
So you can send
questions in that way.

598
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:01,600

599
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,460
So thank you again
for the nice talk

600
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:08,190
and for your hard
work over many years,

601
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:14,120
in many roles, all culminating
to this important project.

602
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:17,840
And maybe you can comment, what
do you think in the long term--

603
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,810
what are the most important
ways that energy markets

604
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:24,320
have to change to support
these large-scale deployments

605
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,870
of offshore wind and other
large, large projects like this?

606
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:30,800
Yeah, I mean, the
energy market question

607
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,650
is one that I think
we've gotten hung up

608
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:35,550
on quite a bit over the years.

609
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:37,350
And it's not an
easy one to solve.

610
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:40,323
So, again, the states that
we're talking about primarily--

611
00:28:40,323 --> 00:28:42,240
and I hope I don't go
too far into the weeds--

612
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,110
but are in what we consider
regulated electricity

613
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:49,160
markets, where you have,
essentially, wholesale markets

614
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:57,410
really premised on
competition and, by and large,

615
00:28:57,410 --> 00:29:02,360
merchant power sales that rely
on those markets to function.

616
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,985
And then here comes
offshore wind along

617
00:29:03,985 --> 00:29:06,568
with some other renewables and
says, well, that doesn't really

618
00:29:06,568 --> 00:29:07,200
work for us.

619
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,590
We need certainty.

620
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:12,480
We need a 20-year contract,
a 30-year contract.

621
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,700
And the states have
gone along with that,

622
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:18,350
which has teed up a
bit of a collision

623
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:20,960
between competitive
wholesale electricity markets

624
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,500
and long-term contracting.

625
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:26,450

626
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:29,600
As I said, I think
to some degree,

627
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,390
I think, we've maybe
overworried about that.

628
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:35,280
And we'll see whether that
turns out to be right or wrong.

629
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,800
But, essentially,
right now we're

630
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:40,130
in such a cyclical upturn
in the need for power

631
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:43,580
that having multiple
avenues to do

632
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:47,480
that, including the
existing wholesale energy

633
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,930
markets plus new contracting
efforts, seems to make

634
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:52,110
seems to make sense.

635
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:53,930
There's been quite
a lot of discussion

636
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:57,230
about carbon pricing in those
wholesale electricity markets.

637
00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:00,800
And that is something
that the New England

638
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,980
ISO has studied
extensively, New York ISO

639
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,160
has studied extensively.

640
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:09,260
It is a good idea
and could work.

641
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:13,130
And it has zero political
support and essentially

642
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:15,600
no chance of happening
any time soon.

643
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:20,090
So I think people aren't
wrong to point out

644
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:21,690
the benefits of carbon pricing.

645
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:22,530
It would be there.

646
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:25,790
But we're not in
a political moment

647
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:28,940
right now where we can afford
to wait for something like that

648
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:29,730
to come along.

649
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:34,670
And so our pitch
to the states is

650
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:38,360
to continue to put in place the
contract structures that will

651
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,170
allow projects to move forward.

652
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:42,950
We have lots of specific ideas
about how those contracts should

653
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:44,200
be structured.

654
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,370
I think, interestingly,
one of the things

655
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:52,430
that you hear
increasingly from the ISO,

656
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:55,670
who's in charge of grid
reliability here in New England,

657
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:59,203
is that we hear a lot about
winter reliability and gas

658
00:30:59,203 --> 00:31:00,620
pipeline constraints
because we're

659
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:01,850
at the end of the pipeline.

660
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:04,257
And in the winter gas supply
gets taken up for heating.

661
00:31:04,257 --> 00:31:06,090
And then there's not
enough for electricity.

662
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:08,210
But the biggest thing we
can do to shore up winter

663
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:11,990
reliability is to build as
much offshore wind as we can.

664
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:14,660
ISO New England has been
pretty increasingly clear

665
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:17,680
about that in recent years,
which is extremely helpful.

666
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:21,390
So you have to think about
it from the multiple angles

667
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:25,360
of reliability, affordability,
and also decarbonization,

668
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,220
which under the
current construct,

669
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,670
those wholesale markets
aren't really legally allowed

670
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:31,650
to take cognizance of.

671
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:34,300
So we're in a bit of
an imperfect situation,

672
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:38,400
I would say, with the contracts
maybe not fitting neatly

673
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:41,890
in competitive wholesale
market structure.

674
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:46,290
But I think on balance,
that's where we need to be.

675
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:48,100
Maybe just two follow
ups about that.

676
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:51,840
So one is, it seems like
the offshore wind is maybe

677
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:56,610
analogous to nuclear that it
needs gigantic amount of capital

678
00:31:56,610 --> 00:32:00,690
upfront and, therefore,
some special arrangement

679
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:01,300
in the market.

680
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:04,410
It's not the same as a little
merchant gas turbine coming in.

681
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:07,650
But then I'm wondering why you
think the carbon pricing would

682
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:08,700
be so impossible.

683
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,190
I mean, the state legislature
able to intervene, set up

684
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:13,440
a market that's going to
make it possible for the wind

685
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,350
to come in--

686
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,767
you'd think they could also
intervene and do whatever they

687
00:32:16,767 --> 00:32:20,610
wanted with the carbon pricing?

688
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:23,870
I mean, again, I think it's one
that kind of perplexes people

689
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:26,930
at an intellectual level because
there's a lot of rationale

690
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:28,500
for those arguments.

691
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,880
And, again, you have
credible neutral entities

692
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,850
like ISO New England or New
York ISO making those arguments

693
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:38,420
and saying, this would
be a good way to do this.

694
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:41,540
But what we've seen-- and it's
been in New England states

695
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:44,550
and New York and down
in New Jersey as well--

696
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:47,030
to your point about
nuclear is some

697
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:50,930
of those plants needing to
get state contracts in order

698
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:51,960
to keep operating.

699
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,680
And in many cases,
those contracts

700
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:58,290
have been justified on the
basis of retaining jobs,

701
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:02,450
frankly, which tend to
be a little bit more

702
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:07,910
politically motivating than
more esoteric discussions

703
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:09,600
about the needs of
the electric grid.

704
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,490
At least that's been
somewhat my experience.

705
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:17,850
I can't say for sure exactly why
carbon pricing hasn't taken off.

706
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:19,870
I'm sure we all have our
own theories about it.

707
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:23,942

708
00:33:23,942 --> 00:33:26,400
So I know when I was working
in New York for the governor's

709
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:30,240
office there, they looked at,
for example, carbon pricing

710
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,343
ballot initiatives
in other states,

711
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:34,260
including Washington
State-- maybe some of you

712
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,730
have followed-- had, I
think, three different times

713
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:39,480
taken a carbon pricing
ballot initiative to voters

714
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,460
and failed every time.

715
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:43,930
It's just really considered
politically unpopular.

716
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:46,090
It's like a gas tax or
something like that.

717
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:48,220
I was thinking not for
general carbon tax.

718
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:51,540
Just in electricity, it seems
like the consumers apparently

719
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,950
aren't aware of what
controls electricity prices.

720
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:57,630
So let's put the carbon tax
in there just as a way to--

721
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:59,880
I think, at the end of
the day, the governors

722
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,330
have to get
comfortable with that.

723
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:05,100
And I think that's
been a hard sell.

724
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:09,870
Changing topics, what are some
of the important research areas

725
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:12,480
that you think that
MIT and the engineers

726
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,920
here should be working on?

727
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,449
Great.

728
00:34:14,449 --> 00:34:14,969
Yes.

729
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:16,150
And I meant to say
at the beginning--

730
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:18,442
I'm always so nervous to
speak to an audience like this

731
00:34:18,442 --> 00:34:19,710
because I am not a scientist.

732
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:20,790
I'm not a technologist.

733
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:23,210
And I can't answer
very detailed questions

734
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:26,180
about offshore wind technology.

735
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:29,010
I'm definitely more on
the business, commercial,

736
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:30,540
and policy side of things.

737
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,540
But we do support--

738
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:35,400
and in my prior
roles-- and, in fact,

739
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,900
I was just talking to DOE
yesterday or something

740
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:42,590
about what is most impactful to
industry in terms of R&D funding

741
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:44,820
and what are the
challenges that we need.

742
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,139
And there are a bunch.

743
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:49,489
It's an extremely long list.

744
00:34:49,489 --> 00:34:51,350
I would say, for
example, going back

745
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:53,989
to the Vineyard
offshore portfolio,

746
00:34:53,989 --> 00:34:57,080
looking at California
and West Coast markets.

747
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:00,690
Floating technology is a
place where a lot of R&D

748
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:02,100
is still really needed.

749
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,460
That's a newer
technology globally,

750
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:09,900
where, again, fixed bottom,
more traditional offshore wind

751
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:10,650
has been deployed.

752
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:16,220
There's 40 gigawatts built in
China, 20 in the EU, another 15

753
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:19,165
the UK, I mean, massive
numbers, lots of projects,

754
00:35:19,165 --> 00:35:20,540
whereas floating
is still-- we're

755
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:22,280
talking about a
handful of projects

756
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,970
and a small number of megawatts.

757
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:27,240
So in order for that
technology to catch up--

758
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:32,420
and that's everything from
constructability of the floating

759
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:36,800
platforms, how do you get
manufacturing and port

760
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,770
infrastructure that can actually
handle those types of logistics?

761
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:44,430
What's the anchoring technology
at various water depths?

762
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:46,200
Truly, you could go
on and on and on.

763
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,490
And it is a big focus of DOE
to continue to advance floating

764
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:52,370
technology, which will be
helpful to that next generation

765
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:53,370
globally.

766
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:58,542
But even for our projects
on the East Coast,

767
00:35:58,542 --> 00:36:03,242
there's interesting
R&D happening around

768
00:36:03,242 --> 00:36:07,100
how vessels, frankly, do their
work in a market like the US,

769
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,737
where we're a bit
constrained to the Jones Act.

770
00:36:09,737 --> 00:36:11,820
I don't know if people
know what the Jones Act is.

771
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:15,470
But, essentially, it
places restrictions

772
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:19,080
on having workers on
foreign flagged vessels.

773
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,020
And, again, the
vessels that we rely

774
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:23,910
on in the offshore wind industry
to date are foreign flagged.

775
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:26,030
There is a single wind
turbine installation vessel

776
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:27,270
under construction in the US.

777
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:28,145
That'll be the first.

778
00:36:28,145 --> 00:36:29,630
It's not done yet.

779
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:33,200
And so you have to come up with
creative feeder barge systems

780
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,080
to move components to
and from these vehicles

781
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:39,230
without going back to shore
in the US, which is not

782
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,790
allowed under the Jones Act.

783
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:46,085
And so there's actually
very interesting research

784
00:36:46,085 --> 00:36:49,700
and demonstration projects
around things like that.

785
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:56,750
Grid integration and getting to
better points of interconnection

786
00:36:56,750 --> 00:37:00,110
and more seamless
interconnection of offshore wind

787
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:01,970
to a grid that
really wasn't built

788
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,740
to take offshore
wind in the places

789
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,640
where it's going to
go near the coast,

790
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:10,110
that's another place that we've
been urging DOE to take action.

791
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:13,910
And I should say that DOE
recently awarded the New England

792
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:18,320
states almost $400
million for this power

793
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,420
up proposal to actually
do a number of things.

794
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,630
But this also includes
new substations

795
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:25,760
for offshore wind
injection capacity

796
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,360
that DOE will be funding under
the Bipartisan Infrastructure

797
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:28,860
Law.

798
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:32,530
So those are some of the
things that we see as needs

799
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:36,320
and addressing real pain
points that we have today.

800
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,012
That's great.

801
00:37:38,012 --> 00:37:39,470
Maybe we can talk
about the blades.

802
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:41,870
Everybody wants to talk
about the broken blade.

803
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:45,740
So we recognize that
the blade is not really

804
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,940
a major issue from the
environmental point of view.

805
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:48,660
There's some cleanup.

806
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,077
But compared to
other things, it's

807
00:37:50,077 --> 00:37:51,590
really pretty small potatoes.

808
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:54,410
But I do wonder, what does
it mean for your development

809
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:56,160
schedule for your project?

810
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,570
And, particularly,
I think that GE also

811
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:01,838
has another blade break in UK?

812
00:38:01,838 --> 00:38:03,380
So it suggests that
maybe something's

813
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:05,780
wrong with the design,
or I don't know.

814
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:11,240
So, again, I'm not trying to
minimize the blade break, which

815
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:16,250
is a real setback
and, gosh, really just

816
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:18,380
unfortunate on a
number of levels.

817
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,990
So as you alluded to,
GE is the manufacturer

818
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:24,200
of the wind turbines, including
the blades that are being

819
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,940
installed on Vineyard Wind.

820
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:29,630
They are also deploying those
same blades and turbines

821
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:32,010
on a project in the
UK called Dogger Bank,

822
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:35,240
where they did have, in
fact, two other blades break

823
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,360
this summer.

824
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:40,370
Those have gotten some attention
here because of their connection

825
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:42,540
to what happened at
Vineyard Wind in Europe.

826
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,090
They've gotten very
little attention

827
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:47,000
from the public, which is just
its own interesting contrast

828
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,750
to how we react to
incidents in the US

829
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:53,650
versus other parts of the world.

830
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:57,910
Each of those, GE has provided
some information publicly

831
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:58,730
about the cause.

832
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:01,280
And they are not
actually connected.

833
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:05,890
So there were no installation
issues and error basically

834
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:09,700
in lifting the blade in
one case on Dogger Bank.

835
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:12,820
But the issue at Vineyard
Wind GE has disclosed

836
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,210
is a manufacturing error.

837
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:16,030
So there was
insufficient bonding.

838
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:21,200
The blades are-- they're made
of fiberglass, foam, and wood,

839
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,050
very similar to boats,
extremely similar to boats.

840
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:27,567
So, again, it is unfortunate to
have that debris in the ocean.

841
00:39:27,567 --> 00:39:29,650
But there's actually quite
a lot of similar debris

842
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:31,940
already in the ocean,
which is not a good thing.

843
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:35,080
But it is the reality of it.

844
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:39,700
Every time people do maintenance
on boats and other things,

845
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:43,360
there's a lot of similar
debris that can occur.

846
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,780
And so that's something
that we are still

847
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:50,230
assessing the full ramifications
of in terms of the manufacturing

848
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,920
issue that has been identified.

849
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,480
The safety regulator,
federal safety regulator,

850
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,600
is highly involved.

851
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,100
And we are going
through a process

852
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:02,070
to re-review and inspect every
single blade on the project.

853
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:03,770
And we don't have
a certain timeline

854
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:05,390
for when that will
be complete, which

855
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:07,307
means I don't have a
certain timeline for when

856
00:40:07,307 --> 00:40:09,110
the project will be complete.

857
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:10,520
I hope you--

858
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,690
I think it should be next year.

859
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:14,270
I just don't know--

860
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:17,060
I just don't know which month.

861
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:21,260
To what extent has local
support for offshore wind

862
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:23,840
and for the associated
industry and jobs

863
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,670
helped with the construction
of Vineyard Wind?

864
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:32,150
And during the Cape Wind
era, the local opinion

865
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:33,200
was the opposite way.

866
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,760
And it caused a lot of
trouble for that project.

867
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,610
Can you talk about--

868
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:37,910
Yeah.

869
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:39,870
--the public perception
in the local community?

870
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,370
I think it's super important.

871
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:43,140
And it's definitely
not monolithic.

872
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:45,630
There's a lot of
different views out there.

873
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:47,600
But it is really relevant.

874
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:51,300
And it comes up in
terms of a project.

875
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,460
I'm thinking not just
about Vineyard Wind.

876
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,550
But as we're developing
our next projects,

877
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:57,470
can we get host
community agreements

878
00:40:57,470 --> 00:40:59,010
where we need to land the cable?

879
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:01,910
Can you get local permits?

880
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:05,030
And it is really important.

881
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:08,150
It plays into the federal
permitting process.

882
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:11,660
And I think our company
actually really tries

883
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,670
to pride ourselves on
what we call a community

884
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:15,810
first development approach.

885
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:20,170
And we focus on
purposeful partnerships.

886
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:24,090
And so when we brought
forward our recent bid that

887
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:26,850
went in New York
about a week ago,

888
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:29,520
we had over 100
letters of support

889
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,890
from different organizations
and communities

890
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:35,350
and elected officials that
were supportive of the project.

891
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:37,890
And that takes a lot of work.

892
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:41,170
Typically, where we've seen
the opposition historically,

893
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:42,630
there's some view
shed opposition.

894
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:45,030
And that is still a thing.

895
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:49,050
There is also concern
from the fishing industry

896
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:52,320
about impacts of offshore
wind on restricting

897
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:55,680
the areas at which
they can do their work.

898
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,860
I think it's really
cool to point out

899
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:00,190
and not super well known.

900
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:02,670
But we've actually hired
a ton of fishing vessels

901
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:04,070
on the Vineyard wind project.

902
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:08,710
They do things for us in terms
of servicing the project.

903
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:11,340
They also help with--
we have requirements

904
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:12,990
under our federal
permits to monitor

905
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:15,550
for protected species, the
North Atlantic right whale

906
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:16,293
but also others.

907
00:42:16,293 --> 00:42:18,210
And so we hire fishing
vessels to be out there

908
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:20,920
and be our eyes and ears
for protected species.

909
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:24,790
So there is economic opportunity
for fishing industry,

910
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:28,740
in addition to mitigation
payments that we also make

911
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:30,970
available from the project.

912
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:33,180
So that's one version.

913
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:34,830
There is a--

914
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:36,280
I want to address it.

915
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:39,510
There's a lot talk
about whale impacts.

916
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:42,030
That's something that
increasingly comes up

917
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:43,620
in the media.

918
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:45,360
And I'll be pretty
blunt about this.

919
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:48,000
By and large, it's
just fake news.

920
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,570
That is just fake news.

921
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:51,360
There has been a
tremendous amount

922
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,160
of purposeful
disinformation that's

923
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:56,433
being shared about whale
impacts or whale deaths

924
00:42:56,433 --> 00:42:58,600
from offshore wind, none
of which has been verified.

925
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:01,470
It's been reviewed.

926
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:04,020
I mean, every
allegation has been

927
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:07,560
reviewed by federal
officials at NOAA, so

928
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:11,380
the National Oceanographic and
Atmospheric Administration.

929
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:14,440
Many independent
researchers at universities

930
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,890
have been reviewing
the evidence.

931
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:20,190
And it's just not there.

932
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:22,410
There's a couple different
versions of the story

933
00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:23,020
that you hear.

934
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:26,330
One is that the vessels
are making too much noise.

935
00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:27,580
And that's harming the whales.

936
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:30,000
The other is just
that, I don't know,

937
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,070
the vessels are striking
the whales or something

938
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:36,730
like that as part of pile
driving or something.

939
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:40,330
And there's truly
not much behind that.

940
00:43:40,330 --> 00:43:44,010
What there has been
validation of is-- actually,

941
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:47,170
Brown University put out a study
that's fascinating on this,

942
00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:50,170
tracing a lot of
the whale stories,

943
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:53,370
and I'm just going to say,
tied it back pretty clearly

944
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:56,400
as part of an
investigative effort

945
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,320
to fossil fuel funded
industry efforts.

946
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:02,460
And there is a very purposeful
disinformation campaign

947
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:03,820
on offshore wind and whales.

948
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:05,260
And I don't say that lightly.

949
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:07,180
I'm not just making
an idle allegation.

950
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:09,263
You can go to the
Brown University study.

951
00:44:09,263 --> 00:44:10,680
It's been written
up in The Boston

952
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:13,670
Globe and numerous other
credible media outlets.

953
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:16,630

954
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:22,120
There's an agenda here to fight
change, fight energy transition,

955
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,020
fight progress.

956
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:25,800
And one of the--

957
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,988
I don't think I would have
imagined this or foreseen

958
00:44:27,988 --> 00:44:28,780
it a few years ago.

959
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:31,920
But one of the tactics that
they've really centered on

960
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,870
is trying to highlight this
potential impact to whales.

961
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:39,720
I have to say, I've
learned multiple examples

962
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,830
of dirty politics
in clean energy.

963
00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:44,050
It's really a little
disheartening, actually.

964
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:46,050
But I we have dirty
politics in a lot of things.

965
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:51,180
So maybe that shows us
part of the mainstream now.

966
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:55,980
Will the power grid and
transmission infrastructure

967
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:58,900
be ready if you guys really
do build 8 gigawatts?

968
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:00,365
Is that a thing?

969
00:45:00,365 --> 00:45:02,928

970
00:45:02,928 --> 00:45:03,820
It's a thing.

971
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:05,400
Yeah.

972
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:08,320
I would say there's a lot
of work going into that.

973
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,180
But we do have work to do.

974
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:12,000
And I mentioned, for
example, the power up

975
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,530
proposal where, again, some
utilities and others are

976
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:20,560
trying to build new
substation infrastructure.

977
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,620
There are transmission
projects in New York that

978
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:25,900
have been greenlighted,
both on Long Island

979
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:29,920
and in New York City,
to hardened transmission

980
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,510
infrastructure specifically
to allow for offshore wind.

981
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:33,920
So those things are happening.

982
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,140
They also take time.

983
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:38,290
Building a new substation,
building new transmission

984
00:45:38,290 --> 00:45:39,790
on Long Island,
that's not something

985
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:41,060
that happens overnight.

986
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:43,570
And so if those projects
are significantly

987
00:45:43,570 --> 00:45:45,590
delayed for one
reason or another,

988
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:47,800
that definitely poses
a risk to the delivery

989
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,930
of the offshore wind power.

990
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:53,890
Again, I think this is a larger
issue for the renewables energy

991
00:45:53,890 --> 00:45:54,510
industry.

992
00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:57,185
Everybody hears a lot talk
about transmission, for example,

993
00:45:57,185 --> 00:45:58,310
and the transmission needs.

994
00:45:58,310 --> 00:46:01,190
And we know that FERC is
taking on these issues.

995
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:04,240
They've issued significant
orders on queue reform.

996
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,400
Queue reform is an
important aspect of this

997
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:10,150
as well, making
sure that there's

998
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:13,430
realistic timelines for projects
to be able to interconnect.

999
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:14,990
So a lot is happening there.

1000
00:46:14,990 --> 00:46:19,060

1001
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:23,450
If it doesn't go well, there
is potential cause for concern.

1002
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:27,210
But I'm heartened that I know,
again, the federal government,

1003
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:30,650
the states are putting resources
to this, to try and solve

1004
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:31,555
this challenge too.

1005
00:46:31,555 --> 00:46:34,265
[INAUDIBLE] just a
question on [INAUDIBLE].

1006
00:46:34,265 --> 00:46:35,860
Could we [INAUDIBLE]?

1007
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:36,770
Sure, go ahead.

1008
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:38,030
Sorry.

1009
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:39,870
I work on that a lot.

1010
00:46:39,870 --> 00:46:44,650
So is there a way to invest
in utilizing the existing

1011
00:46:44,650 --> 00:46:46,007
grid better now?

1012
00:46:46,007 --> 00:46:50,777
Instead of [INAUDIBLE]
You get these $200 billion

1013
00:46:50,777 --> 00:46:53,900
dollar [INAUDIBLE] from
New York and so forth would

1014
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:55,090
take 10 years.

1015
00:46:55,090 --> 00:46:59,185
But a lot of researchers at MIT
are looking into better software

1016
00:46:59,185 --> 00:47:02,290
to use in a more flexible
way, [INAUDIBLE] and so forth.

1017
00:47:02,290 --> 00:47:03,730
Can you comment on that?

1018
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:06,140
Yeah, I mean, I think, I'm
glad you're working on it,

1019
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:09,600
I guess, is my comment
because absolutely.

1020
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:13,390
There is a lot to squeeze
out of the existing grid.

1021
00:47:13,390 --> 00:47:16,210
And, exactly, if you can squeeze
more out of the existing grid

1022
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:19,936
or make it more efficient--

1023
00:47:19,936 --> 00:47:23,560
AI poses significant
new opportunities

1024
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:25,840
to get better
visibility, for example,

1025
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:28,930
on the electric grid
that could help reduce

1026
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:30,760
some of the need for upgrades.

1027
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:33,880
All of that needs to happen
and, again, I think, would

1028
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:36,470
be squarely in that category
you asked about before,

1029
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:38,810
what should researchers
be working on?

1030
00:47:38,810 --> 00:47:41,920
What should DOE or other
government funders like NYSERDA

1031
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,860
be funding?

1032
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:47,050
Again, we have such
a challenge building

1033
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:48,790
infrastructure in this country.

1034
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:51,587
And, again, offshore wind
is one version of that.

1035
00:47:51,587 --> 00:47:53,170
But we have many
versions of it that I

1036
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:57,620
think the more we can utilize
existing infrastructure,

1037
00:47:57,620 --> 00:48:00,443
for sure the better.

1038
00:48:00,443 --> 00:48:01,860
And maybe you can
talk about that.

1039
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:07,340
How is your company using AI and
sensors and other modern tools

1040
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:10,230
to try to make your
operation work better?

1041
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:14,100
Yeah, so we're doing
some small things.

1042
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:18,420
And I think we're, again,
monitoring the status of it.

1043
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:21,750
But, for example, as part of our
recent bid into Massachusetts,

1044
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:24,950
we partnered with the Engine--

1045
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:27,890
so I don't know how
many people here

1046
00:48:27,890 --> 00:48:30,570
are connected with the
Engine in some way--

1047
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:36,170
but, obviously, sponsored by MIT
originally but also partnered

1048
00:48:36,170 --> 00:48:37,910
with a couple of
the companies that

1049
00:48:37,910 --> 00:48:39,950
are funded by the
Engine that might

1050
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:41,520
have applicable technologies.

1051
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,782
And so we've made
commitments to work with them

1052
00:48:43,782 --> 00:48:45,740
during the course of
development of our project

1053
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:48,830
to see whether their technology
would be ready and available

1054
00:48:48,830 --> 00:48:50,300
for our project.

1055
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:53,990
One is actually on a different
topic, is a company called

1056
00:48:53,990 --> 00:48:57,140
Sublime systems that's
working on low carbon cement.

1057
00:48:57,140 --> 00:48:59,510
And there is, again, cement
and various components

1058
00:48:59,510 --> 00:49:03,332
of our operations.

1059
00:49:03,332 --> 00:49:08,520
And we've been working with them
to see whether we'd be able to,

1060
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,470
again, try to reduce
the overall carbon

1061
00:49:10,470 --> 00:49:12,390
footprint, obviously,
of our infrastructure

1062
00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:14,370
by utilizing that technology.

1063
00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:17,130
Another company's
called VEIR, essentially

1064
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:22,000
trying to make transmission
lines more efficient as well.

1065
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,160
So those are not--

1066
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,420
we haven't got to the
finish line on those things.

1067
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:30,010
But we're very open to that.

1068
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:32,370
And hopefully other
developers are

1069
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:34,120
looking at those
opportunities too

1070
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:36,078
because we're going to
have to try some of this

1071
00:49:36,078 --> 00:49:42,300
out and get some
advancement in real time

1072
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:44,400
as we look to
build the industry.

1073
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,170
Great.

1074
00:49:45,170 --> 00:49:47,520
Maybe for a minute
you can try to pretend

1075
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:51,238
that as of January
22 or something,

1076
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:53,280
somebody in administration
calls you up and says,

1077
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,200
what policy should we put in?

1078
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,705
Do you have a suggestion.

1079
00:49:56,705 --> 00:49:58,530
What do you think?

1080
00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:00,400
Yeah.

1081
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:04,260
If I had just one
thing and it was

1082
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:05,770
a new federal administration--

1083
00:50:05,770 --> 00:50:08,040
I think that's
what you're asking.

1084
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:12,180
The pace of permitting
for these projects, this

1085
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:16,030
has been the challenge all the
way back to Cape Wind, in fact.

1086
00:50:16,030 --> 00:50:20,710
But we haven't gotten
where we need to be.

1087
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:24,090
And so I would say, better
funding the permitting agencies

1088
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:25,830
that are doing work
on these projects

1089
00:50:25,830 --> 00:50:32,100
as well as trying to
streamline that process,

1090
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:34,150
that would be my
single biggest ask.

1091
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:37,510
There's a lot of things
that need maturity.

1092
00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:40,385
Maybe another technology need--

1093
00:50:40,385 --> 00:50:41,760
this isn't exactly
that question.

1094
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,410
But just going
back to that is, I

1095
00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:47,100
mentioned how we have
fishing vessels looking

1096
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:48,670
for protected species.

1097
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:50,910
We had an experience
on Vineyard Wind

1098
00:50:50,910 --> 00:50:55,170
last summer where there was
significant fog, just unusually

1099
00:50:55,170 --> 00:50:56,170
large amounts of fog.

1100
00:50:56,170 --> 00:50:58,230
And then there was also
the Canadian wildfires.

1101
00:50:58,230 --> 00:51:00,720
That all significantly
reduced visibility

1102
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:03,780
and inhibited our ability
for those protected species

1103
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:08,995
observers to do their job and to
identify any marine species that

1104
00:51:08,995 --> 00:51:11,370
might be in the area, which
actually stopped construction

1105
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:14,410
because we weren't able to meet
the permit condition to do that.

1106
00:51:14,410 --> 00:51:17,340
So we've been pressing
in those conversations

1107
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:19,350
with federal permitting
agencies better ability

1108
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:24,420
to rely on drones or other
remote sensing technology.

1109
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:26,400
Other technology-based
solutions that

1110
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:30,960
won't be defeated by fog or
wildfires is the kind of thing

1111
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:34,110
that, we've got to try and
move our permitting processes

1112
00:51:34,110 --> 00:51:37,170
and our environmental
protection processes

1113
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:40,260
into the more modern
phase, I would say.

1114
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:42,390
All right, well, I
want to thank you again

1115
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:44,920
for helping to move us
all in the modern phase.

1116
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:47,430
And I'm looking forward
to using your electrons.

1117
00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:48,220
Yes.

1118
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:48,730
Thank you.

1119
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:49,330
Yeah, thanks.

1120
00:51:49,330 --> 00:51:52,060
[APPLAUSE]

1121
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:54,520

1122
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:59,380
And before you leave, I
just wanted to announce,

1123
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:03,020
our next speaker
would be October 16.

1124
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:05,570
It's a Congressman whose
name I forgot now--

1125
00:52:05,570 --> 00:52:06,250
Sean Casten.

1126
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:07,580
Sean Casten--

1127
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:08,110
Cool.

1128
00:52:08,110 --> 00:52:09,652
--from Illinois,
who was previously--

1129
00:52:09,652 --> 00:52:10,193
That's great.

1130
00:52:10,193 --> 00:52:11,650
--in clean energy
industry before

1131
00:52:11,650 --> 00:52:13,240
he got elected to Congress.

1132
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:14,350
He'll be coming, talking.

1133
00:52:14,350 --> 00:52:15,940
We'll have announcements
about that.

1134
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:18,830
The following day,
I think, October 17,

1135
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:24,250
if I have the date right, is
the public on-campus discussion

1136
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:29,800
of our fusion report about the
opportunities for fusion energy

1137
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:32,710
and what conditions have to
be satisfied for fusion energy

1138
00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:36,190
to really help decarbonize
the electricity grid.

1139
00:52:36,190 --> 00:52:38,110
And right now, I want
to invite you all

1140
00:52:38,110 --> 00:52:40,120
to come join us for some
refreshments outside

1141
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:41,890
and some further chat
with the speaker.

1142
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:42,440
Thank you.

1143
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:42,940
Thank you.

1144
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:46,290
[APPLAUSE]

1145
00:52:46,290 --> 00:52:51,000
