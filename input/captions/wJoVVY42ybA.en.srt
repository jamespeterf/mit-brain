1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,920
Hi everyone, nice to meet you. My name

2
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:12,920
is Idol Levy. I'm the founder and CEO of

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,200
Safe Mode. My co-founder, Professor

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,880
Muelli, our chief scientist, is the

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,800
connection for MIT. Came out of the

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,960
media lab and now is the head of big

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,080
data lab in Tel Aviv University. And

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,439
we're helping tracking companies and

9
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:28,080
transportation delivery companies to

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,640
prevent accidents. And you have a lot of

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,960
uh products in this market. But we are

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,200
focusing and developed a behavioral

13
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,760
modification engine. We focus on

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,840
changing behavior not on only on

15
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,680
monitoring behavior but how we can

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,640
actually take drivers and make them

17
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,879
drive more safe, more efficient um and

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,800
more

19
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:50,239
sustainable. So our mission is to focus

20
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,800
on the driver. We want to be the most

21
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,559
driver ccentric company out there. And

22
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,559
the reason that we are focusing on the

23
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,800
driver is that these are the guys that

24
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:01,760
sitting behind the wheel for 10 12 hours

25
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,320
a day. Now most of the industry products

26
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:07,680
are focusing on monitoring how driver

27
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:10,479
behave with dash cams, GPS, many

28
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,640
different hardware. But these let's call

29
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:15,280
it stick products are not really

30
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,280
changing behavior. They are overwhelming

31
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,680
managers with a lot of data. But

32
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,560
eventually when you have 200 drivers or

33
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,040
2,000 drivers, it's impossible to manage

34
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,960
and analyze the data and more important

35
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,439
you don't really able to coach the

36
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,680
drivers or enforce them to drive better.

37
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:35,759
We have an incentive programs the carrot

38
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:38,079
to incentivize drivers to drive better

39
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,320
and make a win-win situation between the

40
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:43,360
driver that earn more money based on

41
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:46,000
safe and efficient driving the company

42
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,119
whether if it's Amazon or trucking

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,240
companies and even the insurance

44
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:52,560
company. These are some of the case

45
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,000
studies. One of them is with Uber rental

46
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,720
car company. The other one is with

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,600
Amazon delivery company. We help them to

48
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,119
lower accidents by 30% on top of all the

49
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,680
advanced solution in the market like

50
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:07,520
dash cams and GPS and telematics and

51
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:10,560
also save 5% of fuel. All of that is

52
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,640
because of better and safer and more and

53
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,280
less aggressive driving behavior of the

54
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,959
drivers. So how we actually do that? We

55
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,400
collect a lot of data from existing

56
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,480
devices in the vehicle. We are

57
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:24,000
completely software platform. We don't

58
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:26,480
have any devices of safe mode. uh we

59
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,120
integrate uh seamlessly with whatever

60
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:32,800
fleets already have. Then we analyze the

61
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:35,599
data and eventually we engage the

62
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,760
drivers with a gamified app that push

63
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:40,080
them to coach themselves to drive

64
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,920
better. Every day they can see how they

65
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,319
drive and more importantly as you can

66
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,480
see in the left screenshot they actually

67
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,959
get cash reward based on their

68
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:52,239
performance. So on a daily basis we

69
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:55,120
coach drivers we push them to see how

70
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,640
they perform and it's trigger some

71
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,440
circuits in the brain that releases

72
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,080
dopamine on a daily basis. This is how

73
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,159
we are trying and actually affecting

74
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,920
their behavior. We have a lot of science

75
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,840
behind that. My other co-founder is

76
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,239
professor for behavioral economics. So

77
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,200
we have a lot of research on what are

78
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,080
the different incentives that we need to

79
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,400
incentivize and how to incentivize

80
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:20,239
drivers. Um, I mentioned the seamless

81
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,159
setup and the plugand play. The way that

82
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,319
it's working, we integrate with whatever

83
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,319
fleets have. And then we have two AI

84
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:29,040
models. The first one is how we score

85
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:31,040
the driver behavior. Driving in San

86
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,360
Francisco, Boston and New York in

87
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,200
winter, summer, day and night is very

88
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,680
different. Nobody in the industry focus

89
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,840
on the drivers but us. And we in order

90
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,120
to make it fair and make the drivers

91
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:46,319
play the game, we need to make it um in

92
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,239
a very dedicated way and fair way that

93
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,080
drivers will understand that if they

94
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,959
drive in different atmospheres, they

95
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,959
ranked in a fair way. The second model

96
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,120
is how we incentivize the drivers. If

97
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,040
you are the best driver in the fleet is

98
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,040
great. We need to maintain you the top.

99
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,720
But if you are the worst driver, this is

100
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,760
the lowhanging fruit. This is how we

101
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:08,000
prevent 30% of accident. Um and

102
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,360
eventually these are the models that

103
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,280
make it happen. Our partnerships ask we

104
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,760
want to have more customers. So if you

105
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,079
have any customer with a fleet or

106
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,079
trucking company, delivery company, we'd

107
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,320
be happy to partner with them as well as

108
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,639
with insurance companies or telematics

109
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,120
providers that have the customer reach

110
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,680
of

111
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:31,840
any transportation company. So we'd be

112
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,919
happy to meet with them. So thank you

113
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:38,800
very much. And we have the booth as

114
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:42,199
well. So stop by and say hi. Thank you.

115
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,199
Thank you, Ido.
