1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,720
great well good morning everybody it's a

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:06,720
pleasure to be here in Houston um if

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:10,840
only because it's 20 degrees warmer than

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:13,679
Boston right now so um as Jim said I

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:16,600
have been working both in Academia and

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,359
in government around issues of uh

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,160
importance to the country particularly

8
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:23,359
right now in manufacturing Supply chains

9
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,039
and and Industrial strategy at large and

10
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,679
my goal this morning is to really set

11
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:30,679
the stage for our conversation today and

12
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:32,640
to do a little framing s what are some

13
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:35,160
of the trends that are affecting the

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,320
country and the globe and help tee up

15
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,040
some of the conversations that will be

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,920
happening today from my colleagues uh

17
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,320
later in the later in the day so let me

18
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,440
start with saying I'll be looking at the

19
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,520
changing Global landscape um a little

20
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,320
bit on Industrial strategy otherwise

21
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,480
maybe known as competitiveness or

22
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,920
competitive

23
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,239
strategy next Industrial Revolution

24
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:00,120
priorities for us manufacturing uh which

25
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:01,800
will my colleagues Ben Armstrong and and

26
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,160
Anthony will go into more detail and

27
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,479
then finally work of the future which

28
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:07,119
we'll be doing on a panel uh later today

29
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:09,159
I'll also make sure that I have time for

30
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,320
some questions and some discussion at

31
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:13,360
the end of this so that we can uh engage

32
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,960
together on some of these topics so let

33
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,560
me begin with some of the first key

34
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,880
trends that are going on in terms of a

35
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:22,759
changing Global landscape and I think we

36
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:24,240
are all aware of these sort of um as

37
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:27,079
bits and pieces but when they come

38
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,880
together I think they help uh explain a

39
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:30,439
lot of the Paradigm shifts we see going

40
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,439
on in in the country country and around

41
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:34,960
the world so the first is supply chain

42
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:36,960
disruptions and as uh Jim said earlier I

43
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,720
was in the thick of supply chain

44
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,200
disruptions in the White House in 2021

45
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:44,240
2022 so even talking about this topic

46
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,240
gives me a little bit of PTSD um but we

47
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,280
all understand that we saw through the

48
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,119
pandemic that we had a real challenge in

49
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:53,119
terms of Supply chains whether it was

50
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:55,520
low commodity products like PPE or

51
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:58,719
high-end products like semiconductors uh

52
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:01,560
what we saw were real risks to National

53
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,520
and health and health security issues uh

54
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,880
as well as economic Prosperity Economic

55
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:09,640
Security issues we saw about a third of

56
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:11,560
inflation in 2021 was caused by uh the

57
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:13,640
supply chain crisis around

58
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,879
semiconductors and for many of you you

59
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:18,680
are well aware that Supply chains are

60
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,920
complicated and if you look at some of

61
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,680
the major corporations in the country uh

62
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:26,040
in the in the world they have thousands

63
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,400
and thousands of suppliers and there has

64
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,000
been an effort in many ways to

65
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,120
consolidate this but we're still talking

66
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,120
about thousands of suppliers and one of

67
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,760
the challenges we had uh during the

68
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,680
semiconductor crisis is that neither the

69
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,360
companies nor the government had any

70
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:44,040
real insight into those semiconductor

71
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:47,680
Supply chains uh and that became a real

72
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:49,239
sort of warning and and call to action

73
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,560
particularly for I think for a role for

74
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:53,560
government to figure out what is you

75
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,879
know how do we understand supply chains

76
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,400
and their vulnerability how do we look

77
00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:00,239
around the corner uh and and if we if we

78
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,480
sort of looked at what was going on

79
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:07,720
nationally we would have said oh huh 90%

80
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:10,440
of our Frontier chips are sourced from

81
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:12,200
one company in one region in the world

82
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,640
that doesn't sound so smart you know I

83
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,000
don't need to be an expert in Supply

84
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:17,280
chains to tell you that that's probably

85
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,360
not a great strategy um and we knew that

86
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,840
you know 10 years ago but now I think

87
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,159
we're seeing the economy in a very

88
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,360
different light through the lens of

89
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:27,200
Supply chains uh and that's really

90
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,159
shaping a lot of our our thoughts on uh

91
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,120
on the economy and on strategies and

92
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:34,319
that's both at the country level and at

93
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,120
the company level and our colleague in

94
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,120
at

95
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,840
MIT um David simchi Levy has come up

96
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,599
with a couple metrics to help companies

97
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,920
think through how resilient are our

98
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:47,080
supply chains so time to survive how you

99
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:49,640
know what what number of components do

100
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:52,519
you have on in your inventory to survive

101
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:54,840
A disruption uh whether that's in stock

102
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:56,720
or with another supplier and time to

103
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,959
recover how long does it take for

104
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:02,480
suppliers to uh get back into full

105
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:05,840
production and really interestingly his

106
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:08,040
recent work on some on semiconductors in

107
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,959
Taiwan provided a case study that showed

108
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,040
a 10-day shutdown in Taiwan took almost

109
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,720
a year for production to be back in

110
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,320
track so which what we saw which is what

111
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,359
we saw in the US right bullwhip effect

112
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:22,120
on Supply chains multiple years to

113
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,600
actually get back on track right now the

114
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,360
Federal Reserve of New York would say

115
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,440
that we are at pre-pandemic levels uh

116
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:31,919
for S supply chain disruption but at the

117
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:36,960
same time you know what are we short of

118
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:38,759
now IV fluids right we one Factory in

119
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,880
North Carolina for the entire country

120
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:43,639
that again could we have seen that

121
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,199
foreseen that uh drone production right

122
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:48,919
now the Chinese have now um cut off

123
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:51,800
exports to one of our uh critical drone

124
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:54,440
manufacturers in the US uh that Supply

125
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:57,520
Ukraine again vulnerabilities that exist

126
00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:00,320
today so that's I think something that's

127
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,919
Now new in our our our minds eye of how

128
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,320
we're thinking about the economy and

129
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,720
there are multiple ways toward

130
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,960
resilience companies are thinking about

131
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,400
this and I would say from what my

132
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,400
observation is there's no single answer

133
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:14,000
here the answer is not let's throw out

134
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:16,479
just in time practices that's probably

135
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,520
not a good idea I remember all of the uh

136
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:21,120
containers on the port of LA Long Beach

137
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:23,960
dock you know we don't need to stock up

138
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:27,360
but we do need to bring in agility and

139
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:28,639
um and other ways of um of flexibility

140
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,240
so what we're seeing right now is

141
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,759
increasing Investments

142
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,199
in transparency so let's understand what

143
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:37,080
we can uh see through sort of digital

144
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,280
connectivity through our supply chain

145
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,840
redundancy the power of two let's open

146
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,919
up uh another sort of supply chain

147
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,160
Channel if we can in our with our

148
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,479
suppliers as well as regionalization

149
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,720
regionalization or distributed

150
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:52,080
manufacturing creating hubs around the

151
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:54,039
globe so that you're not vulnerable to

152
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,840
just one you know to one disruption in

153
00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:58,800
one part of the world sustainability

154
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,759
also another key priority uh we're

155
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,840
seeing compan companies very much

156
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:05,400
investing in understanding where they

157
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:08,199
can improve their carbon footprint also

158
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:11,120
of course reduce energy usage as a whole

159
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:14,160
given the demands on energy uh through

160
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,720
uh compute Etc going forward um and then

161
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,880
digitalization is critical to all of

162
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,800
this if we can't measure what's going on

163
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,240
in our companies and across our supply

164
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,440
chain you actually can't start to

165
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,840
address resilience and sustainability so

166
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,520
all of these are Trends in the supply

167
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:31,639
chain piece that I think we're seeing

168
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:35,720
now again in in companies as well as in

169
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:37,639
countries next next uh major uh Trend

170
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:41,240
that I think we need to acknowledge is

171
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:43,680
climate change and you you know we we

172
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:45,720
perhaps most of us would see uh an

173
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,160
existential threat to the planet on

174
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,720
climate change but if you didn't see

175
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:53,000
that and you're only uh observing the

176
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:55,199
economic impact of negative uh weather

177
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,440
effects you would find that we are

178
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:02,440
seeing this increasing number of

179
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:04,360
dramatic uh impacts on uh on weather

180
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:07,199
events negative weather events to the

181
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:10,240
economy so billion dooll events uh

182
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:13,919
happening now in 2023 28 of them and if

183
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:18,120
we looked at 2024 this is before uh we

184
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:20,000
saw hurricane Helen Etc um so the the

185
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,639
impact of this on the economy the impact

186
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,479
of this in terms of rebuilding for the

187
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:27,720
country uh is enormous so about a

188
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:31,280
hundred billion dollar in in expenses um

189
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:33,759
and impact in 2023 now we're saying

190
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,639
hurricane Helen was probably just 200

191
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,599
billion in on in itself so we just

192
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,599
expect those to increase and we have to

193
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:41,639
think about how are we're going to

194
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,639
rebuild and what does resilience look

195
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:47,319
like when we rebuild our Energy Systems

196
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:51,080
our infrastructure

197
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:52,919
Etc third Trend geopolitical landscape

198
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,360
when we were in the white house and we

199
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:56,000
you know were dealing with all of the

200
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,120
supply chain crises and the big issue

201
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,919
was would there be enough gifts under

202
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,240
the Christmas tree in December of 2021

203
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:05,960
because you know everything was going to

204
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,680
be uh uh disrupted and we finally said

205
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:10,039
oh we got the gifts and everybody was

206
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,199
you know happy and more throughput than

207
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:15,120
the US had ever seen um we sort of sat

208
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,479
back and then we didn't sit back for

209
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,599
very long because there was Russia's

210
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,919
invasion of Ukraine uh then we've had

211
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:22,759
the Middle East uh and we've had you

212
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:24,199
know what what I learned over time and

213
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:25,560
many of you will already know this is

214
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:28,080
that there's always a supply chain

215
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:30,639
crisis uh and they are more the rule

216
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,479
than the exception uh so in terms of the

217
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,880
geopolitical landscape you know what

218
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,719
we've seen is a conflicts first uh one

219
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,599
One impact for the US is that the

220
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,120
conflicts in Ukraine the Middle East the

221
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:42,959
tensions with China have exposed some

222
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:47,519
weaknesses in our defense industrial

223
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:50,160
base and if uh if we take xiin Ping's

224
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,360
words you know seriously the US is now

225
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,600
focused on trying to build up its

226
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:57,959
deterrent capabilities um in the South

227
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,839
China Sea for 2027 and what we

228
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:01,640
understand is that we've got some

229
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:03,680
vulnerabilities here we have a uh a

230
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,920
supply chain that has uh shrunk over

231
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,600
time uh we have challenges in bringing

232
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,640
Innovation into our defense industrial

233
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:14,160
base um and we have a bureaucracy that

234
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:16,760
is that it needs some uh reform so

235
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,800
that's been one major I think uh impact

236
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,279
right now that we're seeing in the

237
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:22,279
country the other is of course the

238
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:24,079
rising concerns with China uh of course

239
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:25,480
if you're if you're you're operating in

240
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:27,680
China there have been more tensions for

241
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,959
the multinationals whether it's

242
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,200
surveillance uh Etc

243
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:34,120
if you are um working in certain

244
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,360
industries and semiconductors and EVS

245
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,640
they're concerned about their overc

246
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,720
capacity and flooding the global market

247
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,800
the US has that concerns Europe has that

248
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,200
those concerns as well uh we have supply

249
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:46,560
chain dominance of course critical

250
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:51,920
minerals they control 60% of global

251
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:53,959
lithium 80% of cobalt in the world um uh

252
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,959
infects our drug Supply affects a whole

253
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:59,040
host of areas as well in terms of uh in

254
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:01,120
terms of energy and then of course they

255
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,600
spend hundreds of billions on scaling

256
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,240
their Industries and scaling new

257
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,680
technologies we're seeing this in

258
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,760
biomanufacturing we're seeing this in

259
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,839
Quantum and the question is you know how

260
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,760
does the US uh continue to lead

261
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,320
technologically and otherwise in these

262
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,680
areas so a lot of Shifting one point I

263
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,079
would like to make is that I don't

264
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,160
believe that we are de globalizing I

265
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:22,680
think we are reg globalizing I think

266
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,680
there is a you know concerns about uh

267
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,440
actors like Russia and China in the

268
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:29,760
world but I don't think that means that

269
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:32,680
we're going to see a um you know a a

270
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,640
massive shift of domestic manufacturing

271
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,959
for example I think we're seeing uh

272
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,880
significant amounts we're seeing some

273
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:40,320
reshoring but in fact I think we're just

274
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:42,560
going to see a a very broader a sort of

275
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,279
different configuration if you will on

276
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,279
how we think about

277
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,920
globalization all right fourth

278
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:55,120
inequality so what we know about

279
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:57,880
populism is that at its core is economic

280
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:01,120
insecurity and we have seen in this

281
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:03,160
country as well as others a lot of

282
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:06,240
turmoil and threats to what i' call the

283
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:08,560
Social fabric of the country um uh

284
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,560
threats to democracy Rises of autocracy

285
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,120
around the globe and I think one of the

286
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,399
things that helps explain this can be

287
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:20,519
found in what's happened for the typical

288
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:22,720
worker in the US this chart um is

289
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:25,680
basically comparing productivity growth

290
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:28,880
to compensation growth in the US uh from

291
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,560
about 1950 until close to 2020 and if

292
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,120
you were say well let's track the

293
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,440
average worker of compensation compared

294
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,839
to productivity growth youd say well the

295
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,320
two top lines they're looking pretty

296
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,440
good and everybody's you know chugging

297
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,839
along it's looking like uh like it

298
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:46,160
should um but if we were to take out the

299
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:50,240
compensation growth for the four-year

300
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:52,240
College worker and look at uh average

301
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,399
compensation for the nonsupervisory

302
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,880
worker so median and um you know

303
00:11:55,399 --> 00:12:00,680
non-supervisory rules what we see is

304
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:03,279
this Flatline relative Flatline for the

305
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:05,440
typical worker in the US and while there

306
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:07,040
was a you know significant growth until

307
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,360
the 80s we had what we call the great

308
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:14,360
Divergence in the 80s and that is I

309
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:16,320
think explains a lot about our political

310
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:18,120
economy and our politics in the country

311
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,680
right now now the good news is that H

312
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,920
that those numbers have slightly ticked

313
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:26,519
up since the pandemic we've had a a rise

314
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:28,880
in the um sort of lower income levels

315
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:31,440
minimum wage and other reasons but this

316
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:34,199
isn't important piece of understanding I

317
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,480
think what's behind some of our uh

318
00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:38,680
policies what's behind some of our uh

319
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,519
politics uh in the in the US right now

320
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,240
and again not just in the US you can see

321
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:44,360
this certainly in Europe and other parts

322
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,360
of the country of the

323
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,920
world so let me move now to what the

324
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:53,199
implications of all this are so these

325
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:55,639
four sort of uh I'd say uh Global Trends

326
00:12:53,199 --> 00:12:58,079
if you will around Supply chains around

327
00:12:55,639 --> 00:13:00,880
climate around geopolitical tensions and

328
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:02,680
around inequal equality have led to at

329
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,440
least in the US and and not only here

330
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:08,040
but a whole move in this industrial

331
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:10,320
policy an idea that actually we have to

332
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:12,639
rebuild in the country areas that we are

333
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,600
vulnerable um that are important for our

334
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,959
National Economic Security so the theory

335
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,079
here is that and the practice is that

336
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,880
the private Market has underinvested in

337
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:23,800
key areas of the economy that are

338
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,120
important for the country so it it may

339
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,440
be that you're investing you know

340
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,959
companies are doing exactly what they

341
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,600
should be doing in terms of their

342
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:32,000
semiconductor strategy but as a whole

343
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,600
we're vulnerable as a country and we

344
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,839
have to look through that lens um in

345
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:39,279
terms of that the same thing with

346
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:41,760
critical minerals for example so we

347
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:43,560
Public public dollars are used to

348
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,800
leverage private dollars because our

349
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,399
public dollars will never have enough

350
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,240
public dollars to address some of this

351
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,920
building this capabilities right you

352
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,920
need to bring in private sector dollars

353
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,279
to make this

354
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,639
worthwhile so what's the transformation

355
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,880
that's been going on a couple in the

356
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:59,759
last few years so a federal agenda that

357
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:02,160
emphasizes building resilient Supply

358
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:04,440
chains rethinking globalization and

359
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,800
investing in critical Industries what we

360
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:09,000
saw in many ways uh how this is played

361
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,199
out recently has been this legislation

362
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,160
over a trillion dollars in public Dollar

363
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:16,079
in public investment going on over the

364
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:17,880
next 10 years uh about a trillion in the

365
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:21,079
bipartisan infrastructure act so that's

366
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:23,759
our uh physical infrastructure Rail Port

367
00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:26,199
train Broadband also energy

368
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:27,759
infrastructure uh 52 billion for chips

369
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:29,800
and science that is essentially

370
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:32,560
semiconductor investment around the

371
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:34,880
country and then also about 370 billion

372
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:37,160
which is mostly in tax credits for clean

373
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,839
energy in the IRA and that would I just

374
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:41,040
to say that that is while there are tax

375
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:44,199
credits for particular types of energy

376
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:47,880
essentially the model has been whatever

377
00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:49,360
produces zero emission is is essentially

378
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,480
fair game for those tax credits so

379
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,839
trying to maintain a sort of a Level

380
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:55,639
Playing Field for investors uh as to

381
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,480
where they're going to invest and the

382
00:14:55,639 --> 00:15:00,959
and and this has been you know extremely

383
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,560
successful if you'd only measure these

384
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:05,759
policies based on how they crowded in

385
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:08,480
private sector investment you'd say

386
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:11,199
hands down success we've got close to

387
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,880
250 billion in clean energy Investments

388
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:15,880
close to 250 300 in semiconductor

389
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,279
Investments you know this is this is

390
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:19,759
looking successful of course that is not

391
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:22,120
uh success is not just about the money

392
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:23,759
it's how we land the plane uh which uh

393
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:26,880
which we're all very focused on but

394
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:28,480
Goldman Sachs uh has said that this at

395
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,480
least just in clean energy we'll see a

396
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,319
three

397
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,959
trillion dollar investment in clean

398
00:15:31,319 --> 00:15:35,440
energy total for public and private

399
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:39,480
investment which is enormously

400
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:41,279
successful and has um not made us uh May

401
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,440
made us very popular with our European

402
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:46,560
friends uh as we've seen a lot of

403
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:49,040
investment coming from Europe into the

404
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,880
US this is just an example of what we've

405
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,040
seen uh in terms of the clean energy

406
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:56,360
it's mostly been in batteries and in

407
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,800
solar and I will say that the uh states

408
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,279
that have been seeing most of that

409
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:02,639
investment actually California and Texas

410
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:04,800
so Texas actually is leading the country

411
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,600
on renewable investment uh including

412
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,199
critical minerals um and so it's been a

413
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,000
very exciting time to see some of those

414
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:13,720
uh Investments uh start but we need a

415
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,880
Whole Decade I think to really see this

416
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:19,800
play

417
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:21,399
out let me move now to the issue of an

418
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,319
industrial revolution and priorities for

419
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:26,240
us manufacturing as I said before I

420
00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:28,199
spent a lot of time on Supply chains but

421
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,480
what I see as the flip side to supply

422
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:31,920
chain resilience

423
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:34,440
is actually um increased Advanced

424
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,920
manufacturing that you can't do one

425
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,680
without the other uh and again I think

426
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,880
Ben and Brian will be talking uh to ways

427
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:43,759
this plays

428
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:46,839
out but um let me start with us

429
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:49,680
manufacturing now I would say about a

430
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:53,000
decade ago um actually it might have

431
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:55,759
begun more than that in the late uh in

432
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,480
the in probably in the like early 2 th

433
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:02,880
mid 2010 Etc um we have had a sort of

434
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:05,319
recognition that said us manufacturing

435
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,120
is critical to our Innovation capacity M

436
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:08,520
MIT was involved in a produ in a

437
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,839
research project called production in

438
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:13,600
The Innovation economy and historically

439
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:16,199
the model sort of was evolving to one

440
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,839
that said as long as we keep the

441
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:21,079
design uh and the services in the US the

442
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:23,559
production can go offshore and we'll

443
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:25,360
just keep the higher value added work

444
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:26,880
but what it turns out is that in fact

445
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,000
that starts to affect actually our

446
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,440
Innovation our capacity to innovate in

447
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,520
these products that you have to know how

448
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:35,360
to make uh and so slowly but surely the

449
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,480
US you know created uh We've the

450
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,720
manufacturing USA institutes there's

451
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:41,000
about 17 of those around the country we

452
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:44,120
started to recognize that our

453
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,720
manufacturing capabilities have been uh

454
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:49,200
depleted uh and now we see just in the

455
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,559
last uh year or two both the defense

456
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,160
industry as well as our nationaly which

457
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:55,760
is sort of a broader I'd call it I just

458
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:58,320
call it the civilian view on this

459
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:02,640
recognizing that manufacturing is

460
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:04,880
critical to our um Innovation and uh and

461
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,200
our competitiveness more broadly so what

462
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:10,320
does this mean this means resilience

463
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,799
Supply chains this means sustainability

464
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:15,360
energy and energy usage um and it means

465
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:18,799
digitalization as I mentioned before uh

466
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:21,280
how do we bring connectivity to our uh

467
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,120
to our industrial base RIT large because

468
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,640
that's what's going to lead to

469
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:27,600
productivity and that's what's going to

470
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:30,760
lead to increasing wages cyber security

471
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:32,960
also another critical area uh for those

472
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:35,039
I'm I'm sure many of you are aware of

473
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:38,280
the the risks there the manufacturing

474
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:39,360
bases have been most um most at risk

475
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:42,880
here that's been where the highest

476
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,440
percentage of attacks has been um and so

477
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,799
addressing that and working with

478
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,760
companies and government to try and

479
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:51,640
address cyber security another key issue

480
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:54,840
and third augmenting workers and we'll

481
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:56,120
talk about this uh later today but if

482
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:59,039
people have been tracking the

483
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:02,080
manufacturing uh industry essentially

484
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:05,320
what we see is that in the next six

485
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:08,080
years we will have um about 2 million

486
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:10,760
unfulfilled unfilled jobs in

487
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:14,000
manufacturing um so how are we going to

488
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:16,960
address that what does it mean to fill

489
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:21,320
those jobs I think technology plays a

490
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:23,960
role um but it also means uh trying to

491
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:26,280
upskill our current workers and also

492
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:28,720
increase wages so we attract the Next

493
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:30,200
Generation uh because they have a lot

494
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,720
lot of options and they're

495
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,159
technologically savvy and so what do

496
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,320
they want to see they want to see

497
00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:39,120
actually technology as part of their as

498
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:41,640
part of their work so all of this is

499
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:46,039
part of an agenda for manufacturing in

500
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:48,039
the country and what we've um seen I

501
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:50,480
think recently is a is a sort of

502
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:52,159
bipartisan Collective Agreement that

503
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,960
this is an area that the US should

504
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:58,720
invest in and that there are a lot of

505
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:58,720
positive spillovers for the country

506
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,440
let me just walk through I mean because

507
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,840
I was sort of the policy adviser I

508
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:07,880
apologize but I kind of have to provide

509
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:09,720
my view on the policy side of this um

510
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:11,400
but there are a number of areas where I

511
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,039
think that we should uh look for

512
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,679
investment both at the state and the

513
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:17,480
federal level in fact states are leading

514
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,520
in this in some ways more so than the

515
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:21,799
feds and so how what does that look like

516
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:24,679
and the first is accelerating technology

517
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:26,480
adoption so the US is amazing at

518
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:29,360
innovating we invent a lot of the

519
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,400
technology here but it it's amazing how

520
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,400
we fall behind when it comes to adopting

521
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:35,799
technology so when it comes to robotics

522
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:38,320
for example China and Germany have a

523
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:40,120
higher penetration rate than the US on

524
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,480
robotics when it comes to additive

525
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:43,960
manufacturing Brian will fill fill us in

526
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,960
there but I think we have in the US we

527
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:49,039
have um the you know we're driving The

528
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,200
Innovation driving the patents but we're

529
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:53,320
just not seeing the adoption as quickly

530
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,480
as we'd like so how do we get the

531
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:57,240
adoption not only in the large companies

532
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,960
but in small and mediumsized companies

533
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,720
which are the backbone of the country

534
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,120
about

535
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:05,080
250,000 small medium-sized firms that

536
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:07,559
make up our manufacturing base um you

537
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:10,840
know if we only wanted 50,000 of those

538
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:12,559
to be at The Cutting Edge of

539
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,360
digitalization we don't really have a

540
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:17,360
mechanism for doing that we just the

541
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:21,080
states have no capacity uh you know it's

542
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,840
not about necessarily more uh more money

543
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,880
per se we've got to find the right

544
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:27,200
incentives for for getting companies to

545
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,600
actually get on board on

546
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,760
this uh another topic which I've worked

547
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:34,600
a lot on is how we enable scale up so we

548
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:38,600
all have seen models that the you know

549
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:42,520
the US leads of course in um software

550
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:44,000
development and in uh all of the scaled

551
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:48,200
large technology companies that are

552
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:50,400
leading in AI uh again uh Europe and the

553
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:52,279
dry report you know underscored the

554
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,840
challenges for Europe in doing that and

555
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:58,880
some of what dragy pointed out is that

556
00:21:54,840 --> 00:22:02,200
the US strength in financing scaleup is

557
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:05,080
partly what explains the growth of some

558
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:08,960
of our leading software and and sort of

559
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:12,039
AI related companies um but that

560
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:15,640
ecosystem that sort of scaleup model is

561
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:17,600
very much um oriented towards a software

562
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:20,919
scaleup and not necessarily the hardware

563
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,760
scaleup so what we know about some

564
00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:26,000
technologies that have a lot of you know

565
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:27,520
engineering and and Hardware is that

566
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,159
they take a longer period of time to

567
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,080
scale and they take take more Capital

568
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:33,240
they're Capital intensive it can take

569
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:35,039
tens to tens of billions tens of

570
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:37,200
millions of dollars if not a billion

571
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:40,360
dollars it's certainly an energy to try

572
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,720
and bring a technology to Pilot scale or

573
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:45,039
certainly commercial production scale

574
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,559
and so what can we do as a country to

575
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:48,039
try and accelerate some of that and so

576
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:51,159
there's been a lot of experimentation

577
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:52,799
going on uh venture capital is dipping

578
00:22:51,159 --> 00:22:56,400
its toe in here in a way that it hasn't

579
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:58,559
in the past um but we're seeing shared

580
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,080
pilot facilities so how do we how do we

581
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:03,679
to bring some public private dollars to

582
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:05,200
bringing that pilot capacity uh online

583
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,919
uh how do we do this in terms of tax

584
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,480
credits we've seen the again the

585
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:10,320
investment tax credit has been very

586
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:13,440
successful in bringing this kind of

587
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:15,159
investment for clean energy um and then

588
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,880
how do we have other funding Vehicles so

589
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:20,000
can we imagine firstof aind funds can we

590
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,880
imagine Insurance that's helping with

591
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,360
tech Innovation what are the ways in

592
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:29,240
which we bring in more capital for that

593
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:31,799
growth stage of uh of of it early stage

594
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:33,799
kind of technology companies uh other

595
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:36,159
countries don't think twice about this

596
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:38,440
they subsidize this area uh China's got

597
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:39,880
a very you know robust way in which it's

598
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,760
supporting a lot of its companies in

599
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:45,000
terms of their growth we have to come up

600
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,679
with a model in the US that building on

601
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,400
what we have already that's going to

602
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:52,039
help fill that gap of what we call the

603
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:54,320
missing middle in terms of

604
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:56,919
capital okay Workforce Development again

605
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:59,240
there'll be more to be uh said on this

606
00:23:56,919 --> 00:24:03,279
uh and my uh colleague Ben Armstrong has

607
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:05,679
been working uh deeply into this area um

608
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:07,880
but what are we missing in terms of

609
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:10,320
technical uh a technical Workforce and

610
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:12,120
an upskilling of the workforce and what

611
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,080
we know is that actually when companies

612
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:16,159
invest in technology they actually

613
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,799
invest in in upskilling their Workforce

614
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,480
it's almost this virtuous cycle so

615
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,840
rather than sort of moving to the lowest

616
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:25,399
Comon neor of no new technology lower

617
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:27,799
wages Etc how do we actually move that

618
00:24:25,399 --> 00:24:29,880
in a different direction uh so we need

619
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:31,880
to invest in the in in bringing that

620
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:34,320
technology into the firms and then we

621
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:37,640
need to create incentives for companies

622
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:39,760
to actually build uh that new that new

623
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:42,440
pathway forward for workers uh because

624
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:44,960
the reality is as I said before wages in

625
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:46,960
in manufacturing are not keeping up and

626
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,440
we're not attracting the Next Generation

627
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,080
so how are we going to actually do that

628
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:52,760
I think technology is a piece of that

629
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,399
answer is a piece of that puzzle um and

630
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:57,000
there's a lot of a lot of efforts at

631
00:24:54,399 --> 00:24:58,960
every state I I know uh the Texas area

632
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,080
has you know really robust

633
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:04,640
uh manufacturing organizations uh the

634
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:06,600
MPS Etc um but we need to now bring that

635
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,919
at a na to a national level we need to

636
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:10,399
really look at ways in which we're

637
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,559
trying to bring the Next Generation and

638
00:25:10,399 --> 00:25:14,679
see a path forward a pathway to the

639
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:16,760
middle uh because what we know for

640
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:19,200
example is that for technicians which do

641
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:20,799
not require a four-year degree um you

642
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,640
can make a very good living and there's

643
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:27,240
a middle class pathway for those workers

644
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:30,279
and remember that about 40% of those who

645
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:33,720
start a 4-year degree do not finish in 6

646
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:35,520
years so that's a waste of money a waste

647
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:38,520
of time you know let's find those

648
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:40,919
Pathways forward for workers in the uh

649
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,919
in this

650
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:46,159
space tariffs and Export controls uh I

651
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:48,039
don't want to go into too deeply into

652
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,320
this topic it's uh you know it's highly

653
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:50,760
charged and we don't know where it's

654
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,919
going to land I think at any point in

655
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:54,840
time we have no idea where this is

656
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:57,039
landing um but the reality is that we

657
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:59,240
are now um looking for ways to kind of

658
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:01,960
level the playing field if you will and

659
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:04,559
that I I believe that the US has

660
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:09,679
suffered from a very aggressive Chinese

661
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:11,320
policy uh to uh invest in um if you will

662
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:13,640
dumping products and then pumping up

663
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:15,880
prices and you know wiping out a lot of

664
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:17,840
us industry so tariffs I think have a

665
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,919
role to play we're seeing them used uh

666
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:22,760
selectively and uh and we'll see where

667
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,760
that plays out going

668
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:27,000
forward finally um Advanced

669
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:29,720
manufacturing R&D of course as someone

670
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,320
at MIT I I'm I need to talk about the

671
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:33,320
science of this the science of

672
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:35,480
manufacturing processes and the

673
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:38,600
importance for investment on that front

674
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:41,600
uh as much as we are uh you know making

675
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:44,679
advances in kind of operations the the

676
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:47,720
R&D of manufacturing is still critically

677
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:50,919
important and this can be foundational

678
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:52,720
uh science breakthroughs uh or

679
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:54,760
foundational engineering breakthroughs

680
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,399
like what we need in Quantum or can be

681
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:58,760
much more applied like continuous

682
00:26:56,399 --> 00:27:00,760
Manufacturing in biomanufacturing

683
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:02,559
but across every single one of the areas

684
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:04,120
that we see the US needing to compete in

685
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:06,640
whether that's critical minerals

686
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:10,039
semiconductors clean energy all of this

687
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:13,440
actually is needing an R&D component an

688
00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:15,120
R&D engine to get us uh into leadership

689
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,440
roles and help us Leap Frog on the

690
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,640
technology because that's ultimately I

691
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:20,960
think how the US uh competes in this

692
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:24,360
area and actually leads globally is

693
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,360
actually going to be through the

694
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:30,240
R&D let me now move on to

695
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:33,000
uh the work of the

696
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:36,600
future and this was a billboard that I

697
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:40,960
drove by for a whole year uh on my way

698
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:43,600
to work and it was um it was sobering

699
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:47,120
because I thought wow is that all we've

700
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:50,640
got as a response to the robots and if

701
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:54,720
some of you remember the um the Super

702
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:57,360
Bowl in 2019 I do um every commercial

703
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,000
had a robot serving you a beer that was

704
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,840
our future right the robots are coming

705
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,039
they're going to take your job they're

706
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,600
going to take your kids' job we're going

707
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:05,679
to need a universal basic income because

708
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:09,919
everybody's going to be on a beach not

709
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:11,720
working what are we going to do um so

710
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:15,760
actually I think things have changed

711
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:17,320
right and that fear subsided and one

712
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,880
could argue that if we had had more

713
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:22,000
robots during the pandemic we might have

714
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:25,519
saved more lives and our challenge as a

715
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:28,760
country has always been quality of jobs

716
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:32,360
not the quantity of jobs right and and

717
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:34,960
what uh MIT did in 2018 to

718
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:36,559
2021 was set up a task force on the work

719
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:41,279
of the future our president at the time

720
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:43,360
Raphael re was approached by you know uh

721
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:45,640
the Great and the good and everyone else

722
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:47,320
on campus to say you guys are inventing

723
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:50,440
the robots what are you doing about

724
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:52,720
their impact on society and uh he took

725
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:55,000
that very seriously and we set up a task

726
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,960
force that had all five schools involved

727
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,320
so we had the technology folks we had

728
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,880
the engineers making robots but then we

729
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,679
had the political scientists the

730
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,320
anthropologists the sociologist coming

731
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:06,880
together saying what does this mean uh

732
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:08,720
you know what we haven't this we have

733
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,440
we've been here before this concern

734
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,679
about technology and and frankly right

735
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:16,000
now the robots have Sub sub you know

736
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,840
subsided and now ai has moved forward

737
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,760
and that's our our latest fear about

738
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:23,480
technology um but what does this all

739
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:25,640
mean so I won't go into great detail um

740
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:27,799
about about the findings of the report

741
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:29,799
but I I like to say I mean I'm proud to

742
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:32,600
say that I think the results of that

743
00:29:29,799 --> 00:29:34,360
report still hold strong and stand 5

744
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,440
years later so let me just run through a

745
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,760
couple of those High you know

746
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:40,240
highlighted

747
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:43,080
points so three key findings the first

748
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:45,320
is that technological change is

749
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:47,519
simultaneously replacing existing work

750
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:50,559
and creating new work often as humans we

751
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:53,360
can only see what's been replaced you

752
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:56,080
know we used to have a medical

753
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:58,039
transcriptionist um who was taking you

754
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:00,320
know taking down the dictation and

755
00:29:58,039 --> 00:30:02,880
typing it up at the hospital no they no

756
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:04,840
longer exist you know what's happened to

757
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,640
that person it's very hard for us to see

758
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:09,519
the new creation of work and what we

759
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:12,480
know from our work uh from our colleague

760
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:16,200
David otter is that about 60% of the

761
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:18,159
work today did not exist 80 years ago

762
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,960
you know there's a lot in which it gets

763
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:22,240
recreated of course none of us would

764
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:24,559
have said uh at least I wouldn't have

765
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,519
said 5 years ago oh I want to be a

766
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:28,559
social influencer I think I'll figure

767
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:31,200
out how to make money off Tik Tok

768
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:33,320
I still can't say that and I hope my

769
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,080
daughter will not be saying that but in

770
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:38,200
any case there are all the ways in which

771
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:40,200
you know new jobs are being created and

772
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:42,679
as I said before our challenge has not

773
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:44,039
been about the quantity of work uh

774
00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:45,679
outside of of course business cycle

775
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:48,200
works it's been about that quality of

776
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:49,919
work and that leads me to the second

777
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:52,000
point which is Li Rising labor

778
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:55,120
productivity this is a a chart I showed

779
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,919
earlier hasn't really translated into

780
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:59,600
broad increases in

781
00:30:56,919 --> 00:31:03,399
income and what we decid what we sort of

782
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:05,960
landed on as a task force was to say yes

783
00:31:03,399 --> 00:31:08,399
there are impacts from technology so

784
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:11,519
technology has wiped out a lot of in you

785
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:15,120
know that middle middle rung jobs in in

786
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:17,000
in manufacturing in clerical work so we

787
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,399
we have a bit of a dumb a barbell

788
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,320
economy right where we see growth in the

789
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:21,679
low-skilled workers growth in the

790
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,200
high-skilled workers and and this

791
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:26,600
missing middle that has technology has

792
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,880
played a role there and yes we've seen

793
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:33,200
the impact of globalization

794
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:36,039
so uh when China entered the WTO uh and

795
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,720
we start CH Chinese Imports into the us.

796
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:40,519
and the manufacturing we saw a major

797
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:42,240
impact on our manufacturing communities

798
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:44,240
right textile industry all these

799
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,760
industries moving offshore competing

800
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,399
trying to compete with lower cost

801
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:50,360
products and as a country I think we we

802
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:52,200
did not do enough for those communities

803
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:57,080
and for the intergen generational

804
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:59,799
impacts of that um but the reality is

805
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:03,639
every country faced technological change

806
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:06,240
and faced global global Trends as well

807
00:32:03,639 --> 00:32:08,279
um those you know those have hit every

808
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,440
every country um but what's really

809
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:14,360
different are the

810
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:18,159
institutional uh conditions in a country

811
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:20,799
and the US's institutional conditions

812
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:23,159
for workers are are quite different than

813
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:24,919
what we'd find for example in Europe so

814
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:27,360
what does that mean that means like a a

815
00:32:24,919 --> 00:32:29,000
minimum wage minimum wage the rise of

816
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:32,559
minimum wage a number of states in this

817
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:34,519
country has done more to compress the

818
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:37,880
income inequality in this country than

819
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:40,120
just about any other policy it means uh

820
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:42,720
unemployment insurance it means Health

821
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:45,320
Care it means training and investment in

822
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:48,000
training it means worker voice all of

823
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:51,600
these ways in which workers the typical

824
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,519
worker um can be supported through these

825
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:57,240
transitions we we should be less

826
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:58,919
interested in supporting the job the job

827
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:01,840
uh than we are are about supporting the

828
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:04,639
workers and I think when we see

829
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:07,639
reactions that are you know hostile

830
00:33:04,639 --> 00:33:09,960
toward Innovation or technology or

831
00:33:07,639 --> 00:33:12,200
automation it's coming from it's coming

832
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:14,200
from the place that chart showed earlier

833
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:16,159
people have been left behind they are

834
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:19,000
they do not trust that this technology

835
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:21,320
is going to actually you know help them

836
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,080
get ahead and move forward and be part

837
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:25,880
of the economy going forward so I think

838
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,039
this issue of you know what we broadly

839
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:30,559
call institutions is important for us to

840
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:32,279
to look at and uh and I believe as a as

841
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:33,639
a society we have been in a number of

842
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:36,519
different

843
00:33:33,639 --> 00:33:38,039
ways finally momentous impacts of

844
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:41,360
Technology change are unfolding

845
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:43,120
gradually now uh you know the first

846
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,320
reaction to that is no AI is happening

847
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,919
so quickly what are you talking about

848
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:49,000
but let me remind you of where we were

849
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:51,320
five years ago and the autonomous

850
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,240
vehicle and if you can all recall that

851
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:55,880
you know the Panic that we were going to

852
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,519
all of our truck drivers were going to

853
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:00,200
be out of work and I can tell you if we

854
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:02,159
had had more truck drivers during that

855
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:04,440
pan the crisis of the pandemic we would

856
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:07,240
have done much better through it but the

857
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:08,879
fact is the that this technology

858
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:10,599
technology does take time and a lot of

859
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:13,320
the research at MIT has shown almost a

860
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:16,399
30-year Arc for new technologies to

861
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:18,720
really uh take hold uh again I don't

862
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:20,000
think that'll happen with the AI I think

863
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:22,159
things have Mo are moving much more

864
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:26,079
quickly but the fact is we do usually

865
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:28,280
have time to adjust as a society and to

866
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:30,599
help our workers transition

867
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:33,280
uh and to get ahead of this and I think

868
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:35,159
I think with AI in fact we see a lot of

869
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,639
uh public and private leaders trying to

870
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:39,760
quote get ahead on that topic in a way

871
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:41,240
that maybe we haven't in the past so I'm

872
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,919
encouraged by that but we can't be

873
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:44,480
complacent we have to be you know

874
00:34:42,919 --> 00:34:46,280
actively looking for ways to help make

875
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,960
sure that everybody can transition

876
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:50,040
through these technological changes

877
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:52,839
because they will continue to come uh as

878
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:54,960
we know so I'm going to wrap up right

879
00:34:52,839 --> 00:34:57,800
there and uh leave a few minutes for

880
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:04,520
questions but thank you all very much

881
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:06,760
[Applause]

882
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:08,839
raise your hand if you have a question

883
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:11,440
and we'll bring the mic to you or a

884
00:35:08,839 --> 00:35:14,599
comment yes right

885
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,880
here M you go and please introduce

886
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:19,720
yourself oh hi uh my name is Brian

887
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:22,440
Thompson I work at Cisco uh food

888
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:25,960
distribution organization um I was just

889
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:28,960
curious in any of these findings um has

890
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:31,160
there been a inclination to look at

891
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:33,240
education I mean I feel like young

892
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:36,040
people right now it's it's almost a

893
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:39,440
crisis of Despair uh they don't see a

894
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:41,079
path to Victory so you know instead of

895
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:44,760
becoming an electrician maybe I should

896
00:35:41,079 --> 00:35:47,440
get familiar with a CAD program right or

897
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:49,720
um you know any variety of other kind of

898
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:52,319
skill sets and our education system or

899
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:54,760
at least our public education system is

900
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:56,599
not doing a very good job of providing

901
00:35:54,760 --> 00:36:00,040
that hope right you know that path to

902
00:35:56,599 --> 00:36:02,920
Victory so is there any policy

903
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:07,079
initiative or Forward Thinking portion

904
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:08,760
of this that deals directly with the way

905
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:11,480
that the federal government is planning

906
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:13,599
on dealing with education at scale yeah

907
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:15,920
very very good point I I will first say

908
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:18,480
I don't feel I'm an education expert but

909
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:20,560
what you are pointing to which a lot of

910
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,800
people point to is actually our efforts

911
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:24,280
at Workforce you know the workforce of

912
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,960
the future have to begin from K through

913
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:29,880
12 so I think there's a lot of focus on

914
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:32,160
what do we bring into the K through 12

915
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:34,319
uh experience and education curricula

916
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,920
that helps expose students to the

917
00:36:34,319 --> 00:36:38,599
critical learning and thinking that has

918
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:40,119
to happen for the for that path forward

919
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:42,880
the other thing the other area that I

920
00:36:40,119 --> 00:36:47,000
think as a country we're focused on is

921
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:48,680
that um you know we have we know how

922
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,319
students March forward through high

923
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:53,960
school and get a high school degree uh

924
00:36:51,319 --> 00:36:55,560
which most high school um students do

925
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:58,440
which is a great achievement in this

926
00:36:55,560 --> 00:37:00,640
country um

927
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:02,160
but then there then it's like a cliff

928
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:04,720
you're on your own to figure out what

929
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:07,640
you do next right and that is not the

930
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:09,640
model you'll find in uh in Europe and

931
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:11,720
and what we need to do is create that

932
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:15,160
pathway that allow that takes takes the

933
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:18,200
student uh right from high school into

934
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:19,480
their next secondary career path and

935
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:21,280
that is an area that people have been

936
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:24,240
focused on in terms of trying to build

937
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:27,000
up apprenticeships uh and get get high

938
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:28,200
school students into early you know

939
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,440
college

940
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:33,560
associate degree um credits IBM has a

941
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,880
program where they're taking uh high

942
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:37,040
school students and bringing them into

943
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:39,319
community colleges to help train them

944
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:41,640
over a three-year period to be um cyber

945
00:37:39,319 --> 00:37:44,560
security analysts so I think that

946
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:46,480
there's uh an understanding that that's

947
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,760
that there's a a crisis I mean I don't

948
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,599
know if I use the word crisis I think

949
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,560
others would in terms of in terms of the

950
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:53,200
education process but there are points

951
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:55,319
in the system that we where it really

952
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:59,440
breaks down in the US and we don't find

953
00:37:55,319 --> 00:37:59,440
it elsewhere necessarily yeah

954
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:10,000
atomically those things were

955
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:12,640
relevant but now with the Adent of a lot

956
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:16,319
of these Technologies those skills are

957
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:17,720
not necessarily asant right maybe

958
00:38:16,319 --> 00:38:21,599
there's

959
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:25,720
aing that a little

960
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:27,960
yeah giving young people this vict

961
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:30,079
you're talking about a you're talking

962
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:32,920
about Rare Minerals a lot of these take

963
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:34,160
10 15 years before they exactly start

964
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:36,720
producing

965
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:39,160
anything right no and I I think that

966
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:41,000
that's I mean the idea of the skills

967
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:42,520
that need you know that the students are

968
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,400
going to need or or the next generation

969
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:47,400
is going to need I think those have been

970
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:49,000
well identified um how they're taught

971
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,839
how we bring them into the system I will

972
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,720
say for vocational training now in the

973
00:38:50,839 --> 00:38:55,480
state of massachusett for example the

974
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:57,680
state has doubled down and is trying to

975
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:00,000
vastly increase the number of seats in

976
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:02,480
vocational training which is bringing

977
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,119
you know more sort of the shop floor

978
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:08,800
training and the engineering piece

979
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:10,160
together for uh for a pathway that's not

980
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,920
doesn't involve a four-year degree and

981
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,240
has an associates degree associated with

982
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:17,200
it but we'll have more time for this

983
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:20,359
conversation later today yes other right

984
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:22,720
here so my apologies the question is a

985
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:25,560
little complicated you shown the kind

986
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:27,400
flatlining of the uh incomes what I'm

987
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:29,800
wondering is if you have a sectoral

988
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:33,000
breakdown of that so what I'm getting at

989
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:35,119
is it people doing the same job being

990
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,839
paid the same salary or are people

991
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:41,520
moving from higher paid sectors into

992
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:45,319
lower paid sectors so it averages out as

993
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:47,359
um you know as a flatline even though it

994
00:39:45,319 --> 00:39:48,760
really is reflecting a different thing

995
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:51,119
and indirectly what I'm getting at is

996
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:53,040
the impact of offshoring and I remember

997
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:55,480
a while back Alan binder at the FED had

998
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:57,680
done some work showing the uh your

999
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:59,680
incomes depend not on the skill required

1000
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:03,640
to do the job but the ease of offshoring

1001
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:07,040
the job and I'm wondering if that aspect

1002
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:09,040
of that flattening of the income has

1003
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,480
statistically expect yeah I believe it

1004
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,400
does it is part of what we're seeing

1005
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:15,119
there because the the this flatlining is

1006
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:17,200
in part the wage distribution that we've

1007
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:18,599
seen that what wages used to be you know

1008
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:22,359
concentrated in the middle and the lower

1009
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:24,839
income have headed higher up so I think

1010
00:40:22,359 --> 00:40:26,599
that is a reflection of some of the uh

1011
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:29,720
of the jobs that have headed out and so

1012
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:32,599
those who had the those um those better

1013
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:34,599
paying jobs have moved into lower paying

1014
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:36,359
positions yeah into sectors and so the

1015
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:38,119
question I mean again what's the answer

1016
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:40,119
to that is actually how do you build the

1017
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:42,119
quality job what does that look like to

1018
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:45,599
go forward and and Ben might have some

1019
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:47,079
thoughts on that later today uh okay um

1020
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,480
I think I'm gonna have to oh there's one

1021
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:50,599
more question I'm gonna squeeze in one

1022
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:56,200
more question sorry I know they hate it

1023
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:56,200
when I do this so but really quickly

1024
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:03,880
thank you my question is uh you know you

1025
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:06,040
mentioned about the friction in uh the

1026
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:08,640
you know adoption of technology and

1027
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:11,760
innovation in US companies compared to

1028
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:14,119
say uh Germany and I think it was China

1029
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:17,920
what are some of your thoughts on how to

1030
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:20,839
tackle that yeah oh good a small a small

1031
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:22,760
question and it just happens that our

1032
00:41:20,839 --> 00:41:25,960
next speaker is going to speak to that

1033
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:28,480
so I'm going to punt and do and find the

1034
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:30,560
halfway point here and allow Ben to

1035
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:34,319
answer that question in his talk so

1036
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:34,319
thank you all very much
