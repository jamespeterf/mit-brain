1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,340

2
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,280
Good afternoon, everyone.

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,940

4
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:21,720
On the afternoon of
Friday, July 30, 2021,

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,630
I stood outside
the emergency room

6
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:27,800
entrance of UT Southwestern
medical Center in Dallas, Texas.

7
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,670
I'd been there for a few hours--

8
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,840
not an unexpected amount of
time to spend at the ER--

9
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,290
while my sister and I waited
with our mother for a visit

10
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:37,430
from her surgeon.

11
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:41,480
A year earlier, she'd had a
bilateral mastectomy, performed

12
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,590
at the height of the COVID-19
pandemic and nearly 19 years

13
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:48,620
after her first breast
cancer diagnosis.

14
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:52,100
Our visit to the ER in
2021 was about eight weeks

15
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,530
after a second
eight-hour surgery

16
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:57,840
that was the direct result of
the prior year's mastectomy--

17
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,400
this time, for a quick check to
examine a troublesome incision.

18
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,590
Mom's surgeon released
her with instructions

19
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:06,390
to come back the following
Monday for a surgical cleanse,

20
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,110
and I set off to
retrieve the car.

21
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,760
As I stood waiting for
the car to arrive--

22
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,440
$5 valet parking for patients
is a nice side benefit

23
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,920
in a state with so much land
available for parking garages--

24
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,770
the valet attendant
started chatting with me.

25
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:25,260
After a few innocuous
comments, he suddenly asked,

26
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:27,710
did you take the COVID vaccine?

27
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:33,350
I replied, yes, absolutely, and
so did all of my family members.

28
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,900
And so began a
fascinating conversation

29
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,690
that included tales of
government conspiracies

30
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:40,730
and plots to track
citizens based

31
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:44,060
on devices included in the
vaccine, and even a connection

32
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,740
to monkeypox.

33
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:48,260
I decided not to tell him
that if he was worried

34
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,070
about being tracked
by the government,

35
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,490
he should put down
his cell phone.

36
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:52,670
[LAUGHTER]

37
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:55,310
At one point, the
attendant posed a question

38
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,680
that he undoubtedly thought
would carry weight with me.

39
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,420
Answer me this, he asked--

40
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,320
how did they manage to
develop a vaccine so fast?

41
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,980
My response--
because practically

42
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:10,669
the entire biomedical
world, from academic labs

43
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:13,140
to multinational
pharmaceutical companies,

44
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,580
started working on it.

45
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,380
Imagine the global problems
we could solve if only

46
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:21,710
we worked together to do it.

47
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,790
My name is Kristala
Jones-Prather.

48
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,910
I'm the Arthur D. Little
professor and department

49
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:28,310
head of chemical
engineering here at MIT,

50
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:32,510
and I am also a class of
1994 undergraduate alumna.

51
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:35,220
In my time as a student
and a faculty member,

52
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,120
I have come to see that
MIT is an institution that

53
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,530
is collaborative by design,
with our infinite corridor

54
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,870
representing endless
possibilities,

55
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:47,480
and our connected buildings
and hallways serving

56
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,660
as a physical reminder of
the lack of true boundaries

57
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,320
between our disciplines.

58
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,600
After all, the beneficiaries of
our scientific and technological

59
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,030
advancements,
including my mother,

60
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,910
who participated
in a clinical trial

61
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:04,090
after her initial cancer
diagnosis in 2001,

62
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:08,230
that, I learned 15 years later,
established the standard of care

63
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,310
for adjuvant hormonal therapy.

64
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:13,420
These patients are not concerned
with the fields of study

65
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:16,390
or the affiliations
of the inventors.

66
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:19,700
And so as we launched the
MIT Hills Collaborative,

67
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,860
we do so with the intention of
tackling big problems by asking,

68
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,100
what if?

69
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,450
And working together across
boundaries and barriers

70
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:31,180
and even institutions
to find the answers

71
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,340
and deliver solutions.

72
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,070
What if detection of
diseases like breast cancer

73
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:39,770
could be made easier, less
invasive, more accessible,

74
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,240
and more comprehensive?

75
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,410
Could this lead to earlier
detection, better health

76
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:47,560
outcomes, and greater
patient survival?

77
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,920
What if we really work to
understand the unique dimensions

78
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,040
of women's health, with women
being disproportionately

79
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,560
affected by autoimmune and
chronic inflammatory diseases?

80
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,740
Could we see new
human tissue models

81
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,290
giving way to novel
physiological insights

82
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:05,090
and new paths for
effective treatments?

83
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:07,720
What if we tackled ovarian
cancer in a fundamentally

84
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,960
new way, fusing knowledge
gained from basic immunological

85
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,360
sciences with novel
engineering approaches

86
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,230
to delivering immunotherapies?

87
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,959
Could we leverage
the partnerships

88
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,570
of academics and clinicians
to change the outlook

89
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:21,010
on this disease.

90
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,990
What if we thought
about education

91
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:26,770
in a radically different way
by working not just in research

92
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:30,350
labs but also in the communities
where epidemics take hold?

93
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,500
Could we incorporate
the social scientists

94
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,770
to foster a deeper understanding
of the challenges associated

95
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,640
with the adoption
of new medicines,

96
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,390
and develop new approaches
to more deeply understand

97
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:43,000
the many dimensions of health?

98
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,670
In this session,
you'll hear from four

99
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:48,010
of my amazing
colleagues, each of whom

100
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:51,160
is using interdisciplinary
approaches and collaborative

101
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,430
partnerships to ask and
answer these questions.

102
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,620
As you listen to
them, I hope you're

103
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:00,290
inspired to think about the
possibilities, the promise,

104
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,560
and the hope that
their work represents

105
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,470
to reflect on the patients,
perhaps some well-known to you,

106
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:09,280
and others who may remain
nameless, that would benefit

107
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,180
from the achievements yet to
come, and to consider if and how

108
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,410
you can contribute
to these missions.

109
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,740
Oh, and yes, my
mother is continuing

110
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,590
to live her best life, having
spent Thanksgiving week

111
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:23,920
traveling in Australia,
thanks, in no small part,

112
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,620
to a continuous community
of scientists, physicians,

113
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:31,761
and engineers who never
stop asking, what if?

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

117
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,770
- Nobody knows your
body like you do.

118
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:00,490
Imagine spotting
dangerous diseases way

119
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:01,970
before symptoms arrive.

120
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:05,840
Protecting yourself by
detecting yourself is the goal.

121
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,180
- So this variable, non-invasive
ultrasound patch is specifically

122
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,250
for early breast
cancer detection.

123
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,890
- Professor Dagdeviren has
been working with her students

124
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:17,630
for six years on a
wearable breast monitor.

125
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:20,620
Because it uses ultrasound
waves instead of radiation

126
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,720
to create an image, the
monitor can be used regularly.

127
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,750
This invention
inspired her students

128
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:29,140
to create smaller, even
less-invasive silicone

129
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,880
patches that can scan
for other cancers.

130
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,870
- Wearable technologies will
grow rapidly in the near future.

131
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,930
But in the far
future, they will be

132
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,210
one of the most powerful
tools that we will

133
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:42,105
be seeing in our daily life.

[PLAYBACK ENDS]

136
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:50,170
So we create that far future
right here at the MIT Media Lab

137
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:54,790
by blending media,
arts, and sciences.

138
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:59,550
Specifically for my group, we
are focusing on women's health.

139
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:03,610
And we create technologies
for female technologies,

140
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:06,960
which I often called femtech.

141
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,530
And let me tell you why by
giving three dramatic facts.

142
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:15,150
80% of autoimmune
diseases are in women,

143
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:18,220
and we still don't
understand why.

144
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,790
Heart disease remains
the number one cause

145
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:25,230
of death in both genders,
yet women wait more in ER

146
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,700
to be treated.

147
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:32,110
Women were excluded from
clinical trials until 1993.

148
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:35,370
Hormones were
given as an excuse,

149
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,590
and which means there
is a massive data

150
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:40,060
gap in hormone health.

151
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:45,840
And since mice don't
menstruate, how can we catch up?

152
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,450
To catch it up, in my
group at the MIT Media Lab,

153
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:53,230
we create devices which
are organ-specific.

154
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:56,560
These devices can be thinner
than your hair fiber,

155
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,060
and implantable like a needle,
can go in the deep brain,

156
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:04,600
and do neurological
explorations and stimulus.

157
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,780
And at the same
time, these devices

158
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:11,130
can be directly worn on
your largest organ skin

159
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:14,280
to do hormonal drug delivery
all the way from face

160
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,830
to the abdominal skin
throughout the IVF process.

161
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,370
Or these devices
can be attachable

162
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:24,520
to your personal garments, like
your daily bra or underwear,

163
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,620
and they can detect your
breast cancer at an early stage

164
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,710
and/or monitor
your bladder volume

165
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:36,059
to better understand your
kidney health and wellness.

166
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:38,650
Let me give you an
example more in depth.

167
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:42,330
It's a wearable ultrasound
breast patch for early breast

168
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:44,159
cancer detection.

169
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,690
It's a technology that
was invented here at MIT,

170
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:54,330
and this device is non-invasive
and can be directly placed

171
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:56,580
in the internal
wall of your bra.

172
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:01,930
By using safe non-radiative
ultrasound technology,

173
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:08,530
this device can detect any
anomalies within subseconds,

174
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:12,780
literally by sitting
on your seats

175
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:15,660
and listening to
this presentation.

176
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,940
And this data is sent
to your medical doctors.

177
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,510
And your medical
doctors can tell

178
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:25,050
if you are supposed to come for
more sophisticated treatments

179
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:27,070
or screening at the hospital.

180
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:29,940
This is specifically
important for the women who

181
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:34,270
have barriers to this kind of
technologies in the rural areas,

182
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:36,870
and also for women
who are on high risk

183
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,910
and needs to do
periodic screening

184
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:43,080
to increase their
survival rate to up to 98%

185
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:47,250
And this is also important
because high-risk women often

186
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:50,790
are often diagnosed
between two mammographies

187
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:55,350
and decrease their
survival rate up to 22%

188
00:09:55,350 --> 00:10:00,100
So with our technology,
what we are trying to do--

189
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:05,250
not only doing the science, also
creating stories behind that.

190
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,600
I'm not only doing
science at MIT.

191
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,670
It's a calling for me, and
it has a personal story.

192
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:16,720
I lost my aunt at the
age of 49.5 years old.

193
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,370
In this picture, she is Fatima.

194
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:20,770
She's very happy,
very beautiful,

195
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:23,770
and holds tons of
hopes for the future.

196
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:29,110
Whereas in this picture,
she is only 49.5 sick,

197
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:31,030
tired, and in pain.

198
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:35,040
The entire process was miserable
not only for her, for all of us

199
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,130
around her.

200
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:39,340
Despite the fact that she
had regular breast screening,

201
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,370
she was diagnosed
with breast cancer

202
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:43,410
and could survive
only six months

203
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,540
after this picture was taken.

204
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,030
So like my aunt,
many women suffer

205
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,980
from this devastating disease.

206
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,430
And the breast cancer
is the number one cancer

207
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:53,820
type among women.

208
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,150
And even the number is
higher than the combination

209
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,930
of other leading cancer types.

210
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:01,040
And more dramatically,
every eight women, one

211
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,550
will be diagnosed with breast
cancer during their lifespan.

212
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:08,220
And the current standard
screening tool is mammography.

213
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,830
It's painful, and
it's radioactive.

214
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,390
So you can't do it periodically.

215
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,130
You can't screen
your breast tissue.

216
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:17,280
And by the time you have
your second mammography,

217
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:21,170
by assuming the first one is
clear, 40% of high-risk women

218
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:23,400
develop incurable
cancer in between,

219
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,870
with the survival rate of 22%.

220
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:30,320
Imagine a world in which
your daily bra will

221
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,470
allow you to check your
breast tissue regularly

222
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:36,930
to increase your
survival rate up to 98%

223
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,980
That world is right here at MIT.

224
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,660
This is our product,
our technology.

225
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,440
It's a daily bra that you wear
with a wearable ultrasound

226
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,810
technology inside,
which can capture

227
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:52,800
the data within subseconds
with no skill operator needed.

228
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,100
And this data is sent to the
cloud and collect the data.

229
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,500
And by using AI and
machine learning,

230
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:05,900
your radiologist and doctor can
have an AI-supported report.

231
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,510
This is important because
current ultrasonography

232
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,260
technologies are handheld.

233
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,400
You need an operator.

234
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,840
You have to go to a doctor.

235
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,980
And oftentimes, as you can see
in the picture, they are bulky.

236
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,230
They have to press--

237
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:20,810
doctors needs to press against
your very personal part

238
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:21,560
of yourself.

239
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,310
And you need to use a
message [INAUDIBLE].

240
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:27,150
You need to clean up
afterwards, time consuming.

241
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:32,220
It cannot offer frequent
visiting, and it's expensive.

242
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,760
Whereas in our
technology, one scan

243
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,910
will cost less than
a cup of coffee.

244
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:40,670
And how it works?

245
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:44,130
We use-- anyhow, it doesn't go.

246
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:47,810
But anyway, we use inflexible
cables which can come all

247
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:52,200
together and print on a
biocompatible substrates,

248
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:57,050
which can go into your bra and
scan the tissue up to 260-degree

249
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:59,820
angle with 12-centimeter
information.

250
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,920
Why it matters?

251
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,920
Because our technology can
provide a resolution up

252
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,100
to 0.02 centimeters, which
is an order of magnitude

253
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,840
smaller than the
stage one tumor sizes.

254
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:13,160
With frequent screening, we
can enable early breast cancer

255
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,190
detection.

256
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:20,540
It matters because just in
US, we have 44,000 women lost

257
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,320
their life because
of this disease.

258
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,100
And the breast screening
is $30 billion,

259
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,110
and it increasing 30%
every single year.

260
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:31,910
With our technology, we can
increase the survival rate up

261
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:35,960
to 100% by decreasing the
medical costs by half.

262
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,480
So this was a dream
on a piece of paper

263
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,480
that I drew on the bedside
of my aunt just to relax her.

264
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,870
And even while she was in pain,
she was giving me feedback.

265
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:50,060
Now it's real and I can touch
people's bodies, skins, breasts

266
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:54,080
and their lives altogether
with my amazing students

267
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,650
at MIT Media Lab.

268
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:56,215
Thank you.

269
00:13:56,215 --> 00:13:58,860
[APPLAUSE]

270
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:11,450

271
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:12,510
Good afternoon.

272
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:13,590
It's great to be here.

273
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:15,690
I'm Linda Griffith from
biological engineering,

274
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:18,890
and I direct the Center
for Gynepathology Research

275
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:20,840
here at MIT.

276
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,520
What I want to tell
you about today

277
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,140
is a new movement that
we're starting at MIT.

278
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:28,830
It's called the Move
Over, Mice movement.

279
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:32,360
And what inspired it is
the incredible challenges

280
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,970
we have creating
effective therapies

281
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:38,190
for diseases that
preferentially afflict women.

282
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:40,070
Now, they'll help
everybody, but they

283
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:41,970
are motivated by helping women.

284
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:44,100
Now, why do we want
to move over the mice?

285
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,490
Well, think back before
COVID, we had colds.

286
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:50,520
We had the flu, and then we
had that very special disease,

287
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,990
the man flu.

288
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:54,260
And you know what
I'm talking about.

289
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,890
Husband and wife get a cold.

290
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,980
The husband's in bed
dying while the wife's

291
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,670
taking the kids to soccer.

292
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,380
OK, everybody knows that story.

293
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,200
And if you look at the x and Y
chromosome, it's not surprising.

294
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,690
So many things missing from the
Y, including some immune genes.

295
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:08,190
[LAUGHTER]

296
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:10,573
OK, now so it's
biologically true

297
00:15:10,573 --> 00:15:12,240
that men will get
sick-- this is proven.

298
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,190
They'll get more acutely sick.

299
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:16,700
But women stay sick
longer, and they

300
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,890
develop more chronic
autoimmune and

301
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:20,790
chronic inflammatory diseases.

302
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,940
They're the result of
multiple gene environment

303
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,450
interactions in humans--

304
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:27,620
very, very difficult to
study in mice-- and that

305
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,600
have provocative
links to the way

306
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,590
we reproduce and menstruation.

307
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:34,910
And so we can't really hope
to make a lot of progress

308
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,930
if we continue to study animals.

309
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:39,890
We really need to
study the patients

310
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:43,070
and replace our animals
with living patient avatars

311
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:44,370
and studies on patients.

312
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:48,130
Now, I'm going to tell one story
to illustrate the Move Over,

313
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:48,980
Mice principles.

314
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,310
About 15 years ago,
we started working

315
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:54,220
in a chronic systemic
inflammatory disease called

316
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,340
endometriosis.

317
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,350
And probably most people
have heard of this,

318
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:59,410
but it's when you
find bits of tissue

319
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:01,900
similar to the uterine
lining, the endometrium

320
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,300
growing, other places
like the abdominal wall,

321
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,517
invading into the bowel.

322
00:16:05,517 --> 00:16:07,850
It can invade through the
diaphragm and get to the lungs

323
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:08,960
and so on and so on.

324
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,560
It's incredibly
debilitating, causes

325
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,860
pain, infertility,
vomiting, systemic sickness.

326
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:19,900
And we don't know what causes
it, but we do about 10% of women

327
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:23,030
after the age of 12 or so
will have this disease,

328
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,620
and it's very hard to diagnose.

329
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,770
Now, I wouldn't be here
talking to you today

330
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:28,520
if we had good
treatments for it.

331
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,850
Some patients respond
to birth control pills

332
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,830
or menopause drugs,
but a lot of them

333
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:35,660
have repeated,
repeated surgeries.

334
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:38,810
Now, I got involved in this when
a local surgeon, Keith Isaacson,

335
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:41,240
who's a fantastic
surgeon and clinician,

336
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,300
called me one day and said, I
operated on a 23-year-old woman.

337
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,750
It was her 10th surgery
for endometriosis.

338
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,900
And she got operated
on in that OR

339
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,980
there on the right
at Newton-Wellesley,

340
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,730
where we now collect patient
samples because I got together

341
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:58,370
a group of people, and we
started to study endometriosis.

342
00:16:58,370 --> 00:16:59,360
OK, so what do we do?

343
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,530
Well, I'm not a-- we're not
the kind of engineers who

344
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:04,069
make devices or surgical tools.

345
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:05,569
We're biological engineers.

346
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:07,310
We study how systems work.

347
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:09,790
So we reasoned
that we could maybe

348
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:16,180
start to classify patients by
studying their immune networks

349
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,540
in the peritoneal fluid.

350
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,430
So we studied
about 100 patients,

351
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:21,190
did some targeted
proteomics, and we

352
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:24,099
were able to identify in
about a third of the patients

353
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:27,940
a particular inflammatory
network associated

354
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:31,850
with an intracellular enzyme and
immune cells called Jun kinase.

355
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,920
And so Jun kinase--

356
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,980
this is very exciting--
maybe if we inhibit it,

357
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:39,500
we could have a new
non-hormonal drug target.

358
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:47,140
And so it turns out, we go and
find out that there was a--

359
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,410
find these two papers--

360
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:50,480
that there was a drug
company, Merck Serono,

361
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,200
that had been
developing Jun kinase

362
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,590
inhibitors for other diseases.

363
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:57,110
And one of their amazing
scientists, Steve Palmer,

364
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:00,610
convinced them to do preclinical
models of endometriosis,

365
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:03,230
and that their
drug worked there.

366
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:05,020
Unfortunately, it
didn't work when

367
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,520
they licensed it out and there
went into clinical trials.

368
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,820
It didn't have the right potency
or patient heterogeneity,

369
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,810
whatever.

370
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:16,150
But the Steve Palmer
there turns out

371
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:17,900
to stay involved in the field.

372
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,740
So I got invited to give a
keynote talk at the American

373
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,770
Society for Reproductive
Medicine meeting in Hawaii

374
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,850
in 2014.

375
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:28,910
There was a hurricane, over
a foot of rain that weekend.

376
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:31,700
And who did I run
into but Steve Palmer?

377
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,780
So we sat inside, and we
talked about the future

378
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,260
of endometriosis drugs.

379
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,300
And he said, I'm leaving Merck.

380
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,500
I'm going into academia.

381
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,090
I'm going to develop new drugs.

382
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:43,510
But what we need to
get into the clinic

383
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:46,170
is we need human
efficacy models.

384
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,420
We need the patient on a chip.

385
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,730
We need a lesion connected
to blood vessels,

386
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:51,620
circulating immune
cells and all of that.

387
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,630
So you go do that.

388
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:55,880
Well, then, OK.

389
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,170
So the first thing we had to
do-- we had plenty of access

390
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:00,560
to patient biopsies.

391
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,780
And other people in the
field had figured out,

392
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,780
how do you make organoids
from these patient biopsies.

393
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:09,230
You can see the glands from
the endometrium on the left.

394
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:12,310
But what they were doing is
using some terrible reagents

395
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:14,240
to make 3D cultures of these.

396
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,680
They had something derived from
a mouse tumor to make the 3D

397
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,260
environment.

398
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,160
It degraded.

399
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,290
It was really not
great for the biology.

400
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:24,370
So we used our polymer science
and biological engineering

401
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:28,030
skills to design a
completely synthetic hydrogel

402
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:31,190
to support all the different
cell types in a lesion.

403
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:34,690
So you see here the
beautiful epithelial organoid

404
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,290
blue with green in the middle.

405
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:38,650
And the red cells are the
supporting fibroblasts

406
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:39,650
growing in this gel.

407
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:41,380
And labs around the
world have used this,

408
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,920
and it's now being
commercialized.

409
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,530
But of course, the lesion
has to be in contact

410
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:47,380
with blood vessels.

411
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,530
And we were fortunate that
our colleague Roger Kamm

412
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:52,230
had invented a way
to grow a vascular

413
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:55,750
bed in between two microfluidic
channels, as shown here.

414
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,330
And our student in the
movies not playing--

415
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,770
but if it were playing--

416
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:02,100
why is it not playing?

417
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:06,150
Our student Ellen
Khan had shown how

418
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:08,550
to flow immune cells
through that vascular bed

419
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,790
from one side to the other.

420
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:12,870
But what we had to do was
adapt this to accommodate

421
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:14,380
endometriosis lesions.

422
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:18,310
And so what we did is designed
a new chip, bigger with pumps.

423
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:21,910
And we put the vascular cells
and the lesions together.

424
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:25,000
And what you see, over a
six-day time lapse here,

425
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,122
you can see the lesions.

426
00:20:26,122 --> 00:20:27,580
They're in the
green boxes growing.

427
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,980
And you can see
the blood vessels

428
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:32,820
forming from the vascular cells
to build a network of blood

429
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:33,790
vessels around them.

430
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:35,990
And there's immune
cells in there also.

431
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:36,490
OK.

432
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:38,103
So now we're ready to go.

433
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:38,770
We did our part.

434
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,240
What did Steve Palmer do?

435
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,970
He went to Baylor Drug
Discovery Institute,

436
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:45,660
developed a whole new set
of Jun kinase inhibitors

437
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,170
with NIH funding.

438
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:49,960
And then he licensed them to
a company called Celmatix.

439
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,740
He left Baylor.

440
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,820
He's now at Celmatix.

441
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:55,930
And here we are a few weeks ago,
starting the launch of a project

442
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,780
so that we will do
preclinical efficacy

443
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:01,800
testing with the Celmatix team,
Steve Palmer, and the CEO Piraye

444
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,130
Beim, and the MIT team.

445
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:05,680
Of course, Laura Bahlmann
actually does all the work.

446
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,060
She's a postdoc in the lab.

447
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:11,640
But this EndoChip,
there's still a lot

448
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,910
of things evolving about
how regulatory agencies view

449
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:16,270
this kind of efficacy data.

450
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:18,670
So there's great
conversation going on.

451
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:21,910
But no matter what, you have
to prove your drugs are safe.

452
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:25,800
And so we come into this project
with decades of experience

453
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,900
working with drug
companies on building

454
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,590
these kind of patient avatars
for drug safety, particularly

455
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,090
liver.

456
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:33,160
So I invented something
called the liver chip.

457
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,120
It's widely used.

458
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:38,040
Novo Nordisk has built a lab
close to MIT to interact with

459
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:41,730
our team on how to use this
3D liver model of human liver

460
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:43,690
for cardiometabolic disease.

461
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:46,510
We've done interacting organ
systems as shown on the right.

462
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:49,360
And smaller versions of them
are commercially available.

463
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,270
So we know we have
to get these out

464
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:56,140
into the wild in collaboration
with lots and lots of users.

465
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,800
And we have to also
build many other organ

466
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,470
systems similar to what
we have for the chip

467
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:02,740
and connect them together.

468
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,650
So our vision and it's
under construction

469
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:08,400
is a living patient avatar
core facility at MIT.

470
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,410
And Kelly Pate, the
head of the division

471
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:12,990
of comparative medicine,
is very on board with this

472
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:16,650
because she would like to
move some of MIT's mice over.

473
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:20,070
In order to do this, we had to
develop a whole new platform

474
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:20,575
technology.

475
00:22:20,575 --> 00:22:22,200
What I showed you on
the previous slide

476
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,500
is about 10 years old.

477
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,340
So together with Dave Trumper
in partnership with Novo Nordisk

478
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,230
and a lot of other
partners, we're

479
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:32,080
developing all of these
for pain, for liver,

480
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,740
for chronic infection like
Lyme disease, gut microbiome.

481
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,500
And these are real
things that we

482
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,360
want to have on campus for
people to be able to use.

483
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,360
So I'll close there
and invite you

484
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,720
to come to the poster session.

485
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,140
If you want to hear more
about this and other diseases

486
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:51,870
we study, I encourage you
to join the MIT Move Over,

487
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,850
Mice movement and
be happy to talk

488
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:55,890
to you about it later today.

489
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:56,450
Thank you.

490
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:59,710
[APPLAUSE]

491
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:10,710

492
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:12,990
Good afternoon, everyone.

493
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:16,810
So I am a chemical engineer
who works in biology,

494
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:20,250
and I'm going to be talking
about how we can use extremely

495
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:22,530
small lasers to address cancer.

496
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:25,350
In our work, we
actually use alternation

497
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:28,080
of positive and negative
charge to build up

498
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,460
extremely thin nanoscale films.

499
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:33,330
And in this work, we've been
studying how we could take

500
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:36,370
an existing small
drug nanoparticle,

501
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:39,460
like a liposome or a
polymeric particle--

502
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,520
maybe it has a net
negative charge--

503
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,520
and positive and
negatively charged layers.

504
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,900
In this way, we can actually
incorporate a chemotherapy drug

505
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:52,760
in the core and wrap around
this nanoparticle other agents.

506
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,753
For example, after
positively charged layer,

507
00:23:55,753 --> 00:23:57,420
we can put something
negatively charged,

508
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:01,850
like siRNA that can silence a
gene that enables the cancer

509
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:05,210
cells to survive that
chemotherapy drug, thus creating

510
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,255
a way to address
chemo resistance.

511
00:24:07,255 --> 00:24:09,380
And one of the most important
parts of these layers

512
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:12,660
is that final layer,
negatively charged,

513
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,500
that enables us to have
a nanoparticle that

514
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:19,130
doesn't engage with other cells
but might be designed to engage

515
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:21,150
specifically with cancer cells.

516
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:23,700
So these are squishy materials.

517
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,950
I'm a polymer
materials scientist,

518
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:28,880
and we enjoy making
these systems.

519
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,790
But the idea is that we
can actually coat them

520
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:34,820
in a way that allows us
to direct therapeutics,

521
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:39,120
specifically to cancer
cells in chemotherapy.

522
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,660
And I like to compare
this to a Wonka Gobstopper

523
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,780
for anyone who remembers
what those things are--

524
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:44,280
[LAUGHTER]

525
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:47,270
--that have layers of
candy that dissolve

526
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:50,000
at different times, which
gives us a chance to regulate

527
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,680
how the drug is introduced.

528
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,920
However, when we became
really interested

529
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,530
in addressing ovarian
cancer, we found

530
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:59,870
that this approach
was not necessarily

531
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:02,130
the best approach using siRNA.

532
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:06,360
Ovarian cancer has been a very
difficult cancer to address.

533
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,720
It affects a large
number of women,

534
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,350
and it is detected late stage
because of the very subtle

535
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:14,540
symptoms that it provides us.

536
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:17,630
For that reason, although
a large number of patients

537
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:22,710
are able to recover after the
first chemotherapy treatment,

538
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:26,875
about 80% to 85% of them
will suffer a recurrence,

539
00:25:26,875 --> 00:25:29,000
and that recurrence will
be a highly resistant form

540
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,290
of the tensor.

541
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:32,240
For that reason,
it would be really

542
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,370
interesting to have
an immunotherapy that

543
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:37,760
would allow this
cancer to be attacked

544
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,500
by the human immune
system when it comes back.

545
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,800
Unfortunately, there's
been little progress

546
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,140
in doing this
because there are not

547
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:50,240
a large number of immune cells
that reside in ovarian cancers.

548
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,560
So when we began
looking at this problem,

549
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,400
we started thinking about
making a nanoparticle that

550
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,890
would be extremely sticky
to ovarian cancer cells

551
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,150
but not to other cells.

552
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:03,500
And we did this by looking
at a library in which we

553
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,543
started with the liposome
and wrapped positive charge,

554
00:26:06,543 --> 00:26:08,210
and then a range of
different negatively

555
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:11,970
charged stealth layers,
polysaccharides, polypeptides,

556
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:14,930
and a range of other
biomacromolecules, that

557
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:17,400
might be able to help
us with targeting,

558
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:22,010
as well as with getting
through the ovarian

559
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:24,240
space, this
intraperitoneal space.

560
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,440
And in doing so, we found
that there were a few that

561
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,010
were very interesting to us.

562
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:32,990
And those few actually
showed a very high affinity

563
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:35,750
for ovarian cancer,
whether it appeared

564
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:38,900
in the primary tumor-- here
we see a tumor lit up--

565
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:42,060
and the infrared
particle showing up

566
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,120
and a very nice
overlay, but also

567
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:47,540
in metastases within that
intraperitoneal or abdominal

568
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:51,020
space like this gut system.

569
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:53,030
Now, we found that
there were two that

570
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,570
were really interesting to us--

571
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:59,390
one of them, hyaluronic acid
actually binds to cancer cells

572
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:01,400
and gets taken up
into the interior

573
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,560
and releases things like
siRNA in chemotherapy drugs.

574
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,000
That's really interesting.

575
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,980
But we found
another one of them,

576
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:10,850
poly glutamic acid, a
very simple polymer,

577
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:12,980
that causes the
nanoparticle to stick

578
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:15,570
on the outside of the
ovarian cancer cell--

579
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:19,710
not great for delivering siRNA,
which has to-- on the inside.

580
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:23,270
However, it does allow
us to present something

581
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:24,870
to neighboring cells.

582
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:28,170
And we began to think about how
we might be able to use this.

583
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:30,530
I began to talk to my
downstairs neighbor

584
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:34,820
at the Koch Institute, Darrell
Irvin, who knows everything

585
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,150
about immunology and cancer.

586
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:40,240
And he was able to
inform about how

587
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,090
we might be able to use this
to deliver a cytokine, known

588
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:44,740
as interleukin 12.

589
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:48,250
IL-12 actually can
induce large amounts

590
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:53,890
of infiltration of immune
cells, in particular T

591
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:57,590
cells and NK cells that are
responsible for killing cancer.

592
00:27:57,590 --> 00:28:00,680
So we decided to then
take our liposome,

593
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:06,280
attach that IL-12 the liposome
directly, wrap it in plus charge

594
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,340
and then minus charge.

595
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:10,490
And that minus charge will take
us to the ovarian cancer cell.

596
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:13,000
Deliver this into the
intraperitoneal cavity

597
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,080
and let this get presented
to neighboring cells, which

598
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:20,080
will eventually lead to the
generation of interferons

599
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,820
and the infiltration of T cells.

600
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:26,110
And we did indeed find
that we had enriched

601
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:29,410
T cell infiltration
in these layer

602
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:31,340
by layer nanoparticle systems.

603
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:34,490
In fact, when we looked in
mouse ovarian cancer model,

604
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:38,650
we found that there were
something like 10,000 or more

605
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:44,260
infiltrated T cells
compared to untreated mice.

606
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,720
And what was really
exciting is that we

607
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,860
found we could combine
this IL-12 treatment

608
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,460
with checkpoint inhibitors.

609
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:55,600
Now, it's worth mentioning
that the reason IL-12 isn't

610
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,500
used in the clinic today is
because it is extremely toxic.

611
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:02,930
It can also excite the immune
system in the bloodstream.

612
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:05,530
In our work, attaching
it to a nanoparticle that

613
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:07,840
is very specific to
the cancer allows

614
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:14,260
us to rescue that toxicity and
avoid any kind of side effect.

615
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:16,000
Checkpoint inhibitors
are typically

616
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,760
not effective in
ovarian cancer at all.

617
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:23,270
So what we did was we combined
IL-12 with checkpoint inhibitor.

618
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:26,840
And in this case, we changed
the immune microenvironment.

619
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,570
So now there are
immune cells that

620
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:31,120
can be impacted by the
checkpoint inhibitor.

621
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:35,050
And what we found remarkably,
was in this red line as you see

622
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:39,460
here, 100% of the
treated mice survived,

623
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,410
compared to all of
the other treatments--

624
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:44,530
checkpoint inhibitor,
which does barely nothing--

625
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:47,990
and any of the other IL-12
combinations that we looked at.

626
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:50,200
So we're very excited
about this work

627
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,763
and looking at how we can
take this on to clinic.

628
00:29:53,763 --> 00:29:55,180
Now, I mentioned
that little story

629
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:57,640
about getting inside the cell.

630
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,140
With other collaborators,
Joan Brugge,

631
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:04,070
who is at Harvard Medical, and
Ursula Matulonis at Dana-Farber,

632
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:07,910
we've been looking at how we can
encapsulate inhibitor molecules,

633
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:11,890
again, so toxic that,
although they are together

634
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:14,240
very effective against
ovarian cancer,

635
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,960
they're also very effective
at harming the liver.

636
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,290
And in this case,
we encapsulated

637
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:22,930
these in a polymeric
nanoparticle

638
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:26,560
and used our hyaluronic
acid targeting system

639
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,690
to get this directly inside
ovarian cancer cells.

640
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:33,280
And again, we saw a
great deal of improvement

641
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,920
in ovarian cancer treatment.

642
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:40,700
So this theme of collaboration
is really important to us.

643
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:44,060
I usually show a slide of
all of the students involved,

644
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:47,500
and we have some incredible
students and postdocs involved

645
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,510
in this work, but I
wanted to point out

646
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:52,240
collaborators who have
impacted us in our journey

647
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,290
to address ovarian cancer.

648
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:57,620
I mentioned Darryl Ervin,
my wonderful neighbor,

649
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:01,720
who has informed us about
every aspect of the design

650
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,720
of these systems, and we have
worked together to develop it,

651
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,690
but we also have had this
wonderful collaboration

652
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:10,900
with Harvard Medical
School in Dana-Farber.

653
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:13,900
We're involved in breakthrough
cancer, which brings us together

654
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,540
with one of our
younger colleagues

655
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:19,150
at the Koch Institute,
Stephanie Springer, also

656
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:23,030
an expert in immunology
and tumor biology,

657
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:27,730
and Sohrab Shah at Memorial
Sloan Kettering, who is looking

658
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:32,740
at patient cells that are being
treated and determining changes

659
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,810
in the genetic
signatures of those cells

660
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:36,470
before and after chemotherapy.

661
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:40,180
If we can understand what the
outside markers of those cells

662
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:43,720
are, we can find
nanoparticles that can then

663
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:47,260
be targeted directly to
minimal residual disease

664
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:51,100
and treat them and excite
the immune response in them

665
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,810
using the studies that
Stephanie is doing.

666
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:57,520
And finally, we have a
wonderful collaboration

667
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,520
with my MIT colleagues
and colleagues

668
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:04,900
at Johns Hopkins with Angela
Belcher, Sangeeta Bhatia, Kripa

669
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:07,940
Varanasi, and Rebecca
Stone at Johns Hopkins.

670
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:10,430
And in this case, we're
reaching much earlier.

671
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:11,900
Intervention is really critical.

672
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:16,480
Ovarian cancer tends to be
detected at very late stages.

673
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,240
Angie has developed
nanoparticles

674
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:24,050
that are able to allow us
to see inside deep tissue.

675
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:27,040
And we are using our
sticky nanoparticles

676
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:31,570
to address being able to
detect those tumors and even

677
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:34,680
early tumors that appear
on the fallopian tube.

678
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,790
So with that, thank you.

679
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:39,550
And I'm really excited
about collaboration.

680
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:41,640
And I think that
this new initiative

681
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,770
is going to allow even
more of these opportunities

682
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:44,950
to take place.

683
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:48,324
[APPLAUSE]

684
00:32:48,324 --> 00:32:56,040

685
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,820
Hello, my name's Bruce Walker.

686
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:59,830
I'm a physician scientist.

687
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:04,420
I've spent my career taking care
of patients and studying HIV.

688
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:10,080
And it's my great pleasure
to tell you about a course

689
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,000
that I teach to
MIT undergraduates.

690
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,070
Each January in
the intersession,

691
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:18,420
we select 20 students
from all majors

692
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:22,360
and take them to experience
an ongoing epidemic

693
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:27,030
to understand the many
dimensions of an epidemic.

694
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,630
We go to South Africa.

695
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:31,000
You can see from this
slide the staggering,

696
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,710
staggering prevalence of HIV
infection there in the areas

697
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:35,650
that we work.

698
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:42,060
40% of men and 62% of
women in the ages 25 to 44

699
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:45,670
are infected and will
need lifelong therapy.

700
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:47,910
It's in that context
that the students

701
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:52,590
get to see what it's
fueling, that epidemic.

702
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:55,380
We land first in
Johannesburg, where

703
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:59,400
we begin the didactic
portion of the course.

704
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,940
We incorporate a number
of African students

705
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,460
with the MIT
students, and we begin

706
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,199
to teach them where
HIV came from,

707
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:12,190
how it causes disease,
how the body fights back,

708
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:15,880
and how therapies are
developed, and why

709
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:19,179
four and a half decades
after discovery of HIV,

710
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:23,250
there's still no vaccine,
but we don't stop there.

711
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:27,270
We also teach them about how
policy and advocacy influence

712
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:28,870
the course of an epidemic.

713
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:31,800
Here, they're learning
from Edwin Cameron, who

714
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:36,040
was the chief justice of the
South African Supreme Court,

715
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:42,239
who presided over the trial
that led to the forced--

716
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,940
to force the South
African government

717
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:47,590
to provide treatment
to its citizens.

718
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:50,100
He's also a gay man, and
he tells the students

719
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:53,610
about the problems of
stigma and discrimination

720
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:55,889
that he himself
encountered and that

721
00:34:55,889 --> 00:35:00,870
are so widespread
in that population.

722
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:05,370
We then go to Durban,
where we had participated

723
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:09,850
in collaborative research for 25
years with African scientists.

724
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:12,900
We helped catalyze the
construction of two research

725
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:16,950
institutes there by funneling
money from the United States

726
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:19,950
to support that construction.

727
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:24,060
The students get a chance
to see African scientists

728
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:26,700
and talk to them about the
opportunities and challenges

729
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,950
of doing research
there, but they also

730
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:33,280
get a chance to see ongoing
projects that are underway.

731
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,210
One of those projects is
called FRESH, probably

732
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:40,180
the most exciting project I've
ever worked on as a scientist.

733
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,840
Stands for Females Rising
Through Education, Support,

734
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,040
and Health.

735
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,640
And it has two goals.

736
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:49,470
One is it's an HIV prevention
program and poverty reduction

737
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:56,310
program geared at young,
high-risk women 18 to 23 years

738
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:58,740
old who are living in poverty
and because of that, are

739
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,970
at high risk for HIV infection.

740
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:04,450
But it's also a study
of acute HIV infection.

741
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:08,280
And essentially, we see
the women twice a week

742
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:11,590
for nine months, teach them
empowerment, life skills,

743
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:13,120
job readiness training.

744
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,510
And each time they come in,
we do a finger stick blood

745
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:20,490
draw to identify anybody, who
despite our efforts to prevent

746
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:22,420
infection, has become infected.

747
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:24,810
The students get a chance
to talk to these women

748
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:27,420
and understand what
it is that's fueling

749
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:31,310
the 10% per year
incidence rate of new HIV

750
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:33,950
infection in that population.

751
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:38,130
They also get a chance to see
part of the empowerment program,

752
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:40,970
which is teaching these
women, most of whom

753
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:43,880
have never graduated
from high school,

754
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,750
teaching them how
to use a computer.

755
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:48,800
Most of them have never
touched a computer before.

756
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:54,470
And we conduct the
study at a shopping mall

757
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:56,510
to avoid stigma that
would be associated

758
00:36:56,510 --> 00:37:01,440
with coming to a clinic
or to a or to a hospital.

759
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,390
And the course really
completely changes

760
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,760
the lives of these young women.

761
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:14,130
They come in with no real
sense of hope about the future.

762
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:16,280
And they leave having
found their voices

763
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:19,940
and feeling like they really
can make a difference.

764
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:24,440
Of the 3,000 or more women that
have gone through this course,

765
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:29,610
80% of them we've been
able to get employed.

766
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:32,360
And the unemployment
rate is so high

767
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,460
that these women
would really never

768
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:37,970
have had an opportunity
to become employed,

769
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:40,370
which moves them out
of poverty and reduces

770
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:43,850
their risk of HIV infection.

771
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:47,180
We also take the students
to local hospitals

772
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:50,060
to understand
delivery of care in

773
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,690
a resource-constrained setting.

774
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:53,990
Here, talking to
a young man who's

775
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:57,020
infected not just with
HIV, but also with TB,

776
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:59,660
and the challenges in
a resource constrained

777
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:04,610
setting of delivering care with
a highly contagious disease

778
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:07,370
like tuberculosis.

779
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:11,270
We go deeper into the rural
areas of KwaZulu-Natal

780
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:15,720
to teach them about delivery
of health care there.

781
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,920
This is a pharmacy.

782
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,500
And out on the table, you
see traditional medicines.

783
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:23,360
80% of South Africans will go
to see a traditional healer

784
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,160
before they go to
see Western medicine.

785
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,610
We've been collaborating
with traditional healers

786
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:30,300
for the past seven years.

787
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:34,160
And through a process
of building mutual trust

788
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:39,620
and respect, we've been able
to implement with them an HIV

789
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:42,990
counseling and testing program
so that when they see patients,

790
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:47,040
they now not just rely on
their traditional medicines,

791
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,860
but they test them
for HIV and refer them

792
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:52,130
to us if they need therapy.

793
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:54,470
So the students see
those traditional healers

794
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:59,780
and hear from them how they
were called to that profession.

795
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:02,660
We also introduced them
to infected mothers

796
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,610
and their infected
babies so that they

797
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:08,340
can understand how those
mothers became infected,

798
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:11,910
what the factors were
that led to that,

799
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:14,300
and understand how
difficult it is to raise

800
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:17,240
a child who's HIV infected.

801
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:23,300
We also go deep into the
rural areas of KwaZulu-Natal.

802
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:26,610
Here are some of the students
with a mobile clinic.

803
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:30,410
This is a catchment area where
the Africa Health Research

804
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:35,870
Institute has been collecting
data on the whole population

805
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:41,300
of about 160,000 patients once
a year on every person in that

806
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,090
region.

807
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:46,670
And the students go
and make house calls

808
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:52,610
with the RE investigators
and then come back

809
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:56,930
to the Research
Institute and use

810
00:39:56,930 --> 00:40:01,640
that data to answer questions
that they have generated

811
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,610
through the research that--
or through the visits

812
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:07,070
that they've made.

813
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:10,820
At that point, we're so
far north in KwaZulu-Natal,

814
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:15,270
that there are no local
hotels to stay in.

815
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:17,870
So we take advantage of that
and take them to a game park

816
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:21,240
where there is a hotel.

817
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:26,950
And there they do problem sets
in traditional MIT fashion,

818
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:30,970
comparing and contrasting
different epidemics, cetera.

819
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:40,240
And they then present those data
to one another as a wrap up.

820
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:44,800
In between the problem
sets, they go on game drives

821
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,650
to see another dimension
of the African landscape.

822
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:52,010
And finally, when we
get back to Durban

823
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:55,090
to the airport to
head back home,

824
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:59,320
I think it's fair to say
that their lives have really

825
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,720
been changed by the experience.

826
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:05,420
They realize that epidemics
are multifactorial.

827
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:10,700
They're not just the realm of
medical doctors and scientists.

828
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:13,240
But really, every
discipline has something

829
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:16,760
to offer to help
come to a solution.

830
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:20,680
They also learn that
it's really important

831
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:23,260
to learn from the
patients themselves

832
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:25,840
and to understand
what the barriers are

833
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:29,110
to care that prevent
some of the things

834
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:32,510
that we develop from ever
being actually utilized.

835
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:36,730
And what I learned year after
year from teaching this course

836
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:40,990
is that MIT students are
incredibly motivated, incredibly

837
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:43,690
bright, and
incredibly passionate

838
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:46,070
about making a
difference in the world.

839
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:50,530
And I think we as educators
have to show them those worlds

840
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:54,580
and facilitate their
involvement in that.

841
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:57,430
I'd like to finish
just by acknowledging

842
00:41:57,430 --> 00:42:00,860
MISTI and IMES and the Reagan
Institute for their support,

843
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:03,370
as well as
philanthropic support.

844
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:05,320
We set up this
course specifically

845
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,270
so that it would not
cost any of the students

846
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:10,750
any funds of their
own because we didn't

847
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:15,850
want economic considerations,
to prevent anybody

848
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:18,160
from taking the course.

849
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,310
And so I thank
you for listening.

850
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:24,660
[APPLAUSE]

851
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:26,000
