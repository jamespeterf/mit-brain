1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,440
thank you startup exchange for having us

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:09,760
I will jump right into it um I am an

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:15,360
Alum from the slone School of Management

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:18,840
MBA 23 and I lead SOS carbon uh I will

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,760
be focusing on um one of our

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,680
Technologies the most cost effective

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,039
technology for invasive seaweed

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,640
management and Marine debris management

9
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:30,320
but I will briefly also showcase other

10
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:34,079
areas that we have been developing and

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:36,840
already work so many of you probably

12
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,800
already heard about um seawe invasions

13
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:43,239
not only in the Caribbean but globally

14
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:46,840
affecting Co Coastline Marine ecosystem

15
00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:50,320
tourism dependent economies and even um

16
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:52,920
human health so at MIT at the mechanical

17
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:56,120
engineering department we developed a

18
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,359
Innovative but very simple um Hardware

19
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:00,559
that allow us to retrofit local

20
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:02,920
infrastructure local boats

21
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:06,640
to harvest a seawe in the ocean before

22
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:09,840
it makes landfall this device um is

23
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:13,080
already patented and we have deploy it

24
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,439
in several countries not only showcasing

25
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,880
again the high capacity that we have to

26
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:21,960
prevent the seawe from making landfall

27
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:24,560
but also um in terms of employing the

28
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:27,880
local communities and basically how this

29
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:30,240
works is that we again Harvest a seawe

30
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:34,560
in the ocean and then we have develop a

31
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:37,880
series of processes that um accommodate

32
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:41,079
to the local conditions Bas if it is a a

33
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:44,159
tourism location or if if it is like a

34
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:46,240
power plant um or again depending

35
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,719
depending on the customer

36
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,159
profile uh for this equipment we have

37
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:53,799
been able to deploy it as I um

38
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:56,799
highlighted in four countries Dominican

39
00:01:53,799 --> 00:02:00,159
Republic Anan baruda Mexico and Puerto

40
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:03,320
Rico with with operational permits um in

41
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:06,119
in all of them and has enabled us more

42
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:08,920
importantly as well to develop a supply

43
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:12,959
chain uh develop a supply chain from the

44
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:16,400
seawe as we also now work in

45
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:19,560
transitioning other Industries away from

46
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:24,959
petroleum based from chemical based uh

47
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:26,760
products into uh being CU based um we

48
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,560
have already developed a vertically

49
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:33,000
integrated operation from the seaweed

50
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:35,480
man man agement uh to seaweed seaweed

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,599
sales we have already chipped to more

52
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:40,840
than 10 countries um we also have been

53
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:43,840
developing and commercializing uh

54
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:46,800
several products our first entry point

55
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,080
has been in agriculture through a seawe

56
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,480
based bio stimulant called Marine

57
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:55,120
symbiotic and we are now also working on

58
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,319
carbon credits uh quickly to wrap the

59
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,239
idea or the concept around the carbon

60
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:02,640
credit carbon offsets basically when the

61
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,560
seaweed makes landfall it rots and

62
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,599
releases back the carbon and methane

63
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,680
that is that it once capture so taking

64
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:12,560
it through our vertically integrated

65
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,400
operation we can also account for those

66
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:18,799
carbon offsets um basically what we're

67
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:21,280
looking for not only Partnerships around

68
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:24,239
you know U groups of interest in the

69
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:27,400
tourism industry power plants affect the

70
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,200
stakeholders from from the invasive sewe

71
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:33,400
but also um industry leaders on

72
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:36,879
agriculture and bio Refinery looking to

73
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:41,519
transition again away from uh polluting

74
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:43,920
based materials into SE based um

75
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,599
materials so with that said again

76
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,879
looking forward to connect thank you

77
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:52,120
again startup exchange and and here my

78
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:54,280
contact information as we move away from

79
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:57,360
um you know petroleum base into

80
00:03:54,280 --> 00:04:00,480
sustainable materials from invasive sewe

81
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,799
mitigation thank you and thank you so

82
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,280
much and great to see all the progress

83
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:08,560
and um excited about uh the news that

84
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,239
everyone um has to offer so um can you

85
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,959
tell us a little more about um your

86
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:15,400
competitive advantage or how you

87
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,680
differentiate from anyone else out in

88
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,799
the

89
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:22,079
market sure so as I already share we

90
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:25,160
we're working on technically four

91
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:29,080
business segments um quickly on the

92
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:31,720
cweed management our equipment you know

93
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:34,400
is a at least 10 times a fraction of the

94
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:37,720
cost of other other competitive

95
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:40,320
technology like conveyor based machines

96
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:44,600
that are very complex and costly to

97
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:46,639
deploy in Ocean based environment and on

98
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:49,199
our end as well we have been able to

99
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:52,400
develop through our system to integrate

100
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,919
the local communities and offer uh foral

101
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,280
jobs today we have been able to

102
00:04:54,919 --> 00:05:00,560
integrate and and Empower in different

103
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:03,960
levels more than 120 fish

104
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:06,800
with that said on the um agricultural

105
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:09,520
side for example our seawe based bio

106
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,680
stimulate we are already at a commercial

107
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:16,800
level employing it or applying it in

108
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:20,639
over 15 crop types from rice to avocado

109
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:25,080
to tomatoes and we have seen um increase

110
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:28,080
in yield up to 60% in in several crops

111
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:31,039
um and we have also been working on

112
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,800
reducing synthetic f fertilizer putting

113
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:36,600
all that together also improving soil

114
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:39,400
Health um so again couple benefits

115
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:42,440
across our different uh business

116
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:44,639
segments yeah that is great to hear and

117
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:47,280
how um are you working nowadays with a

118
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,520
corporate for example or a government

119
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,759
agency what's the business

120
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:55,400
model thank you so again kind of

121
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:57,680
highlighting or partitioning it over the

122
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:01,240
different business segments very quickly

123
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:03,520
on the sewe management side we provide a

124
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:06,120
service or a licensing to affect the

125
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:09,880
stakeholders this could be the tourism

126
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:12,000
sector hotels um also like power plants

127
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:14,440
we have been also partnering with uh

128
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,520
government agencies across the Caribbean

129
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:20,120
and now looking for Europe as well where

130
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:23,919
where sewe has been affecting the the

131
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:27,080
coastlines of of various countries on

132
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:30,039
the um agricultural site we have been

133
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:32,440
working with um you know the different

134
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:35,080
farmers at a Industrial Level

135
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:38,160
incorporating our product as we then

136
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:40,479
form alliances with Agro Distributors

137
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,680
that's also the Partnerships mainly that

138
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:45,919
we're looking forward in the US and

139
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:48,240
Europe as we scale up the the

140
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:51,520
commercialization of our

141
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:54,520
products okay thank you very much thank

142
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,520
you
