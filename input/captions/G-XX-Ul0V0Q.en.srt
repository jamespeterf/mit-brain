1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,001
You know, I think as a young child, I was

2
00:00:02,001 --> 00:00:03,044
always just very curious.

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,088
Always asking questions about why things

4
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:05,922
are the way they are.

5
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:06,881
Perhaps not wanting to

6
00:00:06,881 --> 00:00:07,924
take things for granted.

7
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:10,385
I'm an only child, and when I tell that

8
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:11,094
to people, sometimes

9
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:12,053
they look at me and say,

10
00:00:12,053 --> 00:00:13,388
"Ah, that makes sense."

11
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:14,347
And I always wonder

12
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:15,390
what that really means.

13
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:18,184
I think that means that, you know, you

14
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:19,644
have to sort of have your own ideas,

15
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:20,562
you have to be willing to

16
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:21,855
live inside your own head,

17
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,440
thinking about things, having lots of

18
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,191
curiosity and imagination.

19
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:29,571
I was born in England. I was

20
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:30,822
born in the south of England,

21
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:32,574
which is a very green sort of place with

22
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:34,409
rolling hills, a lot of countryside.

23
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:36,703
My mother's English, my

24
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:37,871
father, was from Scotland.

25
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:40,623
And so already, even in British terms,

26
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:41,166
that feels like

27
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:42,083
you're quite international.

28
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:43,084
You know, the English

29
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:44,544
culture is quite calm and polite,

30
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:46,713
and the Scottish, more Celtic culture,

31
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,381
it's quite argumentative and

32
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:49,966
straightforward and brusque.

33
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,052
Chemistry had always felt like a subject

34
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:55,263
that bridged really sort of fundamental

35
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:57,432
science with the real world.

36
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,100
So chemistry seemed to me to be that

37
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,394
gateway between the fundamental sort of

38
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:02,437
properties, if you like,

39
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:04,189
of the universe and the kind of real

40
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:05,815
world as we saw it around us.

41
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:09,861
It felt as if coming to the US was coming

42
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:12,572
to a place where you could really be

43
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,574
authentically enthused

44
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:17,118
about sort of science and fundamental

45
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:17,911
knowledge production.

46
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,662
And so that was something that I really

47
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:21,289
wanted to do when I came from my PhD.

48
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:23,416
I've spent time at MIT since I was a

49
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,334
graduate student, and

50
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:25,335
it's a very special place.

51
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,086
So when I got to Harvard and I recognized

52
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:29,088
that not only could I roam around all of

53
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,632
Harvard's course catalog,

54
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:33,092
that there was an MIT catalog as well, it

55
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:34,177
seemed to me that it was just an

56
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,345
opportunity not to miss

57
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,180
to be able to take classes down here and

58
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,389
experience something different.

59
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,311
I was offered a faculty position in 2000,

60
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:45,438
and particularly for what I

61
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:45,980
have always been interested in,

62
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:49,442
that lab-to-impact journey, an ecosystem

63
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,069
that was flourishing and really

64
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:53,029
supporting some of those extraordinary

65
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:55,198
deep-tech entrepreneurs. It felt like an

66
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:56,699
incredible privilege to be able to be

67
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:57,867
here at MIT, being

68
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:58,785
part of that community.

69
00:02:03,122 --> 00:02:03,998
So I think for me I want

70
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:05,291
to have impact in two ways.

71
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,793
And so as I've said, one of the ways I

72
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:07,877
think I have impact in the

73
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:09,379
world is to teach my students

74
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,881
and to give them both the inspiration,

75
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:14,050
and the tools, the methods that they need to

76
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:14,968
go and actually make a difference.

77
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,679
And for myself, in terms of my own

78
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,180
impact, I increasingly

79
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,640
do work as an advisor.

80
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:21,599
I work advising

81
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,601
governments and large organizations.

82
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:26,312
I work quite closely with NATO and with

83
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:27,480
the UK government and others.

84
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,941
And the question I want to ask is, how is

85
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:32,026
it that our countries and our

86
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:35,155
organizations can actually draw upon

87
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,365
that inspiration to build the kinds of

88
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:38,324
companies and ecosystems

89
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:39,951
that they need to keep,

90
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,620
whether it's the UK or Europe, kind of

91
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,248
strong and resilient, so that we can

92
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,583
really have the kind of

93
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,084
latitude of action to take the hard

94
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:50,503
choices as countries and really do the

95
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:51,880
things that matter to us.

96
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,175
What MIT does so well is the thing that

97
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:59,679
the world needs so desperately, the mind

98
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:00,930
in hand, the thinking and doing,

99
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:01,890
the sort of the

100
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,391
practical genius if you'd like.

101
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,228
There's something really interesting when

102
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:07,979
you walk into a classroom.

103
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,231
You hear so many different accents. You

104
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:12,692
hear students from all over the world.

105
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,361
You meet faculty from all over the world.

106
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,196
It's very rare at MIT to walk into a

107
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:18,615
meeting and be the only person

108
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:21,200
who's a foreign-born individual. And you

109
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:21,910
see people who are

110
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,453
drawn to MIT as a place,

111
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:24,704
as much as they're drawn to being in the

112
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:25,747
United States, they're

113
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:26,956
drawn to the idea of MIT.

114
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,543
Well think it's a brilliant opportunity

115
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,879
to be able to talk to our students

116
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:35,048
and to draw upon their different global

117
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,466
experiences. So it's not just

118
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,343
me sharing my own experiences,

119
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,094
but also my students' experiences,

120
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:41,596
because so many of them have

121
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:42,513
lived in different countries

122
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:44,557
and are from different countries. And we

123
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:45,558
can really start to compare

124
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,143
notes and take a very sort of

125
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:48,645
global perspective on these complicated

126
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,355
times. It felt like an incredible

127
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,398
privilege to be able to be here at MIT,

128
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,317
being part of that community. Getting up

129
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:57,111
every day and coming to MIT is something

130
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:58,988
that is always really intense

131
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:02,784
and interesting. It sort of feeds your

132
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:05,244
curiosity and your ask of the possible.
