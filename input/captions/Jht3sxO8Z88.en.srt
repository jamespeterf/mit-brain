1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,440
next we'll hear about evolo H and how

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,920
they are decarbonizing the chemical

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,840
industry with a lowcost electrochemical

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:13,679
platform um due to an unforeseen event

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:16,680
Jimmy roas is not able to be with us

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:20,279
today but I am happy to introduce you to

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:24,240
Art Charley Chief commercial officer at

8
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:27,080
Evol art please take it away thank you

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:31,240
certainly and let me extend apologies

10
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:33,760
from Jimmy he had a family e Mery uh

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:37,960
earlier in the week and so was unable to

12
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:41,320
do this uh but very keen on the ties

13
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:44,399
with MIT and so he uh wanted some one of

14
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:47,399
us to be here to uh be able to produce

15
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:50,920
that let me uh try to move through this

16
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:55,120
quickly so we don't fall too far behind

17
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:56,960
uh iolo was founded for the purpose of

18
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,359
large scale manufacturing of

19
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:03,440
electrolyzer stacks and the sour story

20
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:07,080
behind it is uh Jimmy did his couple

21
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:09,840
degrees at MIT went to Stanford did a

22
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,960
PhD with a focus on entrepreneurship he

23
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,400
ended up at breakthrough energy

24
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:17,640
Ventures vetting hydrogen projects there

25
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:21,360
were all sorts of interesting technology

26
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:23,640
new Catalyst membranes Etc but no one

27
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,759
focused on the manufacturing and the

28
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,560
manufacturing is important because if

29
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,520
you can hit the actual targets for

30
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,159
hydrogen I I'll move my cursor over here

31
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:36,439
on the left it would require gigawatts

32
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:40,280
and gigawatts of Supply to manufacture

33
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:44,159
the hydrogen in demand probably through

34
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:46,920
uh 2050 you're talking about thousands

35
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:50,439
of gigawatts of installed capacity those

36
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:52,880
Stacks only last for so long 10 years 15

37
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:55,439
years maybe consequently you have to

38
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:58,240
replace them and we did an estimate it

39
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:03,159
would require up to

40
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:05,640
150 factories each one making 15 GW per

41
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:08,879
year that's a lot of capacity it doesn't

42
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,520
exist today and so what we find is in

43
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:14,959
the industry as people develop green

44
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,800
hydrogen projects um only about one out

45
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,760
of 10 is actually reaching a final

46
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,879
investment decision and that's because

47
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,879
the costs are high and the availability

48
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:29,239
is limited the cost are high because

49
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:32,519
existing uh Technologies use very

50
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:35,959
expensive materials precious metals uh

51
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:38,120
toxic membranes uh very complex

52
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:40,599
Logistics you see for the alkaline

53
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:43,159
electrolyzer the picture in the middle

54
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:47,200
on the left uh that one's about 6 and a

55
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:49,800
half megawatts weighs 80 tons so uh it

56
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,720
can't be moved over public roads or by

57
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,840
any kind of public conveyance you need

58
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:58,360
special transport uh transport for it

59
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,840
the Pim electrolyzers are smaller more

60
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:03,239
compact but because the use of precious

61
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,599
metals particularly idium which is a

62
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:07,959
critical limitation and the complex

63
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:10,840
Supply chains that go behind it they

64
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:14,760
tend to be very expensive uh and then

65
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:16,920
the Opex is hot uh they often can't load

66
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,959
follow so they can't be tied directly to

67
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:23,560
Renewables I know Mr giner mentioned

68
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:25,920
something about uh battery uh interfaces

69
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,840
and how expensive those are it really

70
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:33,080
becomes a limitation to tie together

71
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:35,720
lowcost renewal energy with high volume

72
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:39,280
electrolysis capacity and then the

73
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:41,360
second part is is that the scaling these

74
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:45,319
up to the gigawatts and gigawatts that

75
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:47,640
are needed um is uh is not really

76
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:50,280
possible with existing methods the

77
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:54,319
supply chains are broken they tend to be

78
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:56,959
made laboratory style uh and and very

79
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:59,239
inefficient that way the manufacturing

80
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,480
processes likewise are not very scalable

81
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:03,159
and I'll show you some data on that and

82
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,319
then the last part which I think is

83
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:07,799
critical especially for anyone who's

84
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:10,120
worked in the the chemical process

85
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:13,400
industry uh they tend to have very

86
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:15,840
limited warranties one or two years of

87
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:18,199
defects and workmanship and no

88
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,440
performance guarantees so over the

89
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:22,639
lifetime of the stack the performance

90
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:26,759
will degrade efficiency will go down

91
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:29,160
more electricity will be uh used and the

92
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:31,680
manufacturer has no responsibility

93
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,199
behind that so trying to fix these

94
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,759
problems becomes the real challenge in

95
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:40,600
the green hydrogen space so iolo went

96
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:44,039
after this uh in a number of ways number

97
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:46,840
one is we went for economies of scale in

98
00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:49,440
manufacturing by using roll to- roll

99
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:52,800
processing think newsprint something

100
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:56,000
very highspeed where the parts are all

101
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,919
uh made on a roll and then cut from that

102
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,520
in a SYM and in our process all of the

103
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:04,919
repeating component on in the cells are

104
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:07,400
made via roll to roll processing uh it

105
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:09,320
is very highpe speed which means more

106
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:13,360
can be produced in the same space it's

107
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:15,840
also a more compact way to make it the

108
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,960
second part is we use a technology

109
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,560
called anion exchange membrane

110
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:22,080
electrolyzers similar to the pen

111
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,440
electrolyzers I showed the great thing

112
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:29,400
about an exchange membranes is it's

113
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:31,400
possible to use only lowcost materials

114
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:34,400
and our focus on that was to be able to

115
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:39,319
use domestic Supply chains so stainless

116
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:41,520
steel uh nickel foam uh nickel Catalyst

117
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:43,639
uh hydrocarbon membranes all things that

118
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:47,000
you can Source literally anywhere around

119
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:49,319
the globe uh but because of the low cost

120
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,199
it makes it possible to scale the

121
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:54,160
manufacturing and then we want to

122
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,680
convert that into the lowest cost stack

123
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,800
in the industry because we start with

124
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,880
lowcost materials and a high-speed

125
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:04,240
manufacturing process we estimate that

126
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:06,960
our cost to manufacturer be one tenth of

127
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,039
the cost that we're seeing in forecast

128
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,759
for

129
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:14,039
20130 uh firms like Bloomberg NF and the

130
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,680
like have made estimates we believe we

131
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:18,440
can manufacture for a fraction of that

132
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:22,160
and as I said because it's only

133
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:26,400
commodity materials your uh limitations

134
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:29,800
to scale are greatly removed because now

135
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:32,360
these are available in in large amounts

136
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:35,400
and then we believe that will deliver

137
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:37,919
the lowest levelized cost of hydrogen

138
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:40,720
what you see here are a couple of uh our

139
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,919
one megawatt Stacks uh that we've

140
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:46,080
manufactured we don't have the full roll

141
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:49,759
roll process but we're getting there um

142
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,720
it uh is load follows uh and load sheds

143
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,039
instantaneously so you can tie it

144
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:56,120
directly to the

145
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:58,440
Renewables uh and likewise you've got

146
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:01,919
lower engineering costs because it's so

147
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:04,919
compact that uh you don't have a lot of

148
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:08,919
installation cost or cost in the balance

149
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:10,879
balance a plant that's required to uh

150
00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:13,479
required to make these one thing I'll

151
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:15,720
point out is it's a very unique design

152
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:18,039
if you've seen many electrolyzers they

153
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:21,440
typically have big end plates bolt

154
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:23,759
circles retention rods and the like uh

155
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,039
our stack doesn't have any of that it's

156
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,680
compressed uniformly by the wrap that

157
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:31,000
goes over the top and consequently it

158
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:34,319
doesn't have any issu issues with torque

159
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,479
amongst the cells or having to retension

160
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:39,800
the rods over time because of

161
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:43,560
relaxation that means it's much easier

162
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:45,560
to maintain in the field and what the

163
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:48,240
what's the outcome from that well the

164
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:51,479
graph on the left shows you that uh as

165
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:54,960
you drop the cost okay so on the bottom

166
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:57,960
axis uh from above two to below two you

167
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,919
begin to open up a number of markets

168
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:02,960
which really can't be addressed by green

169
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:05,720
hydrogen as it exists today and that

170
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:08,400
means the scale of the market uh

171
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:10,840
increases dramatically and as you see it

172
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:14,479
uh scaled here we go from a few

173
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:18,199
gigawatts all the way up to uh 800 gws

174
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:20,520
and that's in a 2030 sort of time frame

175
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:25,039
because now you're able to compete with

176
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:26,599
hydrocarbon sources of hydrogen and also

177
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,159
produce at the scale that those

178
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:31,159
hydrocarbon sources can produce up and

179
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:33,279
then that opens up all sorts of

180
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:37,120
industrial hydrogen markets as mentioned

181
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:41,039
before uh the ammonia space uh in steel

182
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:44,200
making Etc all of these now have the

183
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:46,399
opportunity to be converted likewise you

184
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:49,440
uh by making ammonia or by making

185
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:53,279
methanol you can get into any number of

186
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:57,000
large range of uh energy transfer or

187
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:59,480
energy uh export sorts of projects the

188
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,440
scale of the projects now become bigger

189
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:07,519
because that can be done likewise you're

190
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:10,480
able to uh focus on uh making energy in

191
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:13,000
one part of the world and moving it to

192
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:16,120
another part and so in particular when

193
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,079
you look at places like uh the Middle

194
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:21,600
East North Africa south Asia

195
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:24,320
particularly India South America where

196
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:27,800
they have huge potential for uh for

197
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:30,040
example solar idance but they're so far

198
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:32,320
from the main markets for electricity

199
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:37,000
that they'll never be able to uh

200
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:40,600
commoditize that and turn it into a a

201
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,160
export uh uh product but now by being

202
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,320
able to make hydrogen with that

203
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:47,560
electricity and then make these

204
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:50,240
exportable products you're able to uh

205
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:52,440
recognize that one of the uh project

206
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,519
developers that we're working with has a

207
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:59,920
project in marania for 35

208
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:02,640
GW of um electrolysis capacity which is

209
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:05,240
more than all the electrolics capacity

210
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:08,040
installed to date so we're very excited

211
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:10,560
to see these kind of big projects become

212
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:13,200
uh possible realizable through this

213
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:16,880
technology in fact we recently closed

214
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:19,800
our first sale it's 500 megawatts uh for

215
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:22,839
a very large renewable energy producer

216
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:24,800
who makes uh ammonia will make ammonia

217
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:28,120
with it and that's a binding sale

218
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:30,200
contract it's not a letter of intent but

219
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:34,200
certainly there's money behind

220
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:37,160
it uh a few last thoughts here uh our

221
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:39,399
factories because they're high speed

222
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:42,200
they have a smaller footprint which

223
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:44,920
reduces building costs they have a lower

224
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,920
equipment cost as well what you see in

225
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:49,639
the graph on the left is the factory

226
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:53,120
cost per gigawatt per year of

227
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:57,200
manufacturing you see a Volo down below

228
00:10:53,120 --> 00:11:00,760
20 uh dollars uh $20 million pardon me

229
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:04,680
per gigawatt whereas you see some of the

230
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:07,000
participants in the space uh cin and

231
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,920
plug power and the like who are much

232
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,959
more expensive typically it's around a

233
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:14,880
hundred million doar per gigawatt we'll

234
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:17,519
bring it in at a fifth of that cost

235
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:20,480
because it's very Compact and that

236
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:23,399
allows you to do that kind of vertical

237
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:26,399
integration where uh material comes in

238
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:29,920
one door and out the other door uh as

239
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:32,959
product very quickly a high uh

240
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:36,839
inventory turnover becomes an important

241
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:39,160
measurement of production cost and that

242
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:42,480
would allow us to be able to do negative

243
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:44,720
cash conversion Cycles in the long run

244
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,320
other words you get paid before you pay

245
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,320
for the raw materials uh and our

246
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:52,320
thirdparty assessments of this

247
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:55,320
manufacturing cost you see in the graph

248
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:59,519
here uh some of the uh markers are uh

249
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:02,360
hidden but anywhere from a 100 units so

250
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:05,680
100 electrolyzer Stacks per year to

251
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:08,480
10,000 electrolyzer Stacks per year you

252
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,959
see a very gradual drop off in that

253
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:14,240
manufacturing cost it cost you about two

254
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:16,959
and a half times here what it does cost

255
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,959
you here to make stacks and that means

256
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:23,199
you don't have to fully load the factory

257
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:26,440
before you're able to produce at a low

258
00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:28,399
cost uh we have a single product this

259
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:31,399
one megawatt stack which we can build

260
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:33,920
into larger units uh in shipping

261
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:37,680
containers uh We've proven those stacked

262
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:39,959
material costs exceptionally low levels

263
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,320
and the third party uh some of you may

264
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:44,600
be familiar with strategic analysis who

265
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,800
did this for us and so what that means

266
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:51,519
when you break down the cost of the

267
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:55,000
stack uh we believe we can go to market

268
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:56,720
uh $200 a kilowatt and you see the cost

269
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,720
of materials and Manufacturing and

270
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:02,920
warranty in there which means there's

271
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:06,639
plenty of room to be able to to uh move

272
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:08,920
that and manage lower cost even going

273
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:11,880
forward uh just want to say something

274
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:13,399
quickly about our partners uh of course

275
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:16,519
our our lead investor the engine

276
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:19,120
Ventures they from the IM Community

277
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:22,320
breakthrough energy and Sapphire

278
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:24,760
Partners uh our development Partners

279
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,639
some of whom are also investors next AA

280
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:30,160
energy the largest renewable energy

281
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:32,920
developer in the americ perhaps one of

282
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,880
the largest in the world uh and we have

283
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:38,839
some exciting projects going on with

284
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:40,639
them uh 3M uh the guys who practically

285
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:42,959
wrote the book on Roll to- roll

286
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:45,079
processing so very exciting to be doing

287
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:48,480
some development with them and then

288
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:52,000
SoCal Gas who is very much focused on

289
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:55,000
using their gas grid for hydrogen uh

290
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,519
moving hydrogen hydrogen projects and

291
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,079
the like some of the things we're doing

292
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:03,240
now uh working on large scale commercial

293
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:05,199
uh Pilots multi megawatt scale Pilots

294
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,600
we're doing working with a number of

295
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:10,600
epcs on the engineering and balance of

296
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:14,320
plant design and then of course uh

297
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:16,880
talking to developers around the globe

298
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:19,320
to be able to bring these projects

299
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:23,120
forward and I think I brought it in

300
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:25,680
under time so kaarina I'll let you take

301
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:29,279
over thank you thank you very much art

302
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:32,040
for the presentation um we have few

303
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:35,720
questions for you as well um the first

304
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:39,600
one is a membran part of the innovation

305
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:42,480
of eolo or am is purchased off the shelf

306
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:45,279
from supplier okay that's that's a great

307
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,279
question uh we do not make the membrane

308
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:51,279
and we do not Source membranes from

309
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:54,199
other startups who make AMS and part of

310
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:56,839
the reason behind that is because their

311
00:14:54,199 --> 00:14:59,079
startups they're developing a product

312
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:01,320
they typically don't have the quality

313
00:14:59,079 --> 00:15:03,880
procedures in place that typically don't

314
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:06,279
have the scale to manufacture that would

315
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:08,040
allow us to do gigawatts per year I

316
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:10,800
think at the last the last count I heard

317
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:13,800
of is we're working with four different

318
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:16,040
multinational membrane manufacturers

319
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,680
lots of people have seen interest in

320
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:20,120
this place particularly with the issues

321
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,399
around the posos materials which are

322
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:25,120
used in the proton exchange membrane

323
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,880
electrolyzers and so consequently lots

324
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,240
of large membrane manufacturers are

325
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:32,079
wanting to get into this space we

326
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:34,360
evaluate those materials uh Our

327
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:37,759
intention is to go to market as a

328
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:39,600
membrane agnostic manufacturer which

329
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:42,160
means we can Source from a number of

330
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:46,839
parties and still deliver the same

331
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:49,560
performance and lifetime that um we uh

332
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:54,000
will warrant for our product okay thank

333
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:57,440
you um what are developers or epcs

334
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:00,600
demanding from oems like eolo and are

335
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:03,360
those demands being met

336
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:05,560
um so another great question one of the

337
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,480
things I touched on before was that

338
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:11,639
typically for electrolyzer manufacturer

339
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:15,079
they have a very limited warranty one or

340
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:18,000
two years defects and workmanship no

341
00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:20,600
performance guarantee overtime or even

342
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,120
initially and so consequently when an

343
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:26,160
EPC builds a plant he has to wrap a

344
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:29,480
warranty around the entire plant that

345
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:32,040
promises the uh the project developer

346
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:34,319
the owner that it will use this much

347
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:36,720
electricity to make this much hydrogen

348
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:39,480
it will have a certain amount of uptime

349
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:42,959
the maintenance will uh be at a certain

350
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:45,319
cost and the The Limited warranties that

351
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:48,360
are typically issued in this field

352
00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:50,360
become very challenging our focus is to

353
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,720
issue uh we're still working on the

354
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:55,480
details with an insur but we believe

355
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,720
we'll be able to go to market with a

356
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:59,519
lifetime warranty think like the

357
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:03,519
warranty you get on your automobile

358
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:07,000
tires of five to eight years when we put

359
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:08,959
our product in the market thank you um a

360
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,720
final question for you uh can you

361
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,880
clarify why several new sites say that

362
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:18,400
Supply is much higher than

363
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:21,720
demand uh yeah so uh that's a question

364
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:26,600
of uh paper capacity versus real

365
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:30,320
capacity so in the after 2020 2021 lots

366
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:33,200
of uh companies incumbents startups Etc

367
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:36,320
announced factories that they intended

368
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:39,080
to build but frankly because they're so

369
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:41,480
expensive most of those have not come to

370
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:44,960
fruition no one's even put a shovel in

371
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:47,240
the ground and so consequently that

372
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:50,280
capacity on paper looks quite

373
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:54,000
large but the reality is the actual

374
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:56,159
manufacturing capacity is quite limited

375
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,840
and I'll say this even in Volo we

376
00:17:56,159 --> 00:18:02,640
announced a 3.75 gwatt per year Factory

377
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,280
in LEL Massachusetts which we intend to

378
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:08,360
start up in

379
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:11,480
2026 uh it appears in a lot of list of

380
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:13,919
factories even though uh we occupy the

381
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:16,039
site we have our development equipment

382
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:18,159
there I showed you a picture before with

383
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:20,600
the stacks that were at that site but it

384
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:24,880
does not manufacture at

385
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:27,679
3.75 kwatts per year today so we have to

386
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,360
be very careful and kind of put a jaist

387
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:32,480
eye on some of these estimates

388
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:35,240
because they take press releases and

389
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:38,080
tabulate from that and the vast majority

390
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:41,000
of those plants do not

391
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:46,159
exist thank you very much har and thank

392
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,159
you again prau for being with us today
