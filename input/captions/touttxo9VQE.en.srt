members of startup exchange but first

9
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:23,960
i'm just going to share a little

10
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:26,679
overview of our

11
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:28,480
program so MIT startup exchange was

12
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:30,679
created over eight years ago within the

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,480
office of MIT corporate relations as you

14
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:36,239
heard earlier to support MIT connected

15
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:38,040
startups as they grow expand and help

16
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,360
solve some of the world's greatest

17
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,680
challenges and we do this by fostering

18
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:45,280
collaborations and Partnerships between

19
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:47,360
the startups and Industry primarily ILP

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,239
members represented by so many of you

21
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,000
joining us today and the MIT Innovation

22
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:56,079
ecosystem and

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,079
Beyond the startups in our program are

24
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:01,039
uh based on MIT licensed technology or

25
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,559
founded by MIT faculty staff or alumni

26
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,960
and they can also be vetted by some of

27
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:09,119
our MIT Partners including the engine

28
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:10,759
Ventures the e14 fund Cale MIT Nano the

29
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,680
marting trust Center for MIT

30
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:16,400
entrepreneurship and many

31
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,240
others and so our program has around a

32
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,759
thousand startups in it usually they

33
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,960
join at Pilot stage or Beyond and they

34
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,280
cover all sectors and all geographies

35
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,720
and we did this uh within this bigger

36
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,159
Network we also have a group that we

37
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,920
call st25 some of you might have heard

38
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,759
of it and this is where we provide

39
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,680
customized support to the startups for a

40
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,000
period of one year where they have

41
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,560
greater visibility more introductions

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,159
and so

43
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,119
on and so when it comes to this value of

44
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,680
startup

45
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:48,600
exchange the startups in the program

46
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,600
have exposure to a Global Network of

47
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:54,200
Industry decision makers and the

48
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,320
corporates have access to vetted MIT

49
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,159
connected

50
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,680
startups on events we host a variety of

51
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,759
them all throughout the year local

52
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,920
International summer conferences like

53
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:09,280
today where we host an uh startup

54
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:12,959
lightning talk session an exhibit and um

55
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,360
we also have our demo days um other

56
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:18,680
webinars one-on-one meetings workshops

57
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,840
and much more and the benefit of this

58
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,120
for the ILP members is that we can

59
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,760
tailor an event according to your needs

60
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,560
and the benefit to the startups is that

61
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,959
we can take you onto different markets

62
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,080
that you're expanding into perhaps and

63
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:34,720
you have greater visibility into new

64
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,599
ecosystems we also launch calls for

65
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,720
startups we call these

66
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:40,400
opportunities and they're based on a

67
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,519
corporate's priorities and internal

68
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,840
challenges and so the startups can apply

69
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:46,959
on our website and if they're selected

70
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,480
they can work with you as an ILP member

71
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,280
to help you solve a problem that you're

72
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,280
facing in your

73
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,560
industry and all in all this is a very

74
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,480
curated and customized approach so I

75
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,599
hope everyone here um and online is able

76
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,120
to take advantage of of these benefits

77
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:04,440
and of course come talk to any of us

78
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:07,280
today if you have any questions about

79
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:10,680
it and so as I mentioned before start of

80
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,080
exchange was created to help um Foster

81
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,360
these Partnerships and collaborations

82
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,239
and these are just a few of the success

83
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:20,200
cases up to date and they can take the

84
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:23,360
shape of a proof of concept uh Grand

85
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,720
Scale Pilot customers joint R&D and all

86
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,239
the way to an

87
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,799
acquisition and again this is a forum

88
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:31,480
where some conversations maybe will

89
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,680
