1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,720
good morning afternoon evening everyone

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:07,279
depending on where you are in the world

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,440
um so my name is Karen Jang I am a

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:12,320
faculty member at the operations

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:15,759
Management Group at slong uh you see

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:19,039
here kind of a very brief F of myself I

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:21,640
actually I grew up in h China and I did

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:24,160
my ma undergrad and master's degrees in

9
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,720
chinua University which I always stroke

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,320
is the MIT in

11
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:32,480
China and then uh I came to the US and

12
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:34,960
did my pH D at Stanford University uh in

13
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,200
management science and engineering then

14
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,559
after that I was fortunate enough to

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,320
join the faculty of slung and um and

16
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,640
I've been here since

17
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,719
2011 um so my my research is broadly

18
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:51,600
related to sustainability issues in

19
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:55,160
Global Supply chains and uh in the past

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:58,320
um decade in particular I have focused

21
00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:00,239
uh in particular on um food and Global

22
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,160
and and food and agricultureal system

23
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:06,600
globally and really the overarching goal

24
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:09,240
of of my research in this area is how we

25
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,720
can think about innovating the systems

26
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,799
um with technology incentive design as

27
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:16,439
well as behavioral interventions to

28
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,799
promote both environmental and social

29
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:21,000
sustainability um and and I think that

30
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,680
you know it goes without saying why food

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,040
and agricultural systems are important

32
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:28,600
to us because food is such a fundamental

33
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,880
need for all all of us uh but just to

34
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,680
you know uh illustr rate uh that

35
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:36,759
importance and highlight that importance

36
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:39,560
with some numbers here um you

37
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:42,360
know uh the global demand for safe and

38
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:45,280
nutritious food is is you know ever

39
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:48,119
growing and and this is also coupled

40
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:51,520
with the challenge that in at least some

41
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:53,600
parts of the world uh productivity may

42
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,560
it has been declining because of uh

43
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:59,920
climate

44
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:02,479
challenges um uh you know food um the

45
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,200
food system is related to two of the

46
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:07,799
most pressing challenges in the world

47
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:10,560
one is hunger and the other is poverty

48
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:13,319
uh and this is especially true when we

49
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,560
think about a large portion of this uh

50
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:18,920
system intersect with uh developing

51
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:21,800
nations uh where a lot of the uh small

52
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:25,120
holder producers are the main uh

53
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:28,640
producers of food uh now of course the

54
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,720
the food system uh has a huge uh impact

55
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,599
on you know Environ mental

56
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,239
sustainability uh it occupies a

57
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:37,800
significant portion of our land and use

58
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:40,080
a significant uh part of the water

59
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,200
globally and also contribute

60
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,040
substantially to greenhouse gas

61
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:47,519
emissions uh finally uh there's also

62
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,560
significant Public Health uh relation

63
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:53,000
between the food system and um and and

64
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,360
public health uh in the sense that you

65
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,959
know uh a lot of uh a large portion of

66
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:05,000
population actually suffer from uh food

67
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:07,760
contamination and um um pathogens Etc uh

68
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,239
in you know in in the food

69
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:14,200
system um

70
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:16,640
so um to give you an overview uh this is

71
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:19,560
kind of the overarching goal of my

72
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:22,920
research uh again focusing on the global

73
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,879
EOS systems how we can use uh

74
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:28,159
Technologies uh incentives as well as

75
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:30,239
behavioral uh interventions to improve

76
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,080
the efficiency of the systems the

77
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,720
sustainability as well as the social

78
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,200
welfare of the systems so far I've been

79
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:40,120
look at uh multiple topics under this

80
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,480
overarching goal uh all the way from

81
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,920
Upstream production and resource uh

82
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,560
optimization to the middle part in terms

83
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:49,000
of how we design markets and Supply

84
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:53,200
chains as well as to the downstream how

85
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:56,760
do we ensure food access and reduce food

86
00:03:53,200 --> 00:04:01,400
waste um oops sorry I did something

87
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:06,519
wrong with my with my okay I'm back all

88
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:08,560
right so oh I'm not back I guess okay um

89
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:12,200
and and uh in the process of doing this

90
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,680
research uh I'm I am um I'm you know a

91
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:17,239
believer of underground collaboration

92
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:19,199
and this is collaborating with a whole

93
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:21,320
spectrum of organizations from private

94
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,759
organizations companies startups

95
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:26,919
nonprofits to you know public

96
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:29,720
organization such as governments and um

97
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:31,479
think tanks and and also academic

98
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,320
institutions particularly those in the

99
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:36,199
ground uh of the regions where my

100
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,560
research projects

101
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:42,880
are so what I wanted to do uh today is

102
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:44,639
to share with you a few examples of uh

103
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,919
these projects to give you a sense of

104
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,960
what kind of uh questions we uh we try

105
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,520
to answer and what kind of tools that we

106
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:55,120
use in answering those questions uh the

107
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:57,680
first example is a collaboration with

108
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:01,800
the state government uh of kataka in

109
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,720
India and focusing on on uh a digital

110
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,199
reform of the state where they build a

111
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:10,280
digital agricultureal platform to unify

112
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:14,199
trades across uh over 160 agricultural

113
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:16,840
markets uh throughout the state and um

114
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:19,120
the idea of this platform is really by

115
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:22,000
integrating historically isolated

116
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,919
markets and also to digitize transaction

117
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,319
processes this could potentially

118
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:28,680
increase competition on the buyer side

119
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:30,759
uh improve Market channels for and

120
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,680
Market access for farmers who are

121
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:34,800
oftentimes confined to their own local

122
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:37,960
regions and also increase price

123
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,600
transparency to um potentially address

124
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:44,360
issues such as uh collusion uh on the

125
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:46,280
buyer side um we did two things uh with

126
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:49,800
this uh with with the state government

127
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:52,000
of cantica one is uh we first perform a

128
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:55,000
very rigorous impact assessment for the

129
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,240
government to really demonstrate whether

130
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,479
uh establishing such a platform can

131
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:03,000
significantly improve Farmers welfare

132
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:07,199
and Farmers income and um and this

133
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,479
requires us to uh you know perform uh

134
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:12,720
Advanced econometrics analysis and

135
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:15,759
statistical analysis on large scale um

136
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:18,319
price and uh quantity data that we can

137
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:21,039
get from uh from the platform and our

138
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:24,000
results show that uh actually the impact

139
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:26,560
of such a platform on Farmer income uh

140
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,319
is not uni is not uniform across

141
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,360
different Commodities there are some

142
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,360
Commodities farmers benefit

143
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:36,479
significantly as you can see here the

144
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,840
313 uh Commodities with the green bar

145
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,840
but then for other

146
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:43,000
Commodities um the the platform has

147
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:45,560
actually not yielded a significant price

148
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Improvement for the farmers and by

149
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:52,560
analyzing the potential supply chain and

150
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,759
operational reasons behind um these um

151
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:58,280
these uh supply chain operational

152
00:06:54,759 --> 00:07:00,160
processes behind uh these Commodities we

153
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:03,080
find that uh this could potentially

154
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:06,879
related to Limited in Market competition

155
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:09,360
and and the platform has not signif

156
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:12,120
sufficiently address those issues and

157
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,479
does a lack of impact and so what we did

158
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,440
next as a as a followup is that we work

159
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:19,120
with the government to completely

160
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:22,039
redesign the auction used on this uh on

161
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,879
the platform for these Commodities um

162
00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:25,840
with the goal of further increasing

163
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:27,759
competition among the Traders among the

164
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,960
buyers and then we work with the

165
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:32,440
government to launch a a uh pilot

166
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:36,400
implementation in one of the major

167
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:38,919
markets for lenos and uh the graph show

168
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,319
here demonstrates that the pilot

169
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:43,360
actually led to a very significant uh

170
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:46,560
price Improvement and profit gain for

171
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,479
over 20,000 Farmers that participate in

172
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,919
the market where the new auction

173
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:53,240
mechanism was

174
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:56,560
implemented so uh this is one of the

175
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:59,520
examples earlier examples um that that

176
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,960
we look at uh basically how platform Des

177
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,720
design and and price and the price

178
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:07,240
Discovery processes on this platform can

179
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:08,360
be designed to um increase the impact of

180
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,080
such

181
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:14,159
platform as a next example this is a

182
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:16,759
current ongoing project in Indonesia and

183
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:18,440
this is in collaboration with a uh

184
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:20,960
private company pam pam which is a

185
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:23,120
platform company as well as a local

186
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,560
academic institution ipb University

187
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,879
specializing agricultural uh

188
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:30,159
Technologies and the idea of this this

189
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:32,159
project is uh to design

190
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:36,399
incentives to promote sustainable

191
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:40,640
practice adoption by small holders um so

192
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:43,479
so far um uh many of these uh um you

193
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:45,600
know projects for promoting sustainable

194
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:48,080
practices by small holder farmers are

195
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,760
only confined within very small scale

196
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,279
pilots and Regional pilots and

197
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,760
short-term uh pilot with transient

198
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:57,720
benefits and so there's the question of

199
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:59,440
how can we design incentives to enable

200
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:04,000
scalable long-term and consist

201
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:07,160
consistent uh consistent um uh adoption

202
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,920
of these practices and so what we did is

203
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:12,120
that we started by um interacting with

204
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,760
the relevant stakeholders to understand

205
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,519
you know what are some of the challenges

206
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:19,279
that they face and that that prevent

207
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:21,760
these um uh practices from being

208
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:24,399
consistently adopted and based on that

209
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:27,920
Insight we develop a model to compare

210
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:30,240
two mainstream uh incentive design uh

211
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:33,279
which is termed offsetting in setting

212
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,160
incentives um yeah the the the high

213
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:39,240
level result from the from the model is

214
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:42,279
such that um in setting incentive is is

215
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:45,079
a a less popular incentive that's only

216
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:47,320
starting to emerge in practice however

217
00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:49,800
for our analysis shows that it can

218
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,880
actually help to balance trade-off

219
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:54,360
between productivity and sustainability

220
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:56,720
adoption much better compared to the

221
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,720
more mainstream offsetting incentive and

222
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,800
as a result it can be more cost

223
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:04,760
effective uh to ensure long-term

224
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,640
adoption of sustainable practices by

225
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:09,680
small holders and given this modeling

226
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:12,200
inside then we go to the field we

227
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:15,000
actually develop a simulation experiment

228
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:17,680
um and recruited over 200 Farmers to

229
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,320
participate in this experiment to

230
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,760
observe their decisions when they are

231
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,760
exposed to these two different kinds of

232
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,880
incentives and you can see here some

233
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:29,720
pictures of us in the field interacting

234
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,600
with Indonesian uh oil pal farmers as

235
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,320
well as the interface of the simulation

236
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:37,639
game that the farmers uh make decisions

237
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:40,079
in and and the results suggest that is

238
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:42,880
is is consistent with our modeling

239
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:45,279
prediction where um the in setting

240
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,040
incentive essentially can promote more

241
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:49,680
consistent compliance than the

242
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,440
offsetting incentive uh we are currently

243
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,200
actually discussing with a number of

244
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,600
corporate organiz corporates uh to

245
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,959
design potential fi uh randomized

246
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:03,200
control trials to really evaluate the

247
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:06,279
impact Act of uh these two incentives uh

248
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:09,240
in in actual you know farming

249
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:12,240
decisions so very quickly one last

250
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:14,320
example that I wanted to share is

251
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,920
another uh project that we recently

252
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,959
worked on and this focused on Ghana

253
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:23,120
subsaharan country and in this project

254
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:25,720
we look at the problem of uh fot waste

255
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,600
as well as food security essentially the

256
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,760
idea is that there's a large amount of

257
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,600
food being wasted in the production

258
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,399
process of food supply chains and yet at

259
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:37,959
the same time we know that food

260
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:41,600
insecurity and hunger are major issues

261
00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:43,600
in these developing countries so uh the

262
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,560
the the overarching goal is how we can

263
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,720
design lowcost scalable behavor

264
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:49,120
interventions to reduce foot waste in

265
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:51,440
the production processes and in

266
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:54,440
particular we focus on restaurant

267
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:57,320
kitchens uh this project is is uh we are

268
00:11:54,440 --> 00:12:00,160
in collaboration with a number of um

269
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:04,760
academic Partners uh as as well as the

270
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:07,720
local Ghana tourism authority to uh

271
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:10,200
basically design uh different kinds of

272
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:13,959
intervention messages that either uh

273
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:16,800
highlight public um interest or private

274
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:19,320
interest so public will be uh public

275
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,800
interest will be related to saying if we

276
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:24,680
can save uh we can if we can reduce food

277
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:27,360
waste then the reduced foot waste could

278
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:30,360
be used to feed more people the private

279
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:33,800
interest intervention is more related to

280
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:36,199
how reducing fot waste can improve uh

281
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:38,639
can induce cost savings by The Man by

282
00:12:36,199 --> 00:12:41,320
the restaurants and as a result more

283
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,320
sustainable employment by the workers in

284
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:45,360
the

285
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:49,440
kitchen um we uh collaborate with our

286
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:52,920
local Partners to engage 71 restaurants

287
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,600
and run a few randomized control trial

288
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,839
across these restaurants over three

289
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,279
weeks uh and this is a map of all the

290
00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:02,560
restaurants that were part you know um

291
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:05,160
engaged in the experiment um and what we

292
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:09,360
found is that in fact private interest

293
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:11,320
intervention can be over twice as as

294
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,800
effective as public interest

295
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:17,160
interventions um and the impact that we

296
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,199
can measure from uh this three-week

297
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:21,160
experiment is such that using these

298
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:23,839
interventions to reduce food waste can

299
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:26,920
have a significant societal impact uh

300
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:29,839
just looking at the restaurants in a

301
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:32,120
that that we involve in the experiment

302
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:34,160
or in the study the total foot waste

303
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:36,600
avoided because of the use of these

304
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:39,199
interventions could already feed 5,000

305
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:42,360
people in the country and so we believe

306
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:44,480
that this is another you know um project

307
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:47,959
that can have a quite significant

308
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:50,519
societal impact so to conclude uh I

309
00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:52,560
would just want to highlight that uh I

310
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:56,560
have quite actively and consistently

311
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:58,680
engaged andan students in my project and

312
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,680
these students contribute in and

313
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:03,040
particip in a number of different ways

314
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,600
and different types of analysis ranging

315
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:08,399
from statistical machine learning

316
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:12,000
analysis to optimization and also I

317
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:13,480
think you know because of my interest in

318
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,519
you know field workor as well as

319
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,759
behavioral interventions a lot of times

320
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,680
these students also engage in designing

321
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:21,440
experiments implementing experiments in

322
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,920
the field as well as analyzing the data

323
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,920
from these experiments
