1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,160
Hello everyone. I'm uh Karn Kaship. Uh

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,519
I'm a undergrad and graduate school alum

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,400
from uh computer science department at

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:17,359
MIT. So Posh is a vertical AI company.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,119
We focus on the financial services uh uh

6
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,720
segment of the market and we've

7
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,320
developed a pretty comprehensive AI

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,840
platform. Uh we develop multiple

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,680
different solutions for financial

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,119
services organizations. Today I'm going

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,800
to highlight a couple of our solutions.

12
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,720
One is a AI powered knowledge management

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,320
system. The other is an AI powered help

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,239
center. The knowledge management system

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,640
is for employees. The help center is for

16
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,160
customers or potential customers. So the

17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,000
uh challenges that we often see working

18
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,760
with a lot of our our uh bank and

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,920
financial services customers. They have

20
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,520
a lot of uh issues with um uh employee

21
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,960
retention and knowledge retention.

22
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,879
There's constant uh turnover whether

23
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,800
it's frontline staff or even uh back

24
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:53,039
office staff. Uh retaining employees,

25
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,559
hiring employees is a challenge. Um we

26
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,920
see continuing elevation of customer

27
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:57,199
experience. You know, historically, it

28
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,280
was okay for a bank to have, you know,

29
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,480
not great customer experience. Uh, today

30
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,600
it's no longer about the bank that

31
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,960
you're competing with down the street.

32
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,479
It's about, you know, the the next

33
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,920
generation fintech companies or the

34
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,920
experiences customers are having with

35
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,080
Amazon and Uber and other uh companies

36
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,840
as well. Um, and lastly, you know, we've

37
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,600
seen a lot of attempts at self-service

38
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,280
and financial services. Uh, those have

39
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,320
all been kind of the previous generation

40
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,200
of self-service tools. So, non AI power,

41
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,720
non-personalized. Uh, and we think that

42
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,400
self-service is still very promising,

43
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,799
just the way that you do it has to be

44
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,080
modernized. So um one of the things that

45
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,600
we're really targeting that's really

46
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,600
rampant across financial services

47
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,200
organizations is legacy search or

48
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,720
keyword search. You know whether it's

49
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,680
internal knowledge, customer knowledge,

50
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,040
there's a lot of unstructured

51
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,200
information, but it's not really

52
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,720
accessed in an intelligent way. Um so

53
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,479
the first one we're going to talk about

54
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,880
today is our uh AI powered knowledge

55
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:45,119
management system. Uh using AI to not

56
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,360
only uh provide better answers based on

57
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,520
documentation, but also using AI to

58
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,680
actually help uh author documentation,

59
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,759
analyze documentation against regulatory

60
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,920
compliant sources. So if regulations

61
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,680
change, can we quickly use an AI agent

62
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,520
to analyze against your policies and

63
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,280
procedures and flag if something is now

64
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,200
non-compliant within your policy or

65
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,960
procedure base? Right? So this is an

66
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,960
example of uh the the experience of the

67
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,319
tool. Here you can see a user can ask a

68
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,560
natural language question just like you

69
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:13,360
might with the chat GPT. Uh we site

70
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,879
source documentation. We uh actually uh

71
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,640
open up the source documentation and

72
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,080
allow you to actually see uh the chunks

73
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,239
or segments within the documents where

74
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,680
the um answer was actually pulled from.

75
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,280
So, you can see here automatic scrolling

76
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,360
and highlighting of that information.

77
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,480
Um, we also allow for the ability to ask

78
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,080
uh follow-up questions in a

79
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,000
conversational manner. So, if you want

80
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,120
to dig into a particular question, can

81
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,040
you um you know ask ask a more detailed

82
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,080
question. This is good for new hires who

83
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,280
don't know how to ask the right

84
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,280
question, you know, instead of having to

85
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,319
try over and over, you can just clarify

86
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,239
what you meant really have a

87
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,519
conversation with the knowledge. So a

88
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,200
lot of this stuff I mean it's it's

89
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,040
pretty obvious that tools like chagbt

90
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,640
can be powerful but uh we're bringing

91
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,959
this into an agentic application even

92
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,720
for the management side of knowledge uh

93
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,879
regulatory compliance checks document

94
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,440
authoring and maintenance and so forth.

95
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,440
So um on the customerf facing side let's

96
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,200
pivot there. Um you can see an example

97
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,200
here. This is a a virtual assistant that

98
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,200
we have with a bank here in New England.

99
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,440
Um so it's you know kind of powered by

100
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,200
uh more LLM and Agentic applications as

101
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,720
well. But I want to show you our uh

102
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,879
customerf facing help center solution.

103
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,720
So very similar to what you saw on the

104
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,560
employee side, but uh a lot of our

105
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,159
customers have search bars on their

106
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,080
websites, in their mobile applications,

107
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,519
digital banking applications. And

108
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,800
typically when people use search bars,

109
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,879
they don't get an answer. They get a

110
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,720
bunch of results back and the results

111
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,840
are usually very annoying to have to go

112
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,959
through and there's no guarantee that

113
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,799
the answer you want's even in the

114
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,400
results. So we see with our customers a

115
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,159
lot of lost revenue opportunities and a

116
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,519
lot of frustration because a customer

117
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,360
doesn't know how to navigate a very

118
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,640
extensive complicated website. So just

119
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,159
like we're doing with the employee base,

120
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,040
we're also bringing it in a customerf

121
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:45,280
facing lens uh with call to actions with

122
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,879
uh suggested actions as well. So taking

123
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,200
them directly to an application form for

124
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,280
example um or a scheduling tool if they

125
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,640
want. So uh we have a lot of different

126
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,000
products. I I just covered a couple of

127
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,519
them today. Some things that we're

128
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,959
working on right now that are not uh

129
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,200
public on our website, we're working on

130
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,040
uh AI simulation training. So actually

131
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,200
having AI avatars that simulate the

132
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,720
customer uh and letting uh call center

133
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,159
agents, collections officers, loan

134
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,480
officers actually have conversations

135
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,599
with uh simulated customers before they

136
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,080
actually deploy into the field for

137
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,599
example. So um we're looking for you

138
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,519
know design partners for new things that

139
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,440
we're working on. We're looking for uh

140
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,040
existing organizations uh domestically,

141
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,720
globally especially if you're in

142
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,560
financial services or tangential

143
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,759
industries who are looking for uh some

144
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,000
of the solutions like what I showed

145
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,360
today. But uh open to any questions. Uh

146
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,360
hopefully this was a good overview of

147
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,360
Posh.

148
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,520
Hi. Um I'm from the insurance industry.

149
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,840
Do you have any uh use case there? Yeah.

150
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,600
So um you know same stuff that I talked

151
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,520
about. Uh you know we're building uh

152
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,080
knowledge management, customer help

153
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,680
center, uh AI simulation for training.

154
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,080
Um a lot of those use cases we've

155
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,240
designed it for industries that have uh

156
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,000
uh GRC requirements. So uh governance

157
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,759
regulatory control uh requirements and

158
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,680
compliance requirements. Insurance is

159
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:59,560
definitely uh part of that financial

160
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,560
services umbrella for us.

161
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,280
One over there. You have to build a

162
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,520
database or Oh, I'm sorry. Do you have

163
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,720
to build a knowledge base or a database

164
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,479
for every industry you go into

165
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,000
presumably? So that insurance might be

166
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,919
different than from healthcare or

167
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,520
something else. Do you participate in

168
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,039
all those industries by the way? And

169
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,880
then what's the ramp up time to get into

170
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,560
a new industry? Yeah, exactly. So that's

171
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,320
why we we've gone vertical. we're we're

172
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,400
just focusing on financial services um

173
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,080
for that reason. Um so we've done a lot

174
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,759
of domain specific work for financial

175
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,680
services. So for us that's like banking,

176
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,720
wealth management, fintech insurance,

177
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,440
that's kind of what we consider

178
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,919
financial services. Um but from when we

179
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,280
onboard a customer, uh the customer's

180
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,199
knowledge also has to be a big part of

181
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,320
these conversational applications. So a

182
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,759
lot of what we've done is not just

183
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,840
making the knowledge easy to access in a

184
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,000
conversational tool, but also building
