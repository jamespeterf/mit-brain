1
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,199
all right let's uh let's get started

2
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:18,320
today we are going

3
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:20,920
to start a new part of the course and

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,240
introduce really A New Concept that will

5
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,680
guide a lot of what we'll do for the

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,080
rest of the

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,760
semester um so what we're going to do is

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,679
return to our supply and demand

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,720
framework but within that framework

10
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:34,200
we're going use it to turn to talk for

11
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,840
the first time about normative economics

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,960
remember positive economics is the way

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,960
things are normative economics is the

14
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,879
way things should be we haven't given

15
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:46,199
you any tools of normative economics yet

16
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:48,559
we will today so let's start with uh The

17
00:00:46,199 --> 00:00:51,640
Standard supply and demand equilibrium

18
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:55,600
and what happens when you

19
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:57,960
shock shocks to demand and Supply we now

20
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,960
know where the demand Supply curves come

21
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,199
from we deal the demand curve from

22
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,239
consumer Theory the supply curve from

23
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,680
producer Theory you should be able to at

24
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:07,360
your leisure uh if I give you the

25
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,960
Primitives like the utility function and

26
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,119
prices or the production function and

27
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,759
prices and the nature of the market you

28
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,799
should be able to derive demand and

29
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:18,360
Supply curves so let's start with a

30
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:22,119
standard Market which is the market for

31
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,759
gas okay so figure 91 has the General

32
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:26,240
market for gas on the x-axis you have

33
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,119
quantity which is gallons of gas in the

34
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,600
y axis you have price which is dollars

35
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:33,600
per gallon you've got a demand man curve

36
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,640
which measures the willingness of

37
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,880
consumers to pay for the good so it's

38
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,240
the marginal willingness to pay each

39
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,560
point on that demand curve represents

40
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,240
the amount consumers are willing to pay

41
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:48,200
for that next unit you have a supply

42
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:50,840
curve which is the producer's marginal

43
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,840
willingness to supply each point on that

44
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,799
curve represents the producer's

45
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:58,880
willingness to supply that next unit

46
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,600
okay demand curve slope up I'm sorry

47
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,079
demand curve slope down

48
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,640
because as the price goes up you're less

49
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:08,000
willing to buy the next unit Supply

50
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,239
curves slope up because as the price

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,360
goes up firms are more willing to supply

52
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:16,200
the next unit okay and equilibrium is

53
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,680
the point where Supply equals demand

54
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:23,080
where both consumers and producers are

55
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:26,840
happy at the point P1 q1 consumers are

56
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:30,280
willing to buy q1 gallons to the price

57
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:33,400
P1 that's on the demand curve producers

58
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,840
are willing to supply q1 gallons at a

59
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,120
price P1 that's on their supply curve

60
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,519
therefore you're in equilibrium at Point

61
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,800
little

62
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,159
E1 okay that's our basic framework

63
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,640
that's literally going back to the first

64
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:48,879
lecture we did this graph for Roses

65
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:50,159
rather than gasoline I've now told you

66
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,360
where those curves come from in the

67
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:53,319
first lecture we just talked about the

68
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,200
demand Supply framework I've now built

69
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:57,519
up the perimeters to tell you where

70
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,720
those curves come

71
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:03,280
from now what I want to ask next next is

72
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:06,080
what happens if there's shocks in the

73
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,519
demand and Supply framework how does

74
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,440
that affect the equilibrium how does

75
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,519
that affect prices and

76
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,159
quantities so for

77
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,599
example suppose The Taste change

78
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:18,560
remember what determines the demand

79
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:20,640
curve is utility function and your

80
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,200
budget constraint utility function is a

81
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,080
representation of your

82
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:28,200
preferences suppose your preferences

83
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,720
change okay suppose for

84
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:34,080
example that people suddenly start to

85
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,720
want to drive big cars so you say look I

86
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,040
like having a big car I feel safer on

87
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:40,040
the road it's better in bad weather I

88
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:43,000
want to start driving SUVs and minivans

89
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:45,080
and other big cars okay and that we'll

90
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,080
call that a preference shift so utility

91
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:49,879
function has changed people have more

92
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:52,400
preferences or big cars well what does

93
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:55,799
that do to the market for gas well big

94
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,799
cars are a

95
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:04,079
complement to gasoline because big cars

96
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:08,000
more gas so if you want a big car you're

97
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:09,799
going to use more gas what that means is

98
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,680
that you're going to see a shift

99
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:15,400
outwards in the demand curve for gas

100
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,600
people want big cars big cars use more

101
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,479
gas the demand curve shifts outwards

102
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:23,919
from D1 to

103
00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:26,320
D2 okay at any given price of gas

104
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:29,479
consumers want more because their tastes

105
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:32,520
are for a bigger car that uses more gas

106
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:33,759
so so if we imagine for a minute the

107
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:37,000
price being

108
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:40,560
unchanged imagine the price stayed at P1

109
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,720
what would happen well at P1 suppliers

110
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:47,080
are still willing to supply q1 but

111
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:50,240
consumers now want q1

112
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,600
Prime since they want to drive big cars

113
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,520
if the price of gas is the same they

114
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,680
want more gas the problem is producers

115
00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:01,160
won't produce it so we have what we call

116
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:05,479
excess demand the difference q1 Prime

117
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:06,400
and q1 is excess demand consumers want

118
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:10,919
more

119
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:14,400
gas than producers are willing to

120
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:17,600
supply so what happens well the market

121
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:21,600
equilibrates what happens is you slide

122
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,960
up the supply curve from point E1 to

123
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,560
point

124
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:30,039
E2 suppliers seeing the excess demand

125
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:32,039
say hey I can raise prices cuz consumers

126
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:35,880
suddenly want more gas I can raise

127
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:38,440
prices consumers as prices rise want a

128
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:41,120
little less gas because the demand curve

129
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:44,880
is after all downward sloping and that

130
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:48,759
continues until you reach Point little

131
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:51,639
E2 at Point little E2 you are back in

132
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:53,039
equilibrium because at Point little E2

133
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:56,680
given the new

134
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:59,120
taste consumers are happy with Q2

135
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,000
gallons of gas at a price P2 they're

136
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,919
willing to pay more to get more gas

137
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,280
because they want more gas guzzling

138
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:06,440
cars producers are still in their supply

139
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,199
curve so they're happy as long as

140
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:11,520
they're in supply curve they're happy so

141
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:14,199
basically what happens is when there a

142
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,319
shift in demand you instantaneously in a

143
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:18,479
shift outward in demand you

144
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,680
instantaneously create excess

145
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,919
demand suppliers respond to that by

146
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,319
raising the

147
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:27,400
price and you eventually shift to new

148
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:29,759
equilibrium where once again both

149
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:32,080
parties are happy

150
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,680
okay you can't keep the price constant

151
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,840
because given new consumer taste that

152
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:40,599
would lead to excess demand for

153
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:44,400
gas okay questions about

154
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:47,840
that okay let's do the flip side let's

155
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:50,720
say that the supply curve shifts imagine

156
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:55,039
there's suddenly a war in the Middle

157
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:57,160
East okay and suddenly gas gets much

158
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:59,160
harder to get the marginal cost of

159
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:01,039
producing gas goes up for example

160
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,960
because it's more expensive to ship it

161
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,400
from the Middle East to the US or

162
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,199
because for example we can't buy from

163
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,840
Middle East sources anymore and we have

164
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:13,360
to buy from less efficient higher

165
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:17,000
minimum average cost sources like the

166
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,919
US so because of that the marginal cost

167
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,199
of producing gas has gone

168
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:25,680
up the supply curve is the marginal cost

169
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:28,919
curve above the shutdown point so that

170
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,080
means there is a shift upward and inward

171
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:32,840
of the supply

172
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:36,919
curve in other words producers are

173
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:39,280
saying given the higher marginal cost I

174
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:43,720
need to get a higher

175
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:46,199
price to produce any given quantity of

176
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,560
gas so producers are saying look if the

177
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:52,159
price stays at

178
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:54,159
P1 I'm only going to produce q1

179
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:55,919
Prime I'm going to produce the price

180
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:57,280
stays at P1 I'm not going to produce as

181
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,879
much gas because it's more costly to

182
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,039
produce gas so I'm going to be further

183
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:04,039
down my curve

184
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:06,879
well at that point consumers still want

185
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:11,199
q1 producers only want to produce q1

186
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:14,039
Prime so what do we have again excess

187
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:16,360
demand excess demand this time not

188
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:19,159
coming from a change in preferences but

189
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:21,000
from a change in the underlying cost of

190
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:22,680
production so what happens with those

191
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,039
excess demand what in this case you

192
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,800
slide up the demand

193
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,479
curve

194
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,800
consumers knowing that they have extra

195
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:31,839
Dem man say look we're willing to pay

196
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,200
higher

197
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:35,800
prices producers say well if you pay

198
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,919
higher prices we're willing to produce

199
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,440
more and you end up at the new

200
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:43,479
equilibrium little

201
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:48,040
E2 at little E2 once again both parties

202
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:49,760
are happy consumers are happy because

203
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:52,800
they are still getting they're on their

204
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:55,920
demand curve they're will their marginal

205
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,000
willingness to pay for Q2 gallons is

206
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,600
P2 producers are happy because they're

207
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,800
happy to produce Q2 gallons that at

208
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:06,760
P2 now you might say to yourself well

209
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:09,360
gee how can consumers be happy life's

210
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:11,240
changed well I'm not comparing their

211
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,240
happiness across the two equilibriums

212
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,720
I'm just saying they're equilibrium

213
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,839
we're going to come that's exactly what

214
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,680
we're going to talk about in a little

215
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,880
while which is what has this done to the

216
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,839
well-being of

217
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,040
consumers what I'm talking about now I

218
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:24,880
shouldn't even use the word happy I

219
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:26,800
should say in equilibrium consumers are

220
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,200
willing to pay that price to get that

221
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,440
quantity but you should immediately

222
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,920
think gee consumers look like they're

223
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,360
kind of worse off here okay and we're

224
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,839
going to come back to that that's what

225
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:39,200
what we'll be talk focusing on this

226
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:41,079
lecture Okay now what's an important

227
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,399
thing to note if you look at figure 92

228
00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:44,720
and

229
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,360
93 in both

230
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:51,560
cases the price went

231
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:53,560
up yet in one case quantity went up and

232
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:56,320
in one case quantity went

233
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:58,880
down the bottom line is you can't tell

234
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,200
from a price increase alone if there's

235
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,560
been a Supply shift or demand

236
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,760
shift okay this is a lot of what drives

237
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:07,959
empirical economics you can't just

238
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,040
observe the one feature in the market

239
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:11,279
and say I tell you what's going to

240
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,519
happen to the two outcomes no you still

241
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:16,480
observe both price and quantity to tell

242
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:19,480
me if there was Supply shift or demand

243
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,480
shift

244
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:26,680
okay now let's ask why do these curve

245
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,640
shift why in general we'll give you lots

246
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,800
of fun examples on tests and problem

247
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:34,040
sets of Shifting demand and Supply

248
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:36,920
curves what do they why do curve shift

249
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:38,920
well why do demand curve shift they

250
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:43,120
shift fundamentally for four

251
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:44,800
reasons first your income changes if

252
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,920
People's income change it shifts their

253
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,639
demand

254
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:51,519
curve

255
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:54,720
okay the second could be the change in

256
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:58,880
the price of a compliment good change in

257
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,880
the price of a complement

258
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,560
okay change in the price of a complement

259
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,279
there could also be a change in the

260
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:09,839
price of a substitute I did a complement

261
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:11,880
example but you should be able to see

262
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,240
what for example would happen if people

263
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,279
suddenly wanted smaller cars and why

264
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,680
that would lead to the main curve to

265
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:19,240
shift in the other

266
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:22,800
direction and then finally as we cover

267
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,800
in our example A change in

268
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:30,160
preferences okay so those are the

269
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:33,240
reasons why demand curves can shift

270
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,240
why do supply curve

271
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,639
shift why the supply curve shift are

272
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:43,360
really just for two simple reasons one

273
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:43,360
is a change in input

274
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:50,079
prices and two is a change in

275
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:57,279
technology so these sorts of outside

276
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,240
outside influences can shift the demand

277
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:01,560
and Supply

278
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,959
curse in the video that it coveries this

279
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,639
lecture I do a fun

280
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:08,279
example which is what

281
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:12,160
happened when Kim

282
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:13,680
Kardashian who has more more Instagram

283
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,760
followers than there are people in

284
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:20,160
France plus England at this

285
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:23,120
point uh decided to post that you could

286
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,839
lose weight by exercising in a corset a

287
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,600
course it is a medieval thing women used

288
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:29,199
to wear to tighten their waists okay

289
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,760
fortunately couple hundred years ago

290
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:33,120
women didn't stopped having to wear

291
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:34,519
those things but Kim Kardashian posted

292
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,240
in fact if you wear a corset while you

293
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:37,120
exercise you lose weight now in fact

294
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,040
she's

295
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,240
wrong okay there is no evidence that

296
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,480
corset while you exercise you lose

297
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:46,600
weight but she's an influencer as they

298
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:49,839
say and immediately there was a surge in

299
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:52,720
demand for corsets at that time there

300
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:55,199
was one corset company because they're

301
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,600
medieval okay and that Corsa company

302
00:12:55,199 --> 00:13:00,040
started making gobs and gobs of money

303
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:03,040
why and because

304
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:06,000
since demand shifted out they raised

305
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:08,120
their prices and raised the

306
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,279
quantity and they started making a lot

307
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:14,320
of profit so that's an example of a

308
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:16,880
preference shift that shifts demand but

309
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,079
what do you think happened

310
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,000
next I mean later we realized it was a

311
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:24,000
bad idea but before before that what

312
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,839
happened in the market for corsets

313
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,120
next

314
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:30,519
yeah what's go ahead there's a price in

315
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,079
increase I said that that's right and

316
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:34,079
more profits but what happened after

317
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:41,000
that yeah remember our La last lecture

318
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:43,440
firms entered when there's profits it

319
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,160
causes entry so suddenly there was a

320
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,720
bunch of corset companies that popped up

321
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,399
and eventually drove the price back down

322
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,839
so much profit be made in the corset

323
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,959
Market they're presumably all bankrupt

324
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:57,600
now I don't know okay but basically

325
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,680
that's an example of the Dynamics of how

326
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,880
preference change

327
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,360
can change the functioning of a market

328
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:06,800
the preference change shifted the demand

329
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,440
curve out that led to higher prices

330
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,040
those higher prices led to an increase

331
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,639
in profit for the one manufacturer that

332
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,199
led to more entry because it's a free

333
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,600
entry Market there's low fixed costs in

334
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:17,519
making corsets that drove the profits

335
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:22,240
back

336
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:22,240
down okay questions about that

337
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:28,120
yeah can you go over the first bull

338
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:30,920
point for what demand what if it was

339
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:32,320
demander the fourth one or all of them

340
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,759
the first one is a change in income I'm

341
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,839
sorry change in income income or

342
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:39,680
preferences changing influences uh

343
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:43,279
demand

344
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:45,320
okay so now with that in mind let's talk

345
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:50,480
about how all this

346
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:50,480
depends on the shape of demand and

347
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:57,759
Supply let's talk about how all this

348
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,079
depends on the shapes of demand and

349
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:03,959
Supply okay

350
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:05,959
let's once again talk about an inward

351
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:07,279
shift in Supply like the war in the

352
00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:10,440
Middle East that raises the cost of

353
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:12,240
producing gas figure 93 shows what

354
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:15,199
happens with a standard supply

355
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:17,040
curve with an inward shift in Supply

356
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:21,639
prices rise quantity

357
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:24,040
Falls what however if the if demand was

358
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:26,480
perfectly

359
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:29,000
inelastic perfectly inelastic demand is

360
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,560
a good where the quanti demand is in

361
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,560
sensitive to price an example we talked

362
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,360
about last time was insulin for

363
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,560
diabetics where you know you're not

364
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,399
going to risk your life over a dollar

365
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,240
here or

366
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,800
there okay if you can afford it I don't

367
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,920
be too glib insulin is very expensive

368
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,120
but if you can afford it you'll you'll

369
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:46,680
you'll pay for it regardless of the

370
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:48,920
price that leads to a perfectly

371
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:51,880
inelastic demand curve for insulin a

372
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:54,279
vertical demand curve for insulin now

373
00:15:51,880 --> 00:16:00,040
what happens when the supply

374
00:15:54,279 --> 00:16:02,000
shock well Supply shifts from S1 to S2

375
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,240
quantity does not change because

376
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,639
quantity can change because it's in

377
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:09,279
elastic all that happens is price goes

378
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:11,759
up so we have a um we have a flat if we

379
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:13,360
have a perfectly elastic demand curve

380
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,399
remember I talked last time that'd be an

381
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,480
example of something like McDonald's

382
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:19,399
versus Burger King in that case if there

383
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,120
Supply

384
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:23,240
shift it doesn't affect the price why

385
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,120
doesn't it affect the price because

386
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,839
remember the perfectly elastic demand

387
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,440
you can't change

388
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:31,199
price okay you can't change price price

389
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,000
price is fixed because if you charge one

390
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:35,079
penny less everyone will buy from you

391
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,480
buy one penny more nobody will buy from

392
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:41,120
you okay so these are the extreme

393
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:43,240
examples and obviously we have cases in

394
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,880
between okay so that's where the

395
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,759
elasticity of demand comes in as we

396
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,839
think about shifts in the demand and

397
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:50,839
supply

398
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,680
curve okay so that's just a little

399
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:53,759
background to the main highlight of

400
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:57,639
today's lecture which is not the

401
00:16:53,759 --> 00:17:02,199
screaming gorilla but rather uh thinking

402
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:02,199
about consumer and producer

403
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:09,559
Surplus as I've said so far in this

404
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:11,919
lecture we have Focus purely on positive

405
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:16,120
economics the way things

406
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:17,480
are How firm how consumers decide for a

407
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:19,760
given set of price and income how many

408
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:22,039
cookies to eat how producers decide for

409
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,919
a given set of input prices and a

410
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:26,480
competitive market demand how many wi

411
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:29,559
widgets to

412
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,679
produce we've not talked about

413
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:34,320
how we feel about that the normative

414
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,919
side is that good is that bad in

415
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,880
particular let's say a particular

416
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:41,960
extreme example we showed in the long

417
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:44,679
run with a perfectly competitive

418
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:47,559
market there are zero

419
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:48,799
profits well how do we feel about that

420
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:50,919
well on the one hand for consumers

421
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:53,640
that's a pretty good deal the price is

422
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:55,280
as low as it possibly can be you are

423
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,640
buying at the lowest possible price

424
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,280
because the Bret producing efficiently

425
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:02,480
is possible for producers not not such a

426
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:04,200
good deal they're making zero profits

427
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,480
and maybe that matters maybe we care

428
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,559
about the companies maybe we care about

429
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,919
the companies in America who have to

430
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:10,159
hire us and give us our jobs maybe we

431
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:13,559
don't just care about the consumers who

432
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:16,000
buy the goods so how do we think about

433
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:19,400
whether that outcome is one we like or

434
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,840
don't like and the answer is we turn to

435
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:24,720
the tools of what we call

436
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,840
welfare

437
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,799
economics welfare economics now

438
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,960
sometimes people use welfare to refer to

439
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,880
money we give to poor people I'll come

440
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,520
to that later the semester when I say

441
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,440
welfare almost always the semester I

442
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,760
mean it's an economic term for

443
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,280
well-being welfare is the welfare of

444
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,640
society it's the well-being of society

445
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:45,720
welfare

446
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:48,960
economics is the normative side of

447
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:51,320
economics and basically the idea of

448
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:54,840
welfare economics is to

449
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:57,360
measure the actual well-being that's

450
00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:01,000
created by different

451
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:04,120
circumstances now to do so technically

452
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,559
we would measure the change in oodles so

453
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:07,200
we'd say in the two different outcomes

454
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:09,200
how do people's udel change but I told

455
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,360
you already utils are

456
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:14,120
meaningless utility is an ordinal

457
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:17,000
concept not a cardinal concept so this

458
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:19,200
sty Economist for a long time how do we

459
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,640
measure well-being when we can't measure

460
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,280
utility until they come up with a very

461
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:26,600
clever

462
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:30,720
idea and the clever idea was to use what

463
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,720
we call compensating

464
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:41,559
variation which basically means instead

465
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,559
of asking how happy or sad I am ask me

466
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:47,600
how much money I would pay to be that

467
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:51,120
happy or pay to avoid being that

468
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:54,120
sad use a concept Economist called

469
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,120
revealed

470
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,880
preference don't try to measure my

471
00:19:57,799 --> 00:20:04,200
preferences get me to tell you what they

472
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:06,760
are by getting me to reveal the prices I

473
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:10,400
will pay for different changes in the

474
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:12,080
environment okay so consider my demand

475
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,679
for my favorite band The

476
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,480
Killers

477
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:18,600
okay let's say the killers are on tour I

478
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,960
saw them three times their last tour

479
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,720
okay let's say they're on tour and let's

480
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,600
say I get huge utility the first time I

481
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,679
see them a little bit less utility the

482
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,320
second time a little bit less than the

483
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,280
third still very positive but it falls

484
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,360
okay

485
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,559
because you know I've just saw him the

486
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,480
night before or whatever but I have I

487
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:38,120
have diminishing Marge utility of killer

488
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:41,720
concerts like with any other good okay

489
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:44,919
so then you ask me John how much would I

490
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:47,320
have to pay you to miss a killer

491
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:49,840
show or alternatively if the tickets are

492
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:53,120
sold out you can ask me John how much

493
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:56,440
would you pay me to go to a killer

494
00:20:53,120 --> 00:21:00,280
show okay those are the kind of

495
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:01,840
questions that reveal my preferences

496
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,240
and in particular they reveal my

497
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:07,000
consumer

498
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:10,279
surplus my consumer surplus is the

499
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,480
benefit that a consumer gets from

500
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:16,279
consuming a good above and beyond the

501
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:19,360
price they've paid the benefit the

502
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:22,400
consumer gets from consuming the good

503
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:25,799
above and beyond the price they've

504
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:30,520
paid so for example imagine I could get

505
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:30,520
a ticket to a killer show for $100

506
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
if I if my marginal willingness to pay

507
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:38,159
for that show is exactly

508
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,679
$100 well first of all if my marginal to

509
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:43,880
pay for that show is $90 what do I do I

510
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:46,559
say no okay what if my marginal is to

511
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:49,240
pay is $100 well then I'm indifferent

512
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:52,880
let's say I say yes let's say it's $100

513
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:55,520
and one cent so let's say I say yes but

514
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,360
I get no consumer surplus because that

515
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:00,080
was pretty indifferent between going and

516
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,320
not going but let's say my marginal need

517
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,559
to pay for Killers concert is more

518
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,080
realistically for the first show at

519
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:06,080
least more like3 or

520
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,039
$400 okay which I'd happily pay to go

521
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:11,840
see The Killers so they came back around

522
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:14,120
again okay well then I've derived a huge

523
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:17,360
Surplus because my marginal link to pay

524
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:20,200
was $300 but they're only charging me

525
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:22,640
$100 I have made

526
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:24,880
Surplus I am better off than if that

527
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,760
opportunity never existed if the ticket

528
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,799
was 100 and I was willing to pay 100

529
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,520
then I'm no better off off for the

530
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:32,960
killers coming to town I'm indifferent

531
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,520
but the ticket was 100 and I was willing

532
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,480
to pay 300 then I'm better off because I

533
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:41,080
got to see the killers at $200 less than

534
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:44,559
I wanted to pay so basically consumer

535
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:46,960
surplus is measured by my willingness to

536
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:48,880
pay well economically how do we measure

537
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,120
willingness to pay what how do we

538
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,640
represent that someone raise their hand

539
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:55,000
and tell me how do you represent

540
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:57,760
willingness to pay in our model so far

541
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,320
yeah the demand curve we already have a

542
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:03,279
measure of willingness to

543
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:04,760
pay so the consumer surplus is simply

544
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:08,559
the demand

545
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:12,600
curve above and beyond the price that's

546
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:17,640
paid so look for example at figure

547
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:22,039
96 okay suppose that my

548
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:25,200
demand for concerts is given by the Blue

549
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:27,520
Line okay I am willing to pay you know

550
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,000
about 500 bucks for the first concert

551
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:32,320
and so on all the way down I'm willing

552
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:35,640
to pay $100 for the fifth killer concert

553
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:38,880
that's probably about right for me okay

554
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:41,480
so basically what does that mean that

555
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:46,080
means that the consumer

556
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:48,159
surplus is the the area above the price

557
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:51,200
line below the man curve so for example

558
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:53,240
for that first killer concert I get a

559
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:58,159
surplus of the

560
00:23:53,240 --> 00:24:01,559
triangle that is a a a base of one and

561
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:03,840
it it it it goes draw a line from 500

562
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:06,919
over to the Blue Line the triangle above

563
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:08,360
that is the Surplus I get from that

564
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:10,279
first Killer's concert that little

565
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:12,200
triangle or in other words I'm willing

566
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:14,039
to pay for that first Killer's concert

567
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,600
more than $500 it's hard because it's

568
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:17,919
discreet let's say

569
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,679
$500 well that ticket if the ticket's

570
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:21,400
only

571
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:23,360
$100 then I make a huge

572
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:25,360
Surplus for the next concert I'm willing

573
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,640
to pay somewhat less but I still make a

574
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,120
surplus by the time we get to the fifth

575
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,000
concert

576
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,159
I'm

577
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,440
indifferent I'll probably still go

578
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:36,640
because I'm a Nut but I won't really

579
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,960
I'll be sort of indifferent about it I

580
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,760
won't get any

581
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:42,520
surplus so the Surplus is what I get

582
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:45,120
from all those earlier concerts I was

583
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:47,919
able to go to where the amount I valued

584
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,720
them was above the

585
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:52,799
price

586
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:54,440
okay so basically consumer surplus is

587
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:56,320
how much it's sort of a weird it's a

588
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:59,520
theoretical concept but an important one

589
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:01,679
think about any trade you've ever made

590
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:04,080
any good you've ever

591
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,600
bought you have some underlying

592
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,200
willingness to

593
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,520
pay if your value of that good was below

594
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,799
the woms pay you didn't buy it that's

595
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,399
easy but you probably didn't think about

596
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:14,640
gee you probably many times in your life

597
00:25:12,399 --> 00:25:18,320
said wow what a great deal I would have

598
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,919
paid a ton for that okay I saw an

599
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,200
awesome concert last night that cost me

600
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:24,120
50 bucks I would have happily paid twice

601
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:27,080
that for that concert I got a big

602
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:29,960
Surplus okay so basically we run this

603
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:32,159
all the time in our lives

604
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:34,360
now that questions about that about that

605
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:37,679
concept

606
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:41,039
yeah for you is it something that kind

607
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:44,760
of time that's a great question think of

608
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:46,840
it right now as your your well-being

609
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:49,000
that you get from that purchase it's a

610
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:51,000
measure of utility it's a measure of

611
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,480
your welfare so right now just think of

612
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,919
it as an abstract measure of welfare how

613
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,679
happy you are made that's why I

614
00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:58,039
shouldn't use the word happy before I

615
00:25:56,679 --> 00:25:58,760
should have said equilibrium this is

616
00:25:58,039 --> 00:25:59,960
happy

617
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,919
how happy you are made by getting to

618
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:04,399
make that purchase so it's the fifth

619
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:07,559
concert I am not made Happy by buying

620
00:26:04,399 --> 00:26:10,240
it okay but the other ones I am yeah

621
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:12,320
speak up so folks can hear so do ins

622
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:15,760
buyers great question we'll come back to

623
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:18,440
that so let's talk about let's turn from

624
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:20,399
Individual consumer surplus this is my

625
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:23,799
individual consumer surplus to Market

626
00:26:20,399 --> 00:26:23,799
consumer surplus in figure

627
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:33,080
97 okay now we're back to the market for

628
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:35,919
gas now we have a whole Market we have

629
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:39,919
the quantity of gas and the price of

630
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:42,240
gas now let's not think now about each

631
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:44,399
gallon of gas a person buys let's think

632
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,480
about people lining up on this line

633
00:26:44,399 --> 00:26:46,799
let's think about a simple case where

634
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,720
everyone wants one gallon just to make

635
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:51,159
life easy everyone wants one gallon of

636
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,880
gas then this line you could do gallons

637
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:55,960
equal

638
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:59,080
people okay you could do gallons equal

639
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:02,200
people and what this says is the first

640
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:04,520
person the highest demander is willing

641
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:07,159
to pay a ton for that gallon of

642
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:08,640
gas but as you go down the demand curve

643
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:09,880
you get to people who care about gas

644
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,760
less and

645
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:13,919
less ultimately there's a price of gas

646
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:16,279
of

647
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:19,320
$3 I'm gonna say that represents the

648
00:27:16,279 --> 00:27:22,919
1,000th consumer what I'm gonna say is

649
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:26,760
that person is indifferent between

650
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:28,000
buying gas for $3 a gallon and walking

651
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,760
or doing their bike or whatever else

652
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,880
they instead or just not going

653
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:36,320
out what that means is everyone to the

654
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,760
right of person a won't buy gas we knew

655
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,679
that already they're willing to to space

656
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:42,279
below the price whatever to left the

657
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:45,640
person a gains welfare they gain

658
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:47,519
well-being because they got a good

659
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:50,480
deal

660
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:52,000
okay and it's really this is our measure

661
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,120
of utility in the real world remember I

662
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,600
said you can't measure utility can't

663
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,360
measure utils well now we're measuring

664
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,640
it I have just given you a measurable

665
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,720
quantity we know how to draw a demand

666
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,080
curve

667
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,559
we know mathematically how to represent

668
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,960
a domain curve you can mathematically

669
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:04,200
compute the area of this triangle I've

670
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,480
mathematically come to this question

671
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:08,720
earlier I've mathematically represented

672
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,519
your welfare your well-being because we

673
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,279
can compute this triangle and now I can

674
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:14,279
make normative statements before I could

675
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:16,480
only make positive statements because

676
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:18,039
utils were meaningless now with this

677
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,120
idea of compensating variation consumer

678
00:28:18,039 --> 00:28:22,799
surplus I can make normative statements

679
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:27,320
I could talk about how well off you

680
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:29,640
are okay so let's talk about two

681
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:33,519
applications of this consumer surplus

682
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:36,200
idea first is what if the price Rises so

683
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:41,200
for example look at figure 98 imagine

684
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:44,120
the price of gas Rose from $3 to 350 a

685
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:46,279
gallon well now what happens two things

686
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:49,039
happen first of all fewer people want

687
00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:50,960
gas we knew that already we know that if

688
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:53,640
this price goes up demain curve slop

689
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:56,919
down so we want fewer people want gas so

690
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:59,679
now the marginal purchaser the person

691
00:28:56,919 --> 00:29:02,000
room Surplus is zero is the 900th person

692
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:05,399
and person 901 to 1,000 no longer buy

693
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,760
gas person Beyond a th000 didn't buy gas

694
00:29:05,399 --> 00:29:11,080
anyway so what has happened to consumer

695
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:13,720
surplus two things have happened first

696
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:17,080
of all fewer

697
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:18,679
people are getting the Surplus it used

698
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:20,320
to be a thousand people got Surplus now

699
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:23,600
only 900 people

700
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:25,679
do second of all everyone the this those

701
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,039
900 people are getting less Surplus

702
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,320
because the price has

703
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:33,679
risen so the there's a loss in consumer

704
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:35,919
surplus of the entire gray triangle of

705
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:37,799
the entire gray um uh

706
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:40,399
polygon

707
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:43,919
okay the L the

708
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:45,880
rectangle is the rectangle is the amount

709
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,679
that the first 900 consumers lost they

710
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:51,000
still buy gas but they're less happy

711
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:53,760
about it they get less utility from it

712
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,039
not less utility less welfare from it

713
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,440
because the difference their willingness

714
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:59,640
to pay and price has shrunk the little

715
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,000
triangle represent the Lost consumer

716
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:03,799
surplus because some people aren't

717
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,880
getting consumer surplus anymore so a

718
00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:08,840
price change causes this last this lost

719
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:12,320
trapezoid of consumer

720
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:14,640
surplus through those two

721
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:18,720
mechanisms

722
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:21,320
okay now let's come to another question

723
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:24,919
and the answer is already given here

724
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:26,880
when is consumer surplus large or small

725
00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:30,960
well that's going to depend critically

726
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:32,960
on what the elasticity of demand is

727
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,880
going to determine whether the super

728
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:38,960
Surplus is large or

729
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:41,240
small okay so let's look for example at

730
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,240
figure

731
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:46,320
99 here we have two downward sloping

732
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:52,320
demand

733
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:54,600
curves but one the curve that um is

734
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:57,320
further to the right on the x-axis and

735
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:59,440
further down on the y- axis that curve

736
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,919
is steeper

737
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,000
it is more

738
00:31:00,919 --> 00:31:04,440
elastic so that curve the one that's

739
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,760
further to the right that has intercept

740
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:08,760
further right on the x-axis we should

741
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:10,240
label these curves for next time uh

742
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:13,200
Andrews one and two or something so I

743
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:16,000
can refer them more easily um the curve

744
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:18,600
that that curve is more

745
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,880
elastic so let's look consumer surplus

746
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,519
that's provided by each of these two

747
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:23,880
curves so if you look at the more

748
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:26,360
elastic curve the consumer surplus is

749
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:29,840
the area under the

750
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:33,159
curve okay the the area under the curve

751
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:36,399
above the price line that's the dark

752
00:31:33,159 --> 00:31:40,360
triangle now as demand gets less

753
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:42,039
elastic consumer surplus goes up so it's

754
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:45,120
actually the opposite of the intuition

755
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:49,639
that this person gave earlier the more

756
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:51,519
inelastic the more Surplus why or the

757
00:31:49,639 --> 00:31:54,320
more elastic the less Surplus indeed

758
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:55,519
with perfectly elastic demand there is

759
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,720
no

760
00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:00,360
Surplus why

761
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,919
with per think about the case for last

762
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:03,279
demand McDonald's versus Burger King

763
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,880
imagine you're totally indifferent it's

764
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:07,360
trivial to shop between

765
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:09,720
them why in that case is there no

766
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:12,720
Surplus

767
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,720
delivered

768
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:18,519
yeah yeah you're never going to pay more

769
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,399
in equilibrium because the equilibrium

770
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:21,639
price anybody who charges you one set

771
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:23,720
more just switch you're always your

772
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:26,120
price is fixed there's no

773
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:28,960
Surplus now consider

774
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:31,399
insulin with insulin

775
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:34,080
it's all Surplus because your demand is

776
00:32:31,399 --> 00:32:36,639
eventally infinite and the price is some

777
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:39,760
level so subject to your resources the

778
00:32:36,639 --> 00:32:42,120
demand for insulin is it's huge

779
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,679
Surplus because you've got this entire

780
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:45,039
infinite rectangle Rising above the

781
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:49,159
price

782
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:54,600
line so the size of consumer surplus

783
00:32:49,159 --> 00:32:54,600
will be determined by the elasticity of

784
00:32:55,039 --> 00:33:01,360
demand okay essentially consumer Surplus

785
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:06,120
will be inversely related to demand

786
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:06,120
elasticity okay question about

787
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:10,960
that okay people aren't the only thing

788
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,600
we care about in this economy we care

789
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:15,519
about firms

790
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:20,000
too okay so now we turn to the other

791
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:20,000
side which is producer

792
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:27,840
Surplus producer Surplus

793
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:35,840
okay basically producer Surplus is the

794
00:33:33,399 --> 00:33:38,200
flip of the analysis instead of saying

795
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,399
producer we consumers we say the Surplus

796
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:42,600
there is between their willingness to

797
00:33:39,399 --> 00:33:44,600
pay and the price for producers it's the

798
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,399
difference between their price and their

799
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:49,880
willingness to

800
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:54,360
supply if producers get a price above

801
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:56,960
their marginal cost they make a

802
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:58,240
surplus okay you could see that for

803
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:01,399
example in fig

804
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:05,000
fure uh

805
00:34:01,399 --> 00:34:06,200
910 okay in figure 910 this is an

806
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,560
individual

807
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:11,960
producer imagine that the price this is

808
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:14,200
indidual gas producer the price of gas

809
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:16,760
in the market is three and let's say

810
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:20,839
that producer at that price wants to

811
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:22,320
produce 100 gallons okay that is the the

812
00:34:20,839 --> 00:34:24,480
their point of supply curve with a price

813
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:27,800
of three their marginal supply is

814
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:31,480
100 well that means that for the first

815
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:35,720
first 99 units they made

816
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:38,720
Surplus why because for the first 99

817
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:41,079
units the price was above their willing

818
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:43,359
to supply which is what what does supply

819
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,359
curve

820
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:52,000
represent what is supply curve marginal

821
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:55,520
cost so for the first 99 units price was

822
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,359
above marginal cost so they made

823
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:01,520
Surplus now in a perfectly competive of

824
00:34:58,359 --> 00:35:03,920
equilibrium we know marginal cost equals

825
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,920
average

826
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:08,680
cost so what is that mean this shaded

827
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:11,440
triangle is can anyone tell what the

828
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:11,440
Shaded triangle also

829
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:18,720
represents it's say if the line is

830
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:22,320
average cost if it's a price line it's

831
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:26,040
price minus average cost what we call

832
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:27,760
that profit so in a long run perfectly

833
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,280
competitive equilibrium producers

834
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,800
Surplus is way easier to understand the

835
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,200
consumer surplus not some vague measure

836
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,640
of well-being it's dollars it's profit

837
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,640
literally in a perfectly competitive

838
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,280
long run equilibrium produce Surplus

839
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,680
equals profit now in the short run it's

840
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:43,359
a little complicated and it's not c as

841
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:45,520
complicated but roughly speaking okay

842
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:47,000
there's by and large no harm they can

843
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,640
produce Surplus being profit it's a lot

844
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
easier to understand and you can really

845
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,200
put your hands around it unlike consumer

846
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,319
surplus which is harder to sort of

847
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,960
conceive

848
00:35:53,319 --> 00:36:00,200
of okay so likewise if we go to the

849
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:02,440
market in figure n 911 you see there's a

850
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:05,200
market supply

851
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:08,960
curve and this goes back to what I

852
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:11,960
talked about last time about why in fact

853
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:13,839
with heterogeneous firms with firms of

854
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:16,319
different production functions there

855
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:19,240
might be an upward sloping supply curve

856
00:36:16,319 --> 00:36:21,800
even if there might be an upward sloping

857
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:24,400
supply curve even in perfect competition

858
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:27,079
in this case at a price of three there's

859
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,359
a bunch of firms producing The Firm that

860
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:30,560
produced

861
00:36:28,359 --> 00:36:33,599
there should be a Josh there should be a

862
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:35,319
big q1 on the x-axis The Firm that

863
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:37,839
produce big q1 which is where that dash

864
00:36:35,319 --> 00:36:40,560
line hits the x-axis the thir that

865
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:41,440
produces big q1 that marginal firm earns

866
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,920
zero

867
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,760
profit the price equals a margin cost

868
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,760
equals their minimum average

869
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:51,119
cost but all the other firms the left

870
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:53,319
earn profit they're the Pakistan cotton

871
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:55,480
producers all the other firms that left

872
00:36:53,319 --> 00:36:57,079
are earning profits because the price is

873
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,119
above their marginal cost which is their

874
00:36:57,079 --> 00:37:00,560
average cost

875
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:03,440
C so if you think about a

876
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:05,200
market there's profit being made by all

877
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,160
the particularly efficient producers as

878
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,520
long as

879
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:11,280
demand hits the supply curve at some

880
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:13,400
point above the first

881
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,839
producer this is profits being made this

882
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,119
is like the example I did with cotton

883
00:37:14,839 --> 00:37:18,079
but instead of a stepwise supply

884
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:20,240
function it's a constant Supply function

885
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:22,079
a linear Supply function and what you

886
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:24,800
see it's the same intuition that there's

887
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:26,680
a bunch of providers of gas on the on

888
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,440
the very left is the most efficient

889
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:30,800
provider of gas

890
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:33,560
their marginal cost is

891
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:36,160
Epsilon they can produce gas for Epsilon

892
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:39,000
yet they get $3 a gallon that's all

893
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:41,079
profit to them $3 minus

894
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:44,520
Epsilon As you move to the right

895
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:46,960
marginal cost Rises so profit Falls

896
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:48,720
until you reach point a for that

897
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:51,119
producer marginal cost equals average

898
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:53,359
cost equals three which equals price of

899
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:56,079
profits or zero so they're indifferent

900
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:57,800
and no one enters to the right of that

901
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:00,440
this is a linear representation the

902
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:04,160
stepwise example we did last

903
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:06,680
time so consumer surplus is your wellbe

904
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:08,960
produce Surplus is profits questions

905
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,960
about

906
00:38:09,319 --> 00:38:17,680
that okay now armed with that we can go

907
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:20,880
on and prove what Paul Samuelson

908
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:22,560
modestly labeled the first fundamental

909
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,599
theorem of welfare

910
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,280
economics Paul Sam said besid being a

911
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:28,440
great Economist was was not a humble man

912
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:31,599
I think his thesis was called something

913
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:33,160
like econom you know what remember

914
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:34,720
something like you know discovering

915
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:36,680
econom inventing econom you know

916
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:39,160
something like that like he he knew he

917
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:40,599
was properly proud of what he was doing

918
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:42,800
and he called this the first fundamental

919
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:45,640
theorem of wealth economics which is

920
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,640
that

921
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:52,200
competition

922
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,200
maximizes

923
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:58,200
welfare competition maximizes welfare

924
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,920
it's a bold statement

925
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:05,480
that says that the equilibrium we got to

926
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:07,760
last time in a positive sense we showed

927
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:10,359
the equilibrium last time is also in a

928
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,280
normative sense the best possible place

929
00:39:10,359 --> 00:39:16,119
we can

930
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:16,119
be to see that let's go to figure

931
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:22,200
912 this shows a demand and supply curve

932
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,720
in equilibrium in competitive

933
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:28,200
equilibrium at Point little

934
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:30,640
E1 where there's q1 units per year year

935
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:34,800
being produced at a price of

936
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:34,800
P1 okay that's the initial

937
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:39,680
equilibrium you can see and the consumer

938
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:41,680
surplus in this

939
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:43,160
example what well somebody tell me what

940
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,760
is consumer use the letters there what

941
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:47,319
is the consumer surplus at Point E1

942
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,599
someone raise their hand and tell me

943
00:39:47,319 --> 00:39:53,359
what letters represent consumer

944
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:54,800
surplus yeah R plus v exactly same

945
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:57,640
person what letters represent producer

946
00:39:54,800 --> 00:40:01,200
Surplus

947
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:03,040
exactly so producer Surplus is R plus v

948
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:07,119
so consumer

949
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:13,119
surplus equals R plus v producer Surplus

950
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:16,440
equals s+ t plus u okay you can

951
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:18,440
see that the sum of those

952
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:20,640
two is

953
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:23,920
maximized at Point

954
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:27,400
E1 and we're going to Define

955
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:29,040
welfare as just the sum of consumer

956
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:32,200
Surplus plus producer

957
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:33,440
Surplus Samus said look I I have no

958
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,760
strong feeling about whether she care

959
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,359
more about consumers or producers

960
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:38,680
producers higher workers we care about

961
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:40,119
them too let's just use a indifferent

962
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:42,760
let's just say social welfare is the sum

963
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:44,200
of the two let's just say that the total

964
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:46,040
welfare societ is just a surplus

965
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:48,160
produced on both sides of a

966
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:50,680
transaction a transaction produces

967
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:54,200
consumer surplus it produces producer

968
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:57,040
Surplus We'll add them up and call that

969
00:40:54,200 --> 00:41:00,440
welfare well you could see that concept

970
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:05,079
we maximized at Point

971
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:08,480
E1 so let's do a simple example imagine

972
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:10,640
that you are someone who says that's

973
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:13,040
ridiculous welfare is always better if

974
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:15,760
prices are lower these consumers get a

975
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:18,760
better deal so I'm going to set a price

976
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:20,119
cap I'm G to say producers cannot charge

977
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:24,520
more than

978
00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:27,560
P2 a price ceiling of

979
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:28,760
P2 well what happens

980
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,760
at

981
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:32,800
P2

982
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:35,000
producers say well look if you're G to

983
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,119
make if you can only give me P2 I'm only

984
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,720
can produce

985
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:42,640
Q2 I have to be on my supply

986
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:45,119
curve I'm willing to supply P2 is Q2 so

987
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:49,760
I'm will to produce

988
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:51,599
Q2 okay so the market has Q2 at Price P2

989
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:55,040
well what happens in that

990
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:59,880
situation well what happens to consumer

991
00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:02,240
surplus it falls it falls by the amount

992
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:05,319
V it falls because there are

993
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:08,280
transactions that make consumers happy

994
00:42:05,319 --> 00:42:09,400
that are not happening it's critical

995
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:11,440
this is the key thing with welfare

996
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:13,520
economics for consumers or for both

997
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:17,720
sides a transaction that produces

998
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:19,920
Surplus that goes away is welfare

999
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:23,440
reducing here's a transaction that

1000
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:25,400
produces Surplus consumers got benefits

1001
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:29,240
from going Q2 to q1 they no longer get

1002
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:31,599
them so consumer Surplus is down by the

1003
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,599
area

1004
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:37,280
V producer

1005
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:39,280
Surplus is down by two things first of

1006
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,640
all producers no longer have

1007
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:45,040
transactions that made them happy they

1008
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:48,160
wanted to sell between Q2 to q1 units

1009
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:50,280
and that gave them a surplus of U that's

1010
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:54,720
gone but that's not

1011
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:58,599
all what also is gone is that now they

1012
00:42:54,720 --> 00:43:01,559
lost the area s

1013
00:42:58,599 --> 00:43:03,640
but is that gone is s gone what happens

1014
00:43:01,559 --> 00:43:06,599
to S

1015
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:09,680
yeah it becomes consumer

1016
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:12,040
surplus s goes away and gets added to

1017
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,040
consumer

1018
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:20,440
surplus so what has happened here is two

1019
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:22,040
things first of all by doing this

1020
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:25,960
intervention by setting this price

1021
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:28,319
ceiling we've taken the area s and given

1022
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:30,160
it from producers to to Consumers see

1023
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:33,680
that look at the new consumer surplus

1024
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:35,280
the new consumer surplus is S Plus R so

1025
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:39,440
we've given s to

1026
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:39,440
Consumers that is what we call a

1027
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:47,200
transfer we have

1028
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:50,319
transferred Surplus from one party to

1029
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:51,960
another in this case we've transferred

1030
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:55,880
Surplus which we can measure as dollars

1031
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:58,240
we transfer that amount of dollars s and

1032
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:00,920
take it away from producers give to

1033
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:02,920
Consumers now how do we feel about that

1034
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:04,119
well we're indifferent about that right

1035
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:06,400
because all we care is consumer plus

1036
00:44:04,119 --> 00:44:09,160
produc Surplus we don't care about

1037
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:11,359
transfers so the movement of s from one

1038
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:13,720
to the other is irrelevant for total

1039
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:17,079
welfare because welfare is the

1040
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:19,119
sum so transfers are relevant for

1041
00:44:17,079 --> 00:44:20,960
welfare if you take something from one

1042
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:24,400
party give it to

1043
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:28,800
another that doesn't matter what matters

1044
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:31,520
is that along the way the and you have

1045
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:36,720
disappeared literally they're

1046
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:41,400
gone we call that dead weight

1047
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:44,680
loss dead weight loss dead weight loss

1048
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:47,800
is the net reduction in welfare from

1049
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:47,800
trades that are not

1050
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:53,000
made when there are trades that would

1051
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:55,720
make both parties better off and they

1052
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:58,119
don't get made that is bad that is a

1053
00:44:55,720 --> 00:45:01,480
loss in welfare we are worse off as a

1054
00:44:58,119 --> 00:45:03,960
society in this perfectly competitive

1055
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:05,640
market if there are trades that would

1056
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:06,839
make both sides better off and they

1057
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:09,520
don't get

1058
00:45:06,839 --> 00:45:12,680
made we are worse

1059
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:15,839
off that is why the competitive

1060
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:17,880
equilibrium maximizes welfare because

1061
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:19,440
every trade people want to make and the

1062
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:23,640
firms are willing to do with them gets

1063
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:25,760
made anything anything else takes away

1064
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:27,960
trades that make both parties better off

1065
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:30,200
and by definition that lowers

1066
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:31,880
welfare a trade that makes both parties

1067
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:33,240
better off or at least makes one party

1068
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:35,079
better off and the other party no worse

1069
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:38,000
off

1070
00:45:35,079 --> 00:45:40,839
technically should

1071
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,839
happen that raises

1072
00:45:40,839 --> 00:45:46,599
welfare

1073
00:45:42,839 --> 00:45:48,760
now this is of course a conclusion under

1074
00:45:46,599 --> 00:45:50,400
a very particular set of assumptions we

1075
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:52,640
can go back to the very first

1076
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:55,119
lecture under these assumptions we

1077
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:57,839
should let people sell their kidneys on

1078
00:45:55,119 --> 00:46:00,960
eBay okay the more person who sells

1079
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:02,680
their kidney is better off the rich

1080
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,119
person who buys it and stays alive is

1081
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:05,839
better off that's a transaction made

1082
00:46:04,119 --> 00:46:08,160
both parties better off we should let it

1083
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:09,760
happen we discussed in the first lecture

1084
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:11,640
why I might not like that for reasons of

1085
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:14,280
equity or because the market might not

1086
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:16,760
work well well those are all reasons why

1087
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:19,720
the model we've discussed so far breaks

1088
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:21,520
down we're not getting there yet well

1089
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:22,640
we're remember economics I said the

1090
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,280
beginning is fundamentally sort of a

1091
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,920
right-wing science maybe I didn't say it

1092
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,960
maybe I'll say it now for the first time

1093
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:29,559
so fundamentally a right-wing science

1094
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:32,280
science economics starts with the market

1095
00:46:29,559 --> 00:46:34,040
knows best it starts with the First

1096
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:37,839
Fundamental welfare

1097
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:41,319
theorem which is that under this under

1098
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:43,640
the set of assumptions of perfect

1099
00:46:41,319 --> 00:46:45,680
competition the best thing to do is just

1100
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:48,160
let the market

1101
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:49,800
rip we will come back in a couple

1102
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:52,200
lectures start talking about why those

1103
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:54,319
assumptions might not be true but let's

1104
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:55,760
not jump ahead let's this is our

1105
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:57,480
starting this is our jumping off point

1106
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:59,359
for all of economics

1107
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:03,160
this fundamental theorem is that the

1108
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:04,880
market knows best that welfare is

1109
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:06,240
maximized by just letting the perfectly

1110
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:09,480
competitive market

1111
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:12,680
rip okay that's the key conclusion here

1112
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:16,319
we'll stop now no class on Monday uh and

1113
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:16,319
I'll see yall on Wednesday
