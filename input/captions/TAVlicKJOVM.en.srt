00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,160
Hello everyone. My name is Andra Mendes.

2
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,679
I'm founder CEO of KAI. Uh before I was

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,320
a co-founder in another company called

4
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,920
Pistol Data and I have a PhD in computer

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,880
science from NOU and I have been doing

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,279
research in machine learning here at

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,560
MIT.

8
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:24,880
Um okay. So the problem that we're going

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,439
to talk about today is the problem of

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,119
e-commerce in the e-commerce data in the

11
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,359
marketplace. So every time that you have

12
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,120
a marketplace you have a lots of data

13
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,360
and this data come from many different

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,520
sources and most of the time the sources

15
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,200
are not structurized. So as you have

16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,399
medium of products coming from different

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,800
sources um this data has to be organized

18
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,559
for you to order to offer basic service

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,640
right so if you want your customer to be

20
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,039
able to find your product you have to

21
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,960
offer discovery search analytics

22
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:56,239
comparisons and everything else and that

23
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,920
has a direct impact on your conversion

24
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,760
rates your return rates and most

25
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,600
important how much your customer trust

26
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,600
your

27
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,040
platform. So basically there are some

28
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,200
problems that comes when you have like

29
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,560
the bad data. So you have duplicated

30
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,840
products, you have irre irrelevant

31
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,159
recommendations and you have a very bad

32
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,000
like search experience. So basically

33
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,000
your product your customer cannot find

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,520
your product or when it finds a product

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,159
is the wrong product and the experience

36
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,000
is bad. All of this seems kind of simple

37
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,439
and and silly but when we look at the

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,920
numbers that's a huge problem to

39
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,080
e-commerce space. More than 90 billion

40
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,000
dollars are lost due poor poor

41
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,000
experience. And a lot of this happens

42
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,640
because people just abandoned their

43
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,920
carts because they have a poor

44
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,520
experience in buying something that they

45
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,520
thought was a product but was something

46
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,600
else. And of course the biggest problem

47
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,439
in e-commerce which is return right like

48
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,520
every time that you buy something that

49
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,600
you did not like and return that's a

50
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,920
huge problem for any people selling into

51
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:55,360
the e-commerce space. So that's where it

52
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,600
enters KOI. So a lot of our customers

53
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,600
they either don't solve that problem or

54
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,920
they are trying to solve that using some

55
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:05,040
manual operations like it's not it's not

56
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,040
necessarily hard to fix a problem in one

57
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,879
or two or even 100 products but it's

58
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,520
very hard to fix on a thousand products

59
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,520
and 10,000 products. So basically our

60
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,680
goal is to offer a solution as a data as

61
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,280
a service where our customers don't have

62
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,520
to build the entire team to do that.

63
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,560
they can just rely on koa to have their

64
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,239
data organized, structurized in one

65
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,000
place and we want to do this as simple

66
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,720
as possible. So basically the way that

67
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,200
works we have a simple API call uh our

68
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,800
customers send this data in a very raw

69
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,319
way. So basically a lot of times it's

70
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,680
just a product description and some

71
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,680
image and we use our internal AI models

72
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,040
to basically process all types of data.

73
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,959
We work with image, we work with

74
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,519
description, we work with other codes

75
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:48,080
that are similar to the industry. And

76
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,080
the output is just this structure

77
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,599
organized data that is in the best

78
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,280
format for our customers to do

79
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,720
everything else. So the goal is that

80
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,879
they don't have to worry about the data

81
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,239
anymore or the underlying data and they

82
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,680
can focus more on the customer

83
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,120
experience on their

84
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,640
website. Here's an example of the

85
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,800
customers that we had in Brazil. It's

86
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,360
one of the biggest um auto parts

87
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,599
marketplace in Brazil. And once they

88
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,519
started work with us, they had like 30%

89
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:17,120
improve in conversion rates. They had

90
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:19,760
15% reduce in the in returning rates and

91
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,280
30% improve and clients finding the

92
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:25,319
right product. And that was like a very

93
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:27,920
important thing for uh the auto parts uh

94
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:29,760
market. Uh so that's what we're trying

95
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,120
to do like our vision is to actually

96
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,200
provide various experience in the

97
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,760
marketplace but we also helping brands

98
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,680
and sellers that they they need to sell

99
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,920
in many other places. So we helping them

100
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,879
also to better configure that data so

101
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,879
they're able to expand their their

102
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:46,640
offer. Um we have been operating for

103
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,560
more than three years. We have customers

104
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,440
in three different countries. We operate

105
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,440
in English, Portuguese, Spanish. Um and

106
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,920
we're looking for partners and clients,

107
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:59,239
marketplaces, procurement platforms, and

108
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:03,480
also brands and sellers that sell into

109
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:03,480
marketplaces. Thank you.

110
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,120
I'm I'm a plant really. Although some

111
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,200
may call me a weed, but never mind. So,

112
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,159
how do you validate the the accuracy of

113
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,360
what the customer is looking for versus

114
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,519
there may be two or three different

115
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,199
products out there, right? What kind of

116
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,639
a guessing game do you have to know that

117
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,880
this is really what I'm thinking about

118
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,720
as opposed to those two other ones?

119
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,360
Yeah. So, basically our main goal is

120
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,960
like we work with product data and in

121
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,680
this part like the accuracy has to be

122
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,520
very high. So a lot of the industries

123
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,280
that we work already have our own ground

124
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,440
truth. So basically we have collected

125
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,240
the this the main data from many

126
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,160
different u sources and every time that

127
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,840
the customer has like whatever product

128
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,479
that they need we do a comparison with

129
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,320
that. So that's a very simple thing. So

130
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,840
but in order to do that comparison you

131
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,840
have to be able to extract what are the

132
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,440
right features of this product that I

133
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,960
can tell if the two products are the

134
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,040
same or not. So that's where we

135
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,960
specialize because if I have the ground

136
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,639
truth and I know how to compare to any

137
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,560
other chiffon product that's coming to

138
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,080
me, I can say, "Oh, these two products

139
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,320
are actually the same or this product

140
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,800
actually are different products." Okay,

141
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,199
thanks.

142
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:14,479
Thank you. And how is it different um to

143
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:16,240
use um KOA versus some of the tools out

144
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,919
there or even building their own

145
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,639
internal?

146
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,000
That's like honestly our that's the

147
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,600
question that we get the most like why

148
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,520
people why companies don't just build

149
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,199
this internally. First of all it's a lot

150
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,039
more expensive. It's another team that

151
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,800
you have to manage. But the biggest

152
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,240
thing is like especially now with AI is

153
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,039
that everybody's like oh why don't I

154
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,880
just use LLM for to do that. This

155
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,039
industry requires like a very high

156
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,039
accuracy right so LLMs are very good for

157
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:44,560
many things but usually you cannot get

158
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:46,479
95 96% of accuracy. A lot of times you

159
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,280
just spend like actually validating what

160
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,880
you get. So the best thing that we offer

161
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,720
a lot of our customers come and say hey

162
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,639
I've tried this for three months and it

163
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,160
doesn't work I cannot implement the

164
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,560
system how can I solve this because

165
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,840
that's not my core my car should provide

166
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,000
the other experience I have to do with

167
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,960
logistics I have to do return how can I

168
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,960
actually get this data clean so a lot of

169
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,800
times it's just that like that it's just

170
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,600
a lot more time consuming resource

171
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,800
consuming for our customers to do inside

172
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,800
thank you thank
