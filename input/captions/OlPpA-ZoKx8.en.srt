[Music]

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:08,320
so hi everyone welcome back to the last

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,320
introductory lecture and uh this lecture

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,120
is going to put together the concepts we

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,599
learned in the first two lectures on

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,240
biology and technology and uh we'll

7
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:17,720
learn about the experiments that were

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,600
perform to generate the data for the

9
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,720
data science Challenge and how we're

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,640
going to work with that data during the

11
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:27,920
challenge so uh the data itself comes

12
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:30,240
from an experiment of perturb seek done

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,759
in t- cells and so let's start talking

14
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,399
about uh the experimental overview and

15
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,520
then after we understand the experiment

16
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:40,280
we'll go into what the data looks like

17
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,760
so the experimental overview so first I

18
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,559
just want to start with a recap from

19
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,360
what we learned in the first uh two

20
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:48,120
introductory lectures so the first

21
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,960
lecture we learned that um te- cells

22
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,280
become exhausted in the cancer

23
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,280
environment and they transition from

24
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,840
progenitor t- cell states to affector t-

25
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,760
cell States and finally terminally

26
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,239
exhausted t- cell States these

27
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:03,000
transitions are driven by the gene expr

28
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,080
programs in the t- cells and the t- cell

29
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,759
states are marked by different abilities

30
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:09,520
to kill tumor cells with theor T cells

31
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:11,439
and the progenitor t- cells being much

32
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,400
better at killing tumor cells or cancer

33
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,560
cells than the terminally exhausted te

34
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,280
cells so that's a recap of what we've

35
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,400
already learned in the first lecture and

36
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,360
in the second lecture we introduced a

37
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,280
perturb seek which allows us to do a

38
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,119
simultaneous readout of the gene

39
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,360
expression in a single cell as well as

40
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,439
the perturbation that cell Reed and how

41
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,240
that worked is we used the crisper cast

42
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:34,320
9 gen editing technology to knock out

43
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,680
individual genes in the te- cells in

44
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,560
parallel and then we introduced those

45
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:42,280
te- cells into cancer let the te- cells

46
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:45,079
fight the cancer for some time isolated

47
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:47,240
the t- cells and then Ed sequencing to

48
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:49,840
read out both the perturbation that that

49
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:52,200
cell received as well as the resulting

50
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,240
gene expression in that single cell and

51
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,320
so this lets us read out perturbations

52
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,560
in parallel as well as the gene

53
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,799
expression uh measurements or expression

54
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,880
values for single cell

55
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,600
okay so with those two Recaps the t-

56
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,520
cell exhaustion and how perturb seek

57
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,520
works we can now talk about the

58
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,800
experiment that was performed um by uh

59
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,920
Mark Schwarz who is a physician

60
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,680
scientist an oncologist at the Bro

61
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:20,160
Institute and Dana Farber Cancer

62
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,760
Institute and so what uh what experiment

63
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,720
was performed was Mark took U mice who

64
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:28,400
had melanoma and he gave them uh te-

65
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:30,400
cells and these te- cells will migrate

66
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,040
into the tumor into the melanoma and

67
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,640
they will fight the cancer and 2 weeks

68
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,879
later Mark took out the tumor and

69
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,720
isolated the t- cells and performed

70
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:44,319
single cell RNA sequencing which we saw

71
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:46,560
in the uh second lecture and what he saw

72
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,800
when analyzing those t- cell States uh

73
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,680
that came out of the Single Cell RNA

74
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,360
sequencing analysis was that a high

75
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,879
proportion of te- cells were in the

76
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,800
terminally exhausted t- cell State and

77
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:59,040
that's uh not surprising because uh we

78
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,720
know that in the tumor environment te-

79
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,239
cells get driven towards terminal

80
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,879
exhaustion now then Mark wanted to know

81
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,879
you know if we take these mice with

82
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:10,519
melanoma what happens if instead we give

83
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:13,200
them te- cells that have been

84
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:15,200
genetically edited and now individual

85
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,400
genes are knocked out in these te- cells

86
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,360
and we can ask do these Gene edits when

87
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,720
we knock out a gene does this affect the

88
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,239
ability of the te- cell to respond and

89
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:26,879
kill the cancer cells to kill the

90
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:29,000
melanoma so Mark prepared uh t- cells

91
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:31,280
with different genetic perturbations he

92
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,760
gave those to the with melanoma those T

93
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,680
cells proceeded to fight the melanoma

94
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,360
and they went through their

95
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,879
differentiation Pathways and then after

96
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,280
2 weeks Mark isolated the te- cells from

97
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:43,519
the tumor and performed perturb seek and

98
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,879
the outcome of the perturb seek

99
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,599
experiment is we have single cells and

100
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:49,720
for every single cell we know what

101
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,799
genetic perturbation that cell receive

102
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:55,040
as well as the resulting gene expression

103
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:57,159
in that same single cell and so when we

104
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,920
analyze the gene expression for those

105
00:03:57,159 --> 00:04:01,360
single cells we might find that

106
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:03,159
perturbation a a was associated with t-

107
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,480
cell killing so the effector T Cell

108
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:07,360
State and perturbation B might have been

109
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:10,280
associated with the exhausted t- cell

110
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,159
state so that's the experiment uh that

111
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,480
was uh done and this is what you're

112
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,599
going to be working with in the data

113
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,840
science challenge so let's just go

114
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,079
through a little bit of question and

115
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:21,239
answer with some more details of this

116
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:23,520
experiment so first question you might

117
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:26,199
have is how many genes were knocked out

118
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,759
so remember um there are 20,000 protein

119
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:31,080
cating genes in the human and mouse

120
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:33,039
genomes so uh how many genes were

121
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:36,160
actually knocked out well Mark knocked

122
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:38,759
out 73 of those genes and this is um you

123
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,520
know not 20,000 because as we said in

124
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:42,320
the previous lecture the amount of work

125
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,280
to do that it would take about 50 years

126
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,520
so we did a more manageable number of

127
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,759
genes and then most genes are going to

128
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:51,080
be in the training set and seven have

129
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:52,080
been left out for validation and testing

130
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,520
and this is what you're going to be

131
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,039
working with in the first uh challenge

132
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,759
those seven genes and predicting their

133
00:04:56,039 --> 00:05:00,680
effects on the t- cell States next

134
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:04,160
question is well why did Mark choose

135
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:06,680
those specific genes so um we don't know

136
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,600
what most genes do or what most genes uh

137
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,880
how most genes affect t- cell

138
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,639
differentiation so Mark used prior

139
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,280
knowledge to kind of narrow the search

140
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,880
space so one thing he did was a

141
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,280
scientific kind of literature review of

142
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:20,680
genes with uh potential roles in

143
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:24,479
controlling differentiation Mark also

144
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:27,960
looked at human uh patient data uh from

145
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:30,000
uh melanoma trials and he looked at gen

146
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,479
from t- cells and melanoma in particular

147
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,759
T cells that were expressing tcf7 which

148
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,919
is a critical Gene and T cell

149
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,440
differentiation and he looked at what

150
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:41,840
genes Mar those T cells so that's like

151
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:43,800
where he chose the genes from and then

152
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,240
we can ask how many single cells were

153
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,600
sequenc so we did this perturbs

154
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:50,080
experiment and we isolated t- cells how

155
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:53,199
many cells did Mark isolate so Mark

156
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,960
isolated um 70,000 cells and because

157
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,600
there's 70 genes that means there's

158
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,240
about 1,000 single cells for each

159
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,240
genetic perturbation on average

160
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,080
and then finally um are there negative

161
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,120
controls in this experiment um are there

162
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:09,000
perturbations that are not expected to

163
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,800
have an effect and actually yes there

164
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
are the experiment was carefully

165
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,319
designed to have negative controls so

166
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,599
there are 30 what are called

167
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:19,479
non-targeting controls which are

168
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:21,759
perturbations are that are not actually

169
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:24,479
going to make any Cuts in the genome and

170
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,319
affect any Gene in the cell and these

171
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,800
just have no effect on the on the gene

172
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,759
expression no effect on the t- cell

173
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,360
States and so this can give us a

174
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,440
background sense of what unperturbed te

175
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:37,240
cells would look like in the context of

176
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:39,000
this melanoma model so the data that

177
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:42,080
comes out of the perturbs experiment

178
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,280
consists of two pieces the first uh is

179
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,560
the gene expression Matrix and the

180
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:48,440
second um is this assignment of the

181
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,120
perturbations that each cell receed so

182
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,160
remember the gene expression Matrix will

183
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:54,560
tell us the expression level of every

184
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,560
single Gene in every single cell now

185
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,440
this perturbation table tells us what

186
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,240
perturbation what genetic perturbation a

187
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:03,639
cell received so cell one received a tox

188
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:06,080
perturbation so the tox Gene got deleted

189
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:09,120
and then we can link that perturbation

190
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,919
to the resulting effect on the uh the

191
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,960
gene expression within that cell so cell

192
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:14,879
one had a tox deletion and has this set

193
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,479
of gene expression values so that's this

194
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:17,720
really nice linkage we can do in a

195
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,080
perturbs experiment between the

196
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:22,100
perturbation and the result on the gene

197
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:27,800
expression in the same cell

198
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:27,800
