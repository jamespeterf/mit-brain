uh MIT n is extremely proud of Hosting

60
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,840
many different kinds of communities

61
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:54,599
there are about 40 different departments

62
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,640
labs and centers that utilize the tools

63
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:58,480
of MIT Nano to advance their next

64
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,159
Frontiers so what you're going to see

65
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,319
today is only a glimpse into a set of

66
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:07,480
opportunities that the world is about to

67
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:09,840
see we had to focus and so we focused on

68
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:12,799
five separate topics to show you off

69
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,000
today the first one is indeed looking at

70
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:17,200
the options of sustainable materials

71
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,840
solutions for Next Generation

72
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,680
Technologies sustainability climate

73
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:25,760
issues have been one of the top topics

74
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:28,000
for the world and indeed MIT through the

75
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,159
leadership of Sally cornbluth has

76
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,040
embraced it as one of the top topics MIT

77
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,040
needs to spend its time on we want to

78
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:37,439
tell you some of the perspectives from

79
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:39,720
the nanoscale as led by Des Plata um

80
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:41,560
that will go ahead and expose you to

81
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,280
various ways of thinking about what

82
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:47,200
climate needs next what can we do as

83
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,760
Technologies indeed to strongly affected

84
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,959
that will lead us to a short break

85
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:54,200
followed by a discussion of how do the

86
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:57,040
Technologies of MIT really reach the

87
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:59,120
world as an institution our business is

88
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,280
very simple uh we need to make impact on

89
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,799
the world through the demonstration of

90
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,360
new technologies new ideas and indeed

91
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:09,040
training of the people that can affect

92
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:11,799
the grand needs of the world but that

93
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,159
transition of the grand idea that is

94
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:16,359
imagined at the laboratory to something

95
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:19,040
that everyone can use a million people

96
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:21,239
can use in their hands is a journey and

97
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,919
that Journey needs to be understood just

98
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:25,280
as much as we need to understand physics

99
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:26,680
and chemistry and biology we need to

100
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,479
understand entrepreneurship and the

101
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,520
scaling up of an idea from the instance

102
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:34,000
in in the lab 2 million people

103
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,479
benefiting from it second session will

104
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,919
focus on that and the manager of star.

105
