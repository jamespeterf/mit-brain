1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:05,520
All right, let's jump right in. So

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,279
basically I'm going to be talking about

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,760
the motivation for developing this

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:13,280
blended genome exo protocol or what I'll

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:16,400
call BGE from now on and talk through a

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:19,840
couple manuscripts that delve into the

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:23,279
technical development of BGE and then

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:25,680
how we scaled and evaluated it in uh our

9
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,680
first large multi- ancestry cohort and

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,000
then finally talked a little bit about

11
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:33,040
some of the uh projects and resources

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,880
that we've been looking at below. is a

13
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,880
nice schematic picture that broad

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,200
clinical labs made that hopefully gives

15
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,360
you a little bit of a sense of what's

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,280
what's going on in terms of the exo

17
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,079
portion the low pass genome and then

18
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:49,039
blending them together to give you uh

19
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,920
this current product.

20
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:54,640
So prior to the development of this the

21
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,600
main thing that people would purchase

22
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:00,719
would be kind of a deep whole exo and

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,520
then a separate genotyping array. Mostly

24
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,400
this was on the global screening array

25
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,799
and you know that generally assayed the

26
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,960
things that we were most interested in

27
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,119
which was rare coding variation where we

28
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,799
think you can find the most disease

29
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:19,040
relevant rare variance um given the

30
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,119
sample sizes and then you've got

31
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,759
genotype array you add amputation on

32
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,360
this you get a a nice uh pretty

33
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:30,240
comprehensive overview of the common

34
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:32,079
variant landscape of things. Um but they

35
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,400
thought we could do better other people

36
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:36,320
were trying to do better and you know

37
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,880
one of the issues that we saw

38
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,720
particularly looking at the GSA and you

39
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,759
know we looked at a you know a couple of

40
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,159
chips this was done uh Alicia Martin's

41
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,399
group which really investigate a lot of

42
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,079
diversity and genomics I kind of wanted

43
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,600
to highlight this and this is you know

44
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,920
it's called the global screening array

45
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,479
but if you look at the African

46
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,719
population you can see compared to say

47
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:01,680
things like the multithnic array are

48
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,520
these more expensive chips that assay

49
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,000
you know on the order of millions of

50
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:09,039
variants raw genotypes versus you know

51
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,200
probably 5 600,000 variants you know you

52
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,879
see this curve is not quite the same

53
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,040
there's a lot of stuff at very low

54
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:17,280
frequencies where in Africa which is an

55
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,959
older population you should see the type

56
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,360
of distribution here with a lot more

57
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,720
convariance so you know this kind of

58
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,040
gives a little bit of pause is the

59
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,319
global screening array really assaying

60
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,560
uh things that we would like

61
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,879
particularly as we scale up to a lot of

62
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,400
these diverse cohorts that we were uh

63
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,239
you know we're going to be looking at.

64
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,920
And so this kind of presented this

65
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,760
challenge or at least this need for

66
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,519
something that could could overcome the

67
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,920
limitations of the current arrays that

68
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,080
that people were buying.

69
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,319
And so that you know the alternative

70
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,519
alternatives to this sort of approach is

71
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,800
to actually just add snips directly into

72
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,319
your exo array. So you could think, you

73
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,800
know, you have your exom capture, it

74
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,800
captures exxons. Why not just, you know,

75
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,319
create more probes, capture these

76
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,680
variants. You might get stuck in the

77
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,480
same problem if you don't pick your

78
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,800
probes right and your snips, right? Um,

79
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,200
but you could say, you know, there might

80
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,879
be a cheaper alternative to these two

81
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,720
products and just say, okay, you can

82
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:14,800
pull out more non-coding snips uh by

83
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,599
just, you know, adding more probes to

84
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,440
your exhome. The other approach is is

85
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,159
what I'll be talking about genering low

86
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,840
pass and then obviously the end the

87
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,680
beall end all is kind of deep whole

88
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,920
genome sequences where you get it all

89
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,239
but still the price point here is still

90
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,239
quite a bit higher than either of these

91
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,239
alternatives

92
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:40,560
and there is option one I will say here

93
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,640
Regeneron uh working with twist which is

94
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,959
kind of the main manu main manufacturer

95
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,640
of a lot of the exom caps we use does

96
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,760
have a diversity University snip panel.

97
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:53,120
This came out around 2021. So this was

98
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,640
in the ether around the COVID era that

99
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,640
you know people were moving on from

100
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,959
arrays and and trying to leverage

101
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,680
sequencing technologies to capture all

102
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:05,280
this stuff. This is out there. I don't

103
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,840
know too much about it. uh but uh that

104
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,080
this approach is being used to just

105
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:14,239
capture common variants with additional

106
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:16,479
amounts of probes in the exo

107
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,639
not in the exo but using kind of exom

108
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:20,880
capture technology

109
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:24,479
and then

110
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:27,120
we have the blended genome exo I have a

111
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,960
link here I'll click on it I will leave

112
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,880
but you will see what's out here broad

113
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:35,680
clinical labs not too long ago made a a

114
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,840
nice splash page here uh kind of giving

115
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,680
you the overview of this stuff. The

116
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,759
clinical blended genome exo, it starts

117
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,600
at 150. There you go. There's your price

118
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,880
point there. I will say the difference

119
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,320
between what I'm going to be talking

120
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,199
about, which is more for research

121
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,280
purposes, uh is that we don't have as

122
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,199
deep of a genome, so this has evolved

123
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,720
over time, but now you can get one that

124
00:04:53,199 --> 00:05:02,160
has just as deep of a or deep of an exo,

125
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:04,720
sorry, uh as as previous stuff. Um, and

126
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:08,080
we pay on the order of I think $100 per

127
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:10,560
sample uh for for this, but as you can

128
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,680
see, they've they've created more

129
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,759
options. Um, you can see different

130
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,080
applications, blah blah blah, and and

131
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,600
get some some stuff here. If you're

132
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,479
interested, you can go on bro Clinical

133
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,479
Labs and and and see what what is here.

134
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,080
And uh I'll talk a little bit more about

135
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,479
what's provided, but I just kind of

136
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,320
wanted to show people that uh you know

137
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:34,720
you can learn more about this directly

138
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:38,039
from Bro Clinical Labs. So if I just go

139
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,039
back here,

140
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,120
so the first thing I'll be talking about

141
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,880
is the technical development of this. As

142
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,120
I was saying, this was right this

143
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:50,080
started probably right around the time

144
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,479
that everyone went on lockdown. Um so it

145
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:57,919
was a lot of zoom meetings and back and

146
00:05:52,479 --> 00:06:00,400
forth um uh to do this and

147
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:04,639
you know on the other side of things

148
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:06,240
which uh I didn't have any real in-depth

149
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,639
knowledge of on the wet lab side of

150
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,560
things uh you know we would kind of be

151
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,240
going back and forth I would be doing

152
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,080
some of the concordance analysis that

153
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:18,000
I'll show but um but basically the

154
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,400
schematic here of this blended genome is

155
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,319
to create two libraries. One is the low

156
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,840
pass whole genomes PCR free looking at a

157
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,600
few different things and I'll I'll talk

158
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,199
a little bit more about some of the

159
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,800
details but then you've got a separate

160
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,880
exo capture library and this is all

161
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,120
before sequencing. So you're bl you know

162
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,600
you're pulling this DNA out you're

163
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,319
creating two separate libraries running

164
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:43,840
the exo capture on on on the PCR plus

165
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:46,240
library coming back in and then blending

166
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:49,120
at a particular ratio to run through the

167
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,120
sequencer. And so this is what gets you

168
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,319
that mix.

169
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,919
Um, here are some gory details. I don't

170
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,759
know half of what's being talked about

171
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:00,479
here. I think the thing to take away is

172
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:03,680
that during COVID when a lot of samples

173
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:05,840
were being sequenced for

174
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,759
uh testing and when the broad kind of

175
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:12,240
pivoted to an allout uh you know co

176
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,479
diagnosis testing laboratory there's a

177
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,639
lot of advances made a lot of increases

178
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:19,360
in throughput and in fact I learned kind

179
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,759
of secondhand that a you know a lot of

180
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:25,599
the ways particularly to get the price

181
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:27,599
point where it's at was in some of the

182
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,800
less lesons learned from doing all this

183
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,720
stuff. So that was really kind of

184
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,440
encouraging. A little bit of a silver

185
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:37,919
lining on an otherwise uh you know great

186
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:39,919
cloud of co but um it's not you know one

187
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:42,000
of the big deals with this is the fact

188
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:45,919
that we can push through quite a few

189
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,840
samples in per per lane of sequencing uh

190
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,759
with this product.

191
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,440
Um so I'm going to talk about I think

192
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,599
this is really important. You know the

193
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,360
exo is still the exo. Things don't

194
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,919
change all too much with that. The big

195
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,879
thing here with the low pass uh whole

196
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:02,560
genomes is that you're using imputation

197
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,479
to really capture all that common

198
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,560
variance all those common variants back

199
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,560
and you can you know you think about

200
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,319
I'll show another schematic here but how

201
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,599
do you how do you impute you know just

202
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:16,479
random you know on average one two reads

203
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:19,440
across the genome at any given location.

204
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,720
So, Glimpse had come out around this

205
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,400
time. These are from the same people

206
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:26,240
that made shape it and impute and you

207
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,400
know have a really strong track record

208
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,319
of this stuff and they recently came out

209
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,320
with some low pass stuff that looked a

210
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,640
lot better than some of the other stuff.

211
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,039
Kai really helped me out during this

212
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:40,399
development period uh in running glimpse

213
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:42,080
and getting things set up for that. This

214
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,159
is kind of the schematic that you can

215
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,800
look at and I think it it provides a

216
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:49,440
nice easy kind of detail. You go here's

217
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,360
what your low pass whole genome looks

218
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,959
like. All sorts of gaps everywhere,

219
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,720
right? And what we're trying to do is

220
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:57,600
we're looking at say in the reference

221
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:00,000
panel there's snips all all across here.

222
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,320
Sometimes there's two reads, sometimes

223
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,279
there's one read, sometimes there's zero

224
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:08,560
reads. If there's zero reads, your prior

225
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:10,240
is probably, you know, pretty equal. You

226
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,920
know, it could be a head, could be a

227
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,839
home alt, could be, but if you have a

228
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:17,440
couple reads, you can adjust those

229
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:19,760
priors and then you take those genotype

230
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,240
prior likelihoods that you get across,

231
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,320
say, whatever number of millions of

232
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:28,000
imputed variants that you're you're

233
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:31,360
wanting to imputee. Uh and then you kind

234
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,959
of run through you know what is kind of

235
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,200
seen as the more traditional kind of

236
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:37,360
imputation pipeline where you phase

237
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,839
select hllet types best guess hllet

238
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,800
types you run a hidden marov model

239
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:45,760
through and sample through hlet types uh

240
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,519
doing this and then once you get these

241
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:50,080
you get your posteriors that are

242
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:52,640
informed both by the phasing and

243
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,800
imputation portion of things of what

244
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:58,240
reference panel hlet types you think you

245
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:00,800
clo most closely match match, but also,

246
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,959
you know, informed by those priors based

247
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,959
on that low pass. Um, you know, there's

248
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,320
probably there's a lot more to this than

249
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,720
just this, but hopefully that gives you

250
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,800
a kind of a schematic of taking lowass

251
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:14,800
and doing that same hletype selection

252
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:17,600
with this and then running amputation.

253
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,519
So in these early iterations what we

254
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,480
used was just some deep hole genomes

255
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,240
from a quite small uh sample sets that

256
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,880
we pretty much ran through the entire

257
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,760
tubes across these iterations. So

258
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:33,279
started with 62 samples, went to 31, ran

259
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:35,600
out of all their blood, uh took 23

260
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:38,560
samples from a different cohort. And

261
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,959
basically what I was comparing is, you

262
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,200
know, taking these re read files,

263
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:47,440
phasing an amputation glimpse, comparing

264
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:50,399
to uh what we would see in GSA, running

265
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,399
concordance with these 30 30x whole

266
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:56,399
genomes as our quote unquote truth data

267
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:57,839
set and uh making sure that you know

268
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,040
seeing you know pretty strong

269
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,560
concordance with what what we see there.

270
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,160
This is kind of the final figure of

271
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:08,160
this. I would say this is probably the

272
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:10,320
most important figure and these were

273
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,399
different iterations that we did as we

274
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,200
started with different blending

275
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:17,600
operations. What you would see early on

276
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,839
uh as we ran through we kind of went way

277
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,440
too high on the exosomes. We did we did

278
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:25,360
pretty well. You know the goal was to

279
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:27,760
just not drop our exo coverage too much.

280
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,360
Um, but with the low pass genomes, we,

281
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,600
you know, we wanted to kind of hit this

282
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,920
sweet spot where, you know, how much

283
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,880
coverage do we need to do pretty well to

284
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:42,320
get strong concordance with our 30x

285
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:44,000
whole genomes. And um, and also on the

286
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,240
very left here, these are just the same

287
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,279
samples. you know, if we pull out those

288
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,360
just the GSA uh snips, you know, we're

289
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:54,560
we're generally doing better across the

290
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:58,959
board than we would if we uh imputed uh

291
00:11:54,560 --> 00:12:02,720
using just the GSA array uh snips here,

292
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:07,120
but we kind of landed in this area. Um,

293
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:10,880
and so we're pretty keen, you know, it

294
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:13,920
was about 33% whole exom sequencing

295
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:16,240
and 67% whole genome sequencing is kind

296
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,160
of where we landed at as our thing. And

297
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,800
this is where we kind of brought it into

298
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,240
the next stage.

299
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,600
And so I'm just going to go back to what

300
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:28,000
is VGE. Um,

301
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,600
you've got your fragmented DNA. you've

302
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,480
got, you know, I just said your

303
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,160
one-third exo, one third, twothirds

304
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,240
whole genome. You're going to have a lot

305
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,959
more reads in the exo, but it's a much

306
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,800
smaller portion of the the genome.

307
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,959
Generally, what I've seen kind of thrown

308
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:46,639
around, you get a, you know, roughly 30x

309
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:49,360
whole exo, 4x whole genome. That's not

310
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,040
quite right. It's something more spread

311
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,320
out. Obviously, there's more variance to

312
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:58,000
this. Uh, you get somewhere around 25 to

313
00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:00,560
40x. This is the research uh kind of end

314
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,639
of things not that clinical uh deeper

315
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:06,399
exo and then something on the order of 1

316
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:08,240
to 4x whole genome here. And one of the

317
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,160
things that I wanted to outline is that

318
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,480
you know if you if you plotted this was

319
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,959
an early pilot sample after the the

320
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,440
development what this whole genome

321
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:19,200
coverage and the and the exo coverage

322
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,959
here there's some winners and some

323
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,480
losers. Obviously these samples would

324
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,160
have been thrown out. This was a pilot

325
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,880
data, but you know, there's going to be

326
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:29,600
samples in our protocol that get, you

327
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:32,639
know, around one one X and they also get

328
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:35,200
the lowest amount of exo coverage. And

329
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:37,200
this is just how it kind of works in the

330
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,680
wash of high throughput. But what you

331
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,760
you know what we really want is to just

332
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,120
make sure that we get enough exom

333
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:47,440
coverage that we're we're we're

334
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:50,240
capturing enough uh reads at 10x uh at

335
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:53,519
least 10x coverage and then we kind of

336
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:56,320
get whatever you know we get whatever

337
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:58,560
else comes out and uh as long as we have

338
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,480
enough DNA in there you know we don't

339
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,600
want to get down to zero but these

340
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,440
lowass imputation things they'll work on

341
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,240
you know.1x

342
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,480
1x

343
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,760
they will do better as you go up but

344
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:14,079
they will do you know it will asmtote in

345
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:17,360
terms of imputation performance I won't

346
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:19,760
say it's it's you know it's not linear

347
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,600
um but I think once you get once you get

348
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,680
at least 1x coverage you're doing pretty

349
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,959
well in the amputation landscape this is

350
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,880
another thing just to show the

351
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:29,120
distribution of of these coverages it's

352
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,839
it's it's you know you get anywhere from

353
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:34,560
one to 5x this is a much larger cohort

354
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:38,959
um and then you get around that 30x

355
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:40,800
uh mean coding depth. And so really the

356
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:43,120
goals the deliverables at least from the

357
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,800
genotyping uh side of things or at least

358
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:48,880
the sequencing side of things is 90% of

359
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:52,160
the exom at 10x. And you know we wanted

360
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:54,800
to see that at least 45% of reads are

361
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,320
going into the the genome. This is a

362
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,360
kind of another way to look at it's a

363
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,880
little fuzzy, but um as you can see, you

364
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,360
know, when you get high coverage, you

365
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:06,720
know, a 5x coverage, a much smaller

366
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,639
proportion go to the exo, but you're

367
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,639
getting as long as we're getting 90% of

368
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,160
our target captured at 10x, that's kind

369
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:16,079
of the the main delivery. We're giving

370
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:18,720
you that deep enough exo uh that that

371
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:21,199
we're asking for. You're getting a hold

372
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,880
a low pass hold genome as well. some

373
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,160
samples do better than others. And if

374
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,000
this is something you may want to be

375
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,399
looking at downstream to see just how

376
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,959
much something like your, you know, your

377
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:33,279
lowass coverage is doing relative to say

378
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:37,040
the imputation performance. Uh something

379
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:39,839
to look at. But um but that's kind of

380
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:42,959
you know something that might be not

381
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:46,680
intuitive about uh this product but uh

382
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,680
this is how it works.

383
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:54,320
So after the technical development, we

384
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:57,680
scaled and evaluated this in a large

385
00:15:54,320 --> 00:16:01,360
multi- ancestry cohort. Uh also looking

386
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:05,519
at um structural variance as well, which

387
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:07,440
I'll show. This was kind of our first

388
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,680
look at a collection we've been

389
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,360
gathering for quite a while at Stanley

390
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,120
Center. And this is the population's

391
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,639
underrepresented mental illness

392
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:20,000
association or pumas. And as you can see

393
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:21,759
here from from the names uh you know

394
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,240
most most of the samples that we were

395
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,880
looking at here are from the neurogap

396
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:30,160
and um you know you can see various

397
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:33,360
locations across Africa as well as South

398
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:35,519
America. The GPC in the US this is

399
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,720
actually uh pretty enriched for for

400
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:41,440
African-American ancestry as well. So

401
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:45,040
you know trying to test this across a a

402
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:49,279
wide diversity samples.

403
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:51,199
If you look at the uh PC plot, it's

404
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:55,040
different than what you normally see

405
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:57,120
with your canonical uh triangle of the

406
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:00,880
these different things. And you know, as

407
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:02,959
you probably look at at lower uh you

408
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,039
know, lower PC loadings, you you you'll

409
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:07,039
probably see separation of stuff, but

410
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:09,439
just showing this to show it's not, you

411
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:12,679
know, not your usual plot that people

412
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,679
like to

413
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:33,919
that also had deep hole genomes and this

414
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:36,640
was run using the GATK GCNV. So this is

415
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:39,919
this is still focusing primarily on that

416
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:42,080
exo content. I will say that you know

417
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,400
this doesn't in any way really turn

418
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:48,799
around the low passold genomes as much

419
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:52,880
as well are we capturing rare uh coding

420
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:56,400
structural varants well enough uh in in

421
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:59,600
this in this new product. Um and you can

422
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:04,320
see with the recall so so basically you

423
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:06,400
know how much do we we see in terms of

424
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:09,520
what's available what's seen in the deep

425
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:12,960
hole genomes as you get up to say about

426
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:14,720
you know five exxons overlapping you're

427
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,360
getting above that kind of point8

428
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:20,480
threshold and beyond and you can see the

429
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:24,880
distribution so you know you will say

430
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:26,559
most most of what we see is below that.

431
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,280
So, you could say there's there is

432
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:32,720
probably room to improve on this front.

433
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:35,679
Maybe if your your primary thing is to

434
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,360
look at uh SVS and and you're not happy

435
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:40,000
with this, this is knowledge that you

436
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,240
may want to have. Uh on the other side

437
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,080
of things, you're still, you know, what

438
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:48,559
you do collect is is pretty uh is pretty

439
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,840
pretty well captured in terms of not

440
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:54,559
calling a whole bunch of false

441
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:57,840
positives. Um so so what you do collect

442
00:18:54,559 --> 00:19:00,960
is is uh pretty well identified in terms

443
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,960
of this positive predicted value. Um but

444
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:06,160
that's what we see in these samples as

445
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:08,160
you pull out to say that larger 50,000

446
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,000
sample set. We don't have this

447
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,520
concordance that you can look at but we

448
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,280
just wanted to look at say overall

449
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,000
distributions of deletions and

450
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:20,160
duplications in these coding regions.

451
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:23,760
And we compared that against uh Nomad V4

452
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:25,919
and largely things looked pretty good.

453
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,960
Um

454
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,720
nothing too crazy. You do see, you know,

455
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:34,320
if anything we're we're calling a little

456
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:36,160
bit more here, but you know, the main

457
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,640
thing we worry about is that everything

458
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,400
is would be on the other side of things.

459
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,120
If say you looked at the proportion of

460
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,919
samples that do carry a rare uh coding

461
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:49,440
deletion or duplication, you know, we're

462
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:51,200
right around the same area, you know, a

463
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,200
little bit lower, but I wouldn't look

464
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,360
too much into the exact numbers here.

465
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,039
We're roughly in the same range with

466
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,760
what we've seen before. So there's no

467
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:04,160
real like red flags that you know doing

468
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:07,039
this in uh using BGE over the exo

469
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:09,919
capture that was used before is going to

470
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:13,120
really hurt you in a meaningful way. You

471
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:17,160
do have a little bit less sensitivity in

472
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,160
those very small regions.

473
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,960
So when we looked at the amputation

474
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:26,000
evaluation, so what differs here in

475
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:28,159
terms of what we did before when we had

476
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,520
deep hole genomes, we have quite a few

477
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:33,360
samples, but uh we didn't have dirty

478
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:38,159
exhole genomes for for a lot of this

479
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:41,760
stuff. Um so what we did instead was

480
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:43,840
look at GSA array genotypes. And so kind

481
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,720
of subsetting that fraction of the

482
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:49,600
imputed calls to what we see in these

483
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,600
same samples with their arrays. There's

484
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,159
quite a bit of kind of back and forth QC

485
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,240
to kind of get things right there. But

486
00:20:54,159 --> 00:21:00,080
we looked at, you know, probably on the

487
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:01,679
order of 11 12,000 individuals among

488
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:05,039
that sample set to look at this

489
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:07,360
concordance. And I I also threw this

490
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:10,559
here to give a little bit of a sense of

491
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:13,760
what the cost per sample is uh in doing

492
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:16,799
this. So on average, it's about 36

493
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:18,240
cents. That's still roughly the same. Uh

494
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,240
you know, there was a bit of work on

495
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:24,159
optimizing how large these batches had

496
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:26,400
to be and what sort of compute uh you're

497
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:29,440
asking for to kind of get the these

498
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,120
numbers as low as we can. Um, and that's

499
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:35,640
a whole another thing that I won't talk

500
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,640
too much about. But, uh,

501
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:41,760
during the time that we scaled up, there

502
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:43,440
was also an advance in the glimpse uh,

503
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,360
software

504
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:49,280
and

505
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:51,120
probably the main thing is you get large

506
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,960
reference panels. Things can get

507
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:56,720
expensive with low pass genomes. You

508
00:21:52,960 --> 00:22:00,240
could say 280 242 pounds using say this

509
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:02,960
other option here. Um the main thing you

510
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:05,600
got a dollar in glimpse one 8 cents.

511
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,120
This sounds very attractive. Uh it's a

512
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,120
lot cheaper to do this stuff

513
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,840
particularly when you're using say

514
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,520
150,000 samples as your reference

515
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:16,000
reference panel instead of just say a

516
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,760
few thousand thousand genomes something

517
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,600
like that.

518
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:23,520
kind of the big takeaway from this

519
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,960
sparity, sparity, sparity, sparity. Lots

520
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,640
of rare variants in your reference

521
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,480
panel. Now, we need to handle those

522
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,200
differently. We got to leverage tools

523
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,840
and adapt to the sparity of this stuff.

524
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,320
Um, and as you can see, I think the main

525
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,720
thing with this UK bio bank is that

526
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:41,440
Glimpse 2 is doing better at those rare

527
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,840
variants than glimpse one. uh as you get

528
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,760
to those lower frequencies and up there

529
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,400
with that super expensive version of low

530
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:51,120
pass uh imputation.

531
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:55,280
Also, I won't go too much into this for

532
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:57,120
time sake, but um you know, having lots

533
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:59,360
of reference having a large reference

534
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:01,039
panel does really well across a pretty

535
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:04,640
wide array. you have to get pretty far

536
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:07,679
from uh that little island over there uh

537
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,520
in the UK before you really start seeing

538
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:12,480
things like thousand genomes and the

539
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:14,559
diversity uh stuff starting to perform

540
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,880
better than say a much larger reference

541
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,880
panel cohort. So something interesting

542
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,520
to think about in terms of what you

543
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:24,960
choose that probably the large reference

544
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:26,960
panel can go a long way in that sense.

545
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:30,240
So we did our implementation in Glimpse

546
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:34,480
2 with this stuff. Um we used a version

547
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:37,200
of the thousand genomes uh HTTP

548
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,039
uh reference panel. We did remove a lot

549
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,280
of the rarest variants that actually

550
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:44,960
drops down. It's there's on the order of

551
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:46,559
likeund and some odd million 150 million

552
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,159
snips. But if you drop out those single

553
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,919
tins and double tins in these in these

554
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:52,080
four case samples, you can get down to

555
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:54,400
somewhere around 67 millions. We don't

556
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:57,039
really trust the rarest variance in

557
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,640
these in this to impute all that well.

558
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:01,200
Anyways,

559
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:03,679
do some QC. We look at concordance with

560
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,520
those arrays. We see results that are

561
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,120
largely consistent with what we were

562
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,280
seeing in our pilot samples. It's very

563
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:12,400
encouraging that you know across many

564
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:15,760
different ancestries and different uh

565
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:18,400
you know um different groups that you

566
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,240
know we're seeing uh largely you know

567
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,000
we're getting above even at the lowest

568
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,720
frequency that we could kind of examine

569
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,240
using this GSA array. It's not quite as

570
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,039
sensitive as those whole genomes

571
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:34,159
obviously but uh you know we are still

572
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:40,000
above 90% uh in terms of our R squared u

573
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:42,000
metric. Uh so things looked good there.

574
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,360
Um, one of the things I I found

575
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,120
interesting, this is in a supplement,

576
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:48,320
but if you if you split up by coding and

577
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:50,240
non-coding snips uh that we we were able

578
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,559
to do that, you do see things. I mean,

579
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,720
there is one little outlier here, but

580
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:56,159
generally things are better. This this

581
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,480
is kind of what I wanted to see. I was

582
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,640
never quite sure about these priors and

583
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,960
how well that they do, but obviously

584
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,279
this is being tagged by a lot of this

585
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,720
deeper exom content, right? And so

586
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:09,279
you're going to see that when you

587
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,760
compare it against uh you know these

588
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:12,960
lower frequencies around. So you know

589
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,279
generally you're going to want to use

590
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,559
the exo but you are getting some

591
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:21,919
interesting kind of uh you know in terms

592
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:24,320
of imputation coding regions.

593
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:27,520
You know you've got 30x

594
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:29,600
mean sequencing depth. It is translating

595
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,360
into better imputation performance. So

596
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,440
you know you're not throwing out the exo

597
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,440
when you run through lowass imputation.

598
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,279
take whatever you can get. And on the

599
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,360
other side of things, we do see higher

600
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:42,159
concordance, which I I found kind of

601
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:45,679
interesting.

602
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:49,279
We did as well look at how well you

603
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:52,159
could capture structural variance in the

604
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:54,640
lowass genomes themselves. I wouldn't

605
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:57,360
say this was a particular

606
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:59,200
use case that, you know, people thought,

607
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:03,120
you know, think to do in this stuff, but

608
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:07,840
it was worth investigating as well. And

609
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:10,480
you know what you see is that as uh you

610
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:13,120
know you get to a certain length these

611
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,120
the the structural variants you call do

612
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:18,799
actually pretty well. In particular for

613
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:23,120
deletions you know anything even in this

614
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:24,880
0 to 500 base pair range. You know

615
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:27,200
you're doing pretty the the deletions

616
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:30,640
you're calling are deletions that we're

617
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:32,720
also seeing in deep whole genomes. You

618
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:35,679
know, the bad side of this is that your

619
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:38,080
recall is way low. So, you're not

620
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,760
capturing all of it. Uh, you know,

621
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,679
you're capturing on the order of say 30

622
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,760
to 40%.

623
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,279
Um, and as you go to that lowest one,

624
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,120
you're capturing a lot less. I mean,

625
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:49,200
maybe if you play around with the tuning

626
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,039
of these these things, you could you

627
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,799
could change things up, but I think as

628
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:56,080
currently stands with with the analysis

629
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:57,520
that that was run, you know, it's it's

630
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,480
interesting to think that, you know,

631
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:03,039
there is room to capture some, you know,

632
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,039
rare structural variants outside of the

633
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:07,200
coding region and say, you know, with

634
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:09,679
some confidence that even though you

635
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,520
you're only capturing, you know, a

636
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,520
fraction of this stuff, it's most likely

637
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,039
real. it's not just filled up with a

638
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:19,520
whole bunch of false positive calls

639
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:22,400
because of the low pass uh so that's a

640
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:24,320
little bit of a interesting side note in

641
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:26,320
these analyses

642
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,880
um

643
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:31,200
and so in the last uh few minutes here I

644
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,279
can talk about some of the current BGE

645
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:37,760
products resources you know we've given

646
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:40,320
talks uh at least the lab has rolled a

647
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,760
number of these BGE samples into the

648
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,400
larger Bipex

649
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:47,520
and schema. So bipolar and schizophrenia

650
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:51,360
exo metaanalyses.

651
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:54,399
Um I will highlight you know bipolar in

652
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,760
particular you know prior to the

653
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:58,960
incorporation of some of these new

654
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:02,080
samples had very few uh if any x and y

655
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:04,559
significant hits um and we're really

656
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,880
seeing some nice results out of that

657
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:09,600
neurogaps. It's still early days with

658
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,679
this stuff. African populations have a

659
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,840
lot more diversity. I think we're going

660
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:15,279
to be waiting on more samples to to find

661
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:18,880
stuff there. But it's really encouraging

662
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:21,200
to see uh you know downstream results

663
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:24,960
popping out. We have a lot more samples

664
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:28,000
in tow. In fact, we have probably within

665
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:31,760
our group and adjacent groups, you know,

666
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:35,679
something on the order of over 260,000

667
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:37,760
samples across uh the globe. uh making

668
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:39,520
this up probably the largest that Puma's

669
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:42,159
cohort that you know we looked at about

670
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:45,200
50,000 it's going to be growing to about

671
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:46,799
140,000 primarily schizophrenia bipolar

672
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,440
psychosis

673
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:52,240
um but we have number of other samples

674
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:54,159
as well and some different uh diseases

675
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,320
that that we're interested I know other

676
00:28:54,159 --> 00:29:01,039
people out there are also starting to

677
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:03,279
look at uh BGE sample collections

678
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:05,600
um in terms of running something like

679
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:09,679
glimpse we ran ran a lot of this through

680
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:13,039
our hail batch uh system and it's a bit

681
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:16,320
more internal but there is a version of

682
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:18,000
running glimpse 2 uh right through terra

683
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:21,039
I will say if your sample size is

684
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,960
somewhere probably around a thousand

685
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:25,760
maybe up to a few thousand this is

686
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,360
actually probably the best route to run

687
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:30,320
things to once you start getting into

688
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:32,240
the 10,000 there are limitations to

689
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,880
running this it's not that it won't work

690
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:37,200
it's that it will take weeks to to run

691
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,360
through. There's quotas on the other

692
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,720
deep in the belly of this. I don't know

693
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:44,080
why there are quotas, but there are

694
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:46,880
quotas and that's just how it is. And we

695
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:50,640
get around it by running basically the

696
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:55,840
same thing that was developed uh in in

697
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:57,520
GP uh through the R hail batch uh

698
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:00,080
compute.

699
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:02,480
Um, but this is out there. You, you

700
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:05,039
know, if you click on on this, you can

701
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:07,360
basically see this. And one of the nice

702
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:09,440
things that that Michael did was

703
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:12,399
basically set put all the settings. You

704
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:17,039
just kind of fill in, rename this demo

705
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:21,279
into whatever you're doing and uh, you

706
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:23,120
know, select uh, how much you want the

707
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:24,240
main thing, the billing project that's

708
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,720
you're going to that's going to actually

709
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,559
pay for all this stuff. And you can do

710
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,320
this. So I think you know we're really

711
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:33,200
close to something that's you know

712
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:35,360
pretty accessible to people who don't

713
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:38,640
have kind of deep knowledge of kind of

714
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:40,240
the inner workings of glimpse.

715
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,840
Um

716
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,240
we are going to be getting beyond

717
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:46,240
thousand genomes http a lot of the

718
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:50,399
samples that we've we've done so far

719
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:53,520
that's been the default but there is a a

720
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:56,320
much larger uh amputation service. We're

721
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:58,240
hoping that it'll support Glimpse later

722
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:01,200
this year. I think right now they're in

723
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:04,159
kind of the pilot phase. We jump to

724
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,840
this. So this combines all of us and the

725
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:08,640
Anvil Centers for Common Disease

726
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:12,799
Genomics. So it's about I think on the

727
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:15,840
order of 800,000 samples. So it's big.

728
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:17,919
It's got lots of variants as many of us

729
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,600
are coming to learn. You know, lots of

730
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:22,000
variants are good until you have to

731
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:24,480
store them and let them sit around for a

732
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,320
while. But uh oh, here we go. We've got

733
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:32,559
515,000

734
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:34,320
uh uh that that came out here. Um and so

735
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:36,240
I think they're in the pilot phase right

736
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,080
now. So if anybody's got arrays that

737
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,880
they want imputed using the service,

738
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:43,840
this might be a good resource to jump

739
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:46,240
out to. not ready for glimpse yet, but

740
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:48,399
you know, we will be kind of making a

741
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,159
big move with a lot of our samples into

742
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:53,600
this space because we really want to

743
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:55,600
leverage uh you know, the sample size

744
00:31:53,600 --> 00:32:00,120
and diversity that all of us and uh

745
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:00,120
Amble will will give us

746
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:04,720
and

747
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:07,519
also we have a BGE toolkit. It's

748
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:10,080
currently in the works. Um but in terms

749
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:13,039
of say running imputation

750
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:16,320
uh through the hail batch version and

751
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:18,320
doing things like QC and potentially say

752
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,840
if you're interested I mean one of the

753
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:22,799
things I didn't really talk too much

754
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:25,840
about you know things still work in the

755
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:27,919
you know impute world of things you get

756
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,760
your imputation you run your G-W was

757
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:32,559
meta analysis and then the exo people

758
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:35,600
run their exom stuff but you know we

759
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:39,600
really want to merge all this stuff at

760
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:42,000
the end of the day having both uh common

761
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:45,039
variants and rare variants together. Why

762
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,039
not? We are working on merging this in

763
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:49,679
ways that I think would be sensible and

764
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:51,919
giving analysts the ability to kind of

765
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:55,039
select just how they want to do this and

766
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:58,080
hopefully giving these sorts of tools

767
00:32:55,039 --> 00:33:00,799
will will help here. And we are

768
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:04,880
developing this now as we move into kind

769
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:08,799
of the next phase of this. Uh,

770
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:11,600
and I think with that I just want to

771
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:13,760
thank a lot of those within our group

772
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:16,720
that that helped all the way from the

773
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:19,840
early days to to a lot of the scaling up

774
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:22,320
and and recent analysis out here. It's

775
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:24,559
been really an effort that spans well

776
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:28,960
beyond our units, you know, with the

777
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:32,880
help of those in in GP and

778
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:36,080
um you know, we're hoping that as

779
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:39,679
as we get here, you know, we this idea

780
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:42,640
of diversity in genomic association

781
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:45,600
studies can, you know, be realized and I

782
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:47,840
think the low pass approach really in

783
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,039
the long term, you know, aside from say

784
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,760
the inevitable

785
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:53,679
everyone has deep whole genomes. Uh if

786
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:55,519
that cost, you know, ever truly gets

787
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:58,880
down to something as competitive with

788
00:33:55,519 --> 00:34:01,120
this, but that you know, you can go to

789
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:04,080
basically any population in the world

790
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:05,919
and, you know, with the right reference

791
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:08,399
panel is that you're not, you know,

792
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:10,720
systematically ignoring the sort of

793
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:13,040
variation that may exist there. where

794
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:15,440
you know with the array approach you

795
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:17,839
have the possibility that you know we

796
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:20,639
are kind of underserving what we can see

797
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:25,919
in the landscape of variation and so

798
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:27,760
really excited about this and uh thanks

799
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:31,399
all right with that let's thank Daniel

800
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,399
one last Time.
