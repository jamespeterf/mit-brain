1
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,840
I'm delighted to introduce Isabelle

2
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,359
Varela um to discuss some of the um

3
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,720
research and learning we're trying to do

4
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,960
at

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,960
>> I have

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,519
Thank you.

7
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,920
So I'm Isabelle with heat and I will be

8
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,680
sharing with you today uh how heat is

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,800
trying to learn from these geothermal

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:46,160
energy networks. Um so learning from

11
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:49,160
geothermal energy networks and thank

12
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,160
you.

13
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,120
Keat has a research project um that is

14
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,960
called learning from the ground up and

15
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,120
it is funded by Massachusetts clean

16
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,440
energy center and the goal of this

17
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,879
project is to evaluate the potential of

18
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,400
these geothermal networks in

19
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,720
Massachusetts

20
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,119
um and mainly to really increase

21
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:12,000
understanding of this technology and uh

22
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,840
to optimize it as much as we can. We

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,799
want to share all the learnings with the

24
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:20,240
stakeholders and make that knowledge um

25
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:23,600
public open source.

26
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:25,200
Here is a brief organizational chart um

27
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,119
in bubbles. I'm not going to go into

28
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,640
detail but I just want to share you know

29
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,960
what are the different organizations

30
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:34,000
that are collaborating with us. So we

31
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,720
have this great uh consortium where we

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,079
have uh ENL that Juliet will be speaking

33
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,560
today. We have LBNL. We have uh Boston

34
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,720
University uh Nathan Phillips, he was a

35
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,119
speaker yesterday, Jonathan Bunor as

36
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,200
well. They're part of that legup

37
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,280
research group. We're also collaborating

38
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,960
with Burough Habold. And of course, we

39
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,880
partner with our utilities that are

40
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:59,320
doing these systems and these

41
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,320
installations uh here in Massachusetts.

42
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,079
So, how is this project organized? at

43
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:09,759
the core of this project. The project is

44
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:12,400
anchored on the data demonstration uh

45
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:14,800
projects that are here in Massachusetts.

46
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,680
And then we're looking at core modeling,

47
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,480
the impacts of these installations and a

48
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:25,040
scaling of these systems. So we'll go a

49
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:27,440
little bit into uh these in more detail.

50
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,120
So in Massachusetts there are different

51
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,080
pilot projects or demonstration

52
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,680
projects. uh as we heard from uh Eric

53
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,200
Bosworth, there's the Frammingham

54
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,840
project. So that's the one that is

55
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,920
installed already uh already in the

56
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:43,440
commissioning stage. Then there's

57
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:46,239
Franklin Field uh national grid uh just

58
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,640
is right now in the design phase of that

59
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:52,319
and they will be drilling their test

60
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:54,480
bore hole this month. uh and we also

61
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:57,280
have the extension the second loop in

62
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,360
Frammingham and heat has collaborated

63
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,519
with Eversource and got grant from the

64
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,920
department of energy uh to do the design

65
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,519
phase and now we were selected for the

66
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,599
construction phase of that project. So

67
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,920
we're very excited to have that moving

68
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,599
forward.

69
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,599
So what are the things that heat is

70
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:16,159
doing as part of this? So the data

71
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,920
acquisition here is focused on

72
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,920
temperature data acquiring temperature

73
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,560
data down the bore holes. So this is

74
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,480
fiber optic cables that are being u

75
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,000
installed in a subset of bore holes. So

76
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,040
there are 90 bore holes in the

77
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,519
Frammingham project and 15 of those have

78
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,000
fiber optic cable to measure temperature

79
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,920
at every location down the bore hole.

80
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,879
And this is temperature that is measured

81
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:42,319
constantly and the idea is that we can

82
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:44,720
um analyze this data with the variations

83
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,640
that we see in the days with the seasons

84
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,480
and with the years. So really when we

85
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,560
have one year of data when that system

86
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,519
has been performed for one year and we

87
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,680
get that sinosoidal curve that uh Connor

88
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,560
uh showed earlier today that's when we

89
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,239
want to you know uh really leverage this

90
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,319
data and how do we think it's going to

91
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,200
keep on performing throughout the years.

92
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,879
So with this we can monitor the systems

93
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,640
and see if there's any change that needs

94
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,640
to be made so that it functions

95
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:15,000
optimally within the temperature range

96
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,000
that the heat pumps work best.

97
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:20,639
the modeling part. So we have two groups

98
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,440
LBNL and ENL that are focusing on

99
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:26,639
developing these core modeling uh tools.

100
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,120
So LBNL has focused on developing a full

101
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,280
physics model um that is more

102
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,360
complicated runs in Modelica softwares

103
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,800
that are less accessible if you will and

104
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,840
then ENL has been working on um reduced

105
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,840
order models tools and I won't steal

106
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,800
your thunder uh Juliet will be talking

107
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:47,440
more about that um that will uh run

108
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,280
quicker and you can still get uh the

109
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,639
behavior of the system with these models

110
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,960
and the idea is that they're going to be

111
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:56,320
open source as well

112
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,960
And this is another slide uh from that

113
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,040
model and I'll just briefly mention that

114
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,320
for example one of the outcomes that you

115
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:06,639
can get is that um you have this in the

116
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:10,240
horizontal line you have the buildings

117
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,919
going along that uh loop and then in the

118
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,840
summer for example as you go from

119
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,919
building to building in that ambient

120
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,240
temperature loop you're getting hotter

121
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:20,800
and hotter until you reach the bore hole

122
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,120
and then you cool down and then you go

123
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,039
around the loop hotter hotter and then

124
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,039
you reach the bore hole and you go down.

125
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,600
So this is one of the advantages of

126
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:32,400
having different bore fields as Brian

127
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:35,680
Erlab was mentioning earlier today. Um

128
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:38,479
so we have that in this uh

129
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,360
in this Frammingham um project and then

130
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:44,919
we have a similar example uh when we are

131
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,919
uh in the winter.

132
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,560
This project is looking at what are the

133
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,800
impacts of these geothermal networks in

134
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:56,000
a more holistical way. We're looking

135
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,800
also at ecology um at the impacts on

136
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,199
health, the impacts on equity. So this

137
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,520
is a work that is being done right now

138
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:06,960
uh and Angie here is the lead for that

139
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,560
in heat impacts on emissions impacts on

140
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,639
the electric grid. One of the things

141
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,960
that we want to do is to have

142
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:16,720
measurements at these demonstration

143
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,319
projects uh to measure what um to

144
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,880
quantify the impact on the electric

145
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,560
grid. So Zay mentioned you know what is

146
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,120
the impact of ground source heat pumps

147
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,600
with this ORNL study if you had them at

148
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,479
a national scale and here we want to

149
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,000
quantify it for a particular project uh

150
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,639
these demonstration projects that we

151
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,800
have in Massachusetts and we also want

152
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,240
to know what is the impact of costs one

153
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:42,080
of the things that we're working with

154
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:46,160
Boro Hapold and ENL is to make this um

155
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:48,400
survey about costs um cost of drilling

156
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,600
cost of the construction of the main

157
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,919
loop and costs also of the retrofit. So

158
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:57,880
the three different phases that were

159
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,880
discussed earlier today

160
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:06,479
and all of this the idea is to uh feed a

161
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,319
study on this regional assessment uh how

162
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:11,919
would it look like if we had these

163
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:14,720
systems installed uh for an entire city

164
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:16,800
uh here in Massachusetts uh say for

165
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,880
example the city of Cambridge. How would

166
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,280
it look like if we had it for the entire

167
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:26,199
state of Massachusetts? So, what are the

168
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:26,199
impacts uh of that

169
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,919
and

170
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,759
this ties very well into the previous uh

171
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,919
session we were talking about data. Data

172
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,840
is one of the things that is needed and

173
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:45,360
here this is a database that heat is

174
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:47,360
making. Um the idea is to enable

175
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,759
quantitative comparison between the

176
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,960
systems to identify what are the design

177
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:56,160
parameters that work best. Things like

178
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,800
the diameter of the main pipe. Uh what

179
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:01,680
is you know the temperature range that

180
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:05,039
the uh main pipe is allowed to fluctuate

181
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:08,000
in. Um so all these kind of engineering

182
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,599
technical aspects but also uh practical

183
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,520
things. So we want to capture the

184
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,280
knowledge of the demonstration project

185
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,520
in Frammingham. We want to capture the

186
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,599
knowledge of the demon of the project in

187
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,680
Colorado Mesa University that will be

188
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:23,039
presented later on that has been running

189
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,280
since 2008. So all of this uh knowledge

190
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:28,000
we want to be able to capture it in a

191
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:31,280
database that will be open source and

192
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,120
this uh interface uh heat has created it

193
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,039
is up and running right now our beta

194
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,760
version and we're in the process of

195
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:41,120
collecting data from all these existing

196
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:43,360
projects. Um

197
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,920
we also want to capture information

198
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,240
about costs.

199
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,399
We want to really eventually identify

200
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,200
how to reduce those costs. Right? But we

201
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:55,040
want to first have that database and we

202
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,839
want to support the development of

203
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,399
datadriven u legislation and regulation

204
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:05,080
which connects to uh our session

205
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:05,080
yesterday with chair von nostrren.

206
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,519
So what is it? We're creating a public

207
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,640
datab bank of these geothermal network

208
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:15,040
installations and why we want to do this

209
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,839
to inform and to facilitate future

210
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:20,560
developments of these systems

211
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:24,240
and how this interface is linked to the

212
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:26,800
heat data uh website and it is stored in

213
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,720
the Harvard data versse which is has the

214
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,640
infrastructure to store data in

215
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:34,000
perpetuity.

216
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,920
So as we right now have few of these um

217
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,080
demonstration projects for example the

218
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:41,440
one in Frammingham and Colorado Mesa

219
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:43,279
University the idea is that when we have

220
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,360
more of these systems we want to be

221
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,760
populating this database so that it is

222
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,440
really useful and that knowledge can be

223
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,160
u the knowledge from the database can be

224
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,600
useful for those installing uh these

225
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,920
systems for communities that are

226
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,080
thinking of doing these installations.

227
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,399
Uh for example, we have the kickstart

228
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:04,000
program here in Massachusetts that is

229
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:06,560
also part of this uh legup project where

230
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,360
uh 12 communities in Massachusetts are

231
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,600
doing either feasibility studies or uh

232
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,920
community engagement projects as to how

233
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:17,120
can they move to have one of these

234
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:19,279
geothermal networks in their community.

235
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:23,200
And we often get the question is this

236
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:26,720
database only for the US or if we have a

237
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:30,240
system in Canada can we uh can can it be

238
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:34,079
there and the answer is yes. So uh while

239
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,680
the legup research project is funded by

240
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:38,320
Massachusetts clean energy center and

241
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:41,360
it's focused on the uh demonstration

242
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:45,200
projects in Massachusetts. This database

243
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:49,399
is really open nationally and to um

244
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,399
projects in other countries as well.

245
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,200
So what are the c different categories

246
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,279
that we are uh acquiring in this

247
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,480
database? Um information about the

248
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,640
buildings we talked about the building

249
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,079
retrofits in the previous session. Uh

250
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,839
about the system performance that was

251
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,320
the coefficient of performance that was

252
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,640
referred to. um about the emissions

253
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:14,000
reductions about the subsurface that's

254
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:17,040
where the borehole uh test um

255
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,279
information gets input about costs about

256
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,360
the energy usage of the buildings before

257
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,839
and after these geothermal networks have

258
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,920
been installed and about uh demographics

259
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,160
how many people are being uh benefited

260
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:31,279
by these systems

261
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:34,640
and uh these different categories can be

262
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:36,880
also um put into these three buckets of

263
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:39,120
the thermal resources what's happening

264
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,600
um in the bore holes, the distribution,

265
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,240
the main loop, and what's happening in

266
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:48,000
the buildings.

267
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:51,120
And now I'd like to close with um one of

268
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,120
the projects that heat is working on. As

269
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,399
as I mentioned, this is the extension to

270
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,640
the Frammingham project that um Eric

271
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:02,079
mentioned earlier. This would be the

272
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:04,560
extension to that project. Um

273
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:09,120
and this is the original loop. Right now

274
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:12,639
we are planning a borefield right here.

275
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:16,079
And uh the the idea is that this is the

276
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:18,880
very first extension loop of one of

277
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:21,279
these systems that is connecting to an

278
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:24,399
already installed and operating system.

279
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:27,120
So this extension loop can be the model

280
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:29,839
for how these systems can connect in

281
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,880
modularity and grow throughout the city.

282
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:35,760
So learnings about how to uh do those

283
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:39,600
connections and grow these systems will

284
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:41,680
come from uh this expansion project.

285
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,590
And with that I'll hand it over to our

286
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:48,309
next speaker. Yeah.

287
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:48,309
[Applause]
