1
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,639
So, good morning. I'm Daniel Hastings,

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,440
uh, the current head of the MIT

3
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:16,480
Aereroastro department. Uh, today we

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:19,600
celebrate the, uh, 64th anniversary of

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:22,560
the first Lester Gardner lecture given

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,279
in 1959. The gardener lecture is made

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,599
possible by the request of the ma the

8
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:30,960
late major Lester Gardner a member of

9
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:33,360
the MIT class of 1898

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,520
to sponsor annual presentations on

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,320
aeronautical history. So we've broadened

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,920
it to aerospace.

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,559
Over the years we've been honored by

14
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,200
luminaries such as Igor Sikosski, Jimmy

15
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:47,200
Doolittle, Ivon Bril, Neil Armstrong to

16
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,680
name a few.

17
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,680
A remarkable individual, Major Gardner

18
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,600
played several critical roles in the

19
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,320
advancement of aviation in the early

20
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,320
years of the 20th century. Uh he

21
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,000
actually actually with the encouragement

22
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,960
of Grover uh loaning and Hunac and Glenn

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,880
Martin he uh organized the gardener

24
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:10,240
publishing company which published

25
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:12,880
aviation who's who which later became

26
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,880
aviation week which some of us read

27
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,119
every week.

28
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,520
In addition, he was the founder of the

29
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,280
Institute of Aeronautical Sciences,

30
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,840
which later became the Institute of

31
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,360
Aerospace Sciences, which became the

32
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,080
AIAA.

33
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,640
So, he had he had his hand in two very

34
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,880
big things. Uh, he was an air officer in

35
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,960
World War I, uh, the recipient of

36
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,640
numerous aeronautical awards, including

37
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:41,360
the Daniel Guggenheim Medal in 1947.

38
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,040
He was always interested in MIT wi which

39
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,880
continued throughout his life and he

40
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,640
helped establish this garden

41
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,320
lecturesship as well as the hunaca

42
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,759
professorship.

43
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:54,079
Uh with that as background I want to

44
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:57,840
turn our attention to our our speaker

45
00:01:54,079 --> 00:02:01,600
today um colonel retired uh Pam Melroy

46
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:04,719
who is the NASA uh deputy administrator.

47
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,439
Now she Pam asked that I keep her her CV

48
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:11,760
very short. Okay. So, what can I say

49
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:14,879
about Pam? Um, she's uh flown uh many

50
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:17,120
aircraft uh in in the Air Force. As

51
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,440
deputy administrator, she performs the

52
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,360
duties and exercise the powers delegated

53
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,959
by the administrator.

54
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,280
Uh assist the administrator in making

55
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:29,120
final agency decisions, acts for the

56
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:31,440
administrator in his absence. Um she's

57
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,360
also responsible for laying out the AY's

58
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,040
vision and representing NASA to the

59
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,760
executive office of the president and

60
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:41,120
Congress, you know, and so on. She's

61
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:43,280
been an astronaut, has flown in space uh

62
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,680
three times, right? Three times, right?

63
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,160
Flew the shuttle up up in space, helped

64
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,519
assemble space station

65
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,680
uh and has worked with a DARPA, Loheed

66
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:58,000
Martin, a number of other places. But

67
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:59,680
most important, she's a graduate of MIT.

68
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,680
and we're very proud of her. So with

69
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,680
that, Pam, up to you.

70
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:12,720
>> Thank you so much. Uh it's really

71
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,040
wonderful to be back at MIT and uh I

72
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:19,360
really appreciate that brief

73
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:21,360
introduction. Uh Dan who is a treasure.

74
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,680
You are a treasure. I've enjoyed so much

75
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,920
working with you uh in the private

76
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,680
sector as well and uh thank you for your

77
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,840
leadership of the aereroastro

78
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,519
department. I do have to let everybody

79
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,599
know that I actually got my degree in

80
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:38,080
earth and planetary science here, not in

81
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:40,560
aereroastro. Uh but um I think uh you

82
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,200
know most of my career was spent doing

83
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,959
essentially aereroastro engineering. Uh

84
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,640
so I'm really happy in the position that

85
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,239
I'm in now that I have the opportunity

86
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,840
to have the science background to work

87
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,239
with the science mission directorate at

88
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,840
NASA as well as feeling very comfortable

89
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,480
with both aeronautics and space

90
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,400
technology. Um, so I've really been able

91
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,319
to achieve a lot of my dreams as a

92
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,680
result of the work, uh, that I was able

93
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:06,159
to do here at MIT. And so, um, you know,

94
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,000
extraordinarily impressive department,

95
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,159
uh, and activities going on. Loved the

96
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,680
pitchfest we just heard. It was, uh, it

97
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,640
was very impressive, actually, having

98
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,400
heard a lot of those things. There are

99
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,720
so many things I could talk to you about

100
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,320
today. Um, but I decided to pick

101
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,880
something that I think is extremely

102
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,040
important and perhaps provide a little

103
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,680
bit of context around that. And that is

104
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,520
our moon to Mars strategy. Uh I'm hoping

105
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,120
to talk for a little while, but uh I'd

106
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,040
also like to have a dialogue. I want to

107
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,440
take your questions because we have so

108
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,160
much stuff going on at NASA right now. I

109
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,400
won't come even close to discussing uh a

110
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,160
tenth of it, but uh to me, this is uh

111
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,400
very important. It's a critical aspect

112
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,400
of what we're doing.

113
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,880
So I do want to give a shout out uh to

114
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,120
MIT. Many of you maybe have seen this

115
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:54,000
picture of Margaret Hamilton who was the

116
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:57,440
lead for the guidance system development

117
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,560
uh software for Apollo uh and she was

118
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,639
right here at MIT and in fact it's just

119
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:06,160
fascinating as we go forward with

120
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:08,320
Artemis to realize essentially software

121
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,280
engineering was invented by Margaret and

122
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,759
her team just didn't exist as a

123
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,840
discipline before Apollo. Uh we needed

124
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,240
that. It's a great example of how the

125
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,479
technology investments that we make when

126
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,960
we do hard things actually spill off

127
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:25,600
into other areas. I think everyone's

128
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,440
familiar with Buzz Aldrin's thesis and

129
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,960
the work that he did as well, but I just

130
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,560
want to make a a special shout out to

131
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,479
Margaret because she's near and dear to

132
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,360
my heart. The fault detection,

133
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:37,759
isolation, and recovery algorithms were

134
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,680
absolutely critical. Um, you all

135
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:42,000
probably heard the, you know, we're all

136
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,880
turning blue down here, you know, kind

137
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,560
of thing. the overflight uh for Neil

138
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:50,720
Armstrong. But in fact, what was

139
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:53,680
happening was that the nav system was um

140
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:56,880
you know had a massive stack overflow.

141
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:59,680
Uh but Margaret's algorithm enabled the

142
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,840
flight to keep going because essentially

143
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,360
it dumped the stuff it didn't need. It

144
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,600
had a list of the things that it

145
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,000
absolutely had to have and then every

146
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,680
time the computer reset it carried over

147
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,600
the critical data to the next level

148
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,319
which allowed that that flight to

149
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,560
continue. So really truly extraordinary

150
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:19,440
work there.

151
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:22,319
Uh so I I hope you had the opportunity

152
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:26,080
to uh watch the Aremis launch either

153
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:29,360
real time and live or uh after the fact.

154
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,639
It was really impressive to be there. Um

155
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,319
one of the things that's interesting

156
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,600
about launching a rocket for the first

157
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,520
time, it's not just about the

158
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,080
technology, it's about the operations as

159
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,840
well. And so for us to figure out

160
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,919
signatures that we were seeing as we got

161
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,600
close to launch countdown, making sure

162
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,759
that we understood what was happening to

163
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,600
the vehicle, it took us a couple tries,

164
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,440
but we were thrilled. And the

165
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,759
performance of the rocket was absolutely

166
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,919
incredible. And uh one of my favorite

167
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,680
pictures uh in the upper right corner, I

168
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:58,319
think we're all used to seeing digital

169
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,400
images where people stack, you know,

170
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,639
several complicated things together.

171
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,680
That is actually not stacked. That is a

172
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:09,280
selfie uh in the upper right corner from

173
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,440
the solar array of Orion. So at the tip

174
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,919
of the solar array was a camera and

175
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,319
pointing back. Yes, that is the moon and

176
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,800
beyond it the earth. And that is a

177
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,800
real-time photo that was taken. Uh that

178
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:24,560
was just um I think phenomenally

179
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,720
inspiring for all of us to see real live

180
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,919
photos from the moon for the first time

181
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:32,639
in uh more than 50 years. So really

182
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:35,199
really phenomenal. So we're at a very

183
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:38,000
very special place in time. We've spent

184
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:40,479
the last decade of investments to get to

185
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,639
this point in having the transportation

186
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:45,680
system that will enable human beings to

187
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:47,360
go to deep space. Um I'm I'm going to be

188
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,520
very, you know, straightforward about

189
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,599
this. It has been a tough decade for

190
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,080
NASA. It's very hard to go into tech

191
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,680
development uh because you're not flying

192
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,120
hardware. So people are like where are

193
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,840
we? What's happening? There's nothing

194
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,800
happening. And uh in fact uh you know

195
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:06,000
space the investment takes a long time

196
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:08,560
to get to this point and uh the first

197
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,479
test flight was absolutely phenomenal.

198
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,960
Uh as a result of that there's been

199
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,960
changes in space policy and discussions

200
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:18,000
about what our destination was going to

201
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:20,560
be uh that have had an impact I think on

202
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,280
all of us. So NASA took an approach

203
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,759
which um I really was very supportive of

204
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,280
which is capabilities-based approach.

205
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,520
We're going to build the capability to

206
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,840
send humans into deep space and then

207
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,560
wherever anybody decides to send us, we

208
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:37,599
will be ready to do it. But I think

209
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:40,479
we're at a different place right now and

210
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:43,839
um especially with the uh announcement

211
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:46,399
that we made on Monday of the Artemis 2

212
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:49,360
crew. So the first crew uh that will go

213
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:52,160
into deep space in more than 50 years.

214
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:55,120
Uh really extraordinary. It's getting

215
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:58,080
real. It's getting very real. So we hope

216
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,920
to fly that mission by the end of 2024.

217
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,000
Uh right now the long pole in the tent

218
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:05,360
is actually a refurbishment of

219
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,800
electronics uh between Orion 1 and Orion

220
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,880
2. So uh that all those electronics were

221
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,279
pulled a few days ahead of schedule

222
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,000
actually and they are now at the vendor

223
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:17,680
uh for evaluation and understanding. But

224
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,279
some basic things like the fact that we

225
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,959
didn't get saltwater intrusion inside

226
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,200
the vehicle and things like that give us

227
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:25,440
hope that that we'll be able to to stick

228
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,959
to that schedule. Uh the next long pole

229
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,360
in the tent, there's a couple pieces of

230
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:32,560
the SLS uh manufacturer, but I was just

231
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:35,519
there last week at Mashe and saw uh the

232
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,839
Artemis 2 vehicle uh getting very very

233
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:40,800
close. So I think I think we're, you

234
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,720
know, in pretty good shape. Uh just like

235
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,480
in Apollo, we've got thousands of people

236
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,560
involved in this and thousands of people

237
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,600
invested in it. One of the things that

238
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:52,000
is uh unusual is uh and very different

239
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:55,519
from Apollo is that we were very focused

240
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,200
on going together internationally. So um

241
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,080
Jeremy Hansen, one of the crew members

242
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:02,720
is from Canada. Uh this is there could

243
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:05,040
be no more visible representation of the

244
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,519
difference between Artemis and Apollo

245
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,279
than this crew. Uh first of all, we have

246
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,760
a woman, we have a person of color, we

247
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:14,160
have a person from uh an international

248
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,839
partner. So it's it's very different,

249
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,440
but it's highly appropriate because

250
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:21,360
Apollo the after all the mission was to

251
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,399
send a man to the moon and return him

252
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,480
safely. That was it. What we found when

253
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,640
we got there was there was all kinds of

254
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,560
really interesting science and other

255
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,440
technology spin-offs as a result of

256
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:35,839
that. But really in the eyes of the

257
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,839
public and the stakeholders that was the

258
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,920
mission. We've got a different mission

259
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,720
now. Artemis is a very very different

260
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:46,000
purpose. It's actually about going out

261
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:48,000
into deep space with humans to stay. And

262
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,920
uh so I I love this picture just because

263
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,640
I think it's it's a critical part of the

264
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:55,839
story.

265
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:59,760
So uh and we're starting this year.

266
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:02,079
We're not waiting. Um, Capstone is uh in

267
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,240
the near rectal linear halo orbit that

268
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:07,360
we plan to put gateway which is our

269
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,360
orbiting logistics cache and uh

270
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,640
technology demonstrator and potentially

271
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:15,680
a jump off uh point for Mars that will

272
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,680
be uh put into orbit around the moon.

273
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,760
The problem is it's a very complicated

274
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,440
orbit. It's really interesting being an

275
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,360
astronaut because I have a strong

276
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,440
intuitive sense of low earth orbit

277
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,920
mechanics. I mean I just lived it. had

278
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,320
to fly three rendevous and dockings and

279
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,160
undockings with the space station. So,

280
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,399
it's just something that I really really

281
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,320
understand. I'll tell you what, I have

282
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,800
been struggling with the astronamics

283
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:41,120
around the moon because it's really a

284
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,040
three-body problem. Uh so much

285
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,959
influenced by the gravity of the earth,

286
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:48,800
but also much more influenced by the

287
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:50,959
gravity of the sun. So, um fantastically

288
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,519
challenging, especially as you look at

289
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:56,480
our destination, uh for Artemis is the

290
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,880
South Pole. much more difficult uh than

291
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,839
getting to the equator. Uh one of the

292
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:05,920
benefits of the NRO orbit is that it

293
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:07,920
will ensure that we have 100% comm uh at

294
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,079
all times for the crew, which I think is

295
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,160
really important. Um, one of the things

296
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,839
that was very interesting about Apollo,

297
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,839
if you go back and talk to those folks,

298
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,079
how they sweated it when the crew was on

299
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,600
the far side of the moon and how little,

300
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,279
you know, information there was no

301
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,240
information, especially when you're

302
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:26,560
making critical burns like a, you know,

303
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,880
uh, uh, the burn to get back into the

304
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,800
trajectory back to Earth. Um, all

305
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,880
happened on the far side of the moon.

306
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,880
So, Capstone is providing us really

307
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,040
critical information about that orbit

308
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,880
right now to really understand the

309
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,279
dynamics better. I mean we certainly got

310
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,440
the theory. Um we know a lot about the

311
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:45,279
earth's gravitational field from all the

312
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,839
satellites that have been operating

313
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:50,000
here. It's a lot more complex with the

314
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,160
moon and in particular that threebody

315
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,839
dynamics. So that data is going to be

316
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,079
critical because it will help us operate

317
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,760
gateway more efficiently.

318
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,760
And then this year we'll be landing

319
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,639
through the commercial lunar payload

320
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:05,360
services multiple science and technology

321
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:08,160
payloads on the surface of the moon.

322
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,959
many of them to support uh important

323
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:14,320
decal recommendations around science but

324
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:17,279
many also to pave the way for Aremis and

325
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,200
for crude missions uh because we really

326
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,880
want to be doing science and technology

327
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:24,160
with our astronauts on the surface of

328
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:27,360
the moon that's what they do best so um

329
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:29,279
this is uh you know very exciting I

330
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,040
think from my standpoint see the more

331
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:33,519
hardware we can see on the moon as early

332
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,040
as possible that is actually also very

333
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,720
helpful for all of

334
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,560
First of all, it paves the way and helps

335
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,399
us understand what we're going to do.

336
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,000
But I think we can also send a very

337
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,000
different message to all of our

338
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,720
stakeholders, which is we're here to

339
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,000
stay. This isn't just a camping trip,

340
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:52,800
boots on the moon, and return home.

341
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,800
So, I'd like to talk about the moon for

342
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:58,320
a moment. One of the things that we like

343
00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:00,480
to say is 50 years ago, we went to the

344
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,440
moon. So, what's different? Well, first

345
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,680
of all, the moon is different. I talked

346
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,639
about going to the south pole of the

347
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:11,360
moon. So the previous exploration of the

348
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,279
moon was all in the equatorial region

349
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,839
and of course the south pole of the moon

350
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,120
is a very interesting place. Uh the

351
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,360
technology and the science

352
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,199
demonstrations uh that finding out that

353
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,920
in the deeply shadowed regions of the

354
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:26,639
south pole we have the potential to find

355
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:29,440
water. We still don't know how much

356
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,440
exactly or where the optimum places are.

357
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,240
So we really have a lot of work to do

358
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,880
there. But uh it's it's very different

359
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,320
geologically uh and it's a very

360
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,720
different place from any place that

361
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,120
we've ever explored before. Then you add

362
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,880
on to it that we're different. Our

363
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,040
technical capabilities, the things that

364
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,440
we know how to do, the science that we

365
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,920
know how to do and the exploration is

366
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,680
completely different. We have learned so

367
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:57,199
much. I mean, if you look back at the

368
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,959
history of the space shuttle, um, we had

369
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:02,240
the opportunity to fly an orbiting

370
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:04,560
laboratory and also manufacture a space

371
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:07,360
station, repair the Hubble and deploy

372
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,199
it, of course. Uh, but we learned a lot,

373
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,279
but it was a tantalizing amount of

374
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,959
science that we got out of the space

375
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:15,760
shuttle. And if you're going to operate

376
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:17,839
a national lab only about six times a

377
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,680
year for about 10 days to two weeks at a

378
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,000
time, sooner or later you're going to

379
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,600
decide you need more more science, more

380
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,680
data. And that's why we built the

381
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:29,920
International Space Station, so that we

382
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:32,079
could do science 365 days a year. But in

383
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,160
addition to that, we learned how to

384
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:36,160
sustain and support humans and the

385
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,399
science that they are doing for much

386
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,320
longer periods of time. And that is

387
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,880
absolutely critical as we go out into

388
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,560
the solar system. So our capabilities

389
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,440
are not the same. What we have learned

390
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:50,440
is not the same. It is in fact a new

391
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,440
moon.

392
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:56,079
One of the things that I get asked uh a

393
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:58,959
lot is please help those of us who

394
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:01,279
intuitively know why space is important

395
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:03,360
and why space exploration is important.

396
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,279
How do we explain that? How do we

397
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,480
explain that to the average American or

398
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:11,360
or indeed the average citizen of Earth?

399
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:14,639
So um together with our senior leaders

400
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:17,920
at the agency, we put together this why

401
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:21,040
chart and it's the the uh the structure

402
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,959
is around explaining some of that. So

403
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,199
I'll start with science front and center

404
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:27,600
and I think that's critically important.

405
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:30,000
Science is the seed corn for our

406
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,920
technical capabilities of the future. We

407
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,160
all understand that the scientific

408
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,720
research that we do today leads to

409
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:39,120
technological breakthroughs in 10, 20 or

410
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:42,399
even 50 years and that's very very

411
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:45,279
important. So it is the seed corn

412
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:48,639
we can get unique science from space

413
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:51,600
that cannot be done anywhere else. One

414
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:54,560
example of that for great example is the

415
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:57,839
James Webb Space Telescope operating in

416
00:16:54,560 --> 00:17:00,959
frequencies and at levels of sensitivity

417
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,560
not achievable here on earth. Uh there

418
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:05,039
is no way that we could look back in

419
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:07,280
time to just a few hundred million years

420
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:09,199
after the big bang and really understand

421
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:12,400
the formation of the universe without

422
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:14,880
going to space. But in addition to that,

423
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:18,480
especially as we've seen on the shuttle

424
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:21,280
and station is the microgravity uh

425
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,760
science that we do gives us amazing

426
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:26,640
insights into biological and physical

427
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:29,120
sciences. It's extraordinary when you

428
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,280
take gravity out of the equation. The

429
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:34,080
second and third order effects that we

430
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:36,559
have learned that will enable us to do

431
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:39,200
things like have more efficient fluid

432
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:42,559
flow and combustion here on the earth.

433
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:45,440
the insights into the human body. Uh why

434
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:47,919
is it that our astronauts are dehydrated

435
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,000
but they are not subject uh to

436
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:52,640
substantial higher percentages of kidney

437
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,960
stones is a great example of the kind of

438
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,280
critical research that we can only do in

439
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,080
microgravity. And of course there's no

440
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:03,200
way to look at the earth as a system

441
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:05,520
except from space. You simply cannot get

442
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:08,160
enough terrestrial sensors to understand

443
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:10,320
what is happening to our climate. And in

444
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,799
fact 80% of the data that we use to

445
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,480
understand uh climate change and what's

446
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:16,559
happening to the climate comes from

447
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,039
space. If we're going to have a prayer

448
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:21,120
of measuring the impacts of the things

449
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:24,480
we hope to do, we have to do it from

450
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:27,600
space. Science is front and center.

451
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:30,080
Second, national posture. That's uh a

452
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:32,880
big umbrella. uh it can talk about

453
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:35,280
things like uh uh national geopolitical

454
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,600
posture but I think more importantly

455
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:40,080
it's the capabilities of a country to do

456
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,600
science and technology. So I mentioned

457
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,600
Margaret Hamilton and software

458
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,039
engineering. There's multiple other

459
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,840
examples. I think most people are

460
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:50,640
familiar with at least one spin-off uh

461
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:53,200
from NASA the uh the camera in your cell

462
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,919
phone which was developed uh to put a

463
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,440
camera on a chip for earth sensing. Um,

464
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:59,840
there are so many examples. There are

465
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,760
countless examples. But the point being,

466
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:04,160
as President Kennedy said so many years

467
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,799
ago, the point is to do it because it's

468
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,720
hard. And so when we do hard things, we

469
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:11,280
lift the technical and scientific

470
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:14,400
capability of our country to attack

471
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:17,039
multiple problems. And increasingly with

472
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,760
a growing commercial space industry, the

473
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:22,880
economic impact is significant. This is

474
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:24,640
a high-tech, high- growth industry. And

475
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,400
all around the world, countries are

476
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,480
starting space agencies because they

477
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,600
don't want to get left behind on the

478
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:34,160
impact of space. And in fact, space is

479
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:36,480
impacting so many other industries now.

480
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,080
Agriculture, maritime, homeland

481
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,039
security.

482
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,960
I often speculate that uh 35 years ago

483
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,799
there were a lot of people saying, well,

484
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,440
what is this internet thing and will it

485
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:50,000
really have an impact on my industry? Uh

486
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,520
I think in 30 years we we will not be

487
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,039
asking a question about what the

488
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,880
relevance of space is to other

489
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:57,440
industries.

490
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,840
And finally inspiration. It's the way

491
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,679
you feel when you see that picture from

492
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,480
the James Webb Space Telescope or the

493
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:06,799
Hubble Space Telescope. But importantly

494
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,200
this is attacking the other issue our

495
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:11,200
other seed corn issue which is the

496
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,320
pipeline of STEM students for the

497
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,880
future. Space really plays a unique role

498
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:19,039
in inspiring people, making them think

499
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,919
about their place in the universe, but

500
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:24,080
also providing excitement and relevance

501
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:27,360
for problems of the future that focus

502
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:29,200
students on investing in STEM. So these

503
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:32,480
are the three buckets, if you will, that

504
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:34,640
I think are absolutely critical. So uh

505
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,960
when administrator Nelson and I came to

506
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,400
the agency, I was spending a lot of time

507
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,960
thinking about our moon to Mars

508
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,960
strategy. And maybe it's because I was a

509
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,440
physics major, but to me, these are our

510
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,280
first principles. Anything we build in a

511
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,080
strategy has to address all three of

512
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:52,320
these areas. And the reason is that as I

513
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,240
go around the world, I often meet people

514
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,679
who only care about one or two of those

515
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,320
buckets. They don't care about all

516
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:00,080
three. Some do. Uh what that means

517
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,559
though is that if we don't have a

518
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:05,120
strategy that addresses all three areas,

519
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:06,880
we are missing key stakeholders. And if

520
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,200
you want a politically resilient

521
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,280
approach to human space flight and

522
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,360
exploration for the future, you're going

523
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:17,360
to have to hit all three of these things

524
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:20,559
and stay laser focused on it.

525
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,640
So, uh you may have heard a lot of

526
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:25,840
arguments, maybe you've uh proposed them

527
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:28,880
and I'm happy to discuss them and um

528
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:31,200
that has to do with uh you know what are

529
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,520
we doing? So there's um you hear all

530
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,960
kinds of things like well we should be

531
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,120
just doing science and we should be

532
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:40,480
doing it all robotically that that's you

533
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:43,120
know more cost-effective. Uh I've also

534
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:45,520
heard you know why do we need gateway?

535
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:49,679
Uh why are why don't we just go to Mars

536
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:52,159
first etc etc. Well, um, we don't have a

537
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:54,640
decal survey for human space flight the

538
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:57,039
way science does where you gather input

539
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,760
from the broadest set of communities

540
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:01,440
about what what it is that needs what

541
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:04,080
are the critical science questions that

542
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:06,720
need to be resolved. So when I came to

543
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:09,200
the agency, I brought us all together.

544
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,960
Um, I found an organization that was

545
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,960
made up of the highest technical leaders

546
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,039
called the federated board and said,

547
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,880
"Okay, we've done a lot of work on this.

548
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:20,080
we we actually know what we need to do

549
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:22,000
to get to Mars. Um let's talk about it.

550
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:24,000
What capabilities do we actually need to

551
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,760
develop? And by the way, what are we

552
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:30,240
actually trying to do? So um this is the

553
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,400
challenge that I gave the team. I said,

554
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,480
I want us to create a blueprint for

555
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:38,320
sustained human presence and exploration

556
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:40,640
throughout the solar system.

557
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,480
It's really important. I think if you

558
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,520
ask the average American, what is the

559
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,360
job of NASA? That would be it. This is

560
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:50,159
what we've all been waiting for, right?

561
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:53,679
We've got to figure this out and we need

562
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:56,000
to develop that blueprint by practicing

563
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:59,039
it on the moon so that we can then go

564
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,000
demonstrated on Mars and then go on to

565
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:04,000
the next destination after that. So

566
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,280
every single word in that statement

567
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:11,280
means something very important. Uh I'll

568
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:13,760
start out with talking about science. So

569
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:18,159
sustained human presence, why is that

570
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:21,440
important? Well, as we uh have learned

571
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:24,159
from the space station, having science

572
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,240
247 is actually the best way to get your

573
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:28,880
return on investment.

574
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:31,919
So, it's okay if we're going to go to

575
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:34,559
the moon, it's a three-day trip or so,

576
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,559
maybe maybe a week, spend 30 days doing

577
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:38,480
science, and then three days coming

578
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:41,039
home. That's actually not a bad return

579
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:44,080
on investment. Anywhere else in the

580
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:47,520
solar system, the numbers get really bad

581
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:50,400
really fast. So, even Mars, at the best

582
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:52,720
that we can hope for, six months there,

583
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,640
30-day stay, probably about a nine month

584
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,760
trip home, you're kind of looking at a

585
00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:00,000
two-year trip for 30 days of science.

586
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,159
Now, that's okay for a test flight, but

587
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,799
that's not actually how we are going to

588
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:07,440
get the maximum science return. So we

589
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:09,679
really need to think about how to get a

590
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,520
sustained presence and we need to be

591
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:14,799
incorporating science from the very

592
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:16,880
beginning. The extraordinary knowledge

593
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:19,360
that we gained from the samples of the

594
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,360
moon uh that our Apollo astronauts

595
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,600
returned that was not the original

596
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:26,799
purpose of that program. It was just to

597
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,880
go and come back. But it was incredible.

598
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,799
I mean, those those samples are

599
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,400
unbelievable in what they've taught us

600
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:34,080
about the history of the Earth, the

601
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,960
history of the moon, and the history of

602
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,720
the solar system. So, we really need to

603
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,120
be incorporating science front and

604
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,960
center. And I'm really excited to say

605
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,640
that everyone is on board with that, and

606
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,960
we're making significant progress in

607
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:49,200
that area.

608
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,039
Transportation and habitation, that's

609
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,360
the one we've made all that progress on

610
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:55,120
in the last 10 years. Uh, but we have a

611
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,200
lot more to go. We need to be looking at

612
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,520
transportation systems on the surface of

613
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,440
the moon. Uh when I talk about

614
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:03,679
maximizing science return, one of my

615
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,360
favorite statistics is actually not that

616
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:08,720
long ago, I think it was about four or

617
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:11,120
five months ago, the the all of the the

618
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:15,360
sum total of the distance traveled by

619
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:18,320
all the rovers on Mars finally exceeded

620
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:21,279
the last four missions of Apollo. So

621
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:23,600
finally after 25 years and those those

622
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:26,799
four short missions to the moon when you

623
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:30,000
send humans they bring transportation

624
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:33,520
they bring a lot of power and they bring

625
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,679
this your brain. So we can get a lot

626
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,679
more science by using human machine

627
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:40,640
teameming but they have to have the

628
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:44,240
ability to get there and to stay alive

629
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:46,640
and to be uh transported around

630
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:49,279
infrastructure. So my point about humans

631
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:51,520
doing science in space long term, we

632
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:54,159
have to develop the human infrastructure

633
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:57,200
to support humans to stay for longer

634
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:59,039
durations in deep space. NASA needs

635
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,960
that. If we're going to get the science

636
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:03,120
return on investment, we have to have

637
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,760
the communications backbone. We have to

638
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:08,080
have the power. We have to have landing

639
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:10,559
sites. We have to have all of the things

640
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:14,159
that support humans for a long period of

641
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:16,320
time. But excitingly here on Earth,

642
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:18,640
infrastructure enables new business

643
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,919
models. We see that every day. It's not

644
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,279
just roads, our aircraft system. Uh in

645
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:24,720
addition to that, of course, the

646
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:27,120
internet is a key piece of

647
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,520
infrastructure, our power grids, all of

648
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:32,240
those things enable the business models

649
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:34,559
around us. So if we make the investments

650
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,640
in demonstrating scalable and

651
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:39,840
cost-effective infrastructure to support

652
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:42,480
humans, we know the economic business

653
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:44,720
will follow us.

654
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:47,440
And finally, operations. Greatly

655
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:50,080
overlooked, not by me as an operator. I

656
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,760
lived through the transition between uh

657
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:55,039
operating the space shuttle for short

658
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:56,559
duration missions and the transition to

659
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:58,799
long duration missions on the

660
00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:01,279
international space station. Very very

661
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:03,679
very different. We had a lot of things

662
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:06,480
to learn about human health and

663
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:08,640
performance and how to optimize our

664
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,640
operations. We're going to have to start

665
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,480
all over from scratch doing science on

666
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,400
the on the surface of another celestial

667
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,919
body. We have much to learn in

668
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,080
operations.

669
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:20,799
So when I challenged the federated

670
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:22,880
board, they brought together a set of

671
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:25,600
objectives in these four different

672
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:28,640
buckets. They said, "What do we need to

673
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:31,440
learn, understand, and prove to be ready

674
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,760
to go to Mars?" So, I think it's really

675
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:36,320
important to see that this actually

676
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:39,200
transcends a lot of the arguments in a

677
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:41,919
lot of ways. We can show that we have a

678
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:45,919
very clear path from the moon to Mars as

679
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:47,520
a result of these objectives.

680
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,559
Just like to talk for a moment about

681
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:53,440
science and human machine teameing. Um

682
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:56,080
to me this is actually uh a very very

683
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,159
exciting new technology area. I've been

684
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:00,880
interested in it since I worked at DARPA

685
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:03,039
and even before uh the concept that we

686
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:06,480
are actually going to maximize the

687
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:08,880
capability of our to do exploration but

688
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,480
also to do science by the right

689
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,000
optimization

690
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,760
and uh you know we all know what

691
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
machines are good at and we also know

692
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:18,080
what humans are good at. Probably the

693
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,240
toughest technical problem of all is

694
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:22,480
figuring out how to partner them and how

695
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:25,039
to create an architecture that actually

696
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,880
leverages the capabilities. I think we

697
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:29,440
just barely scratched the surface, but

698
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,760
it was very exciting for me in the last

699
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,919
planetary decal where they proposed a

700
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:36,960
mission with a a little rover on the

701
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:39,520
surface of the moon going around uh

702
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,520
crater a crater on the south pole and

703
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:44,559
picking up geological samples from

704
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:47,120
multiple areas that we know from uh from

705
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:49,200
remote sensing um have very interesting

706
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:51,840
geological properties and then

707
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,240
delivering them to the crew for return.

708
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:56,799
Now, the astronaut crew said, "Wait,

709
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,159
we're scientists, too." So, uh, one of

710
00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:01,039
the things that I think we need to look

711
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:03,279
at is how to maximize the human element

712
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:05,600
as well. I mean, it's great. Let's get

713
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:08,399
10 times as many samples as we actually

714
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:11,360
have room to come home and then give our

715
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:14,240
astronauts handheld tools. Um, maybe

716
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:16,559
they'll be using a helmet visor uh

717
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:19,039
eventually on Mars, maybe with operating

718
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:21,760
a helicopter for remote sensing as well.

719
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:24,960
But the idea being that uh we can use

720
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:28,000
humans to select the right sample. So I

721
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:30,640
have this dream that there's a scientist

722
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,679
uh looking through the helmet visor uh

723
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:37,039
looking at the samples with handheld uh

724
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:38,480
uh you know mass spectrograph and etc.

725
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:39,919
And then everybody in the back room

726
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,840
jumping up and down and saying bring

727
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:44,640
home number seven. That's the sample we

728
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:47,200
want. So I really think we can we can

729
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,960
learn how to maximize science by

730
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:52,720
efficiently understanding how to do

731
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:55,039
human machine teameing.

732
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,679
So I want to make the point that it's to

733
00:29:55,039 --> 00:30:00,640
me that's very important which is that

734
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:03,600
uh this moon to strategy that we've been

735
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:07,279
working on is really really aimed at

736
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:10,159
trying to figure out how to maximize the

737
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:12,480
crossover. Now it is true that Mars is a

738
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:15,440
very different destination but I think

739
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:18,080
my point is everywhere is going to be a

740
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:20,559
unique destination in the solar system.

741
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:24,080
Instead we need to develop a framework

742
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:26,960
this blueprint for how do we do this?

743
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:29,279
What order do we do things in? How do we

744
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,360
efficiently figure out how to operate

745
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:34,159
those things? We can work the technical

746
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:36,000
differences between the moon and Mars.

747
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:37,360
that's perfectly okay because we're

748
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,840
going to have to do that at every

749
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:41,679
destination we go to. It's having this

750
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:45,440
overarching framework that is so

751
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:47,919
important. So this moon to Mars strategy

752
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:50,399
has been done in consultation with

753
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:52,960
industry uh with our international

754
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:55,120
partners. We held workshops last year.

755
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,600
Uh we had a public comment period. I

756
00:30:55,120 --> 00:31:00,240
hope some of you contributed to that.

757
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:02,480
Um, and I'm excited that um, at the

758
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,720
National Space Symposium, we will be

759
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:07,679
rolling out the results of our first

760
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:09,440
architecture concept review. Now, I'm

761
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:11,679
going to set expectations here with

762
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,440
regards to that. A lot of this was

763
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,919
actually a bringing about the whole

764
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:18,559
agency together, all of the mission

765
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:21,200
directorates to talk about this moon to

766
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:23,039
strategy and what we what needs to be in

767
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,039
the architecture.

768
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:27,440
We think that the objectives will be

769
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:29,919
enduring. We will certainly review them

770
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,760
as we learn new things. But what won't

771
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:34,240
be enduring is the state of the

772
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:37,279
architecture. The architecture will have

773
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:40,080
to evolve as we have new technologies

774
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:42,720
and new learning. We know that some

775
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:44,480
technology will not work as well as we

776
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:47,039
hope that it did. There will be new

777
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:49,039
capabilities that come online. And so

778
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:51,519
every year we plan to have an

779
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:54,159
architecture concept review and then we

780
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:56,799
will have a public consultation period

781
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:58,399
to go through and have inputs. In

782
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:00,399
particular, one of the ways that we're

783
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:02,159
communicating is there will be a series

784
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:04,480
of white papers that talk about the

785
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:06,960
trades because I hear this all the time.

786
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:09,200
Well, I did the math and the delta V for

787
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,519
this and so forth. This is a systems

788
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,760
engineering problem. So every single

789
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:16,480
element of the architecture has massive

790
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:17,760
trades involved in behind it. But we

791
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,600
need to do a better job about

792
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:22,080
communicating that especially with our

793
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:24,480
technical community who can identify the

794
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:27,039
flaws in our trades or remind us about

795
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:29,600
new technologies, show us new ways of

796
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:31,440
doing business. So I think that's the

797
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:34,080
critical difference. We we have been

798
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:36,080
talking about this technical um

799
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:38,159
activities trying to get to Mars for a

800
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,840
very very long time. I think what's

801
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,640
really different about the moon tomorrow

802
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:44,720
strategy that we have now is uh that

803
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:47,039
it's trying to bring across all of our

804
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:50,080
stakeholders. We're trying to focus on

805
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:52,559
science, national technical capability

806
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:54,480
and of course inspiration which the

807
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:56,320
great thing is that that comes with that

808
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,240
especially when you're sending humans

809
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,720
but also when you're doing worldclass

810
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:03,120
amazing science as we have seen with all

811
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:06,399
the things that we're doing.

812
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:08,159
So, we um don't know and we won't know

813
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:10,399
if this is a politically resilient

814
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:11,840
approach. Uh but I think it's really

815
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:14,080
important to bring the whole community

816
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:16,240
along to make sure that all stakeholders

817
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:18,559
are consulted. It's really important

818
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:21,600
that you participate and uh keep track

819
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:23,679
of this. I want to hear your good ideas.

820
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:26,080
Uh we will be rolling out what that

821
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:27,440
consultation process looks like. I'll

822
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,279
let you know this one is going to be

823
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:32,799
really tight this year. And the reason

824
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:34,960
why is we made the decision uh to try to

825
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:37,279
work on a process for this architecture

826
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:40,240
concept review and then rolling out the

827
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:42,399
the stakeholder reviews uh discuss the

828
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,320
architecture and then start into the

829
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:47,039
next rev. We need to get it aligned with

830
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:49,039
the budget cycle. So our next ACR is

831
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:52,320
going to be in November so that it will

832
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:54,080
inform the ne the following budget cycle

833
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,519
which is really helpful but there's not

834
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,120
a lot of time till November because it

835
00:33:55,519 --> 00:34:01,200
took us a lot of time to get to this

836
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:03,120
first uh architecture. So um I think I

837
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,519
think we'll see a better cadence going

838
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:07,039
forward. Uh but I just want you to keep

839
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,480
your eyes open for that because we

840
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:11,119
really care and we want you to

841
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:13,200
participate in it. Uh I think uh we have

842
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:15,599
to find a way to bring new ideas in

843
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:18,000
faster.

844
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:20,079
So with that uh that was what I wanted

845
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,280
to focus on today was to talk about our

846
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:24,879
moon tomorrow strategy. Uh but I'm very

847
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:28,359
happy to take your questions on anything

848
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:28,359
you want to ask.

849
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:38,560
So we have a microphone that will move

850
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:40,480
around here with for questions from the

851
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:42,879
audience and there are also people

852
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:45,119
online who are asking questions. So

853
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:49,320
great. So, okay. So, let's start. Does

854
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:49,320
have anybody here who has any questions?

855
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:56,000
>> Hey, Pam. Uh, excellent talk. Uh, so my

856
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,520
name is Eric and I work in the

857
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,200
mechanical engineering department and

858
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,960
I'm sure a lot of us here are working on

859
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,200
really exciting, you know, new projects

860
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,800
that are hopefully aligned with Artemis

861
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,480
and some of these future missions.

862
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,800
>> And one of the questions I had had to do

863
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:11,200
with um, a lot of our technologies are

864
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,320
probably like low TRL. Um, and you just

865
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,760
talked about how we're trying to

866
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,760
accelerate or bring, you know,

867
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,359
technologies quicker into these space

868
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:20,160
missions. Could you go into a little bit

869
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:23,200
more detail about what NASA is trying to

870
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:24,880
plan to do in order to, I guess you

871
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,800
could say, alleviate some of the red

872
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:29,760
tape from a technology perspective?

873
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:32,880
>> Yeah. Oh, it's worse than red tape, my

874
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:36,000
friend. Um

875
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:38,640
so it was very instructive for me to

876
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,720
work at DARPA for four years because uh

877
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:43,520
we used to say technology transition is

878
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:46,240
a combat sport and it is indeed there's

879
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:48,079
huge barriers to technology transition

880
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:52,880
and often they are not actually about

881
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:55,359
the technology. Uh we I think I'm really

882
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:58,720
glad that uh the space technology

883
00:35:55,359 --> 00:36:00,720
mission directorate was formed um in the

884
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:02,720
uh Obama administration. Actually, Dava,

885
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,480
where is Dava? Yeah, there she is. Thank

886
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:07,359
you, Dava.

887
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:10,480
Um because having our own technology

888
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:12,320
development organization inside NASA

889
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:15,280
theoretically makes tech transfer

890
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:16,960
easier. theoretically uh even even in

891
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,119
the science mission directorate which

892
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,440
does tech development for science

893
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:25,119
missions it is still incredibly

894
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:27,040
challenging so uh for for me a key part

895
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:28,800
was actually to bring the agency

896
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:31,599
technical leadership together to have

897
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,520
that discussion you can understand the

898
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:36,160
operational perspective of don't don't

899
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:39,680
don't give me that right I'm trying to

900
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:41,920
keep my astronauts alive so uh I think

901
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,680
uh we are just in the first stages of

902
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,760
really trying to figure out and get

903
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:49,839
people used to the idea we need to do a

904
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:52,000
lot more techdev and um you know I

905
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:53,520
really really interesting discussions

906
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,839
actually with some of the stakeholders

907
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,920
for example around nuclear propulsion in

908
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:59,760
space well you don't need a Mars

909
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,480
transport vehicle until the next decade

910
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:04,480
why are you doing that now well because

911
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,800
we have to do the development

912
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,560
demonstration programs so that we can do

913
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,240
an analysis of alternatives and have

914
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,560
enough information this is something

915
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:14,240
that DoD does really well they they

916
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:16,560
really understand that that pipeline has

917
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:19,520
to exist I think because especially in

918
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:21,760
human space flight the scale uh is so

919
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:25,119
long that I don't think this is a part

920
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:27,760
of our DNA yet. Um, so the, you know, I

921
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:29,440
think the big, uh, area that the

922
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:33,359
administrator and I feel very strongly

923
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:35,599
about is to grow STMD's budget because

924
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:38,079
they are where all of that tech

925
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:40,240
development needs to be. And I'm pushing

926
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:44,240
them to make sure that at least 10% of

927
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:45,760
their portfolio is very low TRL. So

928
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,599
that's just kind of a best practice

929
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:50,960
across the federal government that you

930
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:54,880
have to have the uh tech investments in

931
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:56,880
the very low TRL things and about 10% is

932
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:59,359
about right because they tend to be lab

933
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,680
demonstrations and then you need to have

934
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:03,680
uh the money to take it to a TRL6

935
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,839
demonstration. So I don't know if that

936
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:07,280
helps answer your question about what is

937
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:08,800
that strategy.

938
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,400
>> Great. Thank you. So do we have any

939
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:13,440
online questions?

940
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:16,760
>> No. Okay,

941
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,760
over there.

942
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,240
>> Hi Pam, nice to speak to you again. Uh,

943
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:23,359
for those who don't know, my name is

944
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:25,599
Justin Chio. I am a uh aereroastro

945
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:27,680
undergraduate senior. Uh, and what I

946
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:30,880
want to know is has NASA taken into

947
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:32,079
consideration um what they are going to

948
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:35,040
do and how we're going to have an

949
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:36,880
improve a better architecture given the

950
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,839
limiting factors of the launch rate of

951
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,280
SLS

952
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:41,280
>> given that we're can only send four

953
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:43,040
astronauts per year. Yeah, thanks

954
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,680
Justin. I think one of the things that's

955
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:49,119
really interesting about um coming into

956
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:52,079
the agency is realizing that um we

957
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:55,119
actually are have almost no capability

958
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:56,960
to change anything in the next three

959
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:58,480
years. What you're really doing is

960
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,480
you're setting yourself up for the next

961
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,400
decade. And so I hopefully you saw that

962
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,920
out of the moon to Mars strategy. And

963
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,720
the same thing is true of the budget

964
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:10,960
cycle. I mean, we just, you know, got

965
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:12,560
our 2024 budget um that is not even

966
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:15,599
approved yet. It's just the president's

967
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:17,359
budget out on the street. So, uh you

968
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:19,839
know, we have the vehicle. We're focused

969
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:22,079
right now on getting the flight rate up

970
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:25,040
uh to a cadence of once a year. We think

971
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:27,280
that's absolutely critical uh both for

972
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:29,359
technical u making technical progress,

973
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,520
but also for political resiliency as

974
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:33,440
well. So, that's our the focus of our

975
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:37,680
area. We're restructuring the contract

976
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:39,520
for SLS right now. Um, interestingly,

977
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:42,560
uh, we do think that there are other

978
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,680
customers. DoD wanted no part of SLS

979
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:46,160
because they were afraid they were going

980
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:48,480
to get asked for, um, money.

981
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:51,119
>> Yeah. So, you know that, right? On the

982
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:53,119
other hand, they're quite interested in

983
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:57,119
having access to the capability once

984
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:59,359
developed. So uh what we are hoping is

985
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:01,520
that that will enable us to make some

986
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:03,760
investments in infrastructure and

987
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:06,400
potentially theoretically it's possible

988
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:08,160
to launch three a year theoretically. Uh

989
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,960
it could it will take a while to get

990
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:12,640
there and we'll need the the customer

991
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:15,280
additional customers to make sure that

992
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:18,079
that happens but we uh are working right

993
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:21,040
now with industry to hand over SLS to

994
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:24,400
become a service. Right now there is no

995
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:27,119
mechanism for DoD to use SLS because

996
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:29,760
it's 100% NASA owned in the way it's

997
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:32,320
structured. So having it spun off as a

998
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,800
commercial service capability we hope

999
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:38,079
will enable us to to do that more cost-e

1000
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:40,560
effectively. And of course I think um

1001
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:44,320
you know new technologies uh are

1002
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:46,720
certainly out there. I personally don't

1003
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:48,480
think there's anything that well I mean

1004
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,240
it's ridiculous. We put a huge amount of

1005
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,680
investment in it and we've proven that

1006
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,760
it's capable and we're going to launch a

1007
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:56,880
crew on it. Nothing else close to that

1008
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:59,359
yet. So I think uh but you know as it

1009
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,920
happens we'll have a concept review once

1010
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:02,960
a year and hopefully new ideas will come

1011
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,280
forward.

1012
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:07,480
>> Okay.

1013
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:07,480
>> Yeah, there was a question back there.

1014
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:13,040
>> Uh thank you. Um my name is Dan and I'm

1015
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,480
a a graduate researcher at astroy and I

1016
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,960
wanted to thank you first of all for

1017
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:19,280
this um inspiring lecture. My question

1018
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:21,280
relates to your chart on the why and

1019
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,680
benefits to humanity, which is a

1020
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,520
question I often ask myself. I'm curious

1021
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,359
how you see the exploitation of space

1022
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:30,240
research and microgravity research over

1023
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:32,000
the coming decade considering that by

1024
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,920
2030 the ISS is meant to be

1025
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,400
decommissioned and Lunar Gateway is

1026
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,920
going to be significantly smaller. So I

1027
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,920
wonder how you see that sort of

1028
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,839
industrial exploitation of microgravity

1029
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,760
manufacturing and research.

1030
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:46,240
I really didn't pay him to ask that

1031
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:47,760
question, but I'm super glad you asked.

1032
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,440
Um, that's one of the other things that

1033
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:52,079
we're spending a lot of our energy on

1034
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:54,160
right now. Um, so this is something that

1035
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:56,160
just isn't widely known. So, thank you

1036
00:41:54,160 --> 00:42:00,079
for the opportunity to talk about it. We

1037
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:03,200
are in the second decal research uh

1038
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:04,960
effort or decal uh study program for

1039
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:08,079
biological and physical sciences in

1040
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:11,200
microgravity. So that kind of comes as a

1041
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:13,200
surprise to a lot of people um how how

1042
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:16,319
really focused we are on that science.

1043
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:19,280
We are actually just really hitting our

1044
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:20,640
stride in the science on ISS and what's

1045
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:23,040
coming from it and some of the

1046
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:24,880
industrial research that's going on as

1047
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,640
well which you don't hear as much about

1048
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:29,680
because it's proprietary and trade

1049
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:33,040
secret. Um but extraordinary work. So,

1050
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:36,480
we're very confident uh that

1051
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:38,480
microgravity research has a long place

1052
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:41,280
that there's a lot more work to be done

1053
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:43,920
and we're just really beginning to to

1054
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:46,319
get a hold of that. So, ISS has been

1055
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,880
extended through 2030, but we're working

1056
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:51,359
with four companies right now for a

1057
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:54,000
commercial LEO destination. So, I have

1058
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:56,000
to say ISS was amazing. I mean, I helped

1059
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,960
build it, but we didn't know what we

1060
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,760
were doing. We took our best guess and

1061
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:03,359
it was a prototype space station and a

1062
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,599
lot of the technical capabilities on

1063
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:07,599
station are amazing and we use them over

1064
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:09,839
and over and wish we'd done like 10

1065
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:11,440
times more of it. And then there are

1066
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:13,599
things that just didn't work the way we

1067
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:16,240
thought they were going to. So, we've

1068
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:17,920
learned a lot and I think our focus

1069
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:20,319
right now is working with those four

1070
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:22,000
companies to transition that knowledge

1071
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:24,560
and they're out there trying to raise

1072
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,160
capital and we're raising some in uh

1073
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:28,800
we're getting some investment money as

1074
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:31,440
well uh to put into their activities to

1075
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:33,200
help them prepare for commercial LEO

1076
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:35,920
destinations.

1077
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:37,920
I personally think that Gateway is not

1078
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:40,400
an ideal place for microgravity

1079
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:43,200
research. It's a deep space research

1080
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:45,920
location, right? things beyond low Earth

1081
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:48,560
orbit. So microgravity you can get

1082
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:50,560
pretty close to home. Uh the deep space

1083
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:52,000
is is much harder to get. We should

1084
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:54,560
really be focused on the kind of

1085
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:57,599
research that can only be done in deep

1086
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:59,920
space and supports us going to Mars with

1087
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:01,680
humans uh forward in the future on

1088
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,599
gateway and that's why it's going to be

1089
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:07,640
much smaller.

1090
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:07,640
>> Yeah, a question here.

1091
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:11,599
>> Hi Pam, thank you for the talk. My name

1092
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:13,680
is Evan Kramer. I'm a third-year

1093
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:16,400
graduate student in the department

1094
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:20,160
astro. My question is uh in terms of

1095
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:22,079
Mars sample return. Um I'm curious about

1096
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:24,480
your perspective of the importance of

1097
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:27,359
simultaneously developing Mars

1098
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:30,560
technology TRLs while also trying to

1099
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:33,280
focus on lunar exploration and what

1100
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:35,839
efforts are happening to make sure that

1101
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:38,640
TRL development for Mars exploration is

1102
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:40,720
feeding into TRL development for moon

1103
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:43,040
exploration.

1104
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:45,440
>> Yeah, that's a complicated question. as

1105
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:48,079
I pointed out you know that the previous

1106
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:49,680
chart that I had uh there are there are

1107
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:52,079
differences and there are strong

1108
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:53,599
similarities uh particularly around

1109
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:56,079
infrastructure

1110
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:58,319
uh I think you know the ISRU is going to

1111
00:44:56,079 --> 00:45:01,200
be its own thing uh having said that

1112
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:03,040
there's you know the foundations of ISRU

1113
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:05,280
is actually power I mean it is

1114
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:08,640
staggering how much power is needed for

1115
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:11,280
ISRU so when I look at as a a techdev

1116
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:14,560
effort I mean humans you know we're

1117
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:19,359
operating space station on 110 kilowatt

1118
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:22,319
uh ISRU 2 to 5 megaww. So a very very

1119
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:24,720
very challenging problem uh by

1120
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:27,280
comparison. So uh a lot of that

1121
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:30,720
foundational work is going to apply in

1122
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:32,960
both cases. Um and you know I I look at

1123
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:34,079
it and say without the power we're not

1124
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:36,560
going to get any of those tech

1125
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:39,760
demonstrations done or have any of those

1126
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:41,680
those capabilities. So for for the near

1127
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:43,359
term anyway, especially with our limited

1128
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:45,280
budget, we're focused on those really

1129
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:48,240
big rocks, which most of them you see

1130
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:50,079
here. Without those things, uh we won't

1131
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:52,640
have the other capabilities that we

1132
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:54,960
need. It is very interesting. You may

1133
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:56,880
have seen that um the science mission

1134
00:45:54,960 --> 00:46:00,079
directorate recently released a draft

1135
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:01,440
strategy for Mars exploration. So we

1136
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:04,560
went through a very interesting

1137
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:06,800
discussion about their Mars uh strategy

1138
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:08,880
and the moon to Mars strategy and how

1139
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:11,200
they feed together. The linkage is

1140
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,800
really around the decal survey which

1141
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:15,359
really drives the science mission

1142
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:17,760
directorate. Um moon to Mars is very

1143
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:19,680
challenging because it's beyond a decade

1144
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:21,760
and so that was actually part of what

1145
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:24,160
motivated them to look beyond a decade

1146
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:26,960
for their strategy. So we really see

1147
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:30,000
these two streams converging. Uh I think

1148
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:32,800
the Mars sample return is critical to us

1149
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:35,760
because it will guide where we plan to

1150
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:37,520
send humans I think on Mars. So there

1151
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:40,319
there is a lot of discussion in the

1152
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:42,079
agency about how to converge our science

1153
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:44,720
strategy with the human spaceflight

1154
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:46,319
strategy. I hope that helps.

1155
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,839
>> We have any online questions?

1156
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:49,839
>> Yes, I was just going to say we have an

1157
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:51,440
online question who's wondering if the

1158
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:53,520
architecture review process will

1159
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:56,000
eventually be applied to other aspects

1160
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:57,920
of NASA. Um, for example, aviation

1161
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,560
concepts that may benefit from further

1162
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:03,760
transparency and development.

1163
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:05,280
>> Boy, if I had a nickel for every time

1164
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,839
somebody said, "We love your moon to Mar

1165
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:09,680
strategy. Do it for everything." And uh,

1166
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:12,079
all I can say is that it took like a

1167
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:15,200
100% of my time and energy over the last

1168
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:17,760
two years to get here. It's exciting to

1169
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:20,480
have the validation of the process. I

1170
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:22,079
think the key elements to it are around

1171
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:25,119
communications

1172
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:27,359
uh around bringing um unity of purpose

1173
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:30,720
inside the agency but also in the

1174
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:34,000
broader uh tech community and um you

1175
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:37,920
know strategy development is uh a unique

1176
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:39,520
thing um there's a lot of actually great

1177
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:42,079
if there's anybody who also has a

1178
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:44,240
business degree you you you know that um

1179
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:46,000
I see many strategies quote unquote

1180
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:48,640
strategies that are lists of good things

1181
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:51,599
to do that is not a strategy. That's not

1182
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:54,560
how it works. So, um I do think that

1183
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:56,640
that uh strategic thinking approach is

1184
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:59,440
critically important. I have to say I am

1185
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:01,440
pretty happy uh and I'm very picky about

1186
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:04,079
this with our tech strategy and both

1187
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:06,640
STMD and aeronautics. What I'm not as

1188
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:09,520
happy about I think that got brought out

1189
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:11,119
is how well we communicate about it. So,

1190
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:12,720
one of the things that aeronautics is

1191
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:15,760
doing that I really like is building a

1192
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:18,240
community of practice around advanced

1193
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:21,280
air mobility and uh through the

1194
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:24,160
workshops, the roundts and that kind of

1195
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:26,720
consultation. I think um we're beginning

1196
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:29,119
to see a lot more of that transparency,

1197
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:30,640
we're going to extend that out for all

1198
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:33,440
the tremendous work that we're doing

1199
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:35,680
around decarbonizing aviation in

1200
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:38,240
aeronautics as well. But it is

1201
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:40,079
interesting. Um, for those of you who

1202
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:42,160
are engineers, talking about

1203
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:44,000
communications is usually not the top of

1204
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:47,200
their list, but it's actually really,

1205
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,640
really important.

1206
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:50,000
>> Actually, you know, we do have a

1207
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,800
communications requirement for

1208
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,359
undergraduates.

1209
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,720
>> Glad to hear it.

1210
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:54,240
>> Precisely so they can communicate.

1211
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:56,160
>> Well, your your pitchfest showed that

1212
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:58,559
it's working. So,

1213
00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:01,960
>> any other questions?

1214
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:01,960
>> We have a cover.

1215
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:09,640
Can you raise your number? All the way

1216
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,640
over there.

1217
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:18,720
>> Thank you so much for your talk. Uh my

1218
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:21,200
name is Clara and I'm an exchange

1219
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:23,680
student from Imperial College London.

1220
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:26,240
And so you touched upon a lot of

1221
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:28,480
interesting topics. Uh my question

1222
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:31,599
pertains to the fact that there's a

1223
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:34,640
growing competition of a what I would

1224
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:37,520
say is like a dwidening set of mineral

1225
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:40,079
resources out there. I mean I think uh

1226
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:43,119
the semiconductor industry is pretty

1227
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:45,680
symptomatic of that and all of this is

1228
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:48,640
happening against an increasingly

1229
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:51,280
unfavorable political backdrop. And so

1230
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:53,920
what I wanted to know is how is that

1231
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:55,839
impacting design decisions considering

1232
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:58,559
that pretty much every single space

1233
00:49:55,839 --> 00:50:00,480
project is really a long-term project.

1234
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:03,040
You talked that you said that moon to

1235
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:07,040
Mars was basically beyond a decade. So a

1236
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:08,880
lot happens in 10 years and yeah

1237
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:12,640
basically how is that getting factored

1238
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:14,319
into I guess the strategy overall? Yeah,

1239
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:17,520
I think the short answer is that it's

1240
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:21,040
not. Um, I would say, you know, my sense

1241
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:22,559
of the aerrow uh aerospace industry

1242
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:25,280
large

1243
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:27,359
uh as you know, electronics in

1244
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:29,200
particular are an area that is typically

1245
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:31,200
four generations behind what we use

1246
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:34,240
terrestrially uh because of the

1247
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:36,400
requirements for uh radiation

1248
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:40,319
uh tolerance and exposure and uh

1249
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:42,480
qualification. So I think um the way

1250
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:45,680
we're addressing this issue inside NASA

1251
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:49,040
is really driven more by uh I would say

1252
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:53,359
the larger issue of global supply chain.

1253
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:55,440
So um you know what I discovered when I

1254
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:58,240
came to NASA is that we had different

1255
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:00,480
people thinking about supply chain. So

1256
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:03,359
we had the engineering organization

1257
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:06,559
looking at from a like a quality risk

1258
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:08,720
standpoint. Safety had their own lens.

1259
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:11,839
uh the same thing around counterfeit

1260
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:14,400
parts and things like that. Um I don't

1261
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:17,760
think we had a very consistent approach

1262
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:20,400
from a procurement standpoint. So uh we

1263
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:22,880
formed uh an informal supply chain

1264
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:24,400
working group just to enable awareness

1265
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:27,359
of all the different things that were

1266
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:29,280
happening at NASA around this and we're

1267
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:32,480
also strengthening our relationships

1268
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:34,319
with DoD. Uh interestingly DoD has

1269
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:36,160
different supply chain issues than we

1270
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:38,880
do. they tend to buy at much larger

1271
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:40,480
scale than we do. Uh we have we have

1272
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:44,000
more one-offs. So we're thinking about

1273
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:46,559
that. Uh we can often plan ahead more.

1274
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,559
Uh what we have learned is we've been

1275
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:51,440
doing a good job inside the agency.

1276
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:53,839
Okay, this mission got delayed. We need

1277
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:56,000
this this part that was purchased for

1278
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:57,520
that program, but they're delayed.

1279
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,480
Somebody else needs it now. We're going

1280
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:02,559
to do a swap across programs. The next

1281
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:05,200
step is to start do that doing that with

1282
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:08,640
DoD where we're actually broadening that

1283
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:11,040
pool and that approach to it. We're also

1284
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:13,920
really finding out that a lot of the

1285
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:15,920
data is anecdotal. So, uh, we're

1286
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:18,319
building a single tool that will bring

1287
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:21,359
all of the information about the, you

1288
00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:22,960
know, critical risk and so forth and

1289
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:25,200
have that actually at the front end of

1290
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:27,200
procurement planning. So, this is the

1291
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:29,520
dream. We're not there yet, but the

1292
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:31,440
dream is that we can actually project

1293
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:33,520
out our procurements over the next 10

1294
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:36,319
years and say maybe it would be better

1295
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:39,599
to do a bulk buy in a certain area for

1296
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:41,520
certain type of technologies and um you

1297
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:43,680
know get consistency for industry which

1298
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:45,920
is really good for them uh but also

1299
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:48,160
better planning for ourselves. Critical

1300
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:50,480
minerals is going to be really

1301
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:52,000
interesting long term. I think it's a

1302
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:53,760
great point. I think it'll take a while

1303
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,920
before it hits the space industry really

1304
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:58,559
hard.

1305
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:01,520
Okay, final question.

1306
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:03,440
>> Oh, Jeff gets the last word.

1307
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:04,480
>> Is it an astronaut question?

1308
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,760
>> Well, no.

1309
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,400
>> He's not going to ask me about flying in

1310
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,920
space.

1311
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:09,760
>> Although I mentioned some people I was

1312
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,640
on the selection committee when when we

1313
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,160
picked you.

1314
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:14,480
>> Were you? I don't think I remember.

1315
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:17,119
>> And I'm glad we we made a good decision.

1316
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:19,440
But look, this has to a lot a lot of

1317
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:21,280
people ask me about, you know, what are

1318
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:23,599
the Chinese doing? Does it have an

1319
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:25,680
impact on NASA? I know there's political

1320
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:27,200
sensitivities, but I'm I'm sure a lot of

1321
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,880
people here would love to hear your

1322
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:33,839
thoughts on that.

1323
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:35,920
>> Yeah, I think um you know uh so for

1324
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:37,520
those of you who are not aware, there is

1325
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:39,839
something called the Wolf Amendment.

1326
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:42,960
It's a a law that was passed that said

1327
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:45,359
that NASA can't work bilaterally with

1328
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:47,440
China except under certain conditions.

1329
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:50,720
And in fact, we are working bilaterally

1330
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:52,800
on a very few small number of things. Uh

1331
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:55,040
one example of that is we are exchanging

1332
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:57,839
in ephemeris data on our spacecraft

1333
00:53:55,040 --> 00:54:00,400
around Mars uh to make sure that we are

1334
00:53:57,839 --> 00:54:02,559
deconlicting um activities around Mars.

1335
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:04,400
That's a great example. We just there's

1336
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:07,359
a barrier and a threshold that you have

1337
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:10,319
to prove uh that critical technology is

1338
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:12,000
not being transferred. Um but it does

1339
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:14,880
make it a lot harder for us to work with

1340
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,480
China. Um obviously we have a great and

1341
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:19,200
long-standing relationship with Russia

1342
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:21,680
and have since 1975 and that's a in a

1343
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:24,720
very different place. Um I think there

1344
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:28,079
there are challenges in that area. Uh

1345
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:30,640
the the difficult part for us is a an

1346
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:32,960
extreme lack of transparency around what

1347
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:36,079
is exactly happening in the Chinese

1348
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:38,240
space program. Um I mean you know NASA

1349
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:40,559
you can go online and get information

1350
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:42,240
about anything. There's a lot of

1351
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:45,520
information out there about each one of

1352
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:47,359
our missions and uh and then we also

1353
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:49,839
have a commitment to open science and

1354
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:52,559
publishing our results and and sharing

1355
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:55,920
them publicly uh and sharing the data

1356
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:57,599
publicly. Um which is also uh we don't

1357
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:59,920
find very many international partners

1358
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:02,240
that have quite the open science

1359
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:04,000
standards that we do. um there's

1360
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:06,480
typically a period of time at least

1361
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,640
where it's protected and only the

1362
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:12,240
researchers from the country uh of

1363
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:14,640
origin get access to that data and uh we

1364
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:16,400
feel particularly in climate science

1365
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:18,559
this is so critical we need to get that

1366
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:20,480
data out to anybody who can find a good

1367
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:22,559
use for it. So that's probably one of

1368
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:24,480
the biggest barriers for us in in

1369
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:27,119
working with there's some really key

1370
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:29,359
philosophical differences on the happy

1371
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:30,880
side. We have so many part we've got

1372
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:33,040
partnerships

1373
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:36,319
um I think we have agreements with like

1374
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:38,079
63 countries around the world. So that's

1375
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:40,559
an amazing number if you think about it

1376
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:42,559
and most of them are in science. Uh but

1377
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:44,880
it is it is really phenomenal and I

1378
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:46,400
think um that that is just critical to

1379
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:48,400
us going forward. If we're going to go

1380
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:50,400
out into the solar system, we're going

1381
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:52,000
to go as humanity. We're going to go as

1382
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:54,640
partners. We're going to go as

1383
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,720
representatives of Earth, not of any one

1384
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:58,480
country.

1385
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:01,880
All right. Thank you very much for such

1386
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,880
a great talk.
