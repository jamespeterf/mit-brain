engineering at MIT he's a former

80
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:09,159
director of MTL and the founding

81
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:11,400
director of MIT n um we don't have

82
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:14,680
microphones here oh you are miked yeah

83
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,919
yes you are okay excellent good good uh

84
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:19,120
all right let's uh let's get started uh

85
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:21,440
so it's been it's been 4 years as as

86
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,120
thas told us today and actually it only

87
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,639
seems yesterday that we celebrated the

88
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,880
30th Anniversary uh of MTL and so indeed

89
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,880
this is really an occasion to celebrate

90
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:34,240
as as I think to has really showed us

91
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:36,160
very well MTL has been a runaway success

92
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,840
over over many years in research and

93
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,199
education in Microsystems and nanot

94
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,639
Technology now in this panel we want to

95
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:44,479
reflect a little bit on the making of

96
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:46,320
MTL some of the early Visionary design

97
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,919
decisions that were made that brought us

98
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,759
to where we are today and that are also

99
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,240
shaping the future through MIT Nano and

100
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,280
through the future MTL now I wasn't here

101
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,360
in the early days as you saw in the in

102
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:59,960
the in the timeline um I came soon after

103
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:03,160
and I I see if I reflect back on Mt I

104
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:05,560
see five key design principles that uh

105
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,680
in my view profoundly shape the place

106
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,680
first one was the integration of

107
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,600
technology and system design as as thas

108
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,479
has explained very well the fact that we

109
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,520
build a share facility for everybody to

110
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:18,000
come together and share share the tools

111
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,600
and capabilities and the NOA and also

112
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,319
the computation and cut tools a focus an

113
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,759
initial focus on Silicon technology

114
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:26,520
although that evolved the integration of

115
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:29,080
research and education as opposed to

116
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,560
keep them separately and a very close

117
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,039
partnership with industry which endures

118
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,520
to today so so I think these design

119
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:38,960
decisions have endured to today but have

120
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,240
also evolved for example uh with my hire

121
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,840
uh MTL introduced compound

122
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,240
semiconductors into the into the

123
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,319
facility and that was sort of the

124
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,280
beginning of a major expansion and

125
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:50,280
diversification in the Technologies and

126
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,800
materials that MTL was to handle over

127
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:55,400
the years and and perhaps the best

128
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,120
Testament of MTL success is really MIT

129
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:00,360
Nano This truly amazing facility that we

130
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:03,520
have on campus deep in MIT Nano is

131
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,600
really the DNA of MTL but anyway rather

132
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,160
than me uh making all these Reflections

133
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,000
I will I think we all want to hear from

134
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,680
our distinguish panelists so let me let

135
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,960
me start I would like to start with

136
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,479
Dimitri as founding director of MTL so

137
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:19,000
Dimitri you were in MTL uh from the very

138
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:21,759
beginning and actually even before MTL

139
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,759
was MTL uh can you tell us about the

140
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,440
challenges that had to be overcome to

141
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,400
get MTL of the ground and some of the

142
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:31,120
early designed decisions that were made

143
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:35,560
for the lab and it's

144
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:37,639
facilities well the um let's start with

145
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,720
the early

146
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:44,240
uh uh design

147
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:46,919
considerations it was thought that this

148
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:50,199
new laboratory that would uh bring

149
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:52,280
together systems and semiconductors in

150
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:54,960
particular silicon

151
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:58,400
semiconductors was had to be

152
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:01,720
Central so the facility had to be

153
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:06,280
somewhere in the core of the

154
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:10,720
campus but of course as always happens

155
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:15,360
at MIT there's never enough space so we

156
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:16,879
had to evaluate several um

157
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:22,479
locations

158
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:27,039
including a um non-operational um uh

159
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:32,280
wind tunnel at where the u high uh hotel

160
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:33,720
is is now um I think perhaps it uh we

161
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,840
also looked at the

162
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:40,560
TRW uh old factory building somewhere in

163
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:44,319
this area that has long been torn

164
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:47,879
down uh Lincoln laboratory was also a

165
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,919
consideration um because there were very

166
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:52,800
strong supporters from the beginning of

167
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:57,039
establishing a strong silicon

168
00:07:52,800 --> 00:08:02,280
facility but in the end what uh um

169
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:06,120
carried the day was uh actually a

170
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:07,680
relative courageous but Visionary um

171
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,840
decision at the time of the

172
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:14,319
administration take building 39 the most

173
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:19,199
expensive solution because we couldn't

174
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:22,919
tear down the building but uh it

175
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:26,520
um with the idea that uh Computing was

176
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:29,520
now becoming more and more uh

177
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:33,360
diffuse the building that was originally

178
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:36,440
designed to be a computer um Center

179
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,680
facility uh became pretty much available

180
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:42,680
there were some other offices in there

181
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:46,640
so that was the early um challenge that

182
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:49,080
we had to uh overcome but of course uh

183
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,600
always with consideration of how much it

184
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:55,640
was going to cost how we going to raise

185
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:59,040
the the funds and and all those uh

186
00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:00,680
aspects so uh that that was the early

187
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,120
beginning

188
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:05,880
um perhaps I should mention that at the

189
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:09,000
time other

190
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:11,600
universities as well as MIT had silicon

191
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,560
facilities mostly teaching facilities

192
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:19,720
Stanford was perhaps the most uh

193
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:23,279
Advanced Berkeley as well and uh at that

194
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:27,200
time the thought at was we must have a

195
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:29,880
very strong presence in uh silicon so

196
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:33,800
that's why the original name was

197
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:36,600
uh LSI laboratory which been changed

198
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:39,680
yeah thank you uh Ray uh you were an

199
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:42,399
early champion and supporter of MIT in

200
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,399
its quest to set up a new program in

201
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,040
microelectronics uh in fact Analog

202
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,279
Devices was a founding member of the

203
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,959
Microsystems industrial group that has

204
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:52,200
supported MTL and in fact has remained a

205
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:54,240
member to this day we really we really

206
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:57,720
thank you for for your stone support of

207
00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:00,120
MTL now back to the early 80s uh By the

208
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:04,000
time ntl was founded the micro industry

209
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:07,600
was already well on its way and so some

210
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,279
ad MIT thought it was inappropriate to

211
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,720
invest uh in a in a technology that was

212
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:13,399
already in research and educational

213
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,800
programs on a technology that was deemed

214
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:17,760
to be already quite mature now

215
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,240
fortunately uh those voices did not

216
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,800
Prevail and so what arguments did you

217
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,519
use you played a key role in this what

218
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,200
arguments did you use to sway these

219
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,880
decision in the direction of launching

220
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,079
ntl with the parameters that we have

221
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:33,880
been

222
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:35,959
discussing so so in the uh mid 70s uh

223
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,920
there was a group of companies in Boston

224
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:41,079
that got together called the

225
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:43,920
Massachusetts high Technology Council

226
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:46,639
and our objective was collectively to

227
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:51,040
influence uh the environment in such a

228
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:53,959
way that uh the high technology U

229
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,720
industry could continue to thrive and

230
00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:58,000
develop here in

231
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:00,600
Massachusetts uh there were several

232
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,959
parts of the program but one of them was

233
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,040
uh the relationships between

234
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:09,040
universities and

235
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:12,279
Industry um and uh in looking at the

236
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:15,320
landscape of course MIT was a very

237
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:19,200
important part of that and uh we noted

238
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:20,480
that uh uh MIT was lagging in the

239
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,639
Silicon

240
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:27,519
area uh so as the first president of

241
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:30,360
mhdc I was given the mission of meeting

242
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:33,320
with the leadership of MI

243
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:36,079
uh to try to uh lay out at least

244
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,880
industry's view as to why that was not a

245
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:41,480
good

246
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:44,800
direction uh so U we had studied it and

247
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:47,880
uh uh had a good story uh we presented

248
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:50,560
that story to Professor gray was the

249
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:53,480
president at the time and others who

250
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:57,399
were concerned with this area uh and

251
00:11:53,480 --> 00:12:01,320
made our case uh I'm not too sure uh

252
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:04,000
that uh what we had to say uh had a

253
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:08,600
tremendous impact on what was decided

254
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:13,519
but one way or the other I think um MIT

255
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:16,440
and in particular eecs uh begin to to

256
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:19,959
change the focus and to bring uh uh

257
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:22,079
silicon technology to the Forefront in

258
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:26,120
terms of research and

259
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:29,760
education um and um so that's how it

260
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:33,480
that's how we got going now uh Analog

261
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:37,440
Devices had a vested interest in MIT

262
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:42,079
becoming more vital in terms of silicon

263
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:45,760
technology uh we uh uh established a

264
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:49,000
professorship uh to uh help recruit uh

265
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:52,279
faculty from other universities who were

266
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:56,079
a little bit ahead of us and uh and as

267
00:12:52,279 --> 00:13:00,000
it turns out the first recipient of that

268
00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:03,839
is sitting right here Raphael uh when he

269
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,000
left uh Stanford to come to MIT uh he

270
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:09,800
was the first recipient of that

271
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:13,600
fellowship and uh you know later uh my

272
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:17,279
good friend here was also and and

273
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:20,120
several others uh not just what analog

274
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:25,880
did but the industry in general uh TR

275
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:29,600
did uh what we do to support uh MIT and

276
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:35,160
uh uh in research and education and this

277
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:38,560
area and U the uh the amazing thing with

278
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:42,240
within a relatively short period of time

279
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:46,399
uh MIT went from sort of nowhere at

280
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:49,519
least uh in in terms of the the views of

281
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:53,000
many in terms of silicon technology uh

282
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:56,040
to becoming uh you know a major player

283
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:00,839
uh and uh and that turned out to be just

284
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:03,720
in time uh as the government industry uh

285
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:05,920
put some very serious funding on the

286
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:09,519
table to help uh

287
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:11,160
universities uh to uh accelerate the

288
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:14,199
development of the

289
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:17,360
technology um so it all worked

290
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:17,360
out thank

291
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:25,600
you Rafael perhaps uh the most visible

292
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:28,120
manifestation of the runaway success of

293
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,079
of the MTL Venture is MIT Nano our new

294
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,920
nanofabrication facil

295
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,600
even today there is no facility that I

296
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,560
know of in any University environment

297
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,040
with the size and capabilities that MIT

298
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:40,000
Nano offers to us now colleagues or

299
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,680
other universities tell us that they

300
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,320
they find daunting the notion of

301
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,000
convincing their Board of Trustees to

302
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,480
put together something like MIT Nano in

303
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,360
their own campus you were president at

304
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,440
MIT you were president of MIT through

305
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:55,600
the gestation and the launch of MIT Nano

306
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,759
how did you accomplish this what what

307
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,880
were your arguments and and was it hard

308
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:02,600
I assume me was and what were your

309
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,279
greatest concerns when you try to sell

310
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,720
this

311
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:10,120
concept did you ask was it

312
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:12,480
hard how much time do we have three

313
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:14,680
minutes five

314
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:18,240
minutes look I think I think the

315
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:21,000
argument the argument was very simple um

316
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:25,440
it was and it was not that hard to

317
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:28,480
sell I think at the time um uh the

318
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:31,399
word word in the street in the street of

319
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:35,720
silicon Valley to begin with is that

320
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:39,240
software eats hardware for lunch if you

321
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:41,440
remember um the the mo the fundry model

322
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:43,160
already has been established fabulous

323
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,040
companies as thas mentioned earlier has

324
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:48,360
been established so the trend the

325
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:50,519
funding trend for this kind of effort

326
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:53,240
for Hardware stuff for for processing

327
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:55,680
for technology for hard technology was

328
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:57,519
beginning to erode companies were

329
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,920
becoming less interested because they

330
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:04,040
were looking at the value added which is

331
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:08,279
designed um however a few of us

332
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:10,319
certainly I was very much uh one of them

333
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:11,959
felt like that was a mistake and that

334
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:15,680
was going to come back to hurt us to

335
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:17,600
hurt the us so we felt strongly I feel

336
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,600
strongly that we had to have a presence

337
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:23,319
on the advanced technology of the modern

338
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:27,319
era um and that is what eventually

339
00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:29,560
became MIT Nano the the luckily for us

340
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:32,319
uh the MIT Corporation supported the

341
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:34,759
view once they understood the vision um

342
00:16:32,319 --> 00:16:37,880
and and my esteemed person at the right

343
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:40,560
uh had a lot to do with that um so so

344
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:43,199
that was not that hard but it took a

345
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,040
while and again it's a it's a leap of

346
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:47,560
faith that you will build it and they

347
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:50,800
will come uh because again the funding

348
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:51,920
was not there the the the funding agency

349
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,959
from the federal government were not

350
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:58,560
there and so forth um once that was

351
00:16:55,959 --> 00:17:00,720
decided and we moveed forward I mean the

352
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,279
the Miracle of MIT is that we had an

353
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,679
individual who was driven like crazy to

354
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:07,199
make it happen and that's Vladimir

355
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:10,439
bulovic who worked very very hard for

356
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:14,000
this to become a reality um and and the

357
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:17,000
truth is that time proved us right um in

358
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,839
two years ago some of you may remember

359
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,760
uh while the chips and science Act was

360
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:26,319
moving uh in Washington the US Secretary

361
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:30,080
of Commerce uh wanted to see a place

362
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:32,960
like this and she came to see MIT Nano

363
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:35,400
by herself and she was so extremely

364
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:38,440
impressed that by the end of the visit

365
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:41,960
she turned to me and said the US needs

366
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:44,960
10 MIT Nanos so I think I think it went

367
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:47,720
full circle but but time Prov us right

368
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,720
it was an aggressive uh decision that

369
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,039
the might made but I'm delighted that we

370
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,480
made it and I'm delighted that we're

371
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:56,039
here today celebrating not just the 40

372
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,360
Years of MTL but all the accomplishments

373
00:17:56,039 --> 00:18:00,840
that we will be able to move forward

374
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,840
thanks to MIT Nano

375
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:07,600
thank so Vladimir your name has been

376
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:09,400
mentioned you are the founding director

377
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,000
of of MIT Nano you led the way in

378
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,440
conceiving this project and bringing it

379
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,159
to fruition as Rafael told us now in the

380
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,080
early days most critically you help

381
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:19,120
Rafael to sell this concept to the MIT

382
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:21,320
Corporation mit's Board of

383
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:24,000
juses this must have been a very

384
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:26,000
intimidating request uh given the

385
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,280
complexities of the project and and its

386
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,559
and its size so can you tell us how you

387
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:32,559
approach it

388
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:34,480
um obviously you were successful but how

389
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:36,600
how how the meetings

390
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,799
went thank for thank you for asking

391
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:41,320
because I really I'm a junior partner

392
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:43,760
here uh my president president r at the

393
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:46,880
time uh was indeed a key mover and

394
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:49,200
Shaker Mary Schmidt the Provost um was

395
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,480
the other key mover and Shaker my job

396
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,679
was to imagine ways to tell the story

397
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:56,799
and add to their voices that were

398
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:59,039
already very powerful um you know the

399
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:00,559
key to Innovation is human friction uh

400
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,799
the key to us launching next set of

401
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:04,440
ideas is because we happen to bump into

402
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:07,240
each other and we do a lot more when we

403
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:09,960
are together than we stand alone so the

404
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:11,880
result of it was the key is well let's

405
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,559
map where the inventions are made on

406
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:15,440
this campus and we made a heat map a

407
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:17,600
couple of years before we inv invented

408
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,840
even MIT Nano and realized that the

409
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,520
buildings on campus that are easy to

410
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,480
reach and that mix multiple disciplines

411
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:26,440
happened to be just the hot spots of

412
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,039
innovation so the key to building a

413
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,520
might Nano it needed to be right in the

414
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:31,919
center of Campus it needed to be

415
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,679
connected to every discipline and it

416
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:37,440
needed to be able to be reached by every

417
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:39,600
discipline so those are the metrics so

418
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,159
how do you reach them because you are

419
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,120
asking to build in the middle of Campus

420
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:46,799
it's about 20% more expensive than

421
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,640
choosing a spot outside right well the

422
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:51,000
very simple answer is for all of our

423
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,840
drive to make a community as the driving

424
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,400
force you needed to come up with

425
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:57,880
technical reasons it turns out that

426
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:01,480
vibration in the ground at the site of

427
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:04,280
MIT Nano is the lowest vibration on the

428
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:07,280
campus available sites and when it comes

429
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:09,120
to management of chemical affluence it's

430
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,760
easier in the middle of a campus than in

431
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,240
a residential area at the edge of the

432
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:15,159
campus there are many other elements

433
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,880
just like that and guided by my

434
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:20,600
colleagues like VI diuk uh we were able

435
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:23,280
to Think Through various elements that

436
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:25,280
justify the physical reason the next

437
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,039
thing is simply let's make sure the

438
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,760
culture of it indeed will be able to

439
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:32,440
Encompass everyone because it just turns

440
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:35,600
out that MTL tools at the time at the

441
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:38,120
time that I was director 20% of the time

442
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:41,000
we did use them to make micro electronic

443
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:43,280
devices analog and digital circuits but

444
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,440
80% of the time we were inventing new

445
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:48,880
medical devices new Energy Systems those

446
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:51,360
very same precise nanoc skill tools were

447
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,120
opening new Vistas that we couldn't even

448
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:56,520
imagine so let's make sure the space is

449
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:58,600
enabling us to have everyone step into

450
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,840
it and the easy way to do that if it's

451
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,760
going to be in the center of campus and

452
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:04,320
connected to all the buildings let's

453
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,640
make sure no one has an office inside

454
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:09,679
this building no faculty at least staff

455
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:14,279
needed and that way generate a community

456
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:17,440
today that has 1,500 users from 40

457
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:21,720
different departments labs and centers

458
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:24,080
well that was a vision um we could again

459
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:26,720
pin it on the opportunity and the

460
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,080
opportunity was build communities and

461
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,320
that human friction that leads to

462
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:32,880
innovation like we could never do before

463
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:35,440
uh through the words of what Rafael and

464
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:38,279
Marty were able to do indeed Corporation

465
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,919
was convinced and I think all of us and

466
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:43,159
the world are way better for it yeah

467
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:43,159
yeah

468
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:51,320
thanks Dimitri coming back to the uh

469
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:53,720
early days you as the first director of

470
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:56,240
MTL you were in charge over the

471
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:58,640
formative years of a lab and how the

472
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,840
ideas behind the mission of MTL evolve

473
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,440
as the operation uh got going off the

474
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:05,159
ground and what were the major

475
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:09,559
challenges that had to be

476
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:14,480
overcome well the original ideas uh came

477
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:18,799
from the U fact that U silicon was

478
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:22,960
becoming uh ubiquitous in uh

479
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:24,799
microelectronics um MIT had uh as race

480
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:29,360
had you know lagged

481
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:33,279
behind um other universities for sure

482
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:39,559
and um the

483
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:42,960
um the design of a new LSI facility at

484
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:46,919
MIT was to address uh this connection

485
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:48,600
between design of large scale integrated

486
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:52,520
circuits that was

487
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:58,320
becoming um more and more popularized

488
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:59,600
through the um uh M corway uh system and

489
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:04,760
uh

490
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:08,960
um the Advent of seamour of course and

491
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:12,200
um the uh device research MIT had a

492
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:14,960
strong device research in the area of 3

493
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:18,360
five materials photonic

494
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:22,159
materials uh but it did not have a

495
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:24,080
strong effort in um uh silicon devices I

496
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:29,360
should mention however that Steve

497
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:32,559
Centuria had the beginnings of MS also

498
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:36,520
in uh his uh

499
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:38,799
um his uh chemical sensor transition

500
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:40,679
that was built actually in a educational

501
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:45,480
facility in Building

502
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:49,320
13 so the original idea was that we will

503
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:51,520
connect with the design Community

504
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:55,080
within uh

505
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:57,720
MIT in the on the computer science side

506
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:59,000
there was a lot of support at the time

507
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,480
uh for that

508
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,559
and as we were building the facility so

509
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:10,240
the facility was designed actually the

510
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:15,480
centerpiece was a 6,000 um square feet

511
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:19,120
um class 10 sorry class uh 100 facility

512
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:23,480
with localized class stands and um that

513
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:26,120
was to do simos fabrication you have to

514
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:29,200
also realize that at the time the

515
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:31,200
concept of fabulous

516
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:36,480
didn't quite

517
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:39,120
exist and uh many companies that had a

518
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:41,159
strong presence in microelectronics felt

519
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,720
it necessary

520
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:44,320
to

521
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,120
establish

522
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:50,919
silicon microfabrication

523
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:53,320
facilities and um so that actually

524
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:57,320
helped at the time you know with as Ray

525
00:24:53,320 --> 00:25:00,120
was saying in uh raising the profile of

526
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,960
the need uh here at MIT and uh the

527
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,480
initial

528
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:07,840
support

529
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:09,279
however if I go a little uh further down

530
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:13,240
the line

531
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:16,559
maybe within u a year or two that we

532
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:18,840
started uh putting the facility together

533
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:20,799
it became

534
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:25,200
obvious uh

535
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:29,039
that it would be more than just making

536
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:31,720
circuits in uh in Silicon

537
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:34,840
in fact uh I remember very uh well

538
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:36,880
sitting down with uh my colleagues and

539
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:39,559
trying to think what should we call this

540
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,640
new facility that's where the name of

541
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:45,000
MTL came

542
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:46,960
Microsystems so make it all encompassing

543
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,080
even though at the time we're thinking

544
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:52,399
silicon

545
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:56,600
based and um the discipline that we

546
00:25:52,399 --> 00:25:59,399
tried to establish was all simos driven

547
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:01,840
and uh

548
00:25:59,399 --> 00:26:04,120
the evaluation of Technologies to

549
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:07,080
undertake in the lab and so forth was

550
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:10,919
all based on how do we maintain the

551
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:14,640
cleanliness necessary to achieve large

552
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:18,520
circuits these were the um early

553
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:22,799
thoughts behind how the building was

554
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:27,720
designed with a um integrated circuits

555
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:31,960
uh lab on the second floor and then the

556
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:35,600
fourth floor for being the more um the

557
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:38,720
more uh liberal lab if you like this is

558
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:44,360
where Rafel put his EP reactor for

559
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:46,679
example um and um then the individual

560
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:48,720
faculty Laboratories that eventually

561
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:51,279
absorbed the

562
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:56,440
Microsystems uh the sorry

563
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:58,919
the circuits lab the the um Building

564
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:02,760
13 yeah

565
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:04,799
Ray uh so here we are uh 40 years later

566
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:07,159
and as I like to tell uh the students in

567
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:09,320
my classes the microelectronics industry

568
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:11,880
remains as useful as

569
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:14,919
ever uh but it has been transformed many

570
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:17,159
times over so as an industry leader as

571
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:19,679
and as an investor and champion in

572
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:21,559
startups in this domain what new

573
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,440
opportunities do you see ahead of us

574
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:25,799
that we should be getting our students

575
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,799
prepared

576
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:33,159
for help me a little bit what was

577
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:36,880
I for the future what that for the

578
00:27:33,159 --> 00:27:36,880
future oh the future

579
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:44,440
yeah well we we see

580
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:47,320
U uh a great opportunity in phonics and

581
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:51,080
uh being able to integrate uh

582
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:54,080
photonic technology more fully with

583
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:56,880
electronics uh there's been some stabs

584
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:59,880
at that uh but we're nowhere near to

585
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:03,039
where we can be will be so frankly I

586
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:06,440
think that's one of the areas that uh uh

587
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:07,760
we look forward to uh working in and

588
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:11,640
making some

589
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:15,519
progress um the other thing is that as

590
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:18,720
we move to untethered devices battery

591
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:21,640
operated devices uh there's no such

592
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:24,279
thing as uh low power it's ultra low

593
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:27,039
power so I think we have to go back and

594
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:30,120
revisit uh both the technology and the

595
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:34,799
circuit uh architectures to see what we

596
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:37,760
can do to uh minimize uh the the power

597
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:40,399
requirement of a electronic

598
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:44,360
circuits uh there's another uh

599
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:47,440
phenomenon uh Brian author is an is a

600
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:51,679
scholar who's looked at the various uh

601
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:55,080
waves of Technology development and the

602
00:28:51,679 --> 00:29:00,320
electricity and chemistry and aviations

603
00:28:55,080 --> 00:29:03,039
and and and there as as try to uh

604
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:07,760
discern whether there's some kind of uh

605
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:11,039
commonality uh what goes on in in uh uh

606
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:13,480
Innovation development and uh anyway he

607
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:16,279
he came to the conclusion that uh in

608
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:19,200
every one of these waves there was a

609
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:23,240
what he calls the Tipping Point where

610
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:27,799
the uh focus of innovation shifts from

611
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:31,640
the parts to the whole uh and what he uh

612
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:34,080
called calls uh combinatorial

613
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:37,840
Innovation uh the performance of the

614
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:40,720
parts uh for many applications is quite

615
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:45,760
adequate uh but you can do a much better

616
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:49,760
job um if you uh integrate these into a

617
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:53,360
a systems element and I think uh we're

618
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:56,120
well into that we see this uh at our

619
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:58,640
company uh in terms of what customers

620
00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:00,880
want they don't want to buy a bag of

621
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:03,840
parts and figure how to put them

622
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:06,200
together they saying that's your job uh

623
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:09,440
so they're pushing back on the

624
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:10,919
semiconductor suppliers to provide more

625
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:14,240
complete

626
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:17,760
Solutions um and we're just sort of at

627
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:21,279
the um beginning of that uh you know the

628
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:27,559
chipet technology is is one of the ways

629
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:29,640
of of U fulfilling that vision and uh

630
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:33,480
right now now there's uh a hundred

631
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:35,760
different ideas about how to uh create

632
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:38,240
Advanced packaging and ship of

633
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:40,480
technology and I think that the extent

634
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,840
to which that can be more

635
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:45,799
standardized uh the more quickly we can

636
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:49,039
move along and I think uh there's a

637
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:52,480
contribution that uh universities can

638
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:54,480
make in uh bringing together industry

639
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:57,440
and and coming to some

640
00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:01,399
agreement uh about uh how to do that in

641
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:05,600
a more uh Universal way I remember

642
00:31:01,399 --> 00:31:09,000
perhaps 15 20 years ago Charlie sodini

643
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:12,880
uh gave a talk about uh you know what

644
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:17,120
what's going to be the next uh big thing

645
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:21,159
in terms of consumer consumer uh

646
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:24,399
electronics and uh he concluded it was

647
00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:27,120
going to be medical devices and I think

648
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:28,480
here we are today with our smart watches

649
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:31,000
and our smart

650
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:36,159
Rings uh and we're at the very very

651
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:40,039
early stages now of fully exploiting uh

652
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:42,679
the capability of uh of electronic

653
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:47,399
devices photo electronic

654
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:50,440
devices uh for U enhancing health care

655
00:31:47,399 --> 00:31:51,840
and the hospitals just can't afford to

656
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:56,039
expand

657
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:59,000
indefinitely uh so having uh a hospital

658
00:31:56,039 --> 00:32:01,600
at home remote uh

659
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,559
Diagnostics uh a lot of things where it

660
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:06,880
doesn't consume capital on the part of

661
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:09,799
our hospitals is kind of where we're

662
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:12,440
heading and uh there's a just a

663
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:14,799
tremendous opportunity for the

664
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:16,039
development of more sophisticated uh

665
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:21,279
sensing

666
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:25,279
devices um a more uh holistic uh uh

667
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:28,519
system solutions to U health care

668
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:31,480
problems so there's a long way to travel

669
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:34,240
there I think today the size of the

670
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:37,080
semiconductor industry is estimated to

671
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:39,799
be on the order of $500

672
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:42,760
billion and I think those who study

673
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:45,559
these various Trends and try to put them

674
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:50,279
together uh believe that the industry

675
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:54,240
will be uh1 and half trillion dollars by

676
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:55,240
2020 that that uh 2030 that that may be

677
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,799
a bit

678
00:32:55,240 --> 00:33:02,600
optimistic uh but nonetheless uh

679
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:05,519
uh an industry which is

680
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:09,000
substantially multiples of the size that

681
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:13,159
we have today is surely in the future so

682
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:16,039
we have uh We've Just Begun to Fight uh

683
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:21,159
nobody quite knows or understands what

684
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:23,919
the implications of AI is on all this uh

685
00:33:21,159 --> 00:33:28,080
but clearly uh there's uh there's

686
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:31,080
inklings of uh of great happenings there

687
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:35,440
which will require U hardware and

688
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:38,840
software and new uh new combinations to

689
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:43,279
accommodate uh that whole

690
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:45,639
opportunity so it isn't uh really most

691
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:48,039
of the companies in this business today

692
00:33:45,639 --> 00:33:51,559
are not struggling for

693
00:33:48,039 --> 00:33:54,399
opportunity uh the the problem is

694
00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:56,919
there's it's like a kid in a candy store

695
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:58,279
I mean it's just there's so many uh

696
00:33:56,919 --> 00:34:02,440
delightful things

697
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:05,000
uh to to uh to munch on uh that the real

698
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:07,480
trick is being smart and trying to

699
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,839
figure out which of these are the ones

700
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:13,480
that from a commercial point of view are

701
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:16,359
going to Blossom sooner than others uh

702
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:21,040
and as I say a lot of that will have to

703
00:34:16,359 --> 00:34:24,760
do uh with the uh coment oal Innovation

704
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:26,879
more complete uh Solutions that's not to

705
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:29,679
say that there still aren't great

706
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:31,960
opportunities for a continued

707
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:34,919
Improvement of Technology at the

708
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:37,839
component level I mentioned power

709
00:34:34,919 --> 00:34:41,159
consumption as just one of of of many

710
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:45,599
aspects of that so I think we're in for

711
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:50,079
a very exciting decade ahead uh one of

712
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:53,159
the uh concerns we have uh I is that uh

713
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:55,320
because of the the great appeal of

714
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:57,359
computer science and artificial

715
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:59,920
intelligence you know all the smart

716
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:02,200
young students are running in that

717
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:06,280
direction and uh when we look at the

718
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:07,920
enrollments here at MIT and e or things

719
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:11,960
that would be a little closer to the

720
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:14,520
semiconductor technology it's atrophied

721
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:16,839
and I think we're uh we're struggling

722
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:18,880
with figuring out ways to convince

723
00:35:16,839 --> 00:35:21,520
students uh that there really is a

724
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:23,560
future in semiconductors uh because not

725
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:27,839
everybody believes that and certainly

726
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:31,599
many students don't in comparison okay

727
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:34,359
to the unknown appeal of the AI uh so we

728
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:37,760
have some work ahead of us in industry

729
00:35:34,359 --> 00:35:42,000
and in universities uh to keep this

730
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:46,200
thing going um and uh to take the full

731
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:49,280
advantage of what uh uh semiconductor

732
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:52,400
technology uh can can bring to bear on

733
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:55,880
our society and I I I think it's

734
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:58,319
predictable that more and more and more

735
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:01,119
uh the technology where oriented

736
00:35:58,319 --> 00:36:04,160
products of any Dimension is going to

737
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:07,720
have um uh electronics as the

738
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:10,319
fundamental supporting technology thank

739
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:12,960
you Rafael so continuing to think about

740
00:36:10,319 --> 00:36:15,040
the future uh you play a you played a

741
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,280
decisive role in in

742
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:19,560
DC uh in the formulation of the chips

743
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,280
and science act and through the chips

744
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:23,240
act as we know the US is making a big

745
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,079
push to reclaim semiconductor

746
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:26,920
manufacturing leadership and through the

747
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:28,839
science act the US is to invest in

748
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:30,920
research to sustain that leadership into

749
00:36:28,839 --> 00:36:33,119
the future now we see the chips sack

750
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:35,640
well on its way but the science act

751
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:39,040
seems languishing in in the halls of

752
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:40,599
Congress um why does it seem that it was

753
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:43,000
harder to sell the science Act is is

754
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:46,079
there a chance that we can save

755
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:49,480
it you hear

756
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:53,880
me you hear me now yeah

757
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:56,839
um the the uh what became the Chiefs and

758
00:36:53,880 --> 00:37:00,079
science act actually started maybe seven

759
00:36:56,839 --> 00:37:02,520
years ago eight years ago or so and and

760
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:04,280
thas when he started his presentation he

761
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:06,000
showed the beginning of everything in

762
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:07,760
fact he even claimed that that happened

763
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,319
at MTL which is a transistor the

764
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:15,119
semiconductor transistor uh in

765
00:37:11,319 --> 00:37:16,760
1947 right um but but but that's an

766
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:19,520
that's an excellent point because that

767
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:21,960
was the beginning of all the Innovations

768
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:24,560
in technology in so many areas up to

769
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:27,680
today when we talk about AI we need to

770
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:29,480
build those huge data centers and and

771
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:32,599
you have to buy thousands and thousands

772
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:34,920
of gpus from Nvidia and they come from

773
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:36,200
that little transistor that that thas

774
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:41,680
mentioned in

775
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:44,560
1947 so what I was thinking is um what

776
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:47,520
kind of scientific infrastructure or

777
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:50,280
funding infrastructure is needed to come

778
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:52,319
up with the equivalent of the transistor

779
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:55,440
for the next 75 years because we have

780
00:37:52,319 --> 00:37:59,079
lived from that idea for the last almost

781
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:02,720
80 years or so and and and when you look

782
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:05,960
at that Discovery uh which got a Nobel

783
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:08,760
Prize it was not really a discovery I

784
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:11,680
mean the baps researchers were asked to

785
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:14,400
replace the vacuum tube find something

786
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:17,200
that was less less Les less bulky

787
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:19,880
consumes less energy be much smaller and

788
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,760
go and create that and think about how

789
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:23,880
to advance the science to make that

790
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:26,000
possible and there were several groups

791
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:29,040
competing to replace the vacuum tube

792
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,760
that unobtainable goal and this group

793
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:33,480
won and got the semiconductor I think it

794
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:36,720
was germanium at the very beginning so

795
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:39,960
that concept of looking for an

796
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:42,400
unobtainable and having people Advance

797
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:45,440
the science to get there that's what I

798
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:49,400
thought we needed to bring back there is

799
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:51,280
no baps uh we do have Google and

800
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:53,560
Microsoft and they spend a lot of money

801
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:56,079
on on basic science and research but not

802
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:58,680
the same kind so what I thought we

803
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:02,240
needed is what what what we call in the

804
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:04,280
scientific Community use inspired basic

805
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:07,359
research so you have an unobtainable

806
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:09,240
goal Advance the science to get there

807
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:12,280
and that was the concept that I was

808
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:16,440
trying that I was selling in Congress

809
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:18,359
and uh uh it was a little harder to sell

810
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:21,480
Congress on that than to sell the MIT

811
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:23,920
corporation on MIT Nano uh but but we

812
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:26,960
were making progress um and he was

813
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:29,200
advancing U Senator Schumer uh then

814
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:31,760
minority leader of the Senate but then

815
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,720
became Majority Leader uh he Advanced

816
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:36,359
the concept and he called that the

817
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:39,160
endless Frontier act in honor of of

818
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:40,160
vanar bush so that was moving and then

819
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:43,359
we had

820
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:45,079
covid Co showed that we all of a sudden

821
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:47,359
didn't have a supply of the chips we

822
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:51,079
needed from other countries uh and even

823
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:54,000
from our own home country so it it it

824
00:39:51,079 --> 00:39:55,680
atifi the problem that we said earlier

825
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,720
that we had to bring back with M might

826
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:59,440
Nano identify the fact that we don't

827
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:03,240
have Fabrication in this country not

828
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:05,760
enough of it so then that that required

829
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:07,880
a movement that yes the future is fine

830
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:11,319
but the present is in trouble so let's

831
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:14,640
bring manufacturing back to the us and

832
00:40:11,319 --> 00:40:17,680
that was I was okay with that as long as

833
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:20,839
we also fund the research to advance

834
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:23,000
from this point on so to bring a five

835
00:40:20,839 --> 00:40:26,839
media technology to America and leave it

836
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:29,520
there in 3 years will'll be behind the

837
00:40:26,839 --> 00:40:31,800
the technology ology anyway so I was

838
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:34,000
fine with bringing that back as long as

839
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:37,119
we have also the funding to advance it

840
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,280
from here on so that was the chaps part

841
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:41,720
of the chips and science Act and the

842
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:44,359
endless Frontier part for the future was

843
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:46,119
the science act so basically there were

844
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:48,359
a bunch of senators that like the

845
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:50,599
science part were a bunch of senators

846
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:52,960
that liked the te Chiefs part Senator

847
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:54,720
Schumer a brilliant politician brought

848
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,000
all of them together and say you want

849
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,880
your part then vote for both and and

850
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,200
that's how the chips and science side

851
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,119
became a part of what we are today and

852
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,960
and it was

853
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:07,160
bipartisan all that is the Good News

854
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:09,200
Congress recognizing the importance of

855
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:11,480
this for the economy of the nation

856
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:13,920
advancing in universities the role of

857
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:16,160
universities I also wanted that a new

858
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,520
director an NSF to be created to fund

859
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:20,520
this use inspired research which

860
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:22,520
actually happened all that is great news

861
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,640
the less great news is that when it came

862
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:26,160
to

863
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:28,520
Appropriations the cheapest part got

864
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:30,720
appropriated the part of bringing

865
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:33,200
manufacturing back and the part of

866
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,800
advancing it from here for packaging and

867
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:37,119
so forth that was

868
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:40,160
appropriated the science part the part

869
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:42,040
for the next 75 years was very little of

870
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,480
it was appropriated and and we're still

871
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:45,280
working on that but now it's going to

872
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:46,920
become harder and harder so that's the

873
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:49,240
story for the Chiefs and science act

874
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:50,920
yeah yeah thank you Rael we're running

875
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:54,160
our of time and I am I'm really itching

876
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:56,640
to to to ask you a question um and I

877
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:59,160
find striking that former ntl directors

878
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:01,200
have gone to Great achievements and

879
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:04,079
responsibilities at the highest levels

880
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:06,200
of University Administration you as MIT

881
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:08,640
president marish smid as Provost of MIT

882
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:11,680
and now president of RPI anatha Chandra

883
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:16,000
as of engineering so there is probably

884
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:18,520
no other unit at MIT with this kind of a

885
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,640
legacy what's in the water in building

886
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:23,880
39 what what makes this job of MTL

887
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:26,599
director uh such a ground to then

888
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:30,160
achieve uh such great responsibilities

889
00:42:26,599 --> 00:42:31,880
in at the highest level of University

890
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:35,520
Administration there must be something

891
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:38,880
in the water right I mean um look I

892
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:41,440
think you saw uh uh I think Tomas made a

893
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:44,480
terrific job when he showed a slide

894
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:46,359
showing the number I forget how many

895
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:48,960
pictures of professors you had on that

896
00:42:46,359 --> 00:42:50,880
slide working in MTL and there are 30 40

897
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:53,800
50 there just a large number of them

898
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:56,640
coming from all over MIT I think you

899
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:58,920
know I think if you have uh the job of

900
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:02,440
director which Dimitri had and I had and

901
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:05,480
a few others had and you have to Corral

902
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:08,119
uh 50 MIT professors from different

903
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:10,839
parts of MIT to work together and to

904
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:14,040
share a facility if you think that's an

905
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:15,920
easy job I'll tell you you're wrong so

906
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:17,640
if you have the skills to do something

907
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:19,760
like that you have the skills to do

908
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:25,319
anything else at

909
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:27,920
MIT thank you thank you Rafael uh all

910
00:43:25,319 --> 00:43:29,440
right I see that we have one minute left

911
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:31,079
and I see that there is a question that

912
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,480
has come in U I'm not sure that we have

913
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:35,160
time for all to answer but the question

914
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:38,040
is two pieces of advice maybe let's s on

915
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:40,640
one one piece of advice per panelist for

916
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:42,599
each of you to that would solidify the

917
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:44,440
future plans of MTL and the MIT

918
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:48,040
Community given the extreme impact that

919
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:49,359
this community has had one future advice

920
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:51,680
let's start with you I I think the

921
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:54,119
strength of MTL is the fact that it

922
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:56,880
integrates Microsystems uh it's the fact

923
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:59,079
that there is a device there is a system

924
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:01,119
there an application the vision is

925
00:43:59,079 --> 00:44:03,240
always there uh techn economics is even

926
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:05,319
a part of it I think it's incredibly

927
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:07,400
powerful that's the key to what makes

928
00:44:05,319 --> 00:44:11,000
MTL such an incredibly powerful

929
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:11,000
intellectual organization

930
00:44:13,559 --> 00:44:20,640
yeah which is microphone microphone oh

931
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:22,960
yeah continue to support

932
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:25,880
multidisciplinary research which was

933
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:27,839
actually the what we went through uh in

934
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:31,040
the development of Mt yeah we started

935
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:35,359
from Silicon and we became this wide

936
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:38,599
Community uh grabbing from all kinds of

937
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:43,079
places of MIT that didn't even imagine

938
00:44:38,599 --> 00:44:46,280
at the beginning yeah uh Ray Ray yeah I

939
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:51,240
one of the uh great learning lessons

940
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:54,640
from the uh Focus Center research uh

941
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:55,680
program that was in the 80s and early

942
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:57,720
'90s

943
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:02,240
is the

944
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:06,160
uh tremendous benefits uh when uh

945
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:10,559
industry and Academia really uh

946
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:13,880
collaborate on a uh on a deep level uh

947
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:18,319
with the best Minds in the industry and

948
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:21,240
the best mines in uh Academia get

949
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:25,640
together around well defined

950
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:27,520
areas uh and and then with the uh the

951
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:30,680
funds from the government governments

952
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:33,720
and Industry and other sources to have

953
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:38,200
the resources uh to work to get

954
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:42,160
constructively to solve problems so that

955
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:44,559
uh that lesson I think we can apply as

956
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:47,240
we go to the Future and must apply as we

957
00:45:44,559 --> 00:45:50,440
go to the Future and and find ways of

958
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:53,800
bringing uh industry and Academia

959
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:57,559
together in in much closer

960
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:59,839
collaboration learning to solve the

961
00:45:57,559 --> 00:46:02,760
conflict of interest problems and

962
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:04,760
competitive problems as we did very

963
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:07,960
successfully in the

964
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:11,400
semiconductor period uh but the kind of

965
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:14,000
progress that was made in that 10 or 15E

966
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:17,440
period was quite remarkable I think

967
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:22,920
unprecedented in history uh and so we

968
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:27,680
need to repeat that uh uh uh along

969
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:30,400
different dimensions but still uh seeing

970
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:33,680
the mutual benefit of working together

971
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:36,760
and and having policies in the federal

972
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:39,359
government that understands uh the value

973
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:42,280
of that and provides the kind of support

974
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:43,440
that's needed yeah thank you Rafael

975
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:47,800
finish with

976
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:50,240
you look I the the U the advice that I

977
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:55,440
can think of is almost not an advice but

978
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:58,400
a wish um whether for MTL for MIT Nano

979
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:01,800
or or for the whole of MIT which is you

980
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:03,280
know think think about that discovery of

981
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:06,040
the

982
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:07,599
transistor just just imagine that period

983
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:08,760
in which people were still playing with

984
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:12,680
vacuum

985
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:15,119
tubes my my aspiration my wish is that

986
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:16,079
the brain power of this place can think

987
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:19,200
of the

988
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:22,480
unobtainable something we need something

989
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:24,559
we we we demand to have uh that is going

990
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:27,240
to help Humanity help us whether it's in

991
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:29,920
the medical domain or whatever think

992
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:32,720
about that that we need an advanced the

993
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:35,200
science to get there that's that's what

994
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:36,880
we do great and that's what we should do

995
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:40,079
more of and that's what we should just

996
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:42,440
dedicate ourselves to yeah with that

997
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:46,200
please thank these uh the panel for a

998
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:46,200
very enlightening discussion
