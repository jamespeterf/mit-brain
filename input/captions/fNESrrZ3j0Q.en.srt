00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,799
For me, metal has always been a research

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,640
topic, but this class kind of just

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,720
introduces you to another idea of like

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,440
bladesmithing is an engineering effort

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:14,000
and it's fun and it's creative. What I

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,640
got most out of it personally was

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,279
feeling that connection with with older

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,520
techniques.

9
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,760
>> All this physical intuition that you're

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,840
very far removed from when you're purely

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,000
pursuing an academic route was kind of

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:31,039
developed through this class. It relates

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,160
back to who we are as creatures on this

14
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:37,200
planet. If we didn't have that creative

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,120
spark, we wouldn't be here today. And so

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,600
when you give someone the opportunity

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,640
and guide them to actually make

18
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,520
something with their hands, there's very

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,239
few things that are as satisfying as

20
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,160
that.
