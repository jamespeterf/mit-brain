1
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,720
Hey everyone.

2
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,119
Um, today and this week we are going to

3
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,760
talk about the a connection between

4
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:27,199
homogeneous dynamics and projection

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,679
theory. Um today is by the way the first

6
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,679
day of the Simon's lectures. Marina

7
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,040
Vioska is giving them this year and

8
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,640
she's going to be talking about sphere

9
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,960
packing and um I got interested in this

10
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,680
two years ago when Alon Lynen Strauss

11
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,200
came to give the Simon's lectures and he

12
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,960
was talking about homogeneous dynamics

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,960
and he explained a little bit this

14
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,480
connection with projection theory and I

15
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:53,600
have been trying to understand it since

16
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:56,320
then. um and uh it's uh it's a pretty

17
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,879
geometric visual thing. So I brought

18
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,600
some tools with me and the goal of the

19
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:03,920
class is to try to understand visually

20
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,000
geometrically uh how homogeneous

21
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,280
dynamics is related to projection

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,520
theory. Um

23
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,040
okay so let's let's first say uh a

24
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,040
little bit what what is homogeneous

25
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,040
dynamics.

26
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,119
Okay. So we're going to uh be working

27
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,280
with spaces that have a lot of

28
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,920
symmetries. And so the spaces will come

29
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:49,680
from a league group. So G will be a

30
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:53,040
league group. Um for example, SLNR

31
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:56,040
and inside of G there'll be a discrete

32
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,040
subgroup.

33
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,040
So EG,

34
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,640
SLN Z.

35
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:09,280
And then we're going to be studying the

36
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:12,000
quotient space G mod gamma.

37
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,239
So this is called a homogeneous space.

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,080
So we'll see it has a lot of symmetries.

39
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,920
Um and so the homogeneous and

40
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,239
homogeneous dynamics is we're acting on

41
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:23,920
this homogeneous space.

42
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:29,120
Okay. Now what does dynamics mean? Um

43
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:32,800
suppose that H is a subgroup of G

44
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:36,640
and then if X is a point in G mod gamma

45
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:39,120
then we can look at H dox. So H acts on

46
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:42,160
G mod gamma. So you can talk about H dox

47
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:46,760
that's called an orbit. And the question

48
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,760
is to describe the orbits.

49
00:02:53,040 --> 00:03:01,360
Okay. So let's make a picture. Um so in

50
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:05,040
actual group GR

51
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:08,159
G this um there might be some group

52
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,319
element and then um you could take a

53
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:13,599
co-et

54
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:16,319
h.g and that h might be non-compact so

55
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:19,360
that might go on forever but somehow

56
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:22,080
it's not that complicated. Yeah. for

57
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,239
taking the quotient gamma

58
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,800
is what are the conditions for gamma to

59
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,360
be a normal subgroup fill out this

60
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,959
question. So this so this object is not

61
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,120
a group

62
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,280
>> it's just a space

63
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,040
>> right so gamma is a so so the question

64
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,440
was about whether whether gamma is

65
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,360
normal um and the answer is gamma

66
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,319
doesn't have to be normal so this this

67
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,319
is not a normal subgroup of this that

68
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:49,280
means that this is not a group but it's

69
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:55,040
still a space

70
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:57,200
okay um so gm mod gamma oh and I I I'll

71
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,000
put something else so gmod gamma uh

72
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,519
where we'll assume that the volume of or

73
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,080
we'll be interested in cases where the

74
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,760
volume of G mod gamma is finite. So the

75
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,879
volume of G is infinite but the volume

76
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:12,599
of G mod gamma is finite. So G mod gamma

77
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,599
looks sort of like this.

78
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,239
Um, and so then there's a point X in

79
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,880
there and the orbit goes through X, but

80
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:21,880
then it wraps around

81
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:28,240
and the picture looks a lot more

82
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,199
complicated already. And we want to

83
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:34,479
understand what what does this do? Is it

84
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:36,400
um is it going to wrap back on itself

85
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,720
and just just go around over and over

86
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,360
again the same thing? Or is it going to

87
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,320
evenly distribute all over G mod gamma

88
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:47,040
or or something else?

89
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,280
Okay.

90
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,919
So to make it concrete, I'd like to

91
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:54,560
begin with a with a very simple warm-up

92
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:58,680
um which is with a commutative group. So

93
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,680
it's it's simpler than that.

94
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:11,840
Okay. So uh so I think the simplest

95
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:15,280
example of this is that G could be R2

96
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:20,880
and then gamma could be Z2. So G mod

97
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:23,520
gamma is uh R2 mod Z2. It's a Tors.

98
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,639
All right. And H is going to be a

99
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:30,520
subgroup of G. And let's say it's like a

100
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,520
one parameter subgroup.

101
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:37,600
I'll do a couple of examples. H could be

102
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:40,800
the subgroup T2 T

103
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:44,400
and R there's a subgroup of R2 and if we

104
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:47,520
do this what happens um so I'll

105
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,600
visualize G mod gamma as a square with

106
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:54,080
sides identified

107
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:57,600
um and if I were to take so let's say X

108
00:05:54,080 --> 00:06:00,479
knot is like is just gamma which is an

109
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:04,240
element of G by gamma it's like you you

110
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:06,160
take the identity in G and push down.

111
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,080
Um, okay. So, what does the orbit

112
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:13,440
through x knot look like? Well, it's

113
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:14,960
this line of slope 2 looks like that

114
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,080
and then it comes back where it started

115
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,600
and it just keeps going like that. Okay.

116
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,360
And actually, it wouldn't be it's a

117
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,880
little harder to draw accurately, but it

118
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:27,120
wouldn't be different if you started at

119
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:30,000
any other point. So x if you start at

120
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:34,479
any point x then if I were to add 1

121
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,319
comma 2 that would be equal to x in r2

122
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:39,919
z2

123
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:42,720
and so actually every orbit is periodic.

124
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:46,960
So the conclusion in example one is that

125
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:49,680
h dox is periodic

126
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:52,160
for every x.

127
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:55,039
Okay. Example two, I'll take a different

128
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,600
one parameter subgroup t comma

129
00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:00,160
square<unk> of 2t

130
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:02,960
t.

131
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:06,400
Okay. So now what happens?

132
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:09,599
Well, if I if I again start at x knot is

133
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:12,479
the identity. Um now I'm going up at

134
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:15,520
slope square<unk> of two

135
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:17,759
the top and keep going at slope square

136
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:21,039
root of two. And this time this will

137
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:24,880
this will never close up because uh the

138
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:27,599
slope is irrational. Um and in fact this

139
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,360
this orbit will be dense and even evenly

140
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:33,120
distributed.

141
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:36,400
So now what happens is that h dox

142
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:40,120
is dense

143
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,120
for every x.

144
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:48,319
Okay. I won't do a proof right now. Um

145
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,759
but um I'll make a remark there. So

146
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,240
there are several proofs but there's

147
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,240
there's a nice proof using for analysis

148
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,800
that we might talk about later if we if

149
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,800
we feel like it.

150
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,240
Okay. Questions or comments so far?

151
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,680
Okay. So we've seen two things that

152
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:15,199
could happen. The orbit could be

153
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,879
periodic and the orbit could be dense.

154
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,400
uh and we haven't yet seen other things

155
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,720
but we might wonder about whether other

156
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,639
things could happen and now we can shift

157
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,759
to a more complicated non-communive

158
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:28,759
group like SL2R

159
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,759
okay

160
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,519
um

161
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:51,279
so Now let's say G is SL2R

162
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:55,760
and gamma is SL2Z.

163
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:57,600
Okay. And um there's there are multiple

164
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,440
reasons for looking at these quotients G

165
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,800
mod gamma but one of them that comes up

166
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,279
for this particular example is that

167
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:08,720
these parameterize lises.

168
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:10,560
So gamma is this space of latises

169
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,000
in R2

170
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:17,279
with the property latticees lambda in R2

171
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:21,279
with the property that the area of R2

172
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:24,959
mod lambda is one.

173
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:30,720
Um so let's do a proof sketch.

174
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:34,320
So um any such lattice we can write as G

175
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:37,120
times the lattice Z ^2 where G is an

176
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,040
SL2R.

177
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,920
So you can make any lattice by starting

178
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:44,800
with with Z ^ squ and applying a a

179
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,959
linear transformation. Okay. However

180
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:55,200
there's more than one G that gives you

181
00:09:46,959 --> 00:10:01,040
the same lambda. So um if H is in SL2Z

182
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:04,399
then HZ2 is Z2 and therefore G * HZ2 is

183
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:08,880
G * Z2 and these guys give you the same

184
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:11,880
lice. So the space of lises is G modulo

185
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,880
SL2Z.

186
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,040
Okay.

187
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:26,800
All right. Now, this uh space of lises G

188
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:28,560
mod gamma is not compact. Um and I will

189
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,279
give you an example of a sequence of

190
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,720
lises that don't converge to anything.

191
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:36,399
Don't have a subsequence that converge

192
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:39,040
to anything. So example we could take

193
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:43,440
lambdaepsilon

194
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:45,440
to be epsilon z direct sum epsilon

195
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,040
inverse z.

196
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,040
So this is a lattice which is very

197
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,560
skinny in one direction and very tall in

198
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,519
the other direction and has co- volume

199
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,880
one and as epsilon goes to zero this is

200
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,399
not going to converge to anything. So

201
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:00,240
the space of lises is not compact

202
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:03,760
and this is the only reason that the

203
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:08,079
space of lises is not compact. So a

204
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:10,000
definition k epsilon is a subset of g

205
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:12,399
mod gamma.

206
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:17,040
Kepsilon is defined to be the set of

207
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:20,320
lises. So that the minimum over nonzero

208
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:22,320
v in our lattice of the size v is at

209
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,959
least epsilon is greater than or equal

210
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:28,800
to let's say epsilon.

211
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:32,839
Okay. And there's a a proposition which

212
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,839
is called the moler criterion.

213
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:41,959
that says for every epsilon bigger than

214
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,959
zero kepsilon is compact.

215
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,320
Um so um so a picture of of G mod gamma

216
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,480
it's something like this. G mod gamma is

217
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:56,240
threedimensional so it's um not super

218
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:58,560
easy to draw. Um but over here so this

219
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:02,440
would be G mod gamma. There's this

220
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,440
non-compact part

221
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:11,000
and you make a cut off maybe here and

222
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,000
this stuff is K epsilon.

223
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,680
Okay. Um so I won't prove this in

224
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,839
detail. This is not super difficult. If

225
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,560
you think about uh two vectors that

226
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:28,880
generate lambda, um if there if we're in

227
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,959
k epsilon, the vectors definitely cannot

228
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,959
be too close to zero. And you can also

229
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:35,200
always find two vectors that are not too

230
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:37,120
giant because the area of the thing is

231
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:41,240
one. This gives you sort of a compact

232
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,240
set of choices of these two vectors.

233
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,639
Okay, so it gives a little bit of

234
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:47,800
intuition about what the space gamma

235
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,800
looks like.

236
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:58,760
Okay. Now, inside of there, we have some

237
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,760
interesting one parameter subgroups

238
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,360
of of of G of SL2R.

239
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:10,639
So, one of them is the unipotent

240
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:13,120
subgroup. So, that's the set of 1 T 01

241
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:15,440
T and R. And the other one is the

242
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,399
diagonal subgroup. So this is I'll call

243
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:21,040
this so it's the set of u t. So this

244
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:24,320
matrix is u subt and there's the

245
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:26,800
diagonal subgroup e to the r e to the

246
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:30,079
minus r 0

247
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:32,720
little r the reals and this I'll call

248
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:34,800
the set of a sub r. So this matrix here

249
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,480
is called a sub r. Okay. So those are

250
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,079
one parameter subgroups. And now we can

251
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,240
ask our question about what the orbits

252
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,240
look like.

253
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:50,399
Okay. Um,

254
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:54,959
cool. So, um, so there's a theorem that

255
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:56,560
goes back to the 1930s. Headed in the

256
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,839
1930s,

257
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:01,839
he said that a U orbit

258
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,399
is either

259
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:07,360
periodic

260
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:11,199
or dense.

261
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:13,440
Okay. And but in contrast there's a

262
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:17,680
guess I'll also call it a theorem. I

263
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:21,839
don't know who proved this when um that

264
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:24,079
uh d orbit does not have to be

265
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,600
maybe neither

266
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:29,000
periodic

267
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,000
nor dense.

268
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,120
Okay, let me say something more than

269
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,680
that about how these d orbits can be

270
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:39,120
really quite complicated. So here's G

271
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:42,480
mod gamma and inside of G mod gamma pick

272
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:47,519
out three small balls that are not too

273
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:50,519
close together. So B1, B2, B3 are small

274
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,519
balls.

275
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:57,760
Okay. Then for any sequence of ones and

276
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:01,519
twos.

277
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:07,120
So for example the sequence 1 one two

278
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:12,320
one two one two two two one any sequence

279
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:15,120
um there exists an x in gamma

280
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:18,079
so that

281
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,959
the d- orbit of x

282
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:26,800
never hits b3

283
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:28,320
and the d- orbit of x hits b1 and b2

284
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,880
many times.

285
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,880
in this sequence.

286
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:38,440
So, what must this orbit look like?

287
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:46,160
Um, let's see. So, first it hits B1 and

288
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,880
it goes through there. Then it goes

289
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,639
around and it the next thing it hits is

290
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,279
also B1.

291
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:56,320
And it goes around and the next thing it

292
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:59,839
hits is B2. and it keeps going and the

293
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:03,880
next thing it hits is B1 and so on

294
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,880
and it never touches B3.

295
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:11,120
Okay, so this orbit apparently is not

296
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:13,920
dense because it never intersects B3 and

297
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:18,519
it is not periodic if this sequence is

298
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,519
not periodic. So it's something else.

299
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:26,959
Okay. So, so d orbits can do this

300
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:30,079
somewhat crazy thing, somewhat chaotic

301
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:34,240
thing that we're anyway. Um, but U

302
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:37,440
orbits can't. U orbits can be periodic.

303
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:41,440
Um so if you were to take

304
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:45,880
u of x knot um

305
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,880
uh this is periodic

306
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:52,320
and the reason is um so if you take so x

307
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:55,320
so x knot corresponds to the matrix 1

308
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,320
one

309
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:03,040
uh times time s 2z

310
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:08,079
so now if I were to take one one tx knot

311
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:11,919
that's equal to x knot in gy gamma.

312
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:14,000
Uh if t is an integer.

313
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:17,839
So that's a periodic orbit. It makes a

314
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:21,199
closed circle in in gm mod gamma.

315
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:25,199
Um okay. Uh but if you were to start

316
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:27,760
with a kind of weird looking choice of x

317
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,360
knot um and you were to do this then it

318
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,960
won't there won't be any obvious

319
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:34,559
periodicity.

320
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:36,160
Um so for most

321
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:39,679
for most x so that's that's let's that's

322
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:43,440
let's let's suppose now x is uh <unk>2

323
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:46,320
01 over <unk>2

324
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,880
okay so now what happens when we and

325
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:51,440
then times sl2z

326
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:57,600
so now what is

327
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:59,440
ut of x that's one t <unk>20 one over

328
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,440
<unk>2

329
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,799
Um,

330
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:08,440
okay. So, that'll be <unk>2,

331
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:08,440
that'll be

332
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:16,720
<unk>2, that'll be t over <unk>2.

333
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:20,799
Um, this will be zero.

334
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:23,799
This will be 1 over <unk>2.

335
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,799
And

336
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,799
oh, that one might be periodic. I think

337
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,799
I picked the wrong example.

338
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:38,120
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Sorry. Um that was

339
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,120
unhelpful.

340
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,280
Okay. So, so to see why they're not all

341
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,799
periodic, let's let's instead try to

342
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,960
visualize what is happening to the

343
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:58,400
lattice.

344
00:18:52,960 --> 00:19:00,400
So a point uh a point x corresponds to a

345
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:03,360
lice

346
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,440
uh lambda x.

347
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:08,240
And if you think about what what is

348
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:12,000
happening if you take gx

349
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:16,640
that corresponds to the lice

350
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,320
g of lambda of x. So g is in sl2r. It

351
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,840
acts on r2. It moves a lattice to

352
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,919
another lattice and that's what the

353
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:27,520
action is.

354
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:30,080
Okay. And so now G is going to be UT.

355
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:32,720
And the way UT acts on R2 is by

356
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:36,559
shearing.

357
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:40,160
So UT acts on R2

358
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:43,160
um by shearing. So I'll I'll do it this

359
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,160
way.

360
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:51,039
So I'll draw some points in R2. And

361
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:55,360
perhaps coincidentally, these points

362
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:59,360
come from a lattice. Um, and then I'll

363
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:04,400
illustrate what UT does. Um, so if this

364
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:07,360
is the point P, then this over here is

365
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:09,520
UT of P.

366
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,520
It's a shearing motion. And so the

367
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,200
shearing motion moves everybody

368
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,559
horizontally. And it moves you

369
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,720
horizontally, but at an amount

370
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:18,559
proportional to your height. So this one

371
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,080
moves horizontally, but a bit less. And

372
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,160
this one moves horizontally and a bit

373
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:25,200
more.

374
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:27,919
Okay. Now what would it mean? So this so

375
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,240
so you start with a lattice and when we

376
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:34,000
apply this uniport orbit to the lattice

377
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:36,000
every point in the lattice is shearing.

378
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,240
What would it mean if the orbit was

379
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,320
periodic? Well, it would mean that this

380
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,880
point this lattice point is shearing

381
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:45,120
along and eventually it reaches another

382
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,120
lattice point.

383
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:52,320
So

384
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:57,360
if ux is periodic,

385
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:59,840
um that implies that each

386
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:03,039
lattice point

387
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:06,600
is at the same height

388
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,600
as another

389
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,880
lattice point,

390
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:14,640
right? So there must be another lattice

391
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:16,799
point somewhere over here.

392
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,320
Okay, but now think about this. This

393
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:21,039
difference is also in our lattice

394
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:23,520
because a lattice is a subgroup

395
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:25,280
and this distance is is horizontal. So

396
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:30,799
this is

397
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:35,200
um if and only if um there exists if and

398
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:40,039
only if lambda of x contains a vector of

399
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,039
the form x1 comma 0.

400
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:47,039
So most lises don't contain a vector on

401
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:48,799
the x-axis. So u * x is usually not

402
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:51,600
periodic.

403
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:56,919
And then um the difficult theorem is

404
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:56,919
that in that situation u * x is dense.

405
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:05,760
Okay,

406
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:08,640
cool. So this is the situation in SL2

407
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:12,559
and the situation in other league groups

408
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:14,240
say SLNR for larger N is more difficult

409
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:19,600
and more recent but there are similar

410
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:22,640
theorems. Um so for SL3R

411
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:26,720
uh for SL3R Margulus and Donnie in the

412
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:29,360
1980s proved an analog of this theorem

413
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,840
and then for all the SLNR and and all

414
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:35,640
the groups Ratner around 1990 proved an

415
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,640
analog of this theorem.

416
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:41,440
Um cool.

417
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:43,360
Okay.

418
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,280
Um

419
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,120
so that's a little summary of some kinds

420
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,200
of theorems.

421
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:51,600
There's some motivations for this.

422
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,640
There's some motivation from Yeah.

423
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:57,280
>> Just a kind of a question about the link

424
00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:00,720
between the lises and the elements of

425
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:02,400
the uh quotient group. Um so up up there

426
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,640
in the definition of kp epsilon there's

427
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,640
kind of what looks like some sort of

428
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,440
norm the minimum size of v or the

429
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,919
non-zero vector v in the does that

430
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:16,640
generate the same topology as the the

431
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:19,640
quotient topology from so

432
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,640
um

433
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:26,640
so the question is about the topology of

434
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:29,280
gmod gamma and how the topology of gmod

435
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,120
gamma plays with this definition of

436
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:34,640
Kepsilon.

437
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:36,400
Yeah. Um in a moment we'll put a metric

438
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,440
on G mod gamma and that's what its

439
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:44,640
topology is. It's a manifold. It has um

440
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:48,960
topology manifold. Um and um this thing

441
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:54,159
here is a continuous function on on our

442
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:56,000
um on our uh space of lises.

443
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,760
Another way to say what the topology is

444
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
is you know if you describe a lattice as

445
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,679
the span of two particular vectors if

446
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,080
you slightly perturb those particular

447
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:08,520
vectors that will be a slight change in

448
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,520
the in the space of latises

449
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:17,679
>> is is that definition similar anyway to

450
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:21,880
have a minimum I guess you're right not

451
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,880
quite thanks

452
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:32,000
Okay. So when I introduced homogeneous

453
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:35,279
dynamics, I mentioned some application

454
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:38,000
in number theory. The uh uh connection

455
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:40,080
to the Oenheim Davenport conjecture

456
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,240
which is about the values of quadratic

457
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:45,919
forms. Um and it's a nice that that's a

458
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,279
nice connection. I feel like we already

459
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:48,720
talked about a little bit and if you

460
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:51,360
wanted to read about it, it's also easy

461
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:55,279
to read about it. Um, so I wanted to

462
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:57,360
spend the class time on um, uh, yeah.

463
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:59,279
Okay. So I wanted So okay, so I wanted

464
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,960
to spend the class time on trying to get

465
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:03,279
intuition for why something like this

466
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:06,320
would be true and also maybe why

467
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:08,720
something like this would be false. And

468
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,559
um, there are many different ways of

469
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,960
thinking about homogeneous dynamics.

470
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:16,240
There's a big literature, but I want to

471
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:19,039
highlight the way of of connecting it to

472
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,640
projection theory. Um, and that's not

473
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:23,840
one of the classical ways. It's actually

474
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:28,640
not super easy to find in the

475
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:31,640
literature. Um the the

476
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,640
um

477
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,760
um so it appears in these recent works

478
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,600
of Lynden Strauss and Mohammadi and

479
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,360
their collaborators and they're trying

480
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,440
they're doing you know the cutting edge

481
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,720
of homogeneous dynamics and the

482
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,320
particular problem they're trying to

483
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,159
solve is to do first of all these

484
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,240
higherdimensional things that Margulus

485
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,159
and Ratner and Donnie were doing and

486
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,159
second of all instead of having a

487
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:54,799
qualitative theorem like this to have a

488
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:56,559
quantitative theorem that says If you're

489
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:57,760
not approximately periodic for some

490
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,760
length, then you're, you know,

491
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:02,320
quantitatively

492
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:04,720
uh dense.

493
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:07,120
Um, okay. And at that point, the they

494
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,880
had they ran into some things that the

495
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,960
many interesting classical techniques

496
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,120
did could not do or could not obviously

497
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,520
do and they invented this new technique,

498
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,279
this connection to projection theory.

499
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:20,080
But in hindsight, you could also look

500
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:22,720
back at the oldest theorems, the oldest

501
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:25,520
theorems like this one, and you could

502
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,200
approach it using projection theory. And

503
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,480
it may not be the best approach to this

504
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,640
theorem. It's certainly not the only

505
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,400
approach to this theorem, but but uh but

506
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,799
it's a it's a way of looking at it and

507
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,559
and quite a visual way of looking at at

508
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:41,360
what's going on. So the goal of the

509
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:44,640
class is to try to explain um uh

510
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:47,360
uh the how projection theory could help

511
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,120
to understand something like this.

512
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:52,240
Okay.

513
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:54,080
Okay. Um great. So we're going to do

514
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,000
some geometry. So next we we need to

515
00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:00,480
think about the geometry on the space G

516
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:02,960
mod gamma. Um and um

517
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:06,200
uh and how that geometry interacts with

518
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,200
the action.

519
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,320
Oops.

520
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:17,940
[Applause]

521
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:35,880
Okay. So geometry of gamma.

522
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:46,559
Okay. So

523
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:50,320
first we'll talk about the right action

524
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:54,080
of G on itself.

525
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:56,880
Right? So if G is in G, there's a right

526
00:27:54,080 --> 00:28:00,080
action which is a map from G to itself.

527
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:02,559
And the right action G of H is H. and

528
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,480
you multiply by G on the right side. So

529
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:06,159
these groups don't commute. So it's, you

530
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,919
know, it matters which side you put it

531
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:10,720
on. And actually you have to be quite

532
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,880
quite careful in this story.

533
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,399
Okay. So that's a map from from G to

534
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,120
itself.

535
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:19,440
Um,

536
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:22,000
now we're going to use that to start to

537
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:26,000
put a geometry on G. Going to have a

538
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:28,559
right invariant

539
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,200
metric

540
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:31,200
M.

541
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:38,240
Okay.

542
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:40,799
So, how does this work? Um, so, so what

543
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:44,080
does that mean? So, M is going to be a

544
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:48,720
Romanian metric

545
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:52,240
on G and for every G and G, we have this

546
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:56,080
right action G. So, that's a map from

547
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:57,919
our group with its metric to itself. And

548
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,919
this is for every G and G, this is an

549
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:01,279
isometry.

550
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:03,679
That's what it that's what it means to

551
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:06,000
have a right invariant metric. Where do

552
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:08,480
they come from? Um the idea is that

553
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,760
we'll put a metric at the origin and

554
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:15,039
then we'll use R subg to help define the

555
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,720
metric at every other place.

556
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:19,720
Um

557
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,720
okay.

558
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:27,360
Okay. So um a lot of what we'll say here

559
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:31,520
works for any group but to be concrete

560
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:34,320
I'm going to stick to the group SL2R

561
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:37,679
the tangent space at the origin. So E E

562
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:39,360
is or the the identity I was using the

563
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:40,799
word origin I should say identity T is E

564
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,640
is the identity in the group. The

565
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:46,480
tangent space in the identity of this

566
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:51,399
group is the space of matrices A B C D

567
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:51,399
with A + D equal to Z.

568
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:58,480
Um so this is not a deep factor. This is

569
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:02,000
so SL2R is matrices A B C D where A D

570
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:03,520
minus BC equals 1 and the identity is a

571
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,240
is a matrix that's sitting in there in

572
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:08,240
R4. So it's the the group is a

573
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,919
threedimensional manifold in R4 and this

574
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,520
is just its tangent space in the usual

575
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:14,240
sense.

576
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:19,559
Okay. So that's it tangent space. So now

577
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:19,559
m is going to be a metric

578
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:27,520
on t and I can specify it by by

579
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,679
specifying who an orthonormal basis and

580
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:32,720
this choice doesn't matter super a lot

581
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:36,080
but um but there's a convenient choice.

582
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:41,919
So my orthonormal basis

583
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:46,399
of Mn is going to be 0 1 0 0. So which

584
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:52,559
I'll call u 0 0 1 0 which I'll call u

585
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:55,840
tilda and then uh 1 / <unk>2 0 - 1 /2

586
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:58,080
which I'll call D.

587
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:00,000
um these root twos are not actually

588
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,919
important but this this orthonormal

589
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,760
basis happens to be the orthoral basis

590
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,679
that corresponds to the metric where you

591
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:10,320
just take the metric on R4 and restrict

592
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:11,840
it to to uh this subspace.

593
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,840
Okay.

594
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:16,480
So now how will we define the metric

595
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:21,200
elsewhere?

596
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:23,039
So now suppose G is in our group. Um

597
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:27,120
R subg

598
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:30,399
of the identity is G. It's easy to check

599
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:34,000
from the definition of R subg.

600
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:36,799
And therefore R subg defines a map from

601
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,200
T tangent space E of G to the tangent

602
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:41,600
space G of G. And this map is an

603
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:44,080
isomeorphism.

604
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:48,480
We have a metric over here. We use this

605
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:51,840
map to define a metric over there.

606
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:56,880
So now we define

607
00:31:51,840 --> 00:32:00,000
mg which is a a metric or inner product

608
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:02,480
MG on TG.

609
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:09,679
So that

610
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:14,559
RG goes from T E G comma M KN to T G

611
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:14,559
comma MG. So that that's an isometry.

612
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:23,279
Okay. And then it's an exercise to check

613
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:25,430
that this thing we just defined is right

614
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:26,640
invariant. So So

615
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:28,720
[Applause]

616
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,130
that all of these maps are isometries

617
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:33,359
everywhere.

618
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:33,359
[Applause]

619
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:41,600
Okay.

620
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,600
All

621
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:59,840
right. So now because m is right

622
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:02,640
invariant

623
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:05,640
um

624
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,640
uh

625
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:14,519
we we get a metric it it sends to a

626
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:14,519
metric m on g mod g.

627
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:24,240
So how does that work? Um so we have

628
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:27,600
like all of G have a projection map pi

629
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:30,720
to G mod gamma. We have a point X and G

630
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:34,640
mod gamma. And X has many pre-im images.

631
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:39,360
Um so X is equal to say little G *

632
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:42,360
little G little little H* gamma.

633
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,360
So

634
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,200
okay

635
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:57,840
so the pre-image of X is these many

636
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:59,519
different points. Okay. Now I have a

637
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,840
metric upstairs and I'd like to try to

638
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:04,240
define a metric downstairs in a natural

639
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:07,360
way. So I'd like to define a metric

640
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:09,119
here. So for each of these lifts

641
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:11,359
upstairs, I can take the metric there

642
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:13,919
and I can use the map pi and I can

643
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:15,679
produce a metric over here.

644
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:17,599
There's no canonical choice of which of

645
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,679
these purple points in the pre-image I

646
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,359
should use. But because our metric

647
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:23,359
upstairs is right invariant, they all

648
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:26,879
give the same answer. And so there's a

649
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:28,399
coherent choice.

650
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:33,240
Okay.

651
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:33,240
So that gives us a metric on GMO gap.

652
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:41,960
All right.

653
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:41,960
So now have also a left action

654
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:50,000
of G on G.

655
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:53,599
Okay. So if G is in G, the left action

656
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:57,200
of G is also a map from G to itself.

657
00:34:53,599 --> 00:35:01,359
Left action G of H is G inverse on the

658
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:03,839
left H. So the word left and left action

659
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:06,480
is because the the thing that comes from

660
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:08,000
G is over here. Um the inverse is not

661
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,839
super important in our discussion today,

662
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,920
but it causes this to behave correctly

663
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:15,680
when you compose elements in the group.

664
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:18,000
And so it's traditional to do this.

665
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:20,160
Okay.

666
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,640
Right.

667
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:24,480
So um

668
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:27,359
SLG

669
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:30,599
is not

670
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:30,599
an isometry

671
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:36,480
of our group with our right invariant

672
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,800
metric

673
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,320
and that's very important. It's very

674
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:44,480
important to our whole discussion to

675
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:51,800
understand um geometrically how this

676
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:51,800
operation uh affects this space. Right.

677
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:59,800
Okay. So, let's see what happens. Um,

678
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:06,640
right. So, it's easiest to see what

679
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:10,079
happens around the identity and you can

680
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:14,640
do it starting at other points too.

681
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:18,079
So here's the identity and here's some G

682
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:19,920
and I have a map the left action by G

683
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:22,000
inverse that takes the identity over

684
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:25,040
here.

685
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,720
And now this action it's not clear from

686
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:29,280
what we've said whether it preserves the

687
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:32,800
metric. In fact it distorts the metric.

688
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:36,160
Um but how can we figure out what what

689
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:38,880
this mapping is doing to the metric?

690
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:42,000
Well, our metric was defined to be right

691
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:45,520
invariant. So there's a map going the

692
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:48,400
other direction. The right uh action by

693
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:50,400
G inverse that takes G back to the

694
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,760
identity. And this one we do understand

695
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,839
what it does to the metric. It's an

696
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:56,240
isometry.

697
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:58,720
So if I want to understand what this map

698
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:02,720
did to the metric, it's a reasonable

699
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:04,800
idea to look at this and then this.

700
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,480
That part is an isometry. So all of the

701
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,079
distortion of the metric came from this

702
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,800
part.

703
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:13,760
Um and this composition is going to be a

704
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:17,839
little easier to understand.

705
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:21,839
Okay. So what happens if I if I do this?

706
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:24,960
If I take a left action by G inverse and

707
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:28,160
a right action by G inverse and I apply

708
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:30,400
it to H.

709
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,839
These these guys uh commute with each

710
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,240
other. We'll see when we write it out.

711
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:38,760
So, um, I don't have to be super careful

712
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:38,760
what order to write them in. Yeah.

713
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,359
>> What's that?

714
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,480
>> Yeah, I guess I should really write it

715
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,480
in the other order, although it doesn't

716
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,480
matter.

717
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:00,320
So, I want you to imagine I started with

718
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:02,160
E or maybe somebody else near E. I

719
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,880
applied left G inverse and then I

720
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:07,359
applied right G inverse and we're gonna

721
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:09,520
see what happens.

722
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:14,480
Okay. So just from the formulas this is

723
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:18,400
right action of G inverse of GH

724
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:20,240
and that's GHG inverse. So actually it's

725
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,480
something natural and important. It's

726
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:26,560
conjugating.

727
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:30,480
So I'll call this uh C subg of H

728
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:35,280
conjugating by G of H.

729
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:38,960
Okay, cool. So conjugating by H then

730
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:41,599
induces a map from the tangent space of

731
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:44,400
E to itself.

732
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:47,119
Right? So so conjugating by G is a map

733
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:49,280
from the group to itself and it sends

734
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:50,880
the identity to the identity and

735
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:54,800
therefore it sends the tangent space to

736
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:56,480
the tangent space. All right. And uh we

737
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,400
can see what we we can write we can

738
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:01,440
write this down and we can see what it

739
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:04,880
does. Um and

740
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:06,800
um if if this thing is distorting the

741
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,720
geometry it means that this thing was

742
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:12,000
distorting the geometry and in exactly

743
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:15,200
the same way.

744
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:18,240
So we could say it's you could say more

745
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:22,400
than this but the singular values

746
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:24,240
of LG inverse are equal to the singular

747
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:28,920
values

748
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:28,920
of um CG.

749
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:35,920
All right. So what you know what they

750
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:37,280
are depends on G. So I'm going to pick a

751
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,599
nice G and we're actually going to

752
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:42,640
compute them to see how the geometry is

753
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:42,640
being distorted. All

754
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:49,190
[Applause]

755
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:14,720
right. So the interesting uh G's are

756
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,119
going to be from those one parameter

757
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:18,880
subgroups up there. And the one that

758
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:20,640
looks up looks the nicest and where this

759
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:23,599
is calculation is the most important is

760
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:26,800
for that diagonal matrix A R. So we're

761
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:30,720
going to compute what that does.

762
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:33,599
Okay. So I'm going to look at C A R

763
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:35,520
that goes from the tangent space to

764
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:39,440
itself.

765
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:44,240
Um so the tangent space is the set of

766
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:47,119
matrices a b c d with a + d equals zero.

767
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:48,960
Let's call this matrix m

768
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:57,359
and we're

769
00:40:48,960 --> 00:41:01,280
so c a r of m is a r m a r inverse.

770
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:05,760
So that's e to the r e to the minus r a

771
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:07,920
b c d e to the minus r e to the r.

772
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:10,000
Right? So this is a sub r. That's just

773
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:13,680
the definition. This is a sub r inverse.

774
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:16,480
So I switched the minus signs.

775
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:20,400
Okay? So

776
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:22,160
I did this very carefully. Uh it's not

777
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,440
super instructive to watch me do it very

778
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,680
carefully. So I'm just going to write

779
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:33,839
down the answer.

780
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:36,160
It's a d e 2 r b eus 2 r c.

781
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:39,599
So this conjugation what it does is it

782
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:41,280
doesn't change the diagonal. It

783
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:45,440
magnifies

784
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:48,000
this component and it uh demagnifies

785
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,680
that component. So that happens to be

786
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:54,520
something we can describe really nicely

787
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:54,520
in the orthonormal basis that I picked.

788
00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:01,359
All right. So,

789
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:03,280
C A R of U.

790
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:06,560
So,

791
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:10,640
is E 2R U.

792
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:15,119
C A R of utilda is E to the minus 2 R U

793
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:17,680
tilda and C A R D is D.

794
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:20,240
This conjugation behaves really nicely

795
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:22,079
in this basis. But you can see that it

796
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:24,800
does not preserve the metric. It

797
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:29,440
stretches that one. it compresses that

798
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:32,800
one and it preserves that one.

799
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:36,480
Okay. So the conclusion from this is

800
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:38,480
that l a r inverse

801
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:42,240
uh

802
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:46,319
of u

803
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:49,839
the length of that is e 2r

804
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:52,000
l a r inverse of u tilda has length e to

805
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:57,920
the minus 2r

806
00:42:52,000 --> 00:43:00,640
l a r inverse of d has length one and uh

807
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:02,400
it also preserved angles right so We

808
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:05,520
just stretched things but we didn't tilt

809
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:10,880
anything. So

810
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:14,119
l a r inverse of u of ut tilda and of d

811
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,119
are orthogonal.

812
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:20,560
So this describes how the left action by

813
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,960
this matrix is distorting the geometry

814
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,960
of the space.

815
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:29,440
Okay. And we also can make some kind of

816
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:32,960
picture. Um

817
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:38,079
so suppose this is a quote unquote cube

818
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:41,040
in G. Um where this is the

819
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:42,960
U direction this is the utilda direction

820
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:46,319
and the direction into the board is the

821
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:49,359
D direction. So what will happen to it

822
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:51,760
when we do this? Um the U direction gets

823
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:54,240
really long the utild direction gets

824
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:57,040
really short other direction is

825
00:43:54,240 --> 00:44:00,040
preserved. So it looks kind of like

826
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:00,040
that.

827
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:06,400
Okay.

828
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:08,560
Um, one thing that you can notice from

829
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:12,960
the picture and from the calculation is

830
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:16,720
that um, while L inverse distorts

831
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:22,440
lengths, distorts the metric,

832
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:22,440
it nevertheless preserves the volume.

833
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:42,359
Okay. So that's how the left action uh

834
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:42,359
distorts the geometry.

835
00:44:53,359 --> 00:45:00,280
Okay.

836
00:44:54,880 --> 00:45:00,280
And we also have a left action.

837
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:05,880
of G on G mod gamma,

838
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:15,760
right? And so how does that work? Um

839
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:17,359
well, LG of H gamma is just G inverse H

840
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:19,040
gamma

841
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:22,240
because the gamma is on the right and

842
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:24,240
this guy is on the left. They sort of

843
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:27,680
don't interfere with each other. And so

844
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:31,280
this is an actual group action.

845
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:33,760
Um so LG maps

846
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:38,440
G mod gamma to itself

847
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:38,440
and it is a bjection.

848
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:43,000
It distorts the metric

849
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:49,000
but it preserves

850
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:49,000
the ball.

851
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:54,880
Okay. And maybe I should say we just

852
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:56,800
computed this carefully for a particular

853
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:59,599
element G which is these diagonal

854
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:01,599
elements. You could take any G there

855
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:03,200
don't doesn't have to be diagonal. It

856
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:05,680
will distort the metric in some

857
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:07,839
different way. Every G is different but

858
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:09,280
they all preserve the volume. We didn't

859
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:12,319
really prove that because I just did one

860
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,720
example but it's true.

861
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:15,359
>> Yeah.

862
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:18,079
>> Are you able to show that by showing

863
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:20,960
like that in a second? uh the u u of t

864
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:23,040
one parameter subgroup um does it change

865
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:26,240
the volume and like do those two two one

866
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:28,160
prime subgroups generate a g of pump

867
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:30,000
>> yeah so the question was if we wanted to

868
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:32,000
to check that it preserve that that

869
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,079
every G preserves the volume it would be

870
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:38,400
enough to check a few G's that generate

871
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:40,319
it um and um yeah so so we could if we

872
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:43,040
did the computation with the potent one

873
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:45,520
that would basically finish the job okay

874
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:48,800
so it's not that difficult um we also

875
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:51,280
could just describe the G as you know

876
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:53,040
ABC D

877
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,880
um and and then the computation a little

878
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:57,200
messy but could just check once and for

879
00:46:54,880 --> 00:47:01,640
all. There's probably a better way of

880
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:01,640
doing it but it's not my part of that.

881
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:06,920
Okay, cool.

882
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:17,280
Okay. So now we can say um

883
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:19,760
all right.

884
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:25,400
So now important and interesting part of

885
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:25,400
this story is um

886
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,839
um

887
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:33,599
what is the difference between the

888
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:35,599
unitary ones and the diagonal ones?

889
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:38,400
And there are many different answers to

890
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:40,640
this. Um, we could come back to it

891
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:42,800
multiple times,

892
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:44,640
but I'm gonna mention one way of looking

893
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:47,760
at it which will start to get us to the

894
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:50,720
projection theory.

895
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:54,079
Um, so there's a special feature of

896
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:55,839
unitary matrices that we saw also maybe

897
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:58,880
by coincidence, but it also came up when

898
00:47:55,839 --> 00:48:00,400
we were talking about SL2 of FP, which

899
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:02,400
what we saw there basically is that

900
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:04,880
something cool happens when you

901
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:07,920
conjugate a unitary matrix by a diagonal

902
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:09,599
matrix. And that that is a special

903
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:13,240
feature of unitary matrices and it

904
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:13,240
really helps to understand.

905
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:37,079
Okay.

906
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:37,079
So what is special

907
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:41,440
about

908
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:44,440
unitary

909
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,440
matrices?

910
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:53,839
Okay. So there's a computation that if I

911
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:57,359
take a unitary matrix and I conjugate it

912
00:48:53,839 --> 00:49:01,559
by a diagonal matrix. So I have e to the

913
00:48:57,359 --> 00:49:01,559
r e to the minus r

914
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:08,960
potent.

915
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:12,160
>> Uni potent. Yeah, thanks.

916
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:14,960
>> Yes, thank you. Uni potent.

917
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:19,440
Okay,

918
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:22,240
so if you multiply this out, you get

919
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:24,400
this.

920
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:27,520
So if you're interested in a uni potent

921
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:30,319
matrix UT where this T is really large,

922
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:32,400
you can get at it by starting with U1

923
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:35,440
and conjugating it by one of these

924
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:40,720
diagonal matrices.

925
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:44,160
Um so let's let's say U0 T. This is a

926
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:47,520
set of unitary matrices. This is UT

927
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:51,920
t goes from zero to t. And so to

928
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:54,880
understand an orbit we you know our goal

929
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:56,559
is to understand

930
00:49:54,880 --> 00:50:02,280
um

931
00:49:56,559 --> 00:50:02,280
u 0t of x where t is large

932
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:11,920
and because of this slick little formula

933
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:15,119
we can write u0 t x.

934
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:17,839
So let's let's say

935
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:20,559
um we can write it as

936
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:23,559
a r

937
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:23,559
u01

938
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:33,640
a - r of x

939
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:33,640
where e 2r t.

940
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:42,240
Why is this helpful? So this here is

941
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:43,839
just some point in uh in G mod gamma.

942
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:47,760
It's not the point we started with. It's

943
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:53,000
some other point but it's just a point.

944
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:53,000
This here is a short unitary orbit.

945
00:50:55,200 --> 00:51:00,880
Um short unitary orbit isn't so

946
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:03,920
intimidating to to draw. And then all

947
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:07,599
the action is here. And the question is

948
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:11,079
what does this uh map do to a short

949
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:11,079
unitary orbit?

950
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:18,640
Okay, so if we make a picture,

951
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:22,800
here's our G mod gamma. Here's our new

952
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:25,760
starting point a minus rx.

953
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:27,440
Here's our orbit. It's not very long. It

954
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:32,880
doesn't wrap around yet, so it's not

955
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:36,319
that intimidating. That's um this guy

956
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:38,319
short unitary orbit. Okay. And now we're

957
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:40,400
going to take this map of Gamma to

958
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:42,000
itself and we're going to apply it and

959
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:45,000
we want to see what happens to this blue

960
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
thing.

961
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:50,680
>> Again, uni potent. Thanks short.

962
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:54,280
Thanks.

963
00:51:54,960 --> 00:52:01,440
Okay. And we can also make a remark a r

964
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:04,800
is a subgroup. So a r is like a1 to the

965
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:06,880
r or a little r to the big r over little

966
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:09,440
r

967
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:12,000
big r little over r is a natural number.

968
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:15,920
So we don't have to do this all at once.

969
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:17,920
We could take a less dramatic map of gi

970
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:19,520
gamma to itself and we repeat that over

971
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:23,839
and over again. We want to see what

972
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:26,640
happens to this thing. Right?

973
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:31,359
Okay.

974
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:36,160
Okay. So we are led to try so we led to

975
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:39,559
a goal which is to try to understand

976
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:39,559
and visualize

977
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:48,240
the action of a little r and ga

978
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:52,079
and if we understand that really well we

979
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:55,079
should be able to understand this orbit.

980
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:55,079
Okay.

981
00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:03,309
[Applause]

982
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:14,200
Okay.

983
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:40,319
All right. So, how might we try to get a

984
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:42,400
handle on this? Let's look at a

985
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:46,880
fundamental domain. So, f is a

986
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:49,680
fundamental domain of gamma.

987
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:52,319
So, f is a subset just of g. And I'll

988
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:53,599
draw it as a cube. It's not literally a

989
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:57,440
cube.

990
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:59,359
um uh god gamma is not compact. So f

991
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:00,880
cannot be compact. So it should have

992
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:03,280
like a little tail that's going off to

993
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:05,920
infinity. Um but for what I'm about to

994
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:07,520
say that's not super important.

995
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:09,200
And actually by the way the whole story

996
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:11,040
also makes sense for gamas that are

997
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:15,520
co-compact and then you would this

998
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:18,640
picture would be better. Okay. So now uh

999
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:23,440
we'd like to understand what a does. So

1000
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:25,920
the first step is I'm going to apply AR.

1001
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:27,520
And we just thought about what AR does

1002
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:30,079
geometrically, how it distorts the

1003
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:32,000
geometry. Um we were looking at what it

1004
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:34,000
does to the metric, but it's very

1005
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:41,640
similar to what it does to like a unit

1006
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:41,640
cube. Um so this thing um is going to be

1007
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:52,640
so this is a r of of um of f which is

1008
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:54,400
still sitting in the group g. It got

1009
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:55,680
longer in one way shorter in another

1010
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,119
way. The real thing would have more

1011
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:59,119
dimensions than this but just to give

1012
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:02,400
the idea.

1013
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:05,440
Okay. Now the next thing that happens is

1014
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:10,079
we have to apply the quotient map. So pi

1015
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:13,280
is the map from G to G mod gamma.

1016
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:15,119
Um and when we do that I'll visualize G

1017
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:17,040
mod gamma again as this fundamental

1018
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:19,040
domain. And what happens is that this

1019
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:21,520
thing is going to kind of wrap around

1020
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:24,559
the fundamental domain.

1021
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:26,400
Okay. So it will look something like

1022
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:30,559
this.

1023
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:32,640
There it'll go in there. Um

1024
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:36,319
okay it's very difficult to draw this

1025
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:37,920
well um this map from the fundamental

1026
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:40,240
domain to itself is going to be of

1027
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:41,680
ejection right so somehow this is going

1028
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:45,520
to wrap around it's going to cover every

1029
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:48,400
point exactly once uh it's like a some

1030
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:51,359
sort of beautiful jigsaw puzzle I don't

1031
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:53,040
know how to draw that so I'll just do

1032
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:56,319
I'll just have this come out here and

1033
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:58,160
I'll do sort of a dot dot dot

1034
00:55:56,319 --> 00:56:00,079
okay and then I don't know if We were

1035
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:01,520
visualizing if we had something of

1036
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:03,680
interest eventually it would be some

1037
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:04,960
unipotent orbits but maybe initially

1038
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:08,160
we're interested in what happens to

1039
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:10,240
that. So in the first step

1040
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:14,400
it did this

1041
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:17,280
and then in the next step we see this

1042
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:22,280
and this

1043
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:22,280
somewhere over here we see this. Okay.

1044
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:29,119
All right.

1045
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:29,680
Cool. Um all right. So

1046
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:31,599
>> yeah,

1047
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:33,680
>> why does the map have to be a bjection?

1048
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:36,799
Like why can't the projection map sort

1049
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:40,400
of not be injective?

1050
00:56:36,799 --> 00:56:42,559
>> Yeah. So the question is um why is this

1051
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:46,640
map a bjection?

1052
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:51,799
Um so we were saying so this this uh I

1053
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:51,799
guess is actually there um

1054
00:56:52,640 --> 00:57:00,480
um right? So we said earlier that the

1055
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:03,920
left action of G god gamma goes to

1056
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:06,160
itself as a bjection

1057
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:07,760
and if we believe that then if we start

1058
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:09,520
with the fundamental domain we have one

1059
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:11,680
representative of each point in G mod

1060
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:13,440
gamma and then we end up in back in G

1061
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:17,040
mod gamma we should cover everything

1062
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:19,520
exactly once if this is a bjection.

1063
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:22,960
Okay. Now why was this a bjection? So

1064
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:27,599
what is this map? It's the map H gamma

1065
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:32,920
goes to G inverse H gamma.

1066
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:32,920
So why is this a bjection? Um

1067
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:38,520
um

1068
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:48,960
right. So uh it's injective that means

1069
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:52,880
that if H1

1070
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:58,640
G inverse H1 gamma is equal to G inverse

1071
00:57:52,880 --> 00:58:00,160
H2 gamma then um H1 gamma equals H2

1072
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:02,960
gamma. That's what it means for it to be

1073
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:05,839
injective.

1074
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:09,280
So is this clear?

1075
00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:11,920
Yeah. You multiply on both sides by G.

1076
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:16,000
Okay. Serjective.

1077
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:19,400
That means that um

1078
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,400
for every

1079
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:27,000
uh

1080
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:27,000
every H2

1081
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:34,880
in

1082
00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:39,839
in in G there exists H1 in G. So that G

1083
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:42,720
inverse H1 gamma is H2 gamma.

1084
00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:43,920
So yeah, we set these equal and solve

1085
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:47,200
for G.

1086
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:50,200
>> I guess that convertibility.

1087
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:50,200
>> Yeah.

1088
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:57,440
>> Yeah. Um,

1089
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:58,720
right.

1090
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:00,559
I have to say I went through this too

1091
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:01,839
when I when I drew these pictures. I

1092
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:03,280
asked myself like, is this actually

1093
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:06,160
going to like fold up and cover

1094
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:08,720
everything exactly once? And then I was

1095
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:12,160
like, is it really vigive?

1096
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:15,160
Yeah, it should happen.

1097
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:15,160
Yeah.

1098
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,680
Okay.

1099
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:23,599
I guess you can make easier fun examples

1100
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:27,359
where that are more linear. So you just

1101
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:29,760
have like a matrix acting on R2 mod Z2

1102
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:31,440
or something like that. Um and then the

1103
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:34,400
fundamental domain is a square and you

1104
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:36,640
can draw what happens to it and you can

1105
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:38,079
look up. So this was inspired by the by

1106
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:39,760
that example. They called that the cat

1107
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:41,359
map, a particular map. And instead of a

1108
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:43,040
smiley face, they draw a cat. They've

1109
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:44,559
better artistic skills than me. You can

1110
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:47,799
Google that and see some nice pictures

1111
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:47,799
like this.

1112
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:57,040
Okay, cool. Okay. So here, so so this um

1113
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:58,720
this thing LG LL with with this diagonal

1114
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:01,280
action, they've broken it into two

1115
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:04,319
steps. And out of these two steps, I

1116
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:06,079
find this one quite confusing.

1117
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:08,319
uh it's difficult to write this down

1118
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:10,960
sufficiently accurately and then to say

1119
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:12,640
what happened here and and you know did

1120
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:14,000
this come back over here over there when

1121
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:15,599
it wrapped you know where did it wrap

1122
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,760
and that all of that seems very

1123
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:19,920
intimidating to me so very difficult to

1124
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:24,240
write down in a clean way but this first

1125
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:26,559
step is not so bad right

1126
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:29,119
um and so we're going to try to

1127
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:31,119
understand the first step very well and

1128
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:34,319
use that to see how much we can figure

1129
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:39,160
out about the about this map um LG

1130
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:39,160
acting on our homogeneous space.

1131
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:44,720
Okay. Now the object that we want to

1132
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:47,920
follow is not a smiley face but a

1133
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:50,079
unipotent orbit.

1134
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:52,079
Okay.

1135
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:55,799
So

1136
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:55,799
let's see here.

1137
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,839
Okay. This we can erase all of it.

1138
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:31,280
Okay. So I erased something that is

1139
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:34,960
useful for us. So recall we worked out

1140
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:36,799
um that the left map by a r inverse we

1141
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:41,520
found its singular values and singular

1142
01:01:36,799 --> 01:01:45,040
vectors. So in the u direction um the

1143
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:48,880
length of this is e to the 2r

1144
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:52,240
and in the utilda direction the length

1145
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:54,400
is eus 2 r

1146
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:58,200
and in the diagonal direction the length

1147
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:58,200
is one.

1148
01:01:58,319 --> 01:02:03,119
Um

1149
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:10,799
so this is this is if we're thinking of

1150
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:15,520
l a r inverse from t e g to t a

1151
01:02:10,799 --> 01:02:18,720
right and this little u

1152
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:23,359
this is also the tangent direction

1153
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:24,960
of our group u.

1154
01:02:23,359 --> 01:02:26,400
So that group is going to get stretched

1155
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:30,200
which is the same thing we saw in the

1156
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:30,200
computation over there.

1157
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:34,839
So um

1158
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:45,200
step one so if we start with a single

1159
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:47,920
unipotent orbit starts at some point we

1160
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:52,960
have like this.

1161
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:57,160
So that's u01 of some point x. What

1162
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:57,160
happens when we apply L?

1163
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:08,040
Okay. Well, this thing is going to get

1164
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:08,040
tall and skinny

1165
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:14,079
and the direction that got stretched is

1166
01:03:11,839 --> 01:03:16,880
the direction of this orbit. So now

1167
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:20,240
we're going to have a long orbit

1168
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:24,160
and the height of this thing is e to the

1169
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:26,240
2R. Then we're going to quotient.

1170
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:30,520
Um, so when we quotient, I don't know

1171
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:30,520
exactly where it's going to go,

1172
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:38,559
but it will go along. It'll go out the

1173
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:41,680
top and come in the bottom somewhere.

1174
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:43,920
And then we'll have a bunch of these. So

1175
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:46,480
we'll have like

1176
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:51,079
e to the 2 r

1177
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:51,079
u orbits of length one.

1178
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:55,039
and I have no idea where they are. So,

1179
01:03:53,359 --> 01:03:56,400
we haven't made any progress yet on our

1180
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:58,880
main question, which is to see if these

1181
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:01,839
are distributing kind of evenly.

1182
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:05,559
Um, but now we can start again.

1183
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:05,559
Move this over here.

1184
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:12,559
So, now we have a bunch of unipotent

1185
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:17,240
orbits

1186
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:17,240
and we're going to stretch them out.

1187
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:21,760
Now, what happens when we stretch them

1188
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:24,760
out this time?

1189
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:24,760
Well,

1190
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:33,599
okay. So, each one of them got longer.

1191
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:36,400
It's going to go from the bottom to the

1192
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:39,760
top.

1193
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:41,760
But also, um,

1194
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:44,319
there's also some compression which is

1195
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:46,240
kind of in this direction. And that

1196
01:04:44,319 --> 01:04:50,480
could potentially cause some orbits to

1197
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:52,000
get closer together or not. And this is

1198
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:54,480
the part that we have to understand

1199
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,839
really carefully.

1200
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:57,039
[Applause]

1201
01:04:55,839 --> 01:05:01,720
>> All right.

1202
01:04:57,039 --> 01:05:01,720
>> So this box is some small box.

1203
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:06,760
>> Yeah. So this Yeah.

1204
01:05:07,359 --> 01:05:12,160
>> Yeah. That's right. That's right. So

1205
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:13,920
this this box here is a fundamental

1206
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:17,200
domain.

1207
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:18,640
So it's scale one

1208
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:21,280
and sure it could be around the

1209
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:25,839
identity. Thing I most want to convey in

1210
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:28,880
this class is a feeling for how this map

1211
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:31,839
is like twisting and distorting these

1212
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:33,520
curves. All right. And so I'm going to

1213
01:05:31,839 --> 01:05:36,079
try to make a really big picture of it

1214
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:39,079
there. I also brought with me some um

1215
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:39,079
props.

1216
01:05:39,750 --> 01:05:42,840
[Applause]

1217
01:05:54,319 --> 01:06:00,720
All right.

1218
01:05:56,799 --> 01:06:02,640
So, I'm going to sort of visualize our

1219
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:05,599
fundamental domain or maybe a piece of

1220
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:07,440
it as a cylinder. And now I'm going to

1221
01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:10,480
draw some unipotent orbits in different

1222
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:12,640
colors. And they all go from the bottom

1223
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:15,640
to the top.

1224
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:15,640
Um

1225
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:25,559
maybe I'll draw three of them.

1226
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:36,480
Okay. Now what happens to this picture?

1227
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:38,559
So, first of all, it's going to stretch

1228
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:40,160
that way. That part's not that hard to

1229
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:42,720
imagine. It would go off the board, so

1230
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:45,520
I'm not going to emphasize that. Then

1231
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:47,119
each one of these uh slices, so we have

1232
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:50,079
some sort of slices. Let's say this is

1233
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:53,039
tals 0 up to tals 1. Other t's in the

1234
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:55,200
middle. Each one of these slices, one

1235
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:56,880
direction is going to be squished and

1236
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:58,799
the other direction is going to stay the

1237
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:02,480
same.

1238
01:06:58,799 --> 01:07:07,680
So let's say that at t = 1 cross-section

1239
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:11,640
of this picture, I see a triangle

1240
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:11,640
that looks like this.

1241
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:16,720
And there's going to be some direction

1242
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:20,240
that gets compressed.

1243
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:22,480
When I apply l inverse, if that

1244
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:25,200
direction gets compressed, the output is

1245
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:28,079
going to look like so.

1246
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:30,000
And that has been actually worked out so

1247
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:32,480
that this blue and yellow get kind of

1248
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:36,079
squished together.

1249
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:39,520
And the orange is still there.

1250
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:41,599
And at t equals 0,

1251
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:44,839
if I look at the bottom disc, I have the

1252
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:44,839
same picture.

1253
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:51,839
And there's some direction that's going

1254
01:07:49,359 --> 01:07:55,599
to be compressed.

1255
01:07:51,839 --> 01:07:59,880
And it's not the same direction. I'll do

1256
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:59,880
somewhat arbitrarily that one.

1257
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:08,240
That one. Okay. So,

1258
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:12,559
compress that way. That will look sort

1259
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:15,359
of like so. And the blue point will be

1260
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:19,600
over here. And the yellow and orange

1261
01:08:15,359 --> 01:08:21,199
point will be somewhat close together.

1262
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:22,640
Okay. And as you look at all the

1263
01:08:21,199 --> 01:08:24,480
intermediate heights, you'll have a

1264
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:27,279
similar picture. But this compression

1265
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:31,480
direction is going to be changing

1266
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:31,480
continuously as you go up.

1267
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:48,560
Okay. All right. So I'm not sure if this

1268
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:50,000
will be helpful, but I brought several

1269
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:53,120
props to try to illustrate this

1270
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:54,960
important process. So if you imagine

1271
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:58,719
that you have a bunch of unipotent

1272
01:08:54,960 --> 01:09:02,319
orbits in your homogeneous space like so

1273
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:05,679
and we apply a okay first of all they

1274
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:07,440
will stretch this way and second of all

1275
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:09,279
there will be some compression. So maybe

1276
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:11,920
at the top they might get smooshed

1277
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:13,839
together this way and at the bottom they

1278
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:19,000
might get smooshed together sort of a

1279
01:09:13,839 --> 01:09:19,000
different way sort of like this

1280
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:27,839
or

1281
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:30,400
um if this piece of Play-Doh is this

1282
01:09:27,839 --> 01:09:33,199
cylinder here what's going to happen to

1283
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:35,920
it when we apply the map? Well, it's

1284
01:09:33,199 --> 01:09:38,319
going to get taller

1285
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:40,480
and it's going to get squished and maybe

1286
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:43,600
the top will get squished sort of that

1287
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:46,080
way, but the bottom will get squished

1288
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:48,159
sort of that way and in the middle it'll

1289
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:51,520
get squished some direction sort of in

1290
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:54,560
the middle and that will if I had done

1291
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:56,080
it carefully practiced it at home it

1292
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:58,320
produces something that's sort of like a

1293
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:58,320
helix.

1294
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:10,600
Okay,

1295
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:10,600
cool.

1296
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:19,480
Okay, so let me say briefly why this is

1297
01:10:15,199 --> 01:10:19,480
relevant. Um,

1298
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:23,120
and then if we have time, if we feel

1299
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:27,199
like it, we could try to do some

1300
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:29,920
computations with matrices to check it.

1301
01:10:27,199 --> 01:10:31,920
Okay. So, why is this relevant? Well, if

1302
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:33,760
you had a, you know, a situation like

1303
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:36,640
this,

1304
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:38,640
then

1305
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:42,320
um

1306
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:44,880
yeah. Okay, let's go back up here.

1307
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:47,520
So, this guy is really tall. We're going

1308
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:50,080
to cut it into a sequence of pieces that

1309
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:51,840
each have height one. And then each one

1310
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:54,480
of these pieces is going to fold back

1311
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:57,480
in.

1312
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:57,480
Right.

1313
01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:10,600
So over here there is a an unused color.

1314
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:10,600
There's a purple piece over here.

1315
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:18,280
Okay. That purple piece is going to fold

1316
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:18,280
back in over here.

1317
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:24,880
Can you see that?

1318
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:26,239
All right. And then there are a bunch of

1319
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:28,159
other pieces in different colors. Those

1320
01:11:26,239 --> 01:11:29,840
other pieces will somehow get slotted in

1321
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:33,120
in an order that I don't understand at

1322
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:35,120
all, but they'll all go somewhere.

1323
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:39,679
All right. Now, inside of this purple

1324
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:42,560
piece, so over here we have uh a yellow

1325
01:11:39,679 --> 01:11:44,800
orbit, a blue orbit, and an orange

1326
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:46,400
orbit. Let's just focus on those three.

1327
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:50,480
They aren't all are going to pass

1328
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:54,560
through here. And we could have

1329
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:56,640
um the blue orbit and the orange orbit

1330
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:59,199
and the yellow orbit all kind of spread

1331
01:11:56,640 --> 01:12:01,040
out from each other. Or we could be that

1332
01:11:59,199 --> 01:12:02,719
they are smooshed together close to each

1333
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:04,960
other.

1334
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:06,960
Anyway, whatever happens here, this is

1335
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:09,920
just slotted in over here. So that will

1336
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:13,679
tell us how they're spaced over here.

1337
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:15,199
Okay. So um

1338
01:12:13,679 --> 01:12:18,560
uh

1339
01:12:15,199 --> 01:12:22,320
when we have something like this that

1340
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:24,080
will produce two unit length unipotent

1341
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:26,719
orbits over here in this purple thing

1342
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:29,120
that are really close to each other and

1343
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:31,760
that that phenomenon is the enemy of the

1344
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:32,960
unipotent orbit spreading out. Unipot

1345
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:34,880
orbit is definitely going to be really

1346
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:36,239
long but it may not spread out because

1347
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:39,440
it may have many segments that are

1348
01:12:36,239 --> 01:12:42,400
really close to each other.

1349
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:45,199
Okay. Um

1350
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:47,440
so let me scribe.

1351
01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:54,120
So to prove

1352
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:54,120
that u 0t of x spreads out

1353
01:12:54,159 --> 01:12:58,040
we want to prove

1354
01:12:58,719 --> 01:13:02,760
that coincidences

1355
01:13:04,239 --> 01:13:09,360
of this type are rare.

1356
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:16,719
Okay. And why are they rare? Well,

1357
01:13:14,719 --> 01:13:21,120
they're rare because this compression

1358
01:13:16,719 --> 01:13:23,520
angle is rotating smoothly as we vary t.

1359
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:25,600
And so even though there may be one

1360
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:27,199
projection that smooshes a lot of things

1361
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:28,960
together,

1362
01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:30,239
we have learned in this course that if

1363
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:32,320
you look at the projection in all

1364
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:35,600
different directions, most of them do

1365
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:38,159
not smoosh things together very much.

1366
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:41,480
And that forces this unipotent orbit to

1367
01:13:38,159 --> 01:13:41,480
spread out.

1368
01:14:02,719 --> 01:14:10,080
Sorry for so confused. Why does like the

1369
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:14,159
direction get like compressed change

1370
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:18,480
like from that picture after you apply L

1371
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:21,840
A R inverse it's always

1372
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:24,159
get long and

1373
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:27,199
and get

1374
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:31,040
another direction gets

1375
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:33,840
>> Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right. So the

1376
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:35,280
question is why does this happen? And in

1377
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:37,440
fact there was a point that the picture

1378
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:39,840
that I drew up there sort of makes it

1379
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:41,850
look like it doesn't happen.

1380
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:43,760
Right.

1381
01:14:41,850 --> 01:14:45,360
[Applause]

1382
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:48,239
All right.

1383
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:51,920
[Applause]

1384
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:54,480
So in my picture I this is not exactly

1385
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:56,400
accurate but but I I drew it as though

1386
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:59,199
this map was just a linear map that

1387
01:14:56,400 --> 01:15:02,000
takes a cube to a rectangular solid. and

1388
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:03,760
I drew it as though well I tried to show

1389
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:06,719
that this would okay so these unipotent

1390
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:08,239
orbits are more or less vertical.

1391
01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:09,440
All right so here's what so here's what

1392
01:15:08,239 --> 01:15:11,760
wouldn't work. So if the unipotent

1393
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:15,120
orbits were literally vertical and if

1394
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:17,199
this map was literally a linear map then

1395
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:18,560
this would not happen the compression

1396
01:15:17,199 --> 01:15:20,719
direction would be the same at every

1397
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:24,159
height.

1398
01:15:20,719 --> 01:15:26,159
All right. So, um I think you have to

1399
01:15:24,159 --> 01:15:27,920
kind of

1400
01:15:26,159 --> 01:15:30,719
pick

1401
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:32,800
um this this this Lee group is like, you

1402
01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:34,880
know, it's a sub manifold of R4, but if

1403
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:36,880
you want to represent it in coordinates

1404
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:38,640
in three dimensions, you have to make a

1405
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:41,360
choice. There's not a completely

1406
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:46,000
canonical choice.

1407
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:48,400
So, um, we could make the choice that,

1408
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:50,159
um, the unipotent orbits were literally

1409
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:52,719
vertical.

1410
01:15:50,159 --> 01:15:56,000
And if we did that, this picture would

1411
01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:58,560
not be right anymore. Um, if if we did

1412
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:00,640
that, then this would have a bit of a

1413
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:04,520
twist. This would be more this would be

1414
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:04,520
like a helixy thing.

1415
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:08,960
Or another way of looking at it is I

1416
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:13,679
think we could choose coordinates in

1417
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:16,640
such a way that um this map was pretty

1418
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:19,440
close to a linear map but then these

1419
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:21,920
unipotent orbits would not be vertical

1420
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:24,880
and instead they would kind of spiral a

1421
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:27,760
little bit as you went up

1422
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:31,400
and so the angle between two unipotent

1423
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:31,400
guys would be changing.

1424
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:40,080
Okay. Now at some point

1425
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:42,320
you know why do you believe that?

1426
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:46,400
So at some point we should do a

1427
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:47,920
computation right. Um I don't think I'll

1428
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:50,320
do it in the last two minutes but I'll

1429
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:52,480
just say what you should do.

1430
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:55,040
Um

1431
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:57,760
okay so

1432
01:16:55,040 --> 01:17:00,400
we figured out which direction is

1433
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:02,080
compressing. Um we could have written it

1434
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:04,000
down a little bit more clearly but if if

1435
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:07,120
you trace through our thoughts today at

1436
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:08,960
any point in the homogeneous space if

1437
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:10,640
you ask which is the tangent direction

1438
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:15,280
that's going to get compressed when you

1439
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:17,679
apply L we have a formula for it.

1440
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:20,800
Okay. And then we can also say if you

1441
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:23,360
have two nearby unipotent orbits and

1442
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:27,440
down here at the bottom there's like a a

1443
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:30,000
little vector between them as you go up

1444
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:33,040
the orbit what what happens to that

1445
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:35,360
vector. There's a formula for that too.

1446
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:38,000
If you compare these two formulas you

1447
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:40,640
will see that they don't match. So that

1448
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:42,239
the the if if this direction initially

1449
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:44,800
was the compression direction

1450
01:17:42,239 --> 01:17:46,719
compression direction if you follow it

1451
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:49,679
up you don't get the compression

1452
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:53,560
direction up here and you you can

1453
01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:53,560
compute it all with matrices.

1454
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:58,800
>> Yeah

1455
01:17:55,280 --> 01:18:02,000
>> this just kind of saying is a curvature

1456
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:04,400
tensor that's not zero any from the

1457
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:06,880
guess one of the two one parameter

1458
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:08,719
groups.

1459
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:10,560
Yeah, the question is is is this saying

1460
01:18:08,719 --> 01:18:13,440
that this there's some kind of curvature

1461
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:16,159
tensor that doesn't vanish? Maybe it's

1462
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:19,360
it's not the remon curvature tensor, but

1463
01:18:16,159 --> 01:18:22,360
uh it might be something in that spirit.

1464
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:22,360
Yeah.

1465
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:31,920
>> The picture kind of makes it seem like

1466
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,840
it stretches.

1467
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:35,360
It's not periodic. Is there something

1468
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:37,520
I'm missing?

1469
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:40,159
Yeah, great question. Okay, the question

1470
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:43,600
was this appears to be a proof sketch

1471
01:18:40,159 --> 01:18:46,400
that every orbit of the uniport group is

1472
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:49,199
uh evenly distributed and we saw at the

1473
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:52,159
beginning that that is not true. So what

1474
01:18:49,199 --> 01:18:56,199
did we what did we do wrong?

1475
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:56,199
Okay. Um

1476
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:07,679
all right. So this orbit we can write

1477
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:08,880
this way.

1478
01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:10,159
All right. Actually, so let me say that

1479
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:13,679
the the shortest answer to your

1480
01:19:10,159 --> 01:19:16,159
question, the key thing is that the cusp

1481
01:19:13,679 --> 01:19:18,080
of the homogeneous space is really

1482
01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:23,120
important here. And we were neglecting

1483
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:24,640
the cusp. Um so you know the the cusp

1484
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:26,880
produces a piece of the fundamental

1485
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:28,320
domain that's really skinny and it

1486
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:29,760
doesn't look like the rest of it. And

1487
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:31,600
when something's in the cusp, it doesn't

1488
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:33,920
apply.

1489
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:35,760
Um and so actually Hedland proved

1490
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:38,560
another theorem which is that if you

1491
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:41,360
take a a co-compact subgroup gamma then

1492
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:44,000
in Gmod gamma every unipotent orbit uh

1493
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:46,159
is is dense and this is a sketch of the

1494
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:50,960
proof of that theorem.

1495
01:19:46,159 --> 01:19:53,760
Okay. But now what goes wrong um is that

1496
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:56,560
this a minus rx

1497
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:59,520
could be very far in the cusp and then

1498
01:19:56,560 --> 01:20:01,679
our whole analysis is wrong. So what

1499
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:04,640
what we've roughly shown is that either

1500
01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:07,840
our orbit is very well distributed or a

1501
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:10,080
minus rx is deep in the cusp.

1502
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:12,719
And if you unwind what that means about

1503
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:16,760
x, it means that it's very close to

1504
01:20:12,719 --> 01:20:16,760
being a periodic or

1505
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:28,480
cool. Okay. So, we'll talk a little more

1506
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:29,920
about homogeneous dynamics on Thursday.

1507
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:33,880
I'm not sure exactly what we'll say.

1508
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:33,880
Maybe we'll fill in some things.
