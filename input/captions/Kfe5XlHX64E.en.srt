1
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,240
okay um we're going to uh go through a

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,680
little bit um a topic that you've

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,199
unlocked now with the end of problem set

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,400
three uh which wasn't totally wasn't

5
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:24,080
officially locked but we didn't really

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,679
talk about it and that's stream

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,119
filtering so let me put this down and

8
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:31,160
let's do a little bit of Jupiter work so

9
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:36,000
go ahead and get get yourself um

10
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:36,000
situated in that give you second or

11
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:48,480
two I and I think I saw scores generated

12
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:50,920
in text um for everybody um there was a

13
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,160
great question on the list what do you

14
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:57,600
do if you're score if you're not yet on

15
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:01,359
Version 9 which none of us are

16
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:05,479
um and you want to see more the score

17
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:10,600
you can do showmusic xml. PDF and if you

18
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:12,320
have M score that will um that will open

19
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:15,000
um that'll automatically generate you a

20
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:20,280
PDF of more than just the first page you

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,320
can also just um do show. music show

22
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,720
musicxml sorry those should be straight

23
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,000
quotes I'm just used to putting them as

24
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:28,479
curly quotes you all know that right um

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,960
and that will just open it in your U

26
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:34,560
favorite notation editor

27
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:40,000
great um so let's get started let's

28
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:44,000
um let's not load our favorite bakal but

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,360
let's load our new favorite piece by um

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,920
a Boston based composer Amy

31
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:53,640
Beach and it's um a piece for you see I

32
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,320
even start typing Bach it makes life

33
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,759
oops

34
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:01,079
ah um when I'm not

35
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:04,320
teaching in the semester I have

36
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:06,039
um let's import start all right now so

37
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,640
we don't have to remember everything but

38
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:11,400
not every module is unlocked yet usually

39
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:13,239
when I'm not teaching class I make it so

40
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,599
that that's automatically imported for

41
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:18,239
me you um so I don't have to type that

42
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:21,280
so if you see me make that mistake

43
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:25,440
that's what it is

44
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:28,959
um we'll just start by looking at this

45
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,519
piece and it has a similar structure to

46
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,040
the piece that we have been doing o we

47
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:36,599
have some layout errors today on my

48
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:39,879
thing but uh it's piece called prayer of

49
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:40,959
a tired child for four-part uh chorus of

50
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:44,599
women's

51
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,599
voices and

52
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,760
um

53
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:53,000
and see that the four parts are soprano

54
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:56,319
1 soprano 2 Alto 1 Alto 2 and then

55
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,640
there's a fifth part the piano and the

56
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:04,080
piano part has well we'll we'll see what

57
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:09,599
it what it is in just a bit um

58
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:12,519
so how would we get this um soprano 2

59
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:16,440
part what do we want to do you all have

60
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:16,440
been gotten pretty good at at manual

61
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,720
filtering so beach. something actually

62
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,319
talk talk with your talk with your

63
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,360
neighbors a little bit about that we

64
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,280
have some odd number neighbors and try

65
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,200
to try to talk through what you do it's

66
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:33,840
more important that you can talk can

67
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,840
explain things then do it

68
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:40,560
instantly you want to get the um soprano

69
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,560
2

70
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:51,280
part so good good one way if you if you

71
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,120
find one way keep going for another or

72
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,400
two until we get it there's about five

73
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,400
different ways

74
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,200
good

75
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,560
here everybody give a thumbs up if you

76
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:12,280
think you know how to do

77
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:14,760
it if not keep talking with is that

78
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,799
almost that's almost Universal thumbs up

79
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:21,560
Jonathan was that a thumbs up yep good

80
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:24,639
okay great um let's see uh Jordan what

81
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:27,600
how would you do it dot parts and

82
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,919
brackets for one brackets for one good

83
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,600
so we've already started with one of the

84
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:39,080
things on today uh this was in one of

85
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:40,960
the users guide thing dot Parts is a

86
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,600
kind of filter that filters out

87
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:47,000
everything that is not a part

88
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:50,680
object and so this will let you find

89
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,680
things good what's another way we can do

90
00:04:52,960 --> 00:05:00,240
it somebody else uh who have I've not

91
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,400
been calling on so much Derek

92
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:07,039
I think you can like put in

93
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:08,639
quotes as the like the index uh for the

94
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,960
index

95
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:14,440
to

96
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:17,160
Parts oops sometimes that autocomplete

97
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,160
is less than

98
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,360
helpful oops what do I have to

99
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:31,440
do what am I looking

100
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:34,039
for somebody help soprano two yep great

101
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,680
so he has to be exact does not grab the

102
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:39,680
first one that kind of makes that good

103
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,680
what's another way somebody

104
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:45,759
else Vanessa the first one you did the

105
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:52,960
first one great Matthew get element by

106
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:56,319
ID good get element by ID soprano 2

107
00:05:52,960 --> 00:06:00,199
that's helpful if you don't know um well

108
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:06,759
for instance uh well not piano piano

109
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:09,400
let's try that um part do get element by

110
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:14,120
ID

111
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:17,880
piano you actually get nothing in that

112
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:19,479
case they'll we'll see that there's some

113
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:24,160
interesting things when it comes to

114
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:25,680
piano um let's let's do this for p in

115
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:30,240
beach.

116
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,240
Parts print p

117
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:37,720
and we can actually see a couple things

118
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:40,120
here one is that the piano is

119
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:43,199
represented by two of something called A

120
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:46,599
Part staff that are separate parts in

121
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:50,400
the ontology of Music 21 in a lot of

122
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:53,280
other systems they are the same part and

123
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,800
they're two staves within a part and

124
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:59,199
every one of these representation things

125
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,960
has huge drawbacks to them and when

126
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,680
somebody comes up with a representation

127
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,759
for piano music that does not have the

128
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,520
drawback um you can please please

129
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:12,160
publish that and you will make the world

130
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:16,599
so happy because everything is fine with

131
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:20,440
treating a piano as two parts let's say

132
00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:20,440
it's in 3 four

133
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,440
um as two separate parts as long as I'm

134
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:29,960
try should try to make this at least

135
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:31,520
vaguely consonant um as as long as you

136
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:35,520
do something like

137
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,520
this it's when you start

138
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:45,120
doing that should go up shouldn't it do

139
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,120
proper

140
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:53,919
stemming that you have the problem right

141
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,000
that suddenly a musical melody that

142
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:59,039
starts in one part continues into

143
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,319
another part does your ontology allow

144
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:04,319
for beams to cross

145
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:05,759
Parts well you I I never you asked me to

146
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,639
create an ontology for something that

147
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,080
wasn't Western classical music I have no

148
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:12,440
ontology for yeah but this is this ends

149
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,639
up being uh one of the main things

150
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,800
whenever somebody says they've created a

151
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,159
new way of

152
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,879
representing um classical music thing I

153
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:22,599
always do because I'm a smart alec and

154
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,280
if you want to be a smart alec just

155
00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:26,520
always go up to that person who's like

156
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:28,919
oh I have a mtip just ask them how do

157
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,039
you do cross staff beams in your

158
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:31,639
ontology

159
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:34,200
and they go well we haven't gotten to

160
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:36,880
that this is like the this is the first

161
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,519
thing that almost every ontology should

162
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,760
start with how do we represent cross

163
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:43,479
staff beams if you figured out how to

164
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:45,959
represent cross staff beams or or chords

165
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:49,800
that span what would be a good chord on

166
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:53,600
this uh I guess we're in first inversion

167
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:55,040
Here chords that span multiple staves

168
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,959
it'll figure it out the music 21

169
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:01,440
ontology on this is uh it's really not

170
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:03,440
what it should be on the other hand when

171
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,880
you represent everything as one staff

172
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,360
and you have to say Okay well this is a

173
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:10,000
note on staff one this is a note on

174
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,640
staff two then your sort of left to

175
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,120
right

176
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,680
parser ends up failing quite a bit

177
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,800
because you go left to right and then

178
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:21,640
you say okay now let's jump backwards a

179
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:24,440
bit and um when you have some sort of an

180
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:26,720
array some sort of a sequence of objects

181
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:29,880
that go all in a row but then sometimes

182
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,519
jump backwards and fill things in uh I

183
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:35,120
guarantee you you will be managing what

184
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:37,480
we call cursor hell for the rest of your

185
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:40,120
life trying to figure out where you are

186
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:44,760
left to right and how if you're thinking

187
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:47,160
about uh your Big O algorithmic notation

188
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,839
um you know how how can we simplify

189
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:52,240
things how can we make walking through a

190
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:54,959
score uh be o of n or how can we

191
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,240
do if if we do guess a number between

192
00:09:54,959 --> 00:10:00,640
one and one 100 and I tell you higher or

193
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:05,480
lower what's the uh Big O we're talking

194
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:07,399
about log log n good good yeah some

195
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,360
things M does really really well with

196
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:11,880
this is great A lot of things I might as

197
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,519
well yeah so you all know log n well

198
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:16,720
what happens to your log 10 log n

199
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:23,560
guessing if you have an array of things

200
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:26,640
that go 0 1 2 5 11 14 8

201
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:29,680
2 suddenly what are we back to to find

202
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,320
any element in something o of and you

203
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,360
have to look at every element so you

204
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:35,480
can't know where something is yes Adam

205
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:39,920
you were reciting the Cal numbers for a

206
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:42,000
bit I think I was yes but but something

207
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,560
something we we will get to later in the

208
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,519
class the strong

209
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:49,480
law of

210
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,600
small

211
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:54,920
numbers you can look at this up

212
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:57,639
somewhere it is the

213
00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:00,240
number numbers

214
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:02,560
numbers it is

215
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,440
one of the biggest mistakes with

216
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,959
computational work in any

217
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,880
non-computational

218
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:10,160
non-traditionally computational field

219
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:11,240
like musicology and that is to say you

220
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,320
don't have to look it up now you can

221
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:15,120
look at it later basically there aren't

222
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,600
enough small numbers for all the things

223
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,680
that you want so anytime you're giving

224
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,839
out small numbers there's almost always

225
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,839
going to be a pattern it's going to be

226
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,160
Catalin numbers it's going to be

227
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:26,320
Fibonacci numbers and people always find

228
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:28,959
patterns in all these um these things

229
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,160
okay that was degression on a degression

230
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,200
um

231
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,440
on a slight degression so we'll go back

232
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:37,639
to the main thing which is finding Parts

233
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:40,000
in here good so we have a way of going

234
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:42,600
through and finding interesting Parts

235
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,959
I'm going to turn this off sorry so we

236
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:49,920
can see better is that a little bit

237
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:51,600
better yeah good okay great so um we can

238
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:55,880
figure out all the parts some of the

239
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:57,079
other things you can do it for for thing

240
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:00,680
in

241
00:11:57,079 --> 00:12:04,399
beach. recurse

242
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:06,720
if is instance help me I'm going start

243
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:10,639
with this if is instance be my GitHub

244
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:12,519
autop pilot I've typed this oh good good

245
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:16,360
some people have played with with this

246
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:20,600
if is instance thing thing comma what

247
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:25,760
what are we looking for stream stream.

248
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:30,480
part if um well we can say here we can

249
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:33,279
start with this part num equal 0 do we

250
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:39,320
want to do NE one we'll say negative 1

251
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:42,839
um part num equal 1 uh here we we'll say

252
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:46,360
soprano 2 equals

253
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:49,199
none part n not equals one plus equals 1

254
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:51,600
If part num

255
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:53,199
equals so we start with negative 1 so we

256
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:58,839
get to

257
00:12:53,199 --> 00:13:02,519
one um soprano 2 equals thing and let's

258
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:05,440
see if that works coding on the

259
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:06,440
Fly okay good I can still do that that's

260
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,440
a

261
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:11,560
really really brutally awful way of

262
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,800
doing it right but you can can do it

263
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,800
that way

264
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:21,160
um so there's one other way that I'm

265
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:25,079
going to get you and why did I come back

266
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:27,279
to the recurse way of of doing this

267
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:29,959
because there is one particular shortcut

268
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:35,160
that you're going to find very useful

269
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:38,040
um and that is so we so Beach index you

270
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:40,320
know this one right index zero oh this

271
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:42,079
one uh for those of you who just assumed

272
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,240
that everything starts with a lot of

273
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:46,560
things we have a whole bunch of text

274
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,160
boxes what happens around 10 we're still

275
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:55,600
doing text boxes which appear somewhere

276
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:58,720
on oh there we go part 19 is soprano too

277
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:01,680
but here's another way that we can start

278
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:04,199
getting two parts this is exact um a

279
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,560
little bit different we have but instead

280
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:09,440
of putting a number in there we can put

281
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,440
in a

282
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:18,600
class and that lets us go through

283
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:23,279
everything so we can say for p in Beach

284
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:23,279
stream. part print

285
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:32,360
p and that will be one of your simplest

286
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:36,759
ways of going through things for um for

287
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:39,680
instance for our in stream uh Beach

288
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:41,320
sorry I should scroll down a bit Beach

289
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:46,560
note.

290
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:48,759
rest print R and now you can see quickly

291
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:51,160
get a sense of what durations are used

292
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:52,440
in every rest in the piece sorry I'm not

293
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,680
going to scroll down because people want

294
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:57,399
to see that give you a chance to catch

295
00:14:54,680 --> 00:15:00,240
up and see what are some of your

296
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:03,240
favorite um things does the piece have

297
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,240
any cleft

298
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:07,000
changes actually let's just not say

299
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:10,399
cleft Chang does it have any time

300
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:13,000
signature changes so let's see if we can

301
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:17,120
how quickly you can have the computer

302
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:21,759
figure out does this piece change time

303
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:23,880
signature have any no are there any cff

304
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:27,880
changes let's try

305
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:30,959
that I'll code one behind you I'll code

306
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,959
doesn't have any time C

307
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,720
changes in case you don't have

308
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:50,160
this what do we think about CFT changes

309
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:56,040
yes

310
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:59,360
no no we got yes we got yes ready got

311
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:01,759
yes it does have some Cliff changes

312
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,560
so shall you do the same I'll get let

313
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:07,800
people have a little bit more and then

314
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:11,720
we'll let um we'll let a yes give me the

315
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,720
code for doing

316
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:20,560
this okay I talking who uh yes Jason you

317
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:24,600
were you yes or yeah so what should I be

318
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:26,160
typing uh for.

319
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:29,560
recurse

320
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:31,600
recurse if is is instant

321
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:33,199
okay let's let's go to the new new thing

322
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,600
instead of if is instance what do you

323
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:37,319
want to do instead of that you're you're

324
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,120
on the right track but now we have a new

325
00:16:37,319 --> 00:16:43,199
way of doing it so this is a shortcut

326
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:45,560
for recurse and things Jonathan c. cf.

327
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:48,639
cleff yeah so it's basically the same

328
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:51,199
thing and um oh here is something that

329
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:53,360
came up in a couple things now I know

330
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:56,279
it's going to be a cleff so maybe thing

331
00:16:53,360 --> 00:17:00,160
isn't the best thing best so that do you

332
00:16:56,279 --> 00:17:02,480
like that no this this comes up a lot

333
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:05,520
what um Adam doesn't like it somebody

334
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,120
else not who not anybody else not like

335
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,120
this yeah Paul what do you not like

336
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:12,720
about it because

337
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:15,079
it's because C is part of the

338
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:19,039
music yeah because cleff is part of the

339
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:23,160
music 21 input um some people who uh

340
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:26,079
hate that I recommend um uh importing

341
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,839
all of music 21 so you could do this if

342
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:30,720
you

343
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:33,160
wanted and then clef is only referenced

344
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,960
with a what do you call it with a prefix

345
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:37,640
of Music 21 and some people really

346
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,480
insist on that uh you might have a

347
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:42,320
friend who talks about don't pollute

348
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:44,080
your name Space by things you don't know

349
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,919
um which is can be pretty good advice

350
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:50,840
but yeah you can do that um so so thing

351
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:53,679
is not bad I sometimes do um leave off

352
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:56,760
the vowel um some people don't like that

353
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,840
uh somebody in pet 3 did a lot of this

354
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:01,880
with Note putting an underscore after

355
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:03,840
afterwards that's a pretty good um thing

356
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:06,480
the other thing I will often do is just

357
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,960
use the first letter um even though I

358
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:12,240
usually like verbose things if I'm going

359
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:14,799
to do that so okay um and uh Jason or

360
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:19,320
Jonathan whoever was starting wants to

361
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:22,679
go next priny is that what you did or

362
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:27,039
yep right I'm going through well and we

363
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:30,000
have a CL change so cluff change anybody

364
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:34,039
object Angelica

365
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,280
go Adam has a but yeah Vincent um I

366
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:36,799
think I tried that at first but I didn't

367
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,960
really know if like the base Cut Thing

368
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:42,200
belong to like the Chanel part never

369
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,480
changed and so maybe like you could

370
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:46,400
probably print out the part and then the

371
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:48,840
C that it corresponds to oh okay within

372
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,720
the part good so what we could

373
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:53,440
do let's see how how can we get the part

374
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:57,159
name on

375
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:58,919
this for yeah good I just have another

376
00:18:57,159 --> 00:19:02,880
fold before that that in the parts

377
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:05,280
repeat and Beach and now we'll um so the

378
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:08,799
diff Difference by the way dot Parts is

379
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:11,159
not recursive but we're hopefully the

380
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:13,720
parts are at the topmost level of the

381
00:19:11,159 --> 00:19:18,280
score so it doesn't matter we could do

382
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:22,080
either way yep and then for print P

383
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:24,039
maybe print P actually I usually like to

384
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,480
do something like this when I have an

385
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:32,000
outer loop

386
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:35,799
oops then we'll do for C in Beach

387
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,799
C.C print

388
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:46,880
C what did I do wrong recursing I'm

389
00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:52,559
recursing and Beach what should I be

390
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:54,240
doing P cl. cluff good don't um in no in

391
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,360
any life don't let me make a fool of

392
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,200
myself especially not when we're when

393
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,760
we're filming this class so yeah call me

394
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:02,440
out when I do something like that but

395
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:02,440
great so now we can see

396
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,679
ah

397
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:13,240
oh so there are there actually is a

398
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,799
cluff change but not in one of the

399
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:19,520
voices I was thinking none the voices

400
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:22,559
did but the piano part does change CLS

401
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:25,080
here's another way we can um we can do

402
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:27,600
this I'm going to be unlocking some nice

403
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:30,280
stream things for this we can just skip

404
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:34,080
that outer loop for C you can just keep

405
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:37,080
going and um doing things for in

406
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,080
Beach

407
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:45,000
C.C let's do this print C comma I'll let

408
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,000
everybody get caught up on

409
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:54,080
that c. get context by

410
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:56,440
Class stream. part and make sure to

411
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:59,360
close your second

412
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:02,840
parenthesis so this is a way of moving

413
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:06,919
upward in a hierarchy to try to get what

414
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:06,919
the most recent part

415
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:18,240
is same type of information but maybe a

416
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:20,440
little bit easier for your computer to

417
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,919
parse what what should we do if we want

418
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:26,400
to know bless you uh where that uh base

419
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:28,760
cluff change takes place let's assume

420
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,440
it's like vogner's loow grin we want to

421
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:33,320
switch the whole thing yeah you can get

422
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,360
jet context by class for stream

423
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:37,240
measuring great so I'm going to cut and

424
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:41,520
paste cuz uh we don't want to spend this

425
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:47,679
whole class watching me make um make

426
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:49,960
typos context by class stream.

427
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,799
measure it's a lot of things when you're

428
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:53,679
zoomed in you don't get very much maybe

429
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:55,480
I should print that in separate lines

430
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:59,880
but I want to look at the bottom

431
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:03,840
one measure 29 off set

432
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:06,279
112 uh here's a trick that

433
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:09,159
um that I explained at the beginning of

434
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:12,600
this class I'll open it up in a PDF

435
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:12,600
reader um

436
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:20,159
and hopefully this one has measure

437
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,159
numbers defined yep

438
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:29,760
112 no 29 29 there we go

439
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:35,640
finally there what is

440
00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:38,200
that give me some ideas what what's the

441
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,200
piece scored

442
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:45,919
for what what are the what are the

443
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:47,360
instruments in this women's course and

444
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:49,960
Pi

445
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,880
piano what are you going to guess unless

446
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:54,799
uh Amy Beach likes to use 20 million

447
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:57,000
Ledger lines there's something about the

448
00:22:54,799 --> 00:23:00,880
about the

449
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,880
peace about the piano

450
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:09,400
part that's M it's like pretty high up

451
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,640
yeah so it's up with the voices the

452
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,559
whole time

453
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:16,360
until right at the very end and so you

454
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:19,559
can probably take a guess that something

455
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:22,760
dramatically changes at the

456
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:25,400
end and it doesn't just go down because

457
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:27,600
well we're a tiny bit where where's that

458
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:29,159
note we're a tiny bit too low for

459
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:34,640
trouble cff so we're going to drop down

460
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:38,720
into Bas clo no no we get very very low

461
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:40,720
again um so you could think about it you

462
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,760
know immediately you could kind of ask

463
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:47,559
what are pieces that have a dramatic

464
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:50,720
change in range only at the very

465
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:52,240
end anytime you see something like like

466
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,640
this always be thinking of what are the

467
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:58,720
next three questions you can go from

468
00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:01,200
here so this is um pretty interesting

469
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:04,520
type of research problem that becomes

470
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:06,720
faster to find with the computer um we

471
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:08,840
could also you all know how to find the

472
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,120
highest or the lowest note in a part

473
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:13,520
right yeah okay you're all you're all

474
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:19,080
experts at that now after problem set

475
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:20,720
three so um we can figure out this um

476
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:26,159
thing from from

477
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:28,919
here uh I by the way given the um let's

478
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:31,440
let's look at the beginning and stuff

479
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:32,679
and is there anything always take a

480
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,039
second when you have a new piece I

481
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:37,399
should um there isn't a good recording

482
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:40,919
of this piece if anybody sings in a

483
00:24:37,399 --> 00:24:41,960
four-part women's choir um or AC capella

484
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:43,520
group that could do it it would be

485
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:45,039
really nice to get a good recording of

486
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,760
this

487
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:51,960
but what is where where is the interest

488
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:55,240
in this piece is in Soprano 1 soprano 2

489
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:57,520
Alto one or Alto 2 or more than one

490
00:24:55,240 --> 00:25:00,320
place Adams will give other people just

491
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,320
a little bit

492
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:11,440
time Adam where do you think interest is

493
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:15,200
the middle two the middle

494
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:18,679
two who uh we we asked this before who

495
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:22,600
who sings Al um a middle voice an alto

496
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:25,039
me of soprano uh tener voice and some

497
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:27,360
people how often is that the most

498
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:30,640
interesting part in the piece almost

499
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:33,360
never Almost Never ever okay so either

500
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:36,760
um either Amy Beach is very very kind to

501
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:38,320
Middle voiced people or um there might

502
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:40,760
be another

503
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:43,520
reason what's the name of this

504
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:45,039
piece told you a little bit ago you have

505
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,520
it on your

506
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:49,320
computer see if see how much that sticks

507
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,640
in when we're doing these kind of Corpus

508
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:52,440
analysis I'm going to give it back to

509
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:55,799
you in a second when we given one of

510
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:57,840
these Corpus analyses try to think of

511
00:25:55,799 --> 00:26:00,200
what kinds of questions you might answer

512
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:03,399
based on thing what's the prayer of a

513
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:06,360
tired child how do you think I don't

514
00:26:03,399 --> 00:26:09,320
know why the layout's so bad today but

515
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:13,720
uh I think there might be any

516
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:13,720
connection of the title to this

517
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:19,480
opening just spread around I

518
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:29,880
see well first what what makes it a

519
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,880
prayer

520
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:39,039
yeah starting with our father starting

521
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,279
with our father yeah depending on your

522
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:43,399
religious tradition that that's a uh for

523
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:45,720
some Christians that can be a pretty

524
00:26:43,399 --> 00:26:50,120
standard thing what makes it do you

525
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:50,120
think the um prayer of a tired

526
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,360
child okay good call on somebody else

527
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:03,679
let's put somebody else else on the

528
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:03,679
spot Vanessa what makes it

529
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:14,120
tired Tire okay so the Texs definitely

530
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:16,520
good good always go go with that uh yeah

531
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:19,399
you I think it's of how soft it starts

532
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:22,000
out so it's definitely soft yeah so we

533
00:27:19,399 --> 00:27:26,480
want to do that good anything

534
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:29,080
else pie Jonathan I me two the part just

535
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,919
the samee over right so what does that

536
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:33,399
what might that have to do with

537
00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:35,360
tiredness I mean you're just not moving

538
00:27:33,399 --> 00:27:36,799
you're just not moving you're yeah

539
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,120
you're you're either not moving because

540
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:39,880
you're you're falling asleep or you're

541
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:43,600
not moving because you're you don't have

542
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:45,080
the energy to move up or down so this is

543
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:49,919
one of the things you can start thinking

544
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:51,480
about how is uh how in a text can uh how

545
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:54,760
might the text have something to do with

546
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:57,679
the amount of motion in a

547
00:27:54,760 --> 00:28:01,000
piece um so you know we can look at that

548
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:04,559
and then finally finally um you measure

549
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:07,039
four they finally get to move and which

550
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:08,799
direction does the soprano 1 move when

551
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:12,399
it finally gets to

552
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:13,840
move down okay so so these are some of

553
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:16,399
the things that you guys were putting in

554
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:19,640
your questions on the bach Corrals um

555
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:21,640
that can apply to other pieces not just

556
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:23,399
by Bach by the way how long yeah then

557
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:26,640
when the lowest voice I always want to

558
00:28:23,399 --> 00:28:30,360
say Bas but uh Alto 2 moves where does

559
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:34,600
it finally go down

560
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:36,799
also great so um some of the things we

561
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:40,080
can do with this now let's get back to

562
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:45,200
filtering back to the piece um let's say

563
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:48,960
we want to see this um measure here

564
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:51,480
let's grab the entire context for um for

565
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:55,279
where this happens and just show show it

566
00:28:51,480 --> 00:29:00,039
so what we can do is we can do Beach do

567
00:28:55,279 --> 00:29:00,039
measures let's say 28 to 30

568
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:08,960
doow hopefully I got the right one

569
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:18,480
yep so everything gets cleaned up when I

570
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:20,640
don't show the the beginning um so you

571
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:25,159
can get another one of these commonly

572
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:27,679
used filters is the measures thing now

573
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:30,600
um I don't know if this was a mistake in

574
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:36,519
ont ology or not but decided that

575
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:40,200
measures will um be based on how um how

576
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:44,240
a musician thinks of them so 28 to 30 is

577
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:47,919
28 measure number 28 to measure number

578
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:49,919
30 inclusive um so some of you guys saw

579
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:53,559
this what are some things that can cause

580
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:56,799
the number of let's say bar lines um

581
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:59,600
minus one uh to be not the same as the

582
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:01,480
number as the the meas the measure

583
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,919
number the highest measure what are some

584
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,480
some things that might look like

585
00:30:02,919 --> 00:30:07,480
measures that don't get counted as

586
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,039
measure numbers in your experience yep

587
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:11,840
Vanessa

588
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:14,840
pickups great pickups did you have

589
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:18,799
another one that you're saying no good

590
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:18,799
anybody else think of

591
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:26,919
something ah if you have a Koda or

592
00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:29,960
repeat and then you expand the repeat we

593
00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:32,399
tend to call that like measure 1 2 3 4

594
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:34,840
five well we'll say six cuz you usually

595
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:36,640
repeat even numbered measures and then

596
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:43,320
you repeat it we sometimes call that

597
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:48,559
like 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 a 5 a 6 a the measure

598
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:52,200
after 6 is usually seven it is not 13 if

599
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:54,559
you repeat right we don't count that

600
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:58,880
here's another commonly encountered one

601
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:58,880
especially seems to happen in 34

602
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:07,000
uh here we'll sorry let me start that

603
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:07,000
again pick up

604
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:13,490
[Music]

605
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:21,360
measure anyone see

606
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:25,080
this

607
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:27,600
Etc where you have a incomplete measure

608
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:30,000
a repeat sign and then you begin the

609
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,960
pickup again

610
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,120
afterwards generally we'd call this

611
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:38,120
measure one 2

612
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:41,240
3 four

613
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:43,000
five but most computer representations

614
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:45,480
will represent this as a measure and

615
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:49,279
this as a measure that are both part of

616
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:51,679
the same conceptual measure um why it's

617
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:54,440
easier sometimes to to only look for

618
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:56,960
repeat signs at the ends of measures and

619
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:59,360
not have to look through between every

620
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:01,120
note to see if there's a repeat sign so

621
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:03,120
those are some of the reasons it might

622
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,559
uh call off so here's how we can do it

623
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:07,360
this

624
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:10,080
way um another thing that you'll find

625
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,919
quite often uh and it said what the

626
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:19,200
offset of that offset

627
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:24,120
112 we could say um well piano right uh

628
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:29,960
yeah left hand equals beach. Parts the

629
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:32,960
final part and then um Pian left hand

630
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:35,919
get Elements by

631
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,799
offset uh what do we say one time oh

632
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:40,720
let's let's grab a little bit of context

633
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:40,720
100 to

634
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:47,720
150 oops

635
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:50,080
and want to cast that into like a list

636
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:54,880
or something like

637
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:58,600
that and so that lets you get things

638
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:01,639
from um from within a smaller

639
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:04,039
area you'll find there is also because

640
00:33:01,639 --> 00:33:06,360
get Elements by offset is not recursive

641
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:08,720
there is a recursive version get

642
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:10,840
Elements by offset in hierarchy and I

643
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:15,279
wish I had come up with a shorter name

644
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:17,600
for that but um so you can be able to

645
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:19,360
find anything at a particular element

646
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:21,960
within a

647
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:24,000
hierarchy so these are some standard

648
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:26,840
things some other people were putting in

649
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,880
using uh Lambda filters in some of the

650
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:31,240
code do that who has worked with a

651
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:33,200
Lambda filter before in their life not

652
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:35,000
everybody most people okay so you can

653
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,440
you can say you can write a little piece

654
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:41,679
of code to say just get me things that

655
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:43,159
aren't on here um one thing that one

656
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:45,919
reason you might want to use some of

657
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:48,120
these built-in uh features is that it's

658
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:51,200
a little bit expensive to iterate over a

659
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:55,039
stream so uh the filters do sort of a

660
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:57,840
pre- iteration um for those uh who are

661
00:33:55,039 --> 00:34:00,639
in finance it's kind of like a tax uh

662
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:03,519
tax free tax exempt uh Savings Plan

663
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:05,760
you'll just you only get out the

664
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:08,000
elements and unwrap them and make them

665
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:10,280
look really nice once you have

666
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,200
it peek under here see if there was

667
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:14,520
anything else I wanted to do nope that's

668
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:18,320
basically it

669
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:20,399
on any other questions yeah um yeah so

670
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:23,280
uh during the pie I forgot if we cover

671
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:26,320
this um at some point in class but when

672
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:28,599
I when you flatten um it loses some of

673
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:33,560
the information when I try to then get

674
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:35,480
CL get um context by class um like for

675
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:37,679
for example I think like yeah it just

676
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:39,000
assumes everything is the last part even

677
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,839
though it's not is that because of like

678
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,000
how flat these are yeah it's because

679
00:34:40,839 --> 00:34:49,040
it's um here so let's let's do this

680
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:53,760
we'll say Beach flat equals beach.

681
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:58,720
flatten and now um here we'll look at

682
00:34:53,760 --> 00:35:01,800
the first like 100 things in Beach

683
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:06,560
flat and yeah so we get everything

684
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:09,000
that's here and within that um so we're

685
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:11,800
getting all of these things here almost

686
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,520
all the other get contexts will work

687
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:16,240
really well we'll get to slurs and

688
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:19,359
Dynamics and how they're represented

689
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:23,280
because they're fascinating uh later but

690
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:26,839
the thing is Beach flat itself oh is a

691
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:28,599
score with um in this case sorry so the

692
00:35:26,839 --> 00:35:30,280
in some cases if if you flatten a part

693
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:32,040
it becomes a part if you flatten a score

694
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:33,680
it becomes a score so if you flatten a

695
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:35,960
part you won't be able to get the its

696
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:38,800
original part context but you should be

697
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:42,240
able to get it with this were you not

698
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:44,440
able to um yeah like if if you iterate

699
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:47,000
through these and then like through the

700
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:50,800
notes in the flat for example will you

701
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:53,440
be able to get the correct like all the

702
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:58,680
parts yep uh let's see I they should be

703
00:35:53,440 --> 00:36:03,000
different right let's hope so

704
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:03,000
Class stream.

705
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:11,000
part sorry is that the very

706
00:36:06,839 --> 00:36:11,000
end that's oh

707
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:17,520
interesting that seems to be a

708
00:36:14,319 --> 00:36:21,000
bug I'll look into that see what see

709
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:22,880
what might have caused that to come in

710
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,440
um we have a pretty rigorous testing but

711
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:28,440
I don't remember ever testing on that

712
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:32,359
particular one um

713
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:35,319
yep that's why I have you thank you yep

714
00:36:32,359 --> 00:36:37,960
um yeah that'll be interesting what you

715
00:36:35,319 --> 00:36:41,040
might be able to do um I'm not going to

716
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:44,000
try to no part of this class is about uh

717
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:45,359
working around music 21 bugs um though

718
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,680
you will find them let's see what

719
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:49,319
happens if we do uh we get context by

720
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:52,119
class stream.

721
00:36:49,319 --> 00:36:55,520
measure okay

722
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:57,079
and okay so that one does change so I

723
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,839
suppose you could do this you get the

724
00:36:57,079 --> 00:37:04,280
streams measures context and then get

725
00:36:58,839 --> 00:37:06,680
that measures uh context by

726
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:09,760
Class

727
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:11,560
part and now we have different stuff

728
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,680
I'll try to figure out exactly what's

729
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:17,280
happening to not make it not make that

730
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:18,960
work properly um it um but it was

731
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,880
happening with the B Cals also right so

732
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:24,280
it's not a piano bug the piano paring H

733
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:26,079
still has bugs um that's why you're not

734
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:29,240
going to be working too often with piano

735
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:31,920
scores only when I I've um really done

736
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:35,240
that great any other things before we

737
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:37,720
move on to the next and most fun topic

738
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:40,040
for a little

739
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:43,480
bit okay I'm going to move over to the

740
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:45,720
board for a little bit and let's um

741
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:48,119
let's just do some by hand warm-ups

742
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:50,520
we're going to be moving on to intervals

743
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:50,520
for a

744
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:54,119
bit

745
00:37:54,240 --> 00:38:00,079
and these will all supposedly notes

746
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,480
there supposed to be lined up just write

747
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:06,920
them down here I'll give them as number

748
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:10,200
one 2 3 4 5 6

749
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:11,880
seven want you to say um and actually I

750
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:14,240
won't put them as chords I'll always put

751
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:17,520
them here so that there's a

752
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,520
directionality on

753
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:23,119
them

754
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:28,000
and go ahead and work through as I'm

755
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,040
writing that

756
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,200
what the interval is in terms of not

757
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:35,119
number of semitones but we'll call it

758
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,440
we'll call this the dionic interval

759
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:39,160
these are one of these things people

760
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:42,000
haven't completely done so like major

761
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:44,839
third perfect fourth things like that

762
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:49,520
for all these just do it as a

763
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:49,520
review second one's always

764
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:30,160
actually sorry I'm going to change

765
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:32,920
number four for a

766
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:35,119
second want to have at least

767
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:36,640
one goes the other direction I'll put

768
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:39,960
this up

769
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:42,400
for a second okay just so we're on the

770
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:43,920
same page everybody just one second

771
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,440
everybody shout out number one on the

772
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:49,800
count of 3 1 2

773
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:51,640
three major third okay good keep

774
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:53,280
working I just want to make sure we're

775
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:55,760
all using the same

776
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:57,000
system so let's let's get back together

777
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:01,400
even if you don't have them all we have

778
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:05,440
a ma 3D the top um and we'll we'll start

779
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:08,359
with Angelica um and we'll move uh no

780
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:10,160
we'll move this way um what what' you

781
00:40:08,359 --> 00:40:12,760
get get for this one do you have that

782
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:16,720
diminish fifth diminish fifth anybody

783
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:19,440
get another answer it's good anyone any

784
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:21,680
other answers yeah diminish 12 diminish

785
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:24,119
12

786
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:27,680
ah any other

787
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:32,800
answers augmented fourth anybody we have

788
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:35,000
augmented fourth on the table okay so we

789
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:38,119
have a couple different contexts where

790
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:40,680
any of these things can be right oh and

791
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:43,599
uh I want on this one also I should have

792
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:46,040
been um pretty anal from the beginning

793
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:49,920
if I want to say a direction before the

794
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:51,079
major 3D what do we want to say up or

795
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:56,119
let's let's be a little bit more

796
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:57,800
elevated it is a an ascending ascending

797
00:40:56,119 --> 00:40:59,520
major third

798
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,880
good this is usend I'm just going to do

799
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:04,839
that for a little bit so we can keep

800
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:08,560
going with that um so it's a diminished

801
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:10,800
fifth what's a context where diminish uh

802
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:12,760
fifth is as good an answer as diminish

803
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,599
12th and what's one that doesn't what

804
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:16,520
are we assuming which type you've been

805
00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:19,359
doing some of the reading what's the

806
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:21,040
equivalence class that we're using that

807
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:24,440
allows

808
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:29,200
this o octave equivalent so the O of

809
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:32,680
OPEC if we allow the o equivalence class

810
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:36,920
then we don't care if it's diminished

811
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:39,560
fifth or diminished 12th when might who

812
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:42,520
who is a stakeholder who might care

813
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:44,880
about um can you sing this can you sing

814
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:48,240
this piece uh it has a whole bunch of um

815
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:50,400
diminished fifths in it I go yeah no

816
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:53,119
problem I'm an experienced singer great

817
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:55,119
so you're going to sing uh what what

818
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:58,160
notes that you're going to sing this

819
00:41:55,119 --> 00:42:00,319
note and then you're going to sing uh

820
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:03,200
this note you said you had no problem

821
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:06,839
seeing diminished fifths right so there

822
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:09,079
are contexts where we will very much

823
00:42:06,839 --> 00:42:11,800
care about not having octave equivalence

824
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:15,200
and there's other ones where we won't

825
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:17,520
um we'll I'll give you the music 21

826
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:19,319
terms for um for how these things work

827
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:22,319
but we sometimes call this a simple

828
00:42:19,319 --> 00:42:23,960
versus a compound interval so sometimes

829
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:26,640
we care only about simple intervals

830
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:29,040
sometimes we care about compound uh uh

831
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:31,280
when's time that we might be okay with

832
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,400
calling it augmented fourth what

833
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:36,800
equivalence

834
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,800
class uh might be in

835
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:44,839
play spelling spelling or and harmonic

836
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:48,160
yeah so if spelling doesn't

837
00:42:44,839 --> 00:42:52,520
matter what's what's an app that you

838
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:55,839
might make um that I have made I suppose

839
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:58,240
where um where when you're doing this

840
00:42:55,839 --> 00:43:00,040
kind of interval ident ification you

841
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:04,200
want to be careful and turn off spelling

842
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:06,760
for a bit what's the context of interval

843
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:09,680
um identification where you don't want

844
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:13,000
to be too uptight about whether they

845
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:15,040
hear it as a whether I gave it away kind

846
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,040
of diminished fourth or augmented

847
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:19,280
diminished fifth or augmented fourth

848
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:21,440
yeah is it one where you're just like

849
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:24,280
train your like interval training yeah

850
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:26,559
where you're doing ear training right

851
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:28,359
can you you can't usually hear the

852
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:30,480
difference between diminished fourth and

853
00:43:28,359 --> 00:43:32,440
augmented fifth at least not till you

854
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,200
hear the next note right when you hear

855
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:35,800
the opening of The Simpsons then you

856
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:39,119
know it's augmented fourth and non

857
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:42,839
divish fifth based on where it goes um

858
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:44,280
good okay then um next one let's keep

859
00:43:42,839 --> 00:43:47,400
going don't want to spend too much time

860
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:49,839
on this want to get some programing what

861
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:52,960
uh Paul do you want to take a shot on

862
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:55,319
this one you can take a shot or pass go

863
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:57,079
but you take a shot augmented second

864
00:43:55,319 --> 00:44:00,079
augmented second and just three put

865
00:43:57,079 --> 00:44:03,160
identic what what direction ascending

866
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:06,079
augmented second good

867
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:08,359
great I don't think there's any way that

868
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:10,520
you could say it's an augmented ninth

869
00:44:08,359 --> 00:44:12,160
you can always reduce the octave but you

870
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:14,160
cannot that's an interesting

871
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:15,800
non-equivalence class right you would

872
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,599
never be allowed to call that augmented

873
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:21,520
ninth but you can call this one in

874
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:25,000
diminished fifth great

875
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:28,680
uh number four uh let's continue

876
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:34,800
Jonathan uh descending augmented octave

877
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:38,079
good descending augmented uh augmented

878
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:40,680
octave great now let's uh keep going

879
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:41,960
around to Matthew um what do you want to

880
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:44,920
call number

881
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:48,319
five for lack of a better word I might

882
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:50,599
say augmented augmented augmented second

883
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:53,040
augmented augmented augmented second

884
00:44:50,599 --> 00:44:55,480
everyone agree with

885
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:58,319
that well let's look at let's look at

886
00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:00,960
this so

887
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:03,599
uh D2 e is what

888
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:08,520
kind what's that note what's that

889
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:11,240
interval major second so D to e sharp

890
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:13,240
is augmented so anything bigger than

891
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:15,319
major is augmented I want to make sure

892
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:18,319
that this year we don't lose any points

893
00:45:15,319 --> 00:45:19,760
on the problem set from uh from us

894
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:24,200
teaching the computer wrong so good

895
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:24,200
augmented second so what's this going to

896
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:28,920
be augmented augmented second or doubly

897
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:32,119
augmented second so good so what do we

898
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:35,960
have to add this what do

899
00:45:32,119 --> 00:45:35,960
we triply augmented

900
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:44,520
second quadruply augmented second you

901
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,520
know those um quadruply augmented

902
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:50,680
seconds

903
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:53,359
right uh let's do your tonal theory is

904
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:57,839
that consonant or

905
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:57,839
dissonant consonant consonant

906
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:05,400
all diminished or augmented intervals or

907
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:08,880
doubly diminished or doubly augmented

908
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:11,960
whatever are traditionally considered

909
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:14,559
dissonances no matter what they sound

910
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:16,760
like so if you doubly augment triply

911
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:20,119
augment quadruply augment they will

912
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:21,920
generally be regarded as dissonances be

913
00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:23,920
because you're they're either a

914
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:26,640
dissonance or you have written them

915
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:28,520
wrong and the one um that comes up is

916
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:31,800
aug augmented second which sounds just

917
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:34,240
like the beautiful minor third but there

918
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:35,480
so we have quadruply augmented very very

919
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:38,440
close Matthew you shouldn't you should

920
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:40,559
feel proud on that uh quadruple

921
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:43,040
augmented second ascending or

922
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:46,720
descending ascending

923
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:51,119
good great and Misha you get this one

924
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:54,319
I'm not sure okay good pass on Jason

925
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:56,040
good uh doubly diminish second doubly

926
00:46:54,319 --> 00:47:00,079
diminish second let's let's double check

927
00:46:56,040 --> 00:47:04,119
that here that's a minor second right so

928
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:06,680
diminish second dou diminish Second

929
00:47:04,119 --> 00:47:09,440
Great ascending or

930
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:11,800
descending spell this way ascending

931
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:14,720
spelled this way it's ascending and so

932
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:14,720
let's hear those two

933
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:22,440
notes ascending doubly diminish second

934
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:22,440
anyone want to make another

935
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:27,440
argument yes Adam you should just

936
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:29,599
consider what the final pitches are

937
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,599
actually what the final pitches are what

938
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:33,480
do you mean by final pitches eventually

939
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:35,319
it turns out to be an f and a e

940
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:38,119
eventually it turns out to be Adam has

941
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:40,280
an ontology that pray that um that

942
00:47:38,119 --> 00:47:42,200
privileges the ear over the written

943
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:44,720
ontology that will do him very well in

944
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:47,839
most contexts except for in a sheet

945
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:49,880
music Factory right yeah so so sometimes

946
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:52,200
we'll want that sometimes uh we won't

947
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:57,599
but yeah so you could do that uh any

948
00:47:52,200 --> 00:48:00,839
other argument about when so we have

949
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:04,200
ascending but sounds descending or

950
00:48:00,839 --> 00:48:07,280
descending sounds ascending how um if

951
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:08,480
you wanted to say I'm on midi note what

952
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:11,599
is that

953
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:13,319
65 this is midi note 65 and this one is

954
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:16,160
midi note

955
00:48:13,319 --> 00:48:19,880
64 what's the chromatic number of

956
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:23,960
semitones distance sorry for writing so

957
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:25,520
small minus one right so if we don't

958
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:28,400
care about

959
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:32,040
spelling it is a negative

960
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:35,760
interval um here is a context where you

961
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:39,240
might care about how it's written in

962
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:42,160
particular let's say for

963
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:44,280
some deranged reason you needed to write

964
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:49,480
this as a

965
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:53,040
chord oops sorry there are certain rules

966
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:57,720
about where the accidentals go from

967
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:57,720
bottom note to next note

968
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:03,400
so these are some of the things that

969
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,839
come up with computers these are

970
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:08,400
underdefined

971
00:49:04,839 --> 00:49:08,400
parts of Music

972
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:17,920
Theory underdefined parts of music

973
00:49:14,359 --> 00:49:21,680
theory that um that will come up quite

974
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:24,119
often that nobody has absolutely decided

975
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:27,079
on these things because you will see

976
00:49:24,119 --> 00:49:29,520
that they do come up in real music music

977
00:49:27,079 --> 00:49:33,079
but they're very very rare and they're I

978
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:35,960
mean um believe the number of doubly

979
00:49:33,079 --> 00:49:38,760
diminished octaves in the music 21

980
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:41,720
Corpus of tonal music of music of the

981
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:44,440
18th 19th century out of millions of

982
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:46,960
notes there's about 28 times that it

983
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:50,559
happens it happens once in the beach p

984
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:53,240
no it happens in the climan piece um so

985
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:56,440
it does happen in pretty normal music

986
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:58,960
but when you see this what do you think

987
00:49:56,440 --> 00:50:02,160
is Happening by the way when you might

988
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:02,160
have this happening at the same

989
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:07,200
time what's context Adam maybe two parts

990
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:08,799
have a crossover two parts are having a

991
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:11,680
crossover what's what's the top part

992
00:50:08,799 --> 00:50:13,200
doing the one that starts off higher the

993
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:16,440
top part is going down it's the one with

994
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:18,160
the right the one with the the the F

995
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:19,599
flat yeah so sometimes when you're

996
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:21,440
writing a chromatic scale for an

997
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:24,119
instrument or something you'll use a lot

998
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:27,480
of uh flats and then the other one could

999
00:50:24,119 --> 00:50:30,000
be going up um I think you'll that this

1000
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:32,160
happens in John Philips Souza's March

1001
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,160
the

1002
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:36,319
thunderer is a melody in the

1003
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:40,799
Baseline and that there's um I think

1004
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:42,880
that's one where there's a d there's

1005
00:50:40,799 --> 00:50:44,720
either a diminished octave or W

1006
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:47,400
diminished octave in the piano part and

1007
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:48,880
in the instrumental Parts you get these

1008
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:51,520
uh doubly diminished seconds and

1009
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:54,640
diminished seconds that happen there

1010
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:58,599
good so one of the debates is whether or

1011
00:50:54,640 --> 00:51:01,640
not this number tells you ascending or

1012
00:50:58,599 --> 00:51:04,520
descending versus the other one now last

1013
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:07,640
one uh we ended with

1014
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:09,960
Jason Vincent did you no go ahead uh

1015
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:13,000
like diminished

1016
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:15,760
Unis one diminished

1017
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:19,000
one ascending or

1018
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:22,000
descending n

1019
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:24,440
n null poter

1020
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,920
exception uh what do you want to call it

1021
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:30,040
then let's come up with a music term

1022
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:31,920
besides null like a new term uh no

1023
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:35,160
anyone know a music term that's neither

1024
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:35,160
ascending or descending for an

1025
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:40,920
interval you don't usually use it in

1026
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:42,200
intervals but you might use it for types

1027
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:45,160
of

1028
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:47,640
motion the stationary we use another one

1029
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:50,119
sometimes um oblique has anyone heard

1030
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:52,079
that term no okay so some people have

1031
00:51:50,119 --> 00:51:54,200
when there's some motion and some not

1032
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:57,079
motion so some people say

1033
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:59,640
that yeah so there's kind of a B so you

1034
00:51:57,079 --> 00:52:02,400
could say it's no motion is a diminished

1035
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:05,280
Unison um the other thing that some

1036
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:07,400
people want to do is to make everything

1037
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:08,880
always be positive so you can call this

1038
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:11,960
also what's another term we could also

1039
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:15,000
say I'm just going to get a fresh thing

1040
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:18,640
over here so we can look at that from e

1041
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:22,880
natural to E flat we can call this

1042
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:27,799
diminished Unison what we we also call

1043
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:28,839
this augmented Unison and then

1044
00:52:27,799 --> 00:52:32,440
what's the

1045
00:52:28,839 --> 00:52:34,319
directionality uh descend descending so

1046
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:38,160
some

1047
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:40,920
people descending augmented Unis some

1048
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:44,880
people who have done some programming um

1049
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:49,119
things have thought about maybe the

1050
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:52,720
diminished Unison should vanish from our

1051
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:55,240
vocabulary because it's unclear whether

1052
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:58,400
music works like um integer

1053
00:52:55,240 --> 00:53:02,440
multiplication if you have a

1054
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:04,920
descending diminished Unison

1055
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:07,359
descending diminished Unison does that

1056
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:09,040
mean descending multiplied by diminished

1057
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:11,119
Unison which is negative negative

1058
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:13,559
negative means you're going up a

1059
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:16,920
negative times a negative is a positive

1060
00:53:13,559 --> 00:53:19,200
at least the descending augmented Unison

1061
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:21,359
escapes that

1062
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:24,599
argument so some of the weird things

1063
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:27,040
that come up great let's start um any

1064
00:53:24,599 --> 00:53:29,599
any questions on this before we move on

1065
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:32,440
thanks let's get aead start on one of

1066
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:35,400
the hardest parts of problem set 4 uh

1067
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:37,480
what I'd like you to do is given two

1068
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:42,559
music 21

1069
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:45,359
notes first give me what the number one

1070
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:48,000
2 three we call this the generic

1071
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:50,079
interval some people use the term dionic

1072
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,799
interval for this but we'll use dionic

1073
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:57,280
interval for things like perfect Unison

1074
00:53:52,799 --> 00:54:01,000
major 2 minor 3D so on first given any

1075
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:03,200
two notes what's the um what's the

1076
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:07,720
generic interval between them and then

1077
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:11,520
let's see if we can work up to what the

1078
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:14,119
dionic interval is just as a reminder

1079
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:17,200
there is a class called interval you it

1080
00:54:14,119 --> 00:54:19,119
is still locked on this so we'll do this

1081
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:21,799
for about the last six minutes and

1082
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:23,559
that's how we'll end the class today

1083
00:54:21,799 --> 00:54:27,359
I'll just be going around and helping

1084
00:54:23,559 --> 00:54:27,359
people get started thanks
