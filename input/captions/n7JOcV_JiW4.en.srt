1
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:10,840
so the last speaker of this session is

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,280
Professor caros Spa he's a assistant

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,879
professor at MIT Department of

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,600
mechanical

5
00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:21,519
engineering uh he talk about his

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:24,080
research a 3D micro or Nano architected

7
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:26,760
material to achieve a significant

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:31,960
enhancement of the properties his title

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,960
is uh 99% air very interesting title

10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,000
so all right thank you very much for

11
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,480
that nice introduction Mickey and thank

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,760
you all for being here and uh hopefully

13
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,199
I'll get to uh energize you a little bit

14
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,440
right before our coffee break and where

15
00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:55,000
we get to network a little bit more so

16
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,280
today really the goal one is to describe

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,680
the research that we're doing in my

18
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,320
group and second I want you to take some

19
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,399
some messages out of this and hopefully

20
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,359
learn a little bit more about

21
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:05,000
architector materials and in particular

22
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,000
the message is that I hope I can

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,520
convince you that we can really engineer

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,759
the materials of the future materials

25
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,640
that do not exist yet if we start by

26
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:17,080
designing them at the Nano scale and go

27
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,040
upwards so let me start off by looking

28
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:21,119
at this case study let's imagine that we

29
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,680
have a slab of a mystery material in

30
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,000
front of us and this material is

31
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,000
actually going to resists some load we

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,920
try to bend it it actually resists that

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,439
it's kind of hard to break it but then

34
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,360
I'll tell you that what's special about

35
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:35,640
this material is that it's about 99% air

36
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:39,360
so then the next question that you're

37
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:42,119
going to ask is if 99% is air this 1% of

38
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,600
solid where is it distributed and that's

39
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:45,159
a very hard question to answer and I'll

40
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,640
tell you it's easier to say what the

41
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:48,439
wrong answer is and we know that the

42
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,280
wrong answer really is that the material

43
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:53,680
is not going to be just localized along

44
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,840
one corner or or just the edges right so

45
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,600
this is the question that we're trying

46
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,799
to answer in our field of architect and

47
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,520
materials the question is how do we take

48
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,200
a little amount of material and do the

49
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,719
most with it by Distributing it in a

50
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,920
very interesting manner so this leads to

51
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:09,679
the first question that I want to answer

52
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,920
which is what do we mean by this term

53
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,680
architected materials the good thing is

54
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,640
that all of you brought samples of

55
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,040
architected materials with you so human

56
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,959
bone is the best example to us it feels

57
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,760
like a homogeneous material but we know

58
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,959
that if we look at the micr structure of

59
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:27,160
bone we get this very nice ligament

60
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,519
based architecture which leads to very

61
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,239
interesting properties such as a

62
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:32,599
highight toughness and also the high

63
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,440
strength of bone right and bones are not

64
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:36,680
the only architector material out there

65
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,400
in nature for instance the SE sponges

66
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,680
are an example of an architector

67
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,640
material in this case they are

68
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,200
hierarchical and what I mean by that is

69
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,959
that if you start zooming in at

70
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,519
different length scales you're going to

71
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:49,800
start picking up different structural

72
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,480
features each that serve a mechanical

73
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:55,120
purpose now this concept of architecture

74
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,760
really it is not new to us um and it is

75
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,959
epitomized in structure such as the

76
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,239
Eiffel Tower but the point I'd like to

77
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:04,159
make is that the Eiffel Tower is not an

78
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:05,720
architected material so why is this well

79
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,200
if we look at the leg of the Eiffel

80
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,920
Tower and I'm going to try to pick out

81
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,239
one of the struts that makes up the leg

82
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:13,239
and I say it has some length L but then

83
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:15,640
I compare that to the effective width of

84
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:17,239
the leg that it makes up we see that L

85
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,200
and W are about the same right they're

86
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:20,920
on the order of tens of meters and

87
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,840
that's an issue because we don't achieve

88
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,440
what I call separation of scales what

89
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,920
this means is that no matter how far

90
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,640
away you are from the Eiffel Tower you

91
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,840
can always tell that this is a

92
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:32,519
heterogeneous structure you can always

93
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,360
poke holes through it so the opposite

94
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:37,319
would be some architect material where

95
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:39,080
we indeed have some overall Dimension W

96
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:41,200
and some intrinsic micr structural

97
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,280
length L that is significantly smaller

98
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,120
than w at that point we can call this an

99
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,120
architected material so I can try to

100
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,879
categorize a broadly just three broad

101
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,879
examples of architector materials that

102
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:53,599
we readily use one type is a stochastic

103
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:55,319
architector material where we need to go

104
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,280
no further than our kitchen a kitchen

105
00:03:55,319 --> 00:04:00,400
sponge here is where we architect the

106
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,920
pore sizes just to give us a certain uh

107
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,000
property um if we take fibers carbon

108
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:07,159
fibers as an example well composits are

109
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,840
one of the most efficient architecture

110
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:11,239
materials out there and this is you know

111
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:13,280
heavily used in the Aerospace industry

112
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:15,439
and the third example is one where we

113
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,720
take material and we distribute it in a

114
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,799
periodic Manner and we call what I what

115
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,120
I what I describe as lattice architected

116
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:24,040
materials and an example here are these

117
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,960
honeycomb panels that are used

118
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,639
extensively in the airspace industry

119
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,440
basically all the floors and airplanes

120
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:31,440
and most of the walls are made of these

121
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,160
very lightweight honeycomb

122
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,800
panels so that's the first question the

123
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,919
next question is why do we bother with

124
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,639
architecting materials and I'll try to

125
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:42,320
answer this question by giving you three

126
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,960
answers the first one it's kind of

127
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,560
obvious and I already alluded to it is

128
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,600
this idea that because a large

129
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,840
percentage of these materials is air

130
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,880
naturally you're going to get a very

131
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,680
lightweight material and if we want to

132
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,199
keep sending probes to different planets

133
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,440
we need to make sure that we continue to

134
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:57,720
do so with materials that are very

135
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,280
lightweight but also very mechanically

136
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,199
robust the second question as to why

137
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,479
this is

138
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,479
worthwhile is that if you architect

139
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:07,360
materials at the right length scale and

140
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:09,039
here I'm talking about the Nano scale

141
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,360
you're going to endow these materials

142
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:13,039
with properties that you never would

143
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,560
have imagined an example are ceramics at

144
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,440
the macro scale let's think of our

145
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,000
coffee mug if you were to drop this

146
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,639
coffee mug it's going to shatter in a

147
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,600
million pieces well if you take ceramics

148
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,759
at the nanoc scale there's going to

149
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,720
they're going to behave in a very

150
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,160
different manner more like a rubber so

151
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,160
this is an example where you have we

152
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:32,039
have a hollow architecture that's made

153
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:34,000
up of a camic and it has been shown that

154
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:35,440
you can deform these to about 50% of

155
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
their original height and then upon

156
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,479
removing the load they're basically

157
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,280
going to fully almost fully recover so

158
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:42,639
extrapolating this to larger Dimensions

159
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,039
really would change the way we think

160
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,880
about Ceramics

161
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:48,720
altogether now the third point is that

162
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,800
if we want to absorb a lot of energy for

163
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,240
instance for protective applications uh

164
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,160
we can design the micr structure of

165
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,880
materials such as Foams but in a more

166
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,919
careful manner to maximize how much

167
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:59,840
energy we can dissipate an example here

168
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,880
is a material that has two stable

169
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,199
configurations it has an uncollapsed

170
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:05,120
configuration and a collapsed

171
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,599
configuration and it takes energy to go

172
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,479
from one to the other and that energy

173
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:11,680
can be used to prevent an egg from

174
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:14,199
breaking right if you put the egg on top

175
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,960
of the structure and the impact makes

176
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:18,199
the material collapse that's energy that

177
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,199
did not go into breaking the shell so we

178
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:22,520
can think of using this concept to

179
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:24,280
design structural components that can

180
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,080
absorb energy and in some cases they

181
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,880
don't have to be permanently damaged but

182
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,759
you could potentially just pop them back

183
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:32,319
into its original configuration and go

184
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,919
ahead and use it over and over

185
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:37,759
again so at this

186
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:39,599
point we we can step back and look at

187
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,000
architect of materials and and try to

188
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:42,440
answer the question okay where if

189
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,440
they're so interesting where do they

190
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:46,720
land compared to all other materials

191
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:48,599
that we already use so what I'm showing

192
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,440
here is called an ashb plot all I'm

193
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:52,680
showing is basically every single

194
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,960
material that we know of the x- axxis is

195
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,720
the weight or the density of this

196
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,199
material and then in the y- axis I have

197
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,919
some mechanical property here I'm

198
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,120
talking about the effective stiffness of

199
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,440
these materials

200
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,479
and what I hope you're realizing here

201
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,520
and the takeaway of this plot is that

202
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:08,080
there is this white space where no

203
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,800
existing materials really currently uh

204
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,400
land right so this space right here well

205
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,759
that's exactly where architector

206
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,240
materials land architector materials

207
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:19,160
have allowed us to make very lightweight

208
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,160
materials but uh uh with very high

209
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,080
mechanical properties but what I'm

210
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,840
showing you here really is an idea that

211
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,639
is about a decade old in the sense that

212
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,199
you know our this field that has uh

213
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,120
really evolved over the last decade

214
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:32,319
started by looking just at stiffness but

215
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,199
nowadays the fron interior of

216
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,800
architector materials is is looking at

217
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:37,879
more interesting properties such as

218
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:40,919
thermal conductivity uh energy

219
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:42,360
absorption and and any other uh types of

220
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,960
of of interesting properties that you

221
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,599
want not just the

222
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:48,720
stiffness so okay I think we defined

223
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:50,400
architector materials I hope I convince

224
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,319
you that they're worthwhile studying

225
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,720
them and we know where they land from an

226
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,599
engineering perspective the next

227
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,720
question is how do we go about

228
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,199
fabricating these materials and I'll

229
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,039
describe the two ways that we fabricate

230
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:04,840
them my lab we do this extensively at

231
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:07,159
the micro to Nano scale and uh we can

232
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,560
make these solid out of some polymer or

233
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:10,440
we can also make them Hollow as I

234
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,680
described earlier where we basically can

235
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:14,680
use a polymer or a ceramic uh uh or

236
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:17,080
sorry a metal or a ceramic to to make

237
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:19,599
this coating the way we do this is

238
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:21,800
basically by using 30d printing but it's

239
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:23,199
a special type of 30d printing it's the

240
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,840
highest resolution 30d printing

241
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:28,120
technique that currently exists uh it's

242
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:31,080
basically a light based 3D printing it

243
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:33,200
uses a ftoc layer that is focused very

244
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,680
tightly inside of a drop of a

245
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,839
photosensitive resin and we're going to

246
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,519
trace we trace this focal point that's

247
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,080
about 200 nomers Big we trace it in

248
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:44,080
three dimensions and it's going to

249
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,640
locally solidify the material wherever

250
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,320
it passes after we trace it in any

251
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,640
complex arbitrary paths then we end up

252
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,720
with our polymeric nanom microl luses or

253
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,839
whatever complex geometry you

254
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,839
designed so then how we how do we go

255
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,720
about making these Hollow well we start

256
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,440
off with these polymeric ones as a

257
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,160
template and then we go through a

258
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,680
conformal coding process what I'm

259
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:08,040
showing here is a process called Atomic

260
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,640
layer deposition it's basically a way to

261
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:12,720
get fully conformal Coatings and we do

262
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,079
this one layer of atoms at a time and it

263
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:18,160
allows us to really have high resolution

264
00:09:15,079 --> 00:09:19,880
uh and and very very thin Coatings so at

265
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,640
this point now we have a core shell

266
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,160
composite we have a polymer in the

267
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,680
inside and then we have a ceramic or

268
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,480
whatever you chose to do the coating

269
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:28,320
with but ultimately I told you I want to

270
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,720
make these Hollow so then we go ahead

271
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,040
and cut some AC ficial beams because we

272
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,640
want to expose the polymer and then we

273
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,800
put this inside of an oxygen plasma

274
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,920
chamber to remove the polymer so that

275
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,640
the ultimate product is this Holo

276
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:43,600
ceramic architecture so this is at the

277
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,120
micro micro scale but we also can

278
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,760
fabricate architecture materials at the

279
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,320
macros scale as long as we achieve

280
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:51,800
separation of of scales and here we're

281
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:53,959
using nothing fancy really is just 3D

282
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:56,440
printing it's another form of light

283
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:58,320
based 3D printing uh we it's called

284
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,800
Digital Light processing 3D printing it

285
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:04,000
basically uses UV light uh and IT

286
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:06,640
projects a 2d pattern of light inside of

287
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,399
of a resin pool and as you increase the

288
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,399
number of layers that you add you

289
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:13,480
basically emerge with a

290
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:16,440
three-dimensional uh

291
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:18,120
part so now the next question is how do

292
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,839
we once we make these materials how do

293
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,200
we test them how do we get mechanical

294
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,880
properties out of them so I'll start by

295
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,880
describing this at the macros scale well

296
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:28,560
we can make a cube of this material

297
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:31,200
which has some overall height L some

298
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,959
cross-sectional area a and when we apply

299
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,160
some force with a loading frame we get

300
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:37,639
uh what we call their engineering stress

301
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,519
it's just the force that you applied

302
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:42,079
divided by the area of this material and

303
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:43,639
upon some deformation that we'll call

304
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:46,360
Delta then we get some Metric of

305
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:48,480
deformation which is just our strain

306
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,320
engineering strain so what we get out of

307
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,040
this are these so-called St stress

308
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,839
strain plots which have a lot of

309
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,079
information I'll just describe briefly a

310
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,440
couple of things that we generally

311
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:59,440
extract we try to extract the effective

312
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,079
stiffness of these materials we're also

313
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,880
generally are interested in in knowing

314
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:04,480
when they start failing in other words

315
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,360
we Define the strength the yield

316
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,760
strength of these materials we can also

317
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,519
extract things like the energy

318
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,959
absorption in these materials so this is

319
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:14,480
at the macro scale but as I told you we

320
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,360
fabricate a lot of these at the micro

321
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,800
scale and this is where things get both

322
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:21,279
hard but also a lot of fun um the way

323
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,399
you know these materials are are

324
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,240
extremely small so we basically have to

325
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:26,800
work with scanning electron microscopes

326
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,760
we cannot see the materials with with

327
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,839
our eyes so we have to be inside of a

328
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,519
microscope

329
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,079
and we have to use a specialized tool to

330
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,760
be able to get the mechanical test so

331
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:36,600
let me let me zoom in here so you can

332
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,519
see what I'm talking about this is a

333
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,399
nanoindentor this is how we push the

334
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:42,399
material and measure loads but we still

335
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:45,040
can't see the sample quite yet so we

336
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,760
have to keep zooming in so just to give

337
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,000
you a sense of scale so this is a flat

338
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:50,760
punch Diamond tip that is going to push

339
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,680
on the sample we have a load cell here

340
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,480
on the left and just to give you a sense

341
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,720
of scale if my hair would have fallen

342
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,440
inside of the scanning electr

343
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,240
microscope's chamber this is

344
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,560
approximately how it would look compared

345
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,120
compared to these samples right so we

346
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,000
don't need a lot of material to be able

347
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,360
to extract all of these properties if we

348
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,560
work at this

349
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,480
microscale so but things are very hard

350
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,160
right and we have to work with the

351
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:14,279
microscope so I hope the next question

352
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:15,680
you ask is Carlos if it's so easy to

353
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:18,240
make them at the macroscale and you're

354
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,959
getting effectively some same properties

355
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,160
why why do you bother with doing these

356
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:23,959
hard experiments I also have three

357
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,079
answers for you the first one we already

358
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:27,880
discussed it right if we want nanoscale

359
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,760
size effects there's no way around it we

360
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,320
need to make sure that you can fabricate

361
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,120
at the right resolution and get these

362
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,440
nanoscale features the second aspect is

363
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,959
that it really depends on the

364
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,160
application that you're looking for for

365
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,959
instance if you're interested in making

366
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:43,199
these These are called acoustic meta

367
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:45,120
materials because they can uh manipulate

368
00:12:43,199 --> 00:12:46,399
the way the way sound propagates through

369
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,839
them if you're interested in

370
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,880
manipulating them in the kilohertz

371
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,480
regime in the audible regime then it

372
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,760
suffices for you to have just a

373
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,399
millimeter length scale in your unit

374
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,880
cells right the repeating building block

375
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:59,440
can be in the millimeters that's totally

376
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,519
fine however if you're interested in

377
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,920
something like medical ultrasound which

378
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,560
is now in the megahertz regime there's

379
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,959
no way around it you need to make sure

380
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:09,279
that your unit cells are now in the

381
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:11,720
order of tens or hundreds of

382
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:13,399
microns and lastly the third aspect

383
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,920
which I'm I'm very excited about is this

384
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:17,800
idea that materials characterization

385
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,839
doesn't have to be a slow process if you

386
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,560
do it at the micro scale in particular

387
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,720
we can do high throughput fabrication

388
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:25,519
and validation of materials in a

389
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,240
substrate that's just as big as a

390
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,720
fingernail you could put hundreds of

391
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,720
samples and then in a matter of an

392
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,519
afternoon you can get all the data you

393
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:36,079
need and you can really accelerate the

394
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:38,160
way you do materials Discovery and

395
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,959
characterization so with that I I'll

396
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,880
I'll Briefly summarize the last two

397
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:44,440
decades of research in architector

398
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:46,000
materials and architecture materials

399
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,639
really for the last two decades has been

400
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,480
playing this game of looking at

401
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:51,839
different micr structures and trying to

402
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,639
link this to the mechanical properties

403
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,440
that we get so you see that there's a

404
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:57,040
lot of interesting lates things that

405
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,880
look like fibers which we'll describe in

406
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,120
a bit in a bit also things that look

407
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,920
like Foams I'll mention that in a second

408
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,279
and as you might have expected they all

409
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:07,440
delivered on the promise and what were

410
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,279
these promises so a reminder they were

411
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,399
all lightweight materials indeed there's

412
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:14,959
a lot of air in there um they also were

413
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,199
good at absorbing energy and some of

414
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,920
them depending on how they were

415
00:14:16,199 --> 00:14:21,279
fabricated indeed were able to tap into

416
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:23,959
these size effects the issue though is

417
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:26,880
that over the last decade plus we've

418
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:28,600
been limited to very very small samples

419
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,920
again very comparable to about a 100

420
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,279
microns

421
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,800
so this leads us to to the goal and and

422
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:35,680
the vision that I have for the research

423
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,959
that we're doing and I'll try to portray

424
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,000
this by plotting this work that we've

425
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:42,000
done over the last couple of decades in

426
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,560
the y axis we have the effective length

427
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,959
scale associated with these materials

428
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:48,639
that have been made and tested and then

429
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:50,839
the x-axis is the deformation rate under

430
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,759
which we understand them intestin so all

431
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:54,199
of these have been quasistatic

432
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:57,120
conditions basically very small

433
00:14:54,199 --> 00:14:59,519
deformation upon which uh we we report

434
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,480
mechanical properties so one of the

435
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,440
issues is that we cannot scale up these

436
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:05,639
materials or we have not been able to do

437
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,720
this so one of the ways that we've been

438
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:09,320
able to do this and I'll mention here in

439
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,320
a second I'll start populating the

440
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:13,440
x-axis as to how we're understanding

441
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:15,320
these materials under higher deformation

442
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,839
rates but the first step is trying to

443
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:19,759
scale up the fabrication of these

444
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:22,079
materials and there the answer is in my

445
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:23,639
opinion the quickest solution is

446
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:26,040
actually to bypass 3D printing

447
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:27,920
altogether and in a sense we're using

448
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,920
natural self assembly processes to

449
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,440
create these materials and and and we're

450
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,199
forgetting about 30d printing for a

451
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,800
little

452
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:36,959
bit to understand them under higher

453
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,120
rates higher deformation rates we're

454
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,600
interested in knowing how uh vibrations

455
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,800
or mechanical waves propagate through

456
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:45,240
these materials and this includes sound

457
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,279
uh ultrasound and then now in the more

458
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:49,079
extreme regime we're also looking at how

459
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:51,199
these materials dissipate energy under

460
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:53,440
very extreme conditions such as impact

461
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:56,720
mitigation so we have a technique that

462
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,720
does supersonic impact on these

463
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,639
materials so the goal for today and I

464
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,319
want I want to convince you is that

465
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,160
really the objective is that we want to

466
00:16:02,319 --> 00:16:06,240
enable the potential of these

467
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,160
architector materials Beyond laboratory

468
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,920
settings I think over the last decade

469
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,079
we've done enough fundamental research

470
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,839
to know that they're worthwhile but we

471
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,480
need to really translate that to real

472
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,920
applications and there's three hurdles

473
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,839
that we're trying to work towards to

474
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:21,040
make sure that we can do this first one

475
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:22,959
as I mentioned is scalability the second

476
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,120
one is being able to understand these

477
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:27,399
materials to employ them under extreme

478
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,959
conditions and lastly is that we want

479
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:30,199
these materials to be resilient we we

480
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,120
want to make sure that we can use them

481
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:34,000
we can use them and abuse them and not

482
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,839
necessarily uh have them fail

483
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,079
prematurely so let me start off by

484
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,680
describing this aspect of scalability so

485
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,600
I already spoiled the surprise which is

486
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,959
that let's forget about 3D printing

487
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,839
altogether so what if we use a process

488
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:48,120
that is very familiar to us if we use

489
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,040
water and oil and we mix them vigorously

490
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,920
we're going to form an Emulsion but if

491
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,680
we wait long enough we know that oil and

492
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,440
water is going to separate again right

493
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,120
this is a process called spinodal

494
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,319
decomposition so we're basically

495
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,399
leveraging that concept except not using

496
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:04,720
oil and water we're using two types of

497
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:06,880
polymers and upon creating this Emulsion

498
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,600
before they fully separate we actually

499
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,760
stop this process because one of the two

500
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:12,839
polymers is going to polymerize and

501
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:15,480
solidify which means that then we're

502
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:17,520
going to form these very nice porous

503
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,439
structures because we can remove one of

504
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,959
the two polymers and then the solid one

505
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,959
that that polymerized is going to remain

506
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:25,640
and what's remarkable is that we can do

507
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:27,319
this in a matter of minutes and get

508
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,960
these sizes of these samples again this

509
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:31,440
is now at the cubic Center scale if I

510
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,720
would have tried to print something like

511
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,480
this it would have taken a couple of

512
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,160
weeks with the printer that we have so

513
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,360
this is what this micro structure looks

514
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:41,720
like under the sem you'll see it has its

515
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,600
highly porous these pores are in the

516
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,679
order of about 10 microns this is a

517
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,160
little red blood cell for to give you a

518
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,640
sense of scale but again these materials

519
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,160
are not what I care about I want to make

520
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,760
sure that these are very lightweight and

521
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,880
efficient so this is where I take these

522
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:57,280
as a template and I coat them with these

523
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,400
nanoscale Ceramics and ultimately I want

524
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:02,600
to remove the polymer so we end up with

525
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:04,600
these very nice lightweight uh ceramic

526
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,679
based architectures and this is what

527
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,080
these samples actually look like so

528
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:09,760
basically the best way to describe it

529
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,640
think of this as an interc connetic

530
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:15,039
network of X shells that are very

531
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,720
efficient mechanically uh and because of

532
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:19,240
these nice curvatures lead to very

533
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,880
interesting properties but I want you to

534
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,559
actually believe it by seeing these

535
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,039
experiments as a demonstration that

536
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,960
these properties are quite unique so

537
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:29,520
what I'm showing you here is one of the

538
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:33,000
classical examples that we do in the lab

539
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:35,240
except these material is about 99.9% air

540
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,400
and then the rest is this ceramic

541
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:40,240
basically the same ceramic that makes up

542
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:42,200
a coffee MOG the thing with this ceramic

543
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,320
though is that it's extremely thin so

544
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:48,039
what you see are these shells that are

545
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:49,640
about 30 atoms thick just 11 nanometers

546
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:51,080
and we can do this experiment and try to

547
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,440
do the compression and observe what

548
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:55,080
happens on these samples so let me go

549
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:58,280
ahead and play this video so the ceramic

550
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:59,320
started actually wrinkling unbuckling

551
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,280
and not

552
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,200
shattering and eventually it actually

553
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,200
even

554
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,960
recovered and we can go ahead and

555
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,039
continue doing this compression and we

556
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:10,360
see no indications of big cracks

557
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:11,880
propagating through these material to

558
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,840
the point that we can do this over and

559
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,400
over again again this is the magic of

560
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,120
nanoscale features in materials the

561
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,600
ceramic really should not be doing any

562
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:24,919
of this but it is because it is so

563
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,360
thin so but I started on this Direction

564
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:28,080
with this promise that these materials

565
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:30,240
should be scalable so that's exactly the

566
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,880
research that's ongoing in the lab uh so

567
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,200
we know that we can make these in large

568
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,440
volumes but what we've been missing to

569
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,320
until now has been really understanding

570
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,000
what are the the the micr structures

571
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,640
that we're getting not just looking at

572
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,760
them on in a 2d picture of an sem so

573
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:48,880
we're using nanoscale resolution x-ray

574
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:50,880
tomography which allows us to then

575
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,720
perform these scans which then

576
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,440
ultimately give us a full 3d

577
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,000
reconstruction of the micr structure of

578
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,520
these materials and this is important

579
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,280
because I can take this uh

580
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,360
reconstruction and go ahead and and plug

581
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,720
it into my finite element codes and be

582
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,520
able to now start predicting the

583
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,600
mechanical properties even before I I

584
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,679
need to go to the lab to do an

585
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,000
experiment but this is the real promise

586
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:14,159
of these materials so we're developing

587
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,840
the process we're really understanding

588
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:19,000
the structure and we're also measuring

589
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:21,200
and predicting the properties But

590
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,880
ultimately we want to enable inverse

591
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,960
design of these materials so the user

592
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:28,240
should be able to determine what

593
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:30,039
properties they want basically what if

594
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,320
you want this material to have different

595
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:34,000
stiffness along different directions and

596
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,400
then it should tell us we should be able

597
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,440
to then inform you what does the process

598
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,480
need to look like so that you can get

599
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:42,039
those properties and then the structure

600
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,919
really is just what links these two

601
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:45,120
things

602
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:46,600
together so let me shift gears now and

603
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,440
start talking about these extreme

604
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:51,919
condition uh applications so to

605
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,280
understand these materials under extreme

606
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:56,880
conditions uh the first step really is

607
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:58,720
to go to the established methods to

608
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,240
characterize nanoscale materials at

609
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,520
extreme

610
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,760
conditions well that's the

611
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:07,520
issue there are no techniques that

612
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:09,799
allowed us to do this so upon realizing

613
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,919
this we went back to the drawing board

614
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:14,200
with my team and started really coming

615
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:17,200
up with a wish list of what would this

616
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,679
technique actually look like so we said

617
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,960
okay we want to do highr

618
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:22,960
characterization because we don't want

619
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:24,200
to waste our time in slow experiments

620
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,760
and we don't want to destroy every

621
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,200
single sample that we test right we want

622
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:30,120
more than one data point out of each

623
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,000
sample and what if we can get all these

624
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:34,640
mechanical measurements without ever

625
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
touching these samples at this point I

626
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,440
think you might be saying Carlos you're

627
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,960
crazy this is impossible but I'm happy

628
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:42,039
to report that this is no longer a

629
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:44,080
non-existing method so let me describe

630
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:46,520
what it actually looks

631
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:49,640
like the way to do this is actually

632
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:51,960
using lasers and we use one laser to

633
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:54,039
excite materials to vibrate them by

634
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:56,559
basically using a very high power short

635
00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:58,159
Pauls laser uh doesn't destroy them it

636
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:00,200
basically makes them ring just like a

637
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,840
bell and then we use a different laser

638
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:05,120
to serve as our probe to measure these

639
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:07,360
vibrations so again I'll use the analogy

640
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,720
of a bell often because this is

641
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,799
virtually all we're doing is metam

642
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,640
materials that are just Bells because we

643
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:16,080
can dictate the height of these samples

644
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,559
we can basically dictate the wavelength

645
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,200
at which these samples are going to

646
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:22,000
vibrate and this is the mode that we

647
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,679
effectively excite and just as in a bell

648
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,720
what do we care about when we hit a bell

649
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,919
we care about the frequency that that

650
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,840
comes out and that's what we measure

651
00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:32,760
with our ears well basically our laser

652
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:35,919
is our ears our green laser which allows

653
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:37,640
us to now obtain a measurement of this

654
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,720
frequency and as I mentioned the

655
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,120
wavelength is something that we

656
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,400
determined based on how we made the

657
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:44,360
samples so what this means is that now I

658
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,840
have a speed of sound measurement with

659
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,880
if I know these two properties I know

660
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,600
the speed of sound in this material and

661
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,799
this is important because if I know the

662
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,200
speed of sound I now have many

663
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:54,919
properties including the effective

664
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,600
stiffness of these materials and I did

665
00:22:54,919 --> 00:22:58,799
this again without ever touching these

666
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:00,240
materials so this is a schematic of what

667
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:02,640
this technique looks like so as I

668
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,440
mentioned in a substrate that's just as

669
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:07,159
big as a fingernail we can go ahead and

670
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:09,600
have hundreds of these samples and then

671
00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:11,520
if I put my pump laser on top of these

672
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,559
samples and and stay there anywhere from

673
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:16,440
1 to three minutes and as well with our

674
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:18,559
prob laser we're getting about 10,000

675
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:20,200
measurements over and over again because

676
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:21,760
this is a non-destructive method so

677
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:24,000
we're really increasing the signal to

678
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,559
noise ratio in our experiments and this

679
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,760
technique is what we call the leras

680
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:30,120
technique for laser induced resonant

681
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:33,640
acoustic spectr roscopy so we went ahead

682
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:36,080
and took leras and we demonstrated it on

683
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:38,080
on a variety of metamaterial architected

684
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,720
material architectures but the main

685
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:42,039
point also was that this really is

686
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,880
agnostic of the type of material that

687
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:46,279
you have so we demonstrated that this is

688
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:48,360
also good for testing any material at

689
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:49,240
the microscale including polymers metals

690
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,559
or

691
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:53,159
Ceramics and the signals as you might

692
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:54,799
expect you know this is what you would

693
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:56,440
expect out of something a bell that is

694
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:58,640
vibrating right you start with some

695
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:00,559
oscillations but then they're going to D

696
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,360
out naturally uh because there is some

697
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:04,000
damping in the material and from there

698
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:05,880
we're getting all these properties that

699
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,039
I mentioned we know the speed of sound

700
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:10,039
and we can also get acoustic properties

701
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:12,520
so why am I so excited about this

702
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:15,159
technique well our Dream really is to be

703
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:17,159
able to create these broad library of

704
00:24:15,159 --> 00:24:19,039
architect materials with a variety of

705
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:20,960
different properties including different

706
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:23,760
acoustic impedance different speed of

707
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:26,000
sound and why we want to use them is

708
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:28,000
basically two main applications one is

709
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,880
this ability to perform vibration

710
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,559
control one of the demonstrations that

711
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:34,039
we've shown is that we can use These

712
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:36,720
acoustic materials basically just like a

713
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:39,840
lens in an optical sense we can go ahead

714
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,600
and then Focus ultrasound into one spot

715
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,200
and then as you saw earlier from from

716
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:46,880
the talk from my colleague Professor

717
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:49,360
Shan haa um there's a demand for

718
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,399
materials that are able to couple these

719
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,760
very Advanced probes for ultrasound to

720
00:24:51,399 --> 00:24:55,080
soft materials such as the skin and for

721
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,159
that we need to make sure we have the

722
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:59,559
right acoustic impedance mismatch or or

723
00:24:57,159 --> 00:25:01,200
match between transducers and skin and

724
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:04,640
this is what meta materials architector

725
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:07,279
materials will allow us to

726
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,640
do with that let me shift gears into an

727
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:10,279
even more extreme condition of

728
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,279
deformation Beyond just simple

729
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:14,440
vibrations and there's one aspect that I

730
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:16,960
didn't tell you is that we can also make

731
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:20,039
materials architecture materials that

732
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,360
are made out of carbon so on the left

733
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:23,679
what you're seeing is how we can make

734
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,360
them at the nanoc scale and here's a red

735
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:27,000
blood Sul for scale so these are

736
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,840
extremely extremely high resolution

737
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,240
materials and we can also make them at

738
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:32,000
the macro scale these are two different

739
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,080
fabrication techniques different

740
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,440
applications and today I want to focus

741
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:40,840
on these nanoscale

742
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:43,159
materials so this idea of using lates to

743
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,919
as for protective applications think of

744
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:47,200
of a foreign object of a projectile

745
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:48,840
trying to hit something um is really has

746
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,880
been it's an all idea and we've been

747
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,600
wanting to actually uh uh use these

748
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,520
materials for protective applications

749
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:56,120
the issue is that these really are not

750
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,880
architect materials right you agree with

751
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,919
me that there is no separation of scales

752
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:02,440
here so it's not an architector material

753
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:04,399
it's just a structure nowadays of course

754
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:06,520
there because of advances in Native

755
00:26:04,399 --> 00:26:08,520
manufacturing there's a lot of these uh

756
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:10,840
actual architector materials that have

757
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:13,640
been shown to be very very efficient at

758
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:15,159
Dynamic uh compaction however the

759
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,760
problem that we've are interested in is

760
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:18,600
a little bit different it's that of

761
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:21,200
micrometeoroid impact so if you're

762
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:23,679
familiar with this basically in space

763
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:26,000
there's unwanted debris flying around in

764
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:28,559
some cases it can be just a a Fleck of

765
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,200
paint that is traveling at velocity of

766
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:32,799
up to 10 km/s the issue is that even

767
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,600
though they have very small Mass because

768
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,120
of these high velocities they have so

769
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,679
much kinetic energy they can be very

770
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:40,640
dangerous and damage a lot of very

771
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:43,320
expensive equipment that's up in

772
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:45,080
orbit currently the best solution is

773
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:46,640
something that looks like this this is

774
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:48,559
what we call a Whipple Shield it's

775
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,159
basically a multi-layered material that

776
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:51,799
is designed to basically spread out the

777
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,600
kinetic energy instead of letting these

778
00:26:51,799 --> 00:26:56,760
particles go through all the way so we

779
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,640
wanted to design something that could be

780
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:01,520
more efficient than this so the way we

781
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,720
went about this was again we go to our

782
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,919
uh two phonography technique to be able

783
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:08,159
to fabricate these precursor polymer

784
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:10,440
architectures that then we convert it to

785
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:12,960
carbon basically by do burning them in a

786
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:15,080
controll manner by using pyrolysis we

787
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,480
can burn them in vacuum up to 900

788
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:19,240
Degrees celsus this is the precursor

789
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:21,120
polymer and this is what we get after we

790
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:23,240
pyy it so you can see that we retain the

791
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:25,120
shape and the geometry we started off

792
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:27,000
with unit sellers or building blocks of

793
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,880
about 10 microns and then we end up with

794
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,760
something that's about 2 microns s with

795
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,080
struts or features that are about on the

796
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:36,200
couple hundred nanometer in size and

797
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:38,640
this is again a red blood cell for for

798
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:40,640
scale so what we did next again we want

799
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,320
to test them under extreme impact so

800
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,360
this is where we use a technique that

801
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,960
was invented at MIT called the laser

802
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:50,360
induced particle impact test so what

803
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:52,360
you'll see here is a video of these

804
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:55,760
effectively think of them as as grains

805
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:58,480
of sand basically glass spheres that are

806
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:01,039
about 14 microns in diameter we can

807
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,880
shoot to velocities of about 1 kilometer

808
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:05,240
per second and then using a high-speed

809
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,480
camera we can then image this process

810
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:09,159
this impact process taking place so what

811
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:11,200
you'll see is this projectile coming

812
00:28:09,159 --> 00:28:13,960
from the top and impacting these samples

813
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,640
so I'll go ahead and play the video now

814
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:18,760
so when we're shooting these at about

815
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:20,120
230 m/ second we were seeing this kind

816
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,880
of response where the particles were

817
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:23,880
going in damaging the material and then

818
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:25,960
rebounding this is what we call this

819
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,840
particle rejection regime because then

820
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,840
we can look at the the samples and we're

821
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,080
able to to see the crater that was uh

822
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:34,840
actually carved out uh from from these

823
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:36,480
impact events if we were tested we

824
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:38,120
started testing these materials upon

825
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,799
higher velocities and this is about

826
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:42,039
approaching twice the speed of

827
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:44,519
sound we started seeing a very different

828
00:28:42,039 --> 00:28:47,159
response in particular we saw that these

829
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:48,880
projectiles came in damaged the material

830
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:51,480
clearly but then we never saw the

831
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:53,399
particle come out and upon inspection

832
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,240
afterwards we saw that we were entering

833
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:57,000
this capture dominated regime so these

834
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:59,080
materials were now really being really

835
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,559
efficient at not only dissipating the

836
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:02,240
full energy of this impact and

837
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:04,080
protecting what was under but really

838
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,279
just also capturing these projectiles

839
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,640
that were trying to damage it so this

840
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:09,000
was very interesting and we had a lot of

841
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,960
fun doing these experiments but this

842
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,200
really begs for a comparison to to

843
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,080
materials that we're more familiar with

844
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,760
so the way we'd go about this is by

845
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,559
calculating how much energy gets

846
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:20,600
dissipated by looking at comparing the

847
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:22,760
kinetic energy of the projectile and we

848
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:25,240
normalize it by the amount of mass that

849
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:26,679
went into dissipating that energy and

850
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:28,600
then we can come up with these metrics

851
00:29:26,679 --> 00:29:30,519
for other materials which we find in

852
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:33,519
literature such as stainless steel

853
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:35,000
aluminum or polymers like pmma and what

854
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:37,240
you see is that they all lie on this

855
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,720
trend line basically meaning that all

856
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:40,240
the energy from these projectiles is

857
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,919
basically going into deforming the

858
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,640
material that the projectiles see right

859
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:46,519
under them so the opposite would be when

860
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,080
we have more interesting materials such

861
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:52,440
as Kevlar which is one of the the

862
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:55,440
standards for impact mitigation uh which

863
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:57,279
is now adds a new an added complexity to

864
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,640
the material meaning that it allows you

865
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:01,399
to delocalize

866
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:03,360
the damage of of these impacts and you

867
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:04,720
start seeing that for the same amount of

868
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,960
mass they're actually much more

869
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:09,480
efficient than these monolithic solid

870
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,960
materials and this is not only to for

871
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:14,960
Kevlar other nanoscale materials such as

872
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:17,399
graphine can also do this and also

873
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,279
nanoscale polystyrene films can do this

874
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:21,120
so where do our materials land on this

875
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:24,080
plot well I'm happy to say that they

876
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:26,039
were also able to show that there is a a

877
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:28,120
significant improvement over monolithic

878
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:29,720
materials in this case because there's a

879
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:32,559
lot of energy that can get dissipated

880
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:35,080
from compacting uh these very intricate

881
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:38,000
architectures plus the nanoscale size

882
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:39,679
effects uh that we have in our samples

883
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,440
with that I have a couple of minutes

884
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:43,919
I'll try to describe this resilience

885
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:47,399
aspect uh very

886
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:49,039
quickly so I wanted to make sure that we

887
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:51,559
didn't forget about materials that have

888
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:52,880
to be soft and extensible and this is

889
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:54,559
something that this community of

890
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,120
architector materials has forgotten for

891
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:58,200
over a decade they've been in this

892
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:59,799
search for a very stiff very strong

893
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:02,679
materials not something that is

894
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:05,080
compliant and extensible and we went

895
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:06,760
basically on this search and we didn't

896
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:08,480
need to look too far we just looked at

897
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:10,440
textile materials or woven like

898
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,039
architectures where the building block

899
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:14,760
really is just a fiber that is

900
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:16,720
intricately coiled or curved and we took

901
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:19,159
this as our building block to to build

902
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,600
now periodic architectures in three

903
00:31:19,159 --> 00:31:22,039
dimensions that then we could

904
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:24,200
potentially print and get some

905
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:26,200
interesting properties so this is what

906
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,360
an effective strut looked like it's

907
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:31,120
basically three heles that that are

908
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:33,440
interwoven along these struts but what's

909
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:35,000
most important is that the nodes these

910
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,320
Junctions are actually just an

911
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,399
entanglement of these fibers which meant

912
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:41,200
that these materials were actually very

913
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:42,519
very deformable even though the polymer

914
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,399
this polymer that I'm showing you here

915
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:46,440
is actually quite brittle because we

916
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:48,799
architected it in this way now the

917
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:51,639
effective material is very deformable

918
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:52,960
and it doesn't break uh very easily this

919
00:31:51,639 --> 00:31:55,000
is just one of the designs that we

920
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:57,360
worked with now we've in the process of

921
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,720
of publishing very soon this uh

922
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:02,440
computation design framework where

923
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:04,200
basically we Define a lattice we Define

924
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:06,159
where we want this node of entanglement

925
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:08,039
to happen and then we Define the

926
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:11,080
features that Define each of these

927
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:13,240
struts these helices which allows us to

928
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:15,480
now design arbitrary unit

929
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:17,679
cells not only that we can Define

930
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:20,120
different topologies and we can build

931
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:22,639
broader large volumes of these materials

932
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:24,960
uh using this designed

933
00:32:22,639 --> 00:32:26,919
framework as you can see this is just

934
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,440
one of the examples that why do we care

935
00:32:26,919 --> 00:32:30,279
about designing different architectures

936
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:32,200
well we can embed information in

937
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:34,880
something that looks like a very intri

938
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,159
intricately designed fibric material so

939
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,039
I hope you can see there's going to be a

940
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:40,760
message embedded in

941
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:43,480
here and I think it's becoming

942
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:45,159
clear there you go this is just one of

943
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:47,480
these examples that we can embed uh

944
00:32:45,159 --> 00:32:49,320
information in these materials the other

945
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:52,039
aspect really we've we've been inspired

946
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:53,600
by other materials uh such as hydrogels

947
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:55,120
which in some cases you can find these

948
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,600
double Network hydrogels at the

949
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:59,480
molecular scale they have two polymer

950
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,799
net networks one that's stiff one that's

951
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:04,279
very compliant uh that leads to these

952
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:07,159
hydrogels being as as Professor Shon hij

953
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:09,639
was showing very hard to tear uh and at

954
00:33:07,159 --> 00:33:11,240
the same time in some cases quite stiff

955
00:33:09,639 --> 00:33:13,080
so we went ahead and designed an

956
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:15,120
analogous material system in an

957
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:17,799
architected sense so we basically have

958
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:20,080
these materials be uh have a monolithic

959
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:21,360
lattice serving as the rigid framework

960
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,279
and then we have the woven lattice

961
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:25,399
serving as the compliant

962
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:27,320
framework and we fabricated these with

963
00:33:25,399 --> 00:33:29,240
two Photon lithography and to our

964
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:31,279
surpris actually works surprisingly well

965
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:33,360
we can make both networks and they don't

966
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:35,320
actually fuse together even at these

967
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:39,840
small scales and we test them under

968
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:41,440
tension by printing a a tensile gripper

969
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,159
on top of the samples and then going in

970
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,360
with our nanoindentor and going ahead

971
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:46,679
and doing the experiment so this is an

972
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:49,360
example of these experiments what you're

973
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:51,240
seeing here is just a monolithic Network

974
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,919
just a woven Network and then this

975
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:55,120
double Network the remarkable thing is

976
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:57,399
that this double network is

977
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:59,880
significantly stiffer than the other two

978
00:33:57,399 --> 00:34:02,320
but because it has the the woven

979
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:05,120
component as well it's quite extensible

980
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:07,840
and it doesn't fail immediately uh fully

981
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:09,359
uh when you do this this type of tension

982
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,839
just as an example again this is the

983
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:14,000
extreme case of the most extensible

984
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:15,159
material that we've made extremely hard

985
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,800
to

986
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:20,000
break and it dissipates a lot of energy

987
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:21,919
in the process of trying to do this so

988
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,960
we're in the process of characterizing

989
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:26,200
basically to answer the question how

990
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:27,960
hard would it be to tear these materials

991
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:29,720
this is basically a fracture mechanic

992
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:31,800
question so we're doing these types of

993
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:34,119
experiments where we have a notch so

994
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:35,480
basically a notch that we intentionally

995
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:37,480
create on these materials and then we're

996
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:39,639
going to pull on them and see how this

997
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:41,800
fracture starts propagating throughout

998
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:44,040
as you can see the monolithic network

999
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:47,040
not surprising it just fails and just

1000
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:48,679
goes away whereas the woven network is

1001
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:50,960
actually able to have a lot of uh

1002
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:52,679
toughening mechanisms uh making it

1003
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,679
extremely hard for us to actually be

1004
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:56,879
able to tear these

1005
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:59,040
materials okay this leads to the end of

1006
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:00,720
the story but I hope I was able to

1007
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,720
convince you that architecture materials

1008
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,480
have a a huge potential especially if we

1009
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,560
start designing them at the at the

1010
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,320
nanometer scale but ultimately we need

1011
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:10,680
to apply them by being able to fabricate

1012
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,680
them at the centimeter scale and we need

1013
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:15,480
to do this in a close loop fashion as

1014
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:17,320
you saw in my group we do computation we

1015
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:19,160
do the fabrication but we also need to

1016
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:20,800
do the testing and and and work

1017
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:22,920
harmoniously so that make to make sure

1018
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,000
that we're not uh just focusing on one

1019
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,839
of these features what I described

1020
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,400
really is just examples of the four

1021
00:35:26,839 --> 00:35:30,280
directions that were working on in my

1022
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,359
lab one of them is of course scalability

1023
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:34,000
of these materials U working on the

1024
00:35:32,359 --> 00:35:36,200
multifunctionality and I describ the

1025
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,480
acoustic properties as one of these um

1026
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:40,760
looking at the extreme impact mitigation

1027
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,640
properties and then ultimately how can

1028
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:45,280
we make these materials also be quite

1029
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:46,359
compliant and extensible and not fail uh

1030
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:50,040
in a brittle

1031
00:35:46,359 --> 00:35:51,560
manner so the takeaway message hopefully

1032
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:54,400
architected

1033
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:55,839
materials land into a spot where no

1034
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,480
other materials

1035
00:35:55,839 --> 00:36:00,680
can also we need need to leverage these

1036
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,880
nanoscale features and hopefully next

1037
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:04,440
time I see you I can share a sample a

1038
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,480
nanoscale sample that you can hold in

1039
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:08,920
our hands and also that we need to

1040
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:11,119
understand these materials under real

1041
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:13,079
world conditions it doesn't suffice for

1042
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:14,440
us to just do slow deformation because

1043
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:16,319
these materials eventually will be

1044
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:18,280
dropped so we need to make sure that we

1045
00:36:16,319 --> 00:36:19,720
can full fully understand how they

1046
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:22,640
respond across

1047
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:24,319
scales with that I want to thank uh the

1048
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,040
group The postto the students that are

1049
00:36:24,319 --> 00:36:27,760
the ones who are doing the hard work and

1050
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:29,760
the funding agencies that have made this

1051
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,319
possible and I'll leave you with this QR

1052
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,599
code which is actually an augmented

1053
00:36:31,319 --> 00:36:35,079
reality model of these materials which

1054
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:37,440
you can play with you can actually drop

1055
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:40,760
it in front of you and your phone uh and

1056
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:42,599
play with it and then hopefully I'll

1057
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:47,280
show you what I think is the world

1058
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:50,280
record for the smallest MIT Dome ever

1059
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,560
made there we go with that thank you

1060
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:54,040
very much for your attention I'm happy

1061
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:57,250
to answer any questions

1062
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:57,250
[Applause]

1063
00:36:59,319 --> 00:37:03,880
okay first

1064
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:06,640
question at the nanoscale a conventional

1065
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:08,720
FM framework works okay to predict the

1066
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:11,079
mechanical behavior of the structure

1067
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:14,839
great question

1068
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:16,359
um yes and no in a sense yes so okay

1069
00:37:14,839 --> 00:37:19,200
what what is what is happening at the at

1070
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:22,040
the nanoc scale when we have a ceramic

1071
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:25,319
shell that is extremely thin that means

1072
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:27,920
that there's so few atoms that we have

1073
00:37:25,319 --> 00:37:31,040
also a very small probability of having

1074
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:34,119
defects inside of this shell what that

1075
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:38,160
means is that this ceramic shell can

1076
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:40,040
reach theoretical strengths of ceramics

1077
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:42,240
that is impossible to find in a in a

1078
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:44,319
bulk ceramic because a bulk ceramic is

1079
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:46,440
going to have a lot of defects and how

1080
00:37:44,319 --> 00:37:49,359
many defects you have will determine how

1081
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:52,680
strong the ceramic is so the way that we

1082
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:54,680
use FM to model nanoscale uh Frameworks

1083
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:56,800
is by being able to correct properties

1084
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:58,839
such as the effective yield strength by

1085
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,720
increasing that to the actual properties

1086
00:37:58,839 --> 00:38:04,560
of an experiment at that scale um

1087
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:06,280
there's ways of modeling you know every

1088
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,839
single atom using methods such as

1089
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:10,400
molecular Dynamics um that would be the

1090
00:38:08,839 --> 00:38:11,839
the the more rigorous way if you really

1091
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,599
want to understand everything that goes

1092
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:15,960
on in these very thin shells the issue

1093
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:17,440
is that we're Limited in volume as to

1094
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:19,920
how much you can model so there's no way

1095
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:22,800
that we could fit a full lattice inside

1096
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:25,319
of those computational Frameworks so so

1097
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,839
the short answer is yes it works um as

1098
00:38:25,319 --> 00:38:29,200
long as we understand the the the

1099
00:38:26,839 --> 00:38:31,480
constitutive properties of the material

1100
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,480
that we're

1101
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:37,440
modeling second question is how do we

1102
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:39,040
predict the cost competitiveness of

1103
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,440
architected materials for industrial

1104
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:43,480
applications compared to traditional

1105
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:46,839
Composite Materials that's a great

1106
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:49,000
question so it depends on which of the

1107
00:38:46,839 --> 00:38:50,800
material systems we're talking about um

1108
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,160
I'll give you the best example I have in

1109
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,280
terms of the cost aspect which is that

1110
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:57,680
of the self assembled architector

1111
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:02,599
materials there I believe you know we're

1112
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:05,319
talking about cents per gram of cost or

1113
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:08,319
or I guess let's talk about volume cents

1114
00:39:05,319 --> 00:39:10,760
per cubic uh centimeter of these

1115
00:39:08,319 --> 00:39:13,119
materials um so they're very cheap to

1116
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:16,440
make U compared to ones that we need to

1117
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:19,599
3D print um so in that realm it's it's

1118
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:21,960
it's very easy I will say 3D printing so

1119
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:25,079
if we talk about nanoscale 3D printing

1120
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:27,880
those at the moment uh really come with

1121
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:29,240
a with a hefty uh uh price tag

1122
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,880
uh it doesn't mean that it's not

1123
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:34,800
applicable it just depends on what

1124
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:37,560
application can can go ahead and and and

1125
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:39,079
and justify that cost for the the

1126
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:41,319
applications or the the properties that

1127
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:43,240
you're getting however I'll give an

1128
00:39:41,319 --> 00:39:46,240
example um in terms of 30 printing being

1129
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:47,680
an industrial uh step in in in a

1130
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,119
manufacturing process for instance I

1131
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,400
don't know if you're familiar with these

1132
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:53,560
Adidas shoes actually should buy a pair

1133
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:56,319
so I can show it at presentations um

1134
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:58,760
that are made up of a midsole that is a

1135
00:39:56,319 --> 00:40:01,400
lattice architecture so these are solely

1136
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:03,240
3D printed and you know you can buy

1137
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,160
these I think they're on the order of

1138
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:07,160
maybe

1139
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:10,119
$130 uh so so to the point that it is

1140
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:13,680
competitive um of course with an added

1141
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:15,079
maybe performance metric so short answer

1142
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:17,480
is depending on the architect

1143
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:19,200
architector material the cost will vary

1144
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:22,680
but I think there are some applications

1145
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:25,920
that that really could use uh some 3D

1146
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:29,440
printing at a reasonable

1147
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:32,280
cost the next question

1148
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:34,839
is so is this

1149
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:38,480
carbon is it 100% carbon or does it

1150
00:40:34,839 --> 00:40:41,599
contain poers uh great question so

1151
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:43,680
depends on how much we burn it um the

1152
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:46,760
ones that we've that I showed and tested

1153
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:48,640
are 100% carbon um because this thermal

1154
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:50,359
process that we go through you know it

1155
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,200
goes up to temperatures where any other

1156
00:40:50,359 --> 00:40:55,560
Organics or volatile components are

1157
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:58,400
going to to to leave the sample um the

1158
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:59,960
caveat is that the carbon

1159
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,160
I guess it's not part of the question

1160
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:04,400
but is it a good carbon or is it B bad

1161
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:06,359
carbon and what I mean by that um it's

1162
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,920
it's really not graphitic carbon like

1163
00:41:06,359 --> 00:41:11,520
what you see in in a fiber uh for a

1164
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:13,760
composite um this would require much

1165
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:16,160
higher temperatures for processing and

1166
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:18,880
maybe different polymers to start with

1167
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:22,319
um but it is 100% carbon but it's a dis

1168
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,319
disordered micr structure of

1169
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:30,960
carbon okay are there any studies that

1170
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:32,720
aim for good physical properties by

1171
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:35,680
optimizing both the molecular level

1172
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:38,599
structure and the macro level

1173
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:40,920
structure yes and and that's actually

1174
00:41:38,599 --> 00:41:44,520
the current point of where architector

1175
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:46,599
materials Community is now we first

1176
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:48,359
started by saying I'm just going to take

1177
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:50,680
you know any polymer and go ahead and

1178
00:41:48,359 --> 00:41:52,280
print the 3D structure but now we're at

1179
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:54,760
the point that we could potentially make

1180
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:56,480
more interesting resins that at the

1181
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:57,839
molecular level give us very different

1182
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,599
mechanical property

1183
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:01,839
and then if we combine that with the

1184
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:05,359
right morphological design at the 3D

1185
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:08,560
level gives us improved mechanical

1186
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:10,359
property so so the answer is yes we're

1187
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,200
this is really kind of the ongoing

1188
00:42:10,359 --> 00:42:13,640
research in our community not not just

1189
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:15,079
looking at the architecture but also

1190
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:17,880
looking at how are we designing the

1191
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:21,240
material that we're printing

1192
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:25,560
with okay thank you

1193
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:25,560
[Applause]
