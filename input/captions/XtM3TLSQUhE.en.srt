someday soon when these drivers plug in

their cars will also have the capacity

63
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:31,000
be increased demand for energy the

64
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,680
challenge is is ensuring both that

00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,840
there's enough electricity to charge the

66
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,640
vehicles and that this electricity is

67
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,360
coming from renewable sources says

68
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,720
genser but solar and wind energy is

69
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,920
intermittent without adequate backup for

70
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,959
these sources such as stationary energy

71
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,200
storage facilities using lithium ion

72
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:51,120
batteries for instance or large scale

73
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,360
natural gas or hydrogen fueled power

74
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,200
plants achieving clean energy goals will

75
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,920
prove elusive more vexing cost for

00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,280

79
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,280
play a critical and welcome role the

80
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:09,040

83
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,680
for instance the team found that

84
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:18,200

85
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:22,400
Region's 8 million light duty passenger

86
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:25,599
EVS displaced 14.7 GW of stationary

87
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:28,319

their paper also described the role EV

00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:38,040

electricity back into the system to

95
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:46,439
cover these episodes so we don't need to

157
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,120

the clock but if we have blackout

190
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:22,840
scenarios like in Texas last year or hot

191
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,680
day congestion on transmission lines

192
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:27,599
maybe we can turn on these vehicles for

193
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:29,840
24 to 48 hours sending energy back to

194
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,639
the system adds Owens if if there's a

195
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,520
power outage and people wave a bunch of

196
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:36,240
money at you you might be willing to

197
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,800
talk basically I think this comes back

198
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,479
to all of us being in this together

199
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,240
right says genser as you contribute to

200
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,479
society by giving this service to the

201
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,000
grid you will get the full benefit of

202
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:49,120
reducing system costs and also help to

203
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,680
decarbonize the system faster and to a

204
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,319
greater

205
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:55,720
extent actionable

206
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:58,560
insights Owens who is building his

207
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:00,400
dissertation on v2g Research is now

208
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,159
investigating the potential impact of

209
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,960
heavyduty electric vehicles and

210
00:08:02,159 --> 00:08:06,800
decarbonizing the power system the less

211
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,800
mile delivery trucks of companies like

212
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,879
Amazon and FedEx are likely to be the

213
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,000
earliest adopters of EVS Owen says they

214
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:14,479
are appealing because they have

215
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,960
regularly scheduled routes during the

216
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,520
day and go back to the depot at night

217
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,240
which makes them very useful for

218
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:22,879
providing electricity and balancing

219
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,639
services in the power system Owens is

220
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,120
committed to providing insights that are

221
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,960
actionable by System planners operators

222
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,400
and to a certain extent investors he

223
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,919
says his work might come into play in

224
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,560
determining what kind of charging

225
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:37,599
infrastructure should be built and where

226
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:39,640
our analysis is really timely because

227
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:42,000
the EV Market has not yet been developed

228
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:43,880
says genser this means we can share our

229
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,560
insights with vehicle manufacturers and

230
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:49,399
system operators potentially influencing

231
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,200
them to invest in v2g Technologies

232
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:53,200
avoiding the costs of building utility

233
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,000
scale storage and enabling the

234
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,000
transition to a cleaner future it's a

235
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,200
huge win within our

236
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,200
grasp the research search for the study

237
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:05,640
was funded by mighty's Future Energy

238
