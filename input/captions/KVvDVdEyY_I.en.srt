1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,759
So we're going to go to our next speaker

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:09,519
Dr. Takuya Kitagawa and he is the

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:11,679
president of Cuera computing. Kiara

4
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:15,040
computing is work on the neutral atom

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:17,440
based quantum computer and so it's all

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,000
yours Takuya.

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,520
>> Thank you Hong. Um thank you for

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,199
inviting me to this seminar. You know

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,920
that was a fantastic lecture by

10
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,480
professor Oliver. Um so I want I'd like

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,119
to actually introduce you uh to Quera

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,120
and also explain already press Oliver

13
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,440
cover many grounds but you know I want

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,680
to explain why this is a very special

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,079
moment for uh quantum computing

16
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,239
industry. So my name is Takuya. I'm the

17
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,960
president of Quer computing. It's called

18
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:48,239
Quer because it's a quantum era. So you

19
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,640
know it's pronounced as as Quer. Okay.

20
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,399
Okay. Uh so Quira uh develops quantum

21
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,079
computers based on neutral atoms and

22
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,640
professor Oliver already gave a very

23
00:00:54,079 --> 00:01:00,000
nice introduction to this modality. Uh

24
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,879
it was founded in 2018 uh by uh

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,280
professor from MIT Blitic and Harvard

26
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,040
University Mish Lukin Max Grer and also

27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,439
you know Dur England was involved in a

28
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,280
founding of this company. Uh we already

29
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,600
have a a very good commercial

30
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,479
attractions uh including more than $40

31
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,520
million of bookings and and we raised

32
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:21,200
$230 million uh beginning of this year

33
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,240
uh from strategic partners such as

34
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,920
Google, Nvidia and Saltbank Vision Fund.

35
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,040
We have our first generation quantum

36
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,600
computer on the cloud from 2022 November

37
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,280
uh on AWS and we have delivered the

38
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,320
second generation quantum computer in

39
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,079
2025 to Japan. So just this is just to

40
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,640
say you know uh the quantum computers

41
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:43,040
already real and people can access those

42
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,280
quantum computers from quer uh on the

43
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,280
cloud.

44
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,840
So just you know a quick glance at you

45
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,360
know uh uh the you know form factors of

46
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,280
our quantum computer on the left you

47
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,600
know uh the picture you're looking at is

48
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,880
the machine we deliver to Japan ICE this

49
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:01,680
is national laboratory in Japan uh uh in

50
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,240
2025 March and on the right you see you

51
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,640
know ex you know uh uh you know tweet uh

52
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,759
message from u previous prime minister

53
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,720
Ishiba Japanese prime minister and uh

54
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:15,680
you know uh he got to see uh you know uh

55
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,560
our site and this really shows you know

56
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,280
um the interest uh into quantum computer

57
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,760
is across the world uh from you know uh

58
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,080
uh top government uh you know policians

59
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,239
and and and bureaucrats uh around the

60
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,319
world. So this is very exciting uh

61
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,560
period.

62
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,840
Now before I go into explaining you know

63
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,319
uh you know what kind of breakthrough

64
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,680
quer has been making uh I just wanted to

65
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,599
you know show you what our quantum

66
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,120
computer looks like. On the left is a

67
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,280
core part of our quantum computer.

68
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,280
Inside of this brown coil is the glass

69
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,720
cell you can see and we make this you

70
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:51,599
know inside glass cell vacuum and we we

71
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,560
put rubidium atom inside of it and we

72
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:56,720
use we we laser cool and trap them and

73
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,280
manipulate them using lasers. Each

74
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,519
rubidium atom corresponds to cubit the

75
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,879
memory of quantum computers and on your

76
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,640
right you know the movie you're looking

77
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,640
at is exactly how we actually do a

78
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,760
quantum computations. So each dot

79
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,760
corresponds to a cubit and then we

80
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,360
actually do a manipulation and when they

81
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,959
are getting close to each other we

82
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,720
actually pulsing another you know set of

83
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,680
lasers to do you know quantum

84
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:22,159
computations.

85
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,560
Now I already press Oliver you know

86
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,480
touch on this um you you know you've

87
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,840
heard you know many big companies like

88
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,360
Google, IBM, Microsoft uh as uh have

89
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,920
been investing a lot of money into

90
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,680
quantum computers in the last 15 years

91
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,519
but yet you know uh uh one of the

92
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,000
fundamental issues you see with quantum

93
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,680
computer is error rate you know uh

94
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,599
there's tremendous you know promise of

95
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,840
quantum computer for example once it's

96
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,440
scaled maybe you can replace you know

97
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,280
some of the experimental science with

98
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,879
computational science and you can accept

99
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,400
accelerate the scientific discovery by

100
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,239
you know 10,000 times because you can

101
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,480
reproduce some of those you know quantum

102
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,360
mechanical experiments in the computer

103
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,120
rather than in the lab. Um but however

104
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,040
currently you know uh the best of the

105
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,360
best quantum computer can execute maybe

106
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,840
1,000 steps because you know uh uh the

107
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,200
error rate of each step was about 0.1%.

108
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,519
So if you take a inverse of it it's

109
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,080
around 1,000 maybe you can stretch it to

110
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,079
10,000 but that's that's pretty much it.

111
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,680
But however you know to get to this UTD

112
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,519
scale quantum computer that can really

113
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:23,040
you know do this you know tremendous

114
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,720
work in experimental science um you need

115
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,360
trillions of computations which is 10 to

116
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,840
12. So because of this nine order

117
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,479
magnitude difference people thought you

118
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,880
it would take uh about 50 years to get

119
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,960
to that point. However, you know, here

120
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,720
at MIT, you know, uh uh you know,

121
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,040
precious shore came up with this

122
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,280
fantastic idea of quant correction 30

123
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,360
years ago. And you know, this contra

124
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,360
correction can potentially exponentially

125
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,280
lower the error rate. And the

126
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,280
breakthrough that happened in 2023 was

127
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,759
you know a few companies including the

128
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,000
group of you know MIT and Harvard uh

129
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,080
together with Quera have realized you

130
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,840
know uh you know this quant correction

131
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,400
in experiments. you know theoretical

132
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,479
proposal was done by pressure shore 30

133
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,120
years ago by experiments was you know

134
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,560
for the first time done in 2023 and

135
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,840
other companies who have realized

136
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,639
economical correction was you know

137
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,160
Google and continum so uh the movie

138
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,560
you're looking at on on the right is

139
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,199
exactly uh this experiment uh by by

140
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,160
Harvard University and MIT uh of doing

141
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,840
this you know content correction now by

142
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,320
watching this movie you actually notice

143
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,639
a few you know distinct advantage of our

144
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,560
you know neutral atom system one is you

145
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,160
see a lot of parallel operations you

146
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,520
know you you see you know a lot of atoms

147
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,000
moving together and actually doing

148
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,600
operation together. Uh second is you

149
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,560
know you see a lot of you know empty

150
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,960
space uh in the movie and you think okay

151
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,720
maybe you can pack more cubits into this

152
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,280
space and you can increase the number of

153
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,800
cubits and also as Oliver said you know

154
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,800
in order to actually do a quant

155
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,440
correction you need to pack a multiple

156
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,600
cubits into you know one pocket called

157
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,080
logical cubit. So you actually need a

158
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,639
lot more number of cubits to realize you

159
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,039
know a compar correction and as as it

160
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,280
turns out you know you know this new

161
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,680
trans system does have advantage in

162
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,360
increasing the number of cubits and you

163
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,560
know this experiment was done already

164
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,880
within this year uh uh and they you know

165
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,960
MIT and Harvard successfully implemented

166
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,680
you know more than 3,000 cubits more

167
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,759
than two hours so this is you know you

168
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,440
know a large number of you know cubits

169
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,880
that you know no other you know modality

170
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,639
have ever realized.

171
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,000
And you know uh we we think you know

172
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,240
because of this you know neutral atom

173
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,520
system uh have you know tremendous

174
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:38,080
advantage for going into logical QBT era

175
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:40,400
as opposed to you know physical QT era.

176
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,080
Now I also wanted to talk about you know

177
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,720
one another innovation that you know

178
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,960
quer is really pushing for uh which is

179
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,039
you know uh combination of AI and

180
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,080
quantum. So there are two direction you

181
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,000
know that that could be very

182
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,800
interesting. One is AI for quantum, the

183
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,960
other one is quantum for AI. AI for

184
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:00,720
quantum is an approach to integrate AI

185
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,880
into the architecture of quantum

186
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,960
computer such that you can enhance a

187
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,039
quantum computations by a large amount

188
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,039
and and this is the place for example we

189
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,199
are collaborating with Nvidia. You know

190
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,560
one idea for example is when you

191
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,960
actually you know doing quantum error

192
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,800
correction you detect errors uh in the

193
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,199
system and then you need to translate

194
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,120
that you know error signal into error

195
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,919
you know error correction operations

196
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,360
that translation is called decoding and

197
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,120
you know it actually takes a lot of you

198
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,919
know classical computation power to

199
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,840
figure that out and you know if you do

200
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,919
this you know decoding really well as it

201
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,000
turns out you can enhance uh the quantum

202
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,000
computation by a large amount and we've

203
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,680
already demonstrated that using AI you

204
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,599
can actually do a decoding uh much

205
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,840
better and then you can enhance the you

206
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:46,720
know computitional uh uh power of

207
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,960
quantum computer by 10 to 100 times.

208
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,280
Another direction is quantum AI. You

209
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,039
know, uh uh you've heard many examples

210
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,720
of AI for science already, you know,

211
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,520
including alpha fold and other

212
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,759
approaches of using AI to to accelerate

213
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,319
the discovery of science. Now, when this

214
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,560
science touches quantum science such as

215
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:08,240
material discovery or you know uh you

216
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:11,680
know catalysis, then you actually need

217
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:14,800
some simulator that can produce high

218
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,800
quality data to train AI. Now there's

219
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,199
nothing else uh better than quantum

220
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,960
computer that can simulate uh quantum

221
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,560
mechanics of the world and therefore

222
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,039
quantum computer can be used to provide

223
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,840
a high quality data to train AI and this

224
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,919
combination of AI and quantum I believe

225
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,759
will accelerate you know uh the use

226
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,440
cases of quantum computers by a couple

227
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:37,680
years. So these are very exciting

228
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:39,680
directions. Okay. Um so you know this

229
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,519
world is really exciting right now and

230
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,680
uh you know we always welcome very
