1
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:12,160
I'm excited to talk about this project

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:15,240
today um so as was mentioned in the

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:18,039
introduction our lab you know we have so

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,840
one thing we we sort of the name of the

5
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:23,199
lab we say is the Alo bio lab which

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,199
comes from this algorithmic lens on

7
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,760
biology business and we've done a lot of

8
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:31,279
work um in the past that has been

9
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:33,320
related to more more directly related to

10
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,520
this business of using an algorithmic

11
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:38,200
lens on biology and what we mean by that

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,879
is sort of taking lessons from the

13
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,160
limits of algorithms in particular the

14
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,800
application of certain types of

15
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,640
algorithms to the study of very

16
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,480
organized but high-dimensional systems

17
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,520
uh to rethink sort of the limits of

18
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,120
biological experimentation and and

19
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,879
experimental design and in particular

20
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,559
that's that's manifested in a number of

21
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,879
different ways but especially in this

22
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:01,559
line of work that is on these compressed

23
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:03,399
experiments um so I think when or

24
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:05,240
originally invited me he thought I might

25
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:07,520
talk about compressed perturb seek for

26
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:09,320
example and I'm not talking about

27
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,400
compressed perturb seek and there's a

28
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,439
reason I'm not talking about compressed

29
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,799
perturb seek okay so one is that I've

30
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:15,119
talked about it for eight years that's

31
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,360
actually probably the main internal

32
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,840
reason but that's a selfish reason and

33
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,520
my my style of talking is as soon as we

34
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,799
have something interesting to say I like

35
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,439
to go talk about it so that's thing

36
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,759
number one um to note about this talk is

37
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,200
this is all unpublished relatively early

38
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:33,159
stage work so we're very excited to to

39
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:35,720
hear your feedback on it um you know

40
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:38,799
which may include the usual simultaneous

41
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,920
feedback of this is wrong and this is

42
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,000
Trivial and already known so I would

43
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,280
love to hear um any of those comments

44
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,360
that you have but no seriously we do

45
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,479
want to hear your feedback and we're

46
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,119
excited to talk about it um but a little

47
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:52,159
bit more on the motivation for this work

48
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:54,079
so our previous line of stuff on um

49
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,200
these compressed experiments what those

50
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,680
really have been about and it's okay if

51
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,680
you're not familiar with the work I I'll

52
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,000
give you the gist um the idea is that

53
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,600
you know when we're doing sort of high

54
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,920
throughput and high content biological

55
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,640
experiments um oftentimes they cost a

56
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,640
lot of money but it turns out to be very

57
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,360
sort of um useful to get lots of Rich

58
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,000
data from lots of different types of

59
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,560
pertubations or many different

60
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,519
conditions or many different samples or

61
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,200
whatever and that's manifest in 10,000

62
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:25,800
papers a year now with ever bigger

63
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,519
scales of data and ever bigger

64
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,120
models so these are expensive but yet it

65
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:32,800
seems good to have lots of data there's

66
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,560
a line of statistical work a bunch of

67
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,720
different sort of threads going in

68
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,480
parallel but most famously um a line of

69
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,879
work in statistics and the development

70
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,920
of algorithms on something called

71
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,599
compressed sensing which has interesting

72
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:47,400
things to say about studying

73
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:48,920
high-dimensional signals um with small

74
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,319
amounts of data when you have prior

75
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:53,599
knowledge that the high dimensional

76
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:56,280
signal is very very structured okay and

77
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,959
in particular the the the idea is if

78
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,840
there's certain types of statistical

79
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:02,560
structure like sparcity or low rank

80
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,680
frankness or so some covariant structure

81
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,440
in your high-dimensional data then you

82
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,200
can collect what seems to be a

83
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:11,360
fantastically too small amount of data

84
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,599
and then use algorithms that can exploit

85
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,440
that statistical structure to recover a

86
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,360
much larger number of parameters than

87
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,959
you have any business recovering from

88
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,879
having only done this much work okay so

89
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:24,560
like I said we've explored that general

90
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:25,760
idea in half a dozen or so papers most

91
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,319
recently with this thing called

92
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,640
compressed perturb seek which again I'm

93
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:31,000
not talking about even though I actually

94
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,040
am talking about it right now okay but

95
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,519
the the point there is that our lab is

96
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,959
generally interested in in basic forms

97
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,640
of biological organization really trying

98
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:43,080
to understand the nature of organization

99
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,879
and if such things exist fundamental

100
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:48,040
units of organization at the level of

101
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:49,360
single cells and tissues so we want to

102
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,720
know what these things are many other

103
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,840
people are interested in similar

104
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,799
questions that line of work on

105
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:58,360
compressed experiment says we don't

106
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:00,159
really know what the underlying things

107
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:03,560
are I don't know what the under lying

108
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:06,599
biophysical mechanisms are but the last

109
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:09,480
20 or 30 or 300 years of doing biology

110
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:12,200
has taught us something exists okay

111
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:14,879
there is organization it's not all

112
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:17,359
20,000 genes operating independent of

113
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:20,479
each other or all the proteins or all

114
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,919
the uh metabolic fluxes or what have you

115
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:24,000
but there seems to be quite a lot of

116
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:25,840
organization we may not have pinned down

117
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,160
the exact biophysical mechanisms but

118
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,479
what I do know is that from the last

119
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,800
years maybe 10 to 20 years especially

120
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:35,520
where we collect a lot of data what we

121
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,680
always see are statistical patterns that

122
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,360
manifest from whatever those underlying

123
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,880
units of biological organization are

124
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,840
like if you collect a big Matrix of gene

125
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,720
expression data there's always a lot of

126
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,639
correlation patterns usually there's

127
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,639
some low rank decomposition that

128
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,880
captures most of the variance in the

129
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:56,160
data and so on so somehow there's

130
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:59,400
underlying biophysical mechanisms that

131
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:02,039
organize this high-dimensional system

132
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:04,240
that manifest in statistical parameters

133
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:06,199
and this line of compressed work says

134
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,840
aha there are these statistical

135
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:09,759
properties in our data we know how to

136
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,759
exploit that to collect almost

137
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,479
exponentially less data um in the lab

138
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:17,320
but still recover a large amount of

139
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:19,720
information so that's the background is

140
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:22,039
that we're generally interested in basic

141
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:24,840
units or the nature of organization at

142
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:26,560
the level of single cells and tissues

143
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,840
and we've done a lot of work that says

144
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,440
it exists here's an interesting thing to

145
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:33,919
note about your experiments that we have

146
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,759
a very strong statistical formalism of

147
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,199
how we can exploit that to spend fewer

148
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:41,520
dollars and fewer labor hours and

149
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:43,960
whatnot in the lab okay this project is

150
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,479
now getting back to the main question

151
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,840
what are the things what are the actual

152
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,520
units of

153
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,880
organization

154
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,800
and it's a problem that as I said many

155
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,720
people are interested in there's a whole

156
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,840
lot of work out there that collects a

157
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,960
lot of data we can focus on Gene EXP

158
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,759
expression collects a lot of for example

159
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:07,720
gene expression data and does something

160
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:09,759
to look for like latent factors and say

161
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:12,440
here are something that looks like a

162
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,800
program a gene expression program or

163
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,880
here's something that looks like a

164
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:19,360
pathway or here's a set of units whose

165
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:22,160
Collective activity can describe sort of

166
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,960
the the um you know all of what's going

167
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,960
on inside of a single cell or inside of

168
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:30,919
a tissue or whatever and um that's great

169
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:33,120
but the problem with that is

170
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:35,479
um discovering these biophysical

171
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:39,919
mechanisms is not in the domain of

172
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:42,160
Statistics okay so that's like if I have

173
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,840
this mic you know this I'll drop a mic

174
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,680
or something that that should be an

175
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,520
indictment of like a large field and I

176
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:52,280
don't know you know I've contributed to

177
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:54,800
that bad behavior quite a lot um but you

178
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:57,160
know I don't know if anyone yeah

179
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,639
please so you described this as a bad

180
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:01,919
behavior and I do agree that um

181
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:03,720
statistics is not maybe going to

182
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:06,240
discover the biophysical model but

183
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,240
wouldn't it propose new hypothesis for

184
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,039
perhaps there is some sort of

185
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:12,240
interaction between these two things go

186
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:15,919
test it out with um biop physical models

187
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:18,240
or experiments um so are they really

188
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:20,199
like is there no contribution I guess

189
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,800
from the statistical side no there

190
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:24,680
definitely is so you know there's a role

191
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,680
of finding patterns in developing new

192
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,080
hypotheses and trying to understand what

193
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,720
might be going on and finding new

194
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,120
threads to pull on but the problem is

195
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,440
that the things that we find um should

196
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,599
not be sort of privileged units right um

197
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,039
think about the most basic form we are

198
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:41,960
going to do a principal component

199
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:43,720
analysis of some gene expression data

200
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:46,759
set and then try and interpret the

201
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,599
things as like programs or Pathways or

202
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:50,360
something what's the problem with that

203
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:51,879
the problem with that is if I collect a

204
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,720
new data set I'm not going to find the

205
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:56,159
same thing so it's a little bit hard for

206
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:59,720
me to claim that those are the actual

207
00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:01,520
units moreover there is it turn turns

208
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,759
out more than one way to look for

209
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,560
statistical patterns in a data set in

210
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:09,080
fact the number of ways that there are

211
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:12,360
is infinite and so if I tell you that I

212
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:14,879
have infinitely many ways to find a

213
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:17,879
fundamental unit of organization doesn't

214
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:20,000
seem so meaningful anymore so I agree

215
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:21,680
that there's a role for statistics and a

216
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,120
role for collecting a large amount of

217
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,919
data when we have no sort of existing

218
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,879
notion of what we're looking for we need

219
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:31,159
to just go do exploratory analysis and

220
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,479
in fact in data we're getting way off

221
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:36,320
track here by the way um no you you're

222
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:39,519
completely fine um uh uh mostly I'm just

223
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:43,240
off in the weeds um uh there in fact

224
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:45,600
data science um is a necessary part of

225
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:48,240
biology um because the phenomenon that

226
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:51,240
we're studying are a product of complex

227
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,600
historical processes there's I need to

228
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,320
write this up at some point but there's

229
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:57,839
a there's in fact a kinship between data

230
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,800
science and cosmology among the Natural

231
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,519
Sciences because the things we're

232
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,320
studying require some sort of

233
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,240
exploratory analysis we can't just

234
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,640
reason about them in the abstract

235
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,120
because they're the result of sort of

236
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,519
these random and complex historical

237
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,000
processes so we actually have to go

238
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,440
observe things in the world we can't

239
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,040
just come up with the answers um from

240
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,320
sitting on a mountain for 10 years um so

241
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,800
anyway so there is a role for data

242
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:22,519
science but but in the end discovering

243
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:24,200
these basic units of organization inside

244
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:27,120
cells and tissues is not in the domain

245
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:29,959
of Statistics okay so that's the that's

246
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,200
the 45 minute or however long I've taken

247
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:33,920
um introduction to what is the purpose

248
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,120
of this project the purpose of this

249
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,399
project is to take a different Tack and

250
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:43,000
to directly from the bottom up try and

251
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:46,480
derive a theory of something like a um

252
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,079
uh what a basic unit of organization is

253
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,920
or how something like a biological

254
00:09:49,079 --> 00:09:54,079
process a fundamental unit of

255
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:56,640
organization within a cell could arise

256
00:09:54,079 --> 00:10:00,279
out of evolutionary Dynamics or out of a

257
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:02,680
selective process okay so that's my

258
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:05,040
motivation for what this project is

259
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:07,440
about when Aiden gives his talk he's

260
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,360
going to give a much better motivation

261
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,120
this is the dumb motivation that is

262
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:15,600
internal basically to uh to me and to

263
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:17,720
our group about like our path of why we

264
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,200
started investigating this so the title

265
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,720
of the talk is about genotype to

266
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,079
phenotype mapping and so on and and

267
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:26,360
again Aiden's going to give you a much

268
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:28,800
more generalizable and overall better um

269
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,839
motivation for um the work that he's

270
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,279
going to present present but I just

271
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,959
wanted to give you a little bit of extra

272
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:38,040
context that there internally it came

273
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:39,760
from our basically anxiety uh about the

274
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,639
state of the world where many people

275
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,279
seem to be interested in what these

276
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:46,720
basic units of organization are but the

277
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:49,560
dominant mode of interrogation I believe

278
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:52,839
has little hope of succeeding on its own

279
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:55,680
that it needs a a very sharp shift or a

280
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:57,680
very heavy dose of bottom up and

281
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,320
theoretical approaches to actually tell

282
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,720
us the types of things that we might be

283
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:06,800
looking for okay there we go that's the

284
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:10,959
introduction so um again yes it's Alex

285
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:13,360
blel nice to see you um hi Alex hi um I

286
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:15,279
I just wonder um there's a hypothesis

287
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,720
underlying your motivation which is sort

288
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:21,040
of that that that there really is such a

289
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:23,920
modularity uh in some in some underlying

290
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:26,040
fundamental way um rather than like you

291
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,519
know a massive irreducible complexity

292
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:30,360
and of course we all hope that otherwise

293
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:33,079
like what are we doing anyway but um do

294
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:35,279
you have anything to say about that um

295
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:37,320
so we don't know for sure that it's

296
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,360
going to exist I'll grant you that what

297
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,720
we can say is again from like 20 years

298
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,440
of collecting lots of data there sure

299
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:48,519
seems to be a lot of statistical

300
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:50,120
organization and um you know one very

301
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:51,959
obvious way for those statistical

302
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:55,480
patterns to arise is because there's

303
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:57,440
underlying biophysical organization so

304
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:00,200
again with that I don't think that that

305
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:03,279
quite proves that there is this sort of

306
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:04,720
physical modularity um but I don't

307
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,839
really know how to explain the

308
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,839
statistical modularity other than

309
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:11,399
through those physical mechanisms does

310
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:13,639
that make sense it yes and I think there

311
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:15,839
are also potentially evolutionary

312
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:17,199
genetics reasons why that that could

313
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,440
motivate it but that's another for

314
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:20,839
another time but yes I I completely

315
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,760
agree and what we're going to arrive at

316
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:26,000
today is not um a full decomposition of

317
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,680
the activity at the cell what we're

318
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,320
going to arrive at today is basically

319
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:33,240
like one unit how do we how does one

320
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,279
process arise specifically a metabolic

321
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,839
process today is going to be a

322
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,480
discussion of a theory of how something

323
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,760
we are calling a collective mode but you

324
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:44,199
can think of as a metabolic process

325
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:46,839
arises um so we're baby steps baby steps

326
00:12:44,199 --> 00:12:48,600
Alex great no examples are where it's at

327
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:50,160
it's perfect

328
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,959
okay

329
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:56,560
okay um very good so I'm mostly going to

330
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:58,600
go on the board today um and if um

331
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,959
feeling the need later I have a couple

332
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:03,079
slides to illustrate a couple points so

333
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:04,800
what we want to do the more

334
00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:06,720
generalizable version of the

335
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,720
introduction and the motivation to this

336
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,839
talk is that we're interested in

337
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,560
studying non-trivial genotype to

338
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:16,480
phenotype Maps Okay like many people in

339
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:18,880
the world um and we want sort of a

340
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,079
mathematically tractable problem as I

341
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,639
said um part of our initial motivation

342
00:13:21,079 --> 00:13:26,440
is to develop a theory of how something

343
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:28,519
like a process or a unit of organization

344
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:31,320
arises so we're going to be doing some

345
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:34,000
math so we need to live in a world of

346
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:36,959
somewhere we need to find a a

347
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,360
non-trivial um uh genotype to phenotype

348
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:42,240
map in a space that's mathematically

349
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,800
tractable one of the spaces um that sort

350
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:47,240
of fits these goals is in the analysis

351
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,160
of metabolic reaction networks so we're

352
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:51,639
going to be talking about evolution in

353
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:53,600
the space of metabolic reaction networks

354
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:56,880
and like I said how something like a

355
00:13:53,600 --> 00:14:00,240
metabolic process um might arise or a

356
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:03,279
basic unit of um a metabolic reaction

357
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,839
flux Network might arise so um the rest

358
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:07,279
of the primer now um you know well I

359
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,680
can't make any promises that I won't

360
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:13,120
ramble on any other tangents but the

361
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:15,240
rest of the primer is intended to be um

362
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,320
giving you background on these metabolic

363
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:19,680
reaction networks and then we're going

364
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:21,600
to move into I'll set up the the general

365
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,240
framing of of what they are the

366
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,079
mathematical framing of something called

367
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:28,560
flux balance analysis which is usually

368
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:31,720
formulated as a constrained optimization

369
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:34,600
problem linear program to do our sort of

370
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:36,680
theory we need to analyze the basic

371
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,959
mathematical framework of flux balance

372
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:40,399
analysis a little bit differently for

373
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,040
those who are familiar with convex

374
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,399
optimization we're going to look at the

375
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:47,240
Duel of the Primal program so I'm going

376
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:49,600
to talk a little bit about Duality um

377
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:52,399
and then if I have time left at the end

378
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,800
to do our um especially evolutionary

379
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,759
simulations that Aiden is going to talk

380
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,519
about we have a little bit of teeny

381
00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:00,880
little bit of Pop gen that I'll I'll

382
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:03,839
throw in if I have time at the end okay

383
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:09,240
so let's launch into it here um we're

384
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:12,639
the the first thing to discuss um is uh

385
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,639
genome scale metabolic

386
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:28,120
models okay and I put a genome scale in

387
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,360
parentheses in there because there's

388
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:33,000
there's sort of a a whole field out

389
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:36,800
there of doing this metabolic um uh

390
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:39,319
network analysis and and when um they

391
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:42,399
want to apply it to actual living

392
00:15:39,319 --> 00:15:44,639
organisms one of the first tasks is to

393
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:47,399
try and reconstruct the metabolic

394
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:50,560
Network for a given organism and they

395
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:52,839
call that a genome scale model for our

396
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,279
purposes it doesn't particularly matter

397
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:55,720
we're not looking at a general you know

398
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:57,440
a specific organism again we're just

399
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,880
doing theory for starters here later

400
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,120
we're going to look at eoli um but even

401
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,279
when we do that it doesn't really have

402
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,040
to be genome scale lots of times people

403
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:06,959
do this analysis with like core

404
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,600
metabolism or one little branch of

405
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:12,639
something or whatever um but the purpose

406
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:15,319
of of generating a genome scale uh

407
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:18,279
metabolic model is to have a formal

408
00:16:15,319 --> 00:16:18,279
representation of

409
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:33,639
metabolism um for the purpose of um you

410
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:36,040
know having a a a mathematical and a

411
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:39,240
computational framework for making

412
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:41,560
phenotype predictions um from a given

413
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,120
genotype okay and so the way that these

414
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:46,399
things work is that we're going to have

415
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:49,279
a set of metabolic reactions that exist

416
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:52,079
in the network and those reactions are

417
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:54,319
derived from the genes if you're trying

418
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:56,759
to reconstruct the metabolic network of

419
00:16:54,319 --> 00:17:00,000
a particular organism we look at the

420
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:02,920
genes that are annotated

421
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,920
as metabolic

422
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:09,799
enzymes and this gives us um the

423
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:14,400
available

424
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:17,039
reactions r a c t i

425
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,679
s okay so we look in the genome we know

426
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,640
where all the genes are we look for

427
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:24,199
which ones are annotated as metabolic

428
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:27,360
enzymes um and that tells us the list of

429
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:29,799
reactions that are available in that

430
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,760
organism if you have enzyme to catalyze

431
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:33,679
reaction number one reaction number one

432
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,440
goes in your list if there's a second

433
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,200
reaction that exists in some organisms

434
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,120
but we have no enzyme or set of enzymes

435
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,080
for that reaction it doesn't make the

436
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:44,160
list and um the individual reactions are

437
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,919
just taken from Big databases like I

438
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:49,440
think keg and other things like that and

439
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:51,880
they consist of a reaction stochiometry

440
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,200
consume two of metabolite a and one of

441
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:56,880
metabolite B and produce one of

442
00:17:54,200 --> 00:18:00,640
metabolite C so these things what they

443
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:03,159
represent are sort of fluxes or changes

444
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:06,600
through metabolites so consume one of

445
00:18:03,159 --> 00:18:09,360
this produce one of this and so on we

446
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,360
could think of

447
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:15,880
this if we you know multiply this by

448
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:19,240
some amount of flux so call this like

449
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:23,760
one reaction reaction number one is

450
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:27,320
going to consume one of metabolite 2 uh

451
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:31,120
produce uh one of here just ignore that

452
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:33,520
for now prod one of metabolite 3 and and

453
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:36,039
it doesn't involve the other metabolites

454
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:39,679
there okay and in the end later we're

455
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:41,679
going to look at um uh fluxes so right

456
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:44,039
now this is just sort of DM we haven't

457
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:46,000
really said anything about DT um we're

458
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:48,400
going to say how much flux is there

459
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,880
through each individual reaction and

460
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,600
that's going to tell us about rates of

461
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:55,159
change of each individual metabolite all

462
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:57,440
right and so in the end if we have a a a

463
00:18:55,159 --> 00:18:59,919
whole bunch of genes that code for

464
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,679
different enzymes that gives us

465
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:05,120
potentially a big set of reactions and

466
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:07,520
so we might end up with what we call a

467
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:10,480
big stochiometric

468
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:13,960
Matrix okay something that's going to be

469
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:16,559
metabolites by reactions big so we've

470
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:19,280
got one row per metabolite and one

471
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:21,480
column uh per reaction we call that a

472
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,880
stochiometric matrix yeah please does it

473
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:26,200
matter if you have more than one gene

474
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:28,919
per metabolite or metabolic reaction

475
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:32,120
okay great question so um there's a a

476
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:34,039
mapping that um goes from right now

477
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:36,799
we're going from just genes to reactions

478
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:40,159
so there's no genes for metabolites in

479
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:42,480
in the traditional setup um and very

480
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:45,240
often there turns out to be a complex

481
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:47,200
mapping between genes and metabolites

482
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,960
and the answer is yes it turns out to

483
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,400
matter in a very interesting way that

484
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,559
Aiden's can tell us but I probably won't

485
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,320
be able to help myself and I'm going to

486
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:56,320
let it slip before we get to his talk um

487
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:59,520
but very often for example you know an

488
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:02,080
enzyme can catalyze multiple reactions

489
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:04,440
or a given reaction might be catalyzed

490
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:07,080
by multiple enzymes and so what

491
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:09,240
generally when people build these genome

492
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:11,360
scale reconstructions of a metabolic

493
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:14,080
Network they look through a list of

494
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:16,520
genes that exist in an organism and they

495
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:20,520
come up with these rules like reaction

496
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:25,600
one could use you know x

497
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:30,440
one uh and

498
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:34,840
X2 or Y something like that so reaction

499
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:36,679
one could proceed either if you have um

500
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:39,440
these two genes present or through

501
00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:42,159
basically the catalytic capacity um

502
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,840
combined through Gene one or Gene X1 and

503
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:47,520
Gene X2 or through Gene y so these are

504
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:50,400
the types of rules that tend to get um

505
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:53,679
derived um by looking through a genome

506
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,400
and um but for now yes we're going to

507
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:58,760
put this to the side for now so this

508
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:01,240
exists and is important um but but but

509
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:04,600
for now um consider just that we've

510
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:07,840
looked through all these types of rules

511
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:09,480
and said which reactions seem to have be

512
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,000
able to be satisfied in some way or

513
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:13,799
another like in this case I would need

514
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,720
Gene X1 and Gene x2 in the genome or I

515
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:17,960
would need Gene Y and if I have all of

516
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:20,840
them in any case reaction one can happen

517
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:23,559
so reaction one goes in the list okay so

518
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:26,400
I end up with a big stochiometric Matrix

519
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:30,000
and importantly these types of rules are

520
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,559
the bridge between biochem in genomics

521
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,159
that's going to allow us to do this

522
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:36,440
genotype to phenotype mapping so these

523
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,840
rules are critical and yes it matters

524
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:42,480
that they are sometimes

525
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:46,120
complex um okay finally usually there's

526
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,919
one additional reaction um that maybe

527
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,480
isn't entirely intuitive that's

528
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:52,559
something that's typically called a

529
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:55,840
biomass reaction uh that corresponds to

530
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:57,880
the production of biomass okay and it

531
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:01,120
represents you know a consumption of

532
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:04,039
basic pre cursors amino acids ntps

533
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:06,240
lipids co-actors Etc uh and the

534
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:08,880
production of just overall biomass of a

535
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,640
cell okay and we don't need to get into

536
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,440
the details of exactly what those look

537
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,600
like they vary for a a little bit for

538
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,400
each organism depending on the actual

539
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,279
biomass composition of each organism um

540
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,320
but typically there's one reaction that

541
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:25,880
represents again the consumption of

542
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:28,720
precursors and the production of

543
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:31,080
biomass okay so we can look through

544
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,200
genome look at the enzymes that are

545
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:35,919
annotated uh the genes that are

546
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:39,320
annotated as metabolic enzymes and

547
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:42,640
create a big stochiometric Matrix that

548
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:44,880
captures um which reactions can run and

549
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,559
how those reactions affect the flux

550
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,080
through each individual

551
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:51,520
metabolite all right so

552
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:56,799
now there's a further mathematical

553
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:56,799
framework called flux balance analysis

554
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:10,600
and flux balances analysis um is is is

555
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:14,240
the mathematical approach that sort of

556
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:16,159
Builds on U metabolic uh networks

557
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:19,760
reconstructed at the genome level or a

558
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:23,159
smaller level um to make predictions uh

559
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:26,120
phenotypic predictions um from genotype

560
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:27,480
or in this case from a metabolic Network

561
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:30,039
okay so this is the framework that we're

562
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:33,880
going to use to say what phenotype do we

563
00:23:30,039 --> 00:23:36,559
expect to see uh given a particular um

564
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:38,400
stochiometric Matrix

565
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:43,000
okay

566
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:43,000
um okay great so what are the inputs to

567
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,880
this the inputs to this are a

568
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:52,159
stochiometric Matrix S like I talked

569
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:56,559
about here that's metabolites by

570
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:56,559
reactions big some

571
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:03,039
bounds on the fluxes So biochemically

572
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:05,360
speaking reactions can't just run at

573
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:07,679
infinite rate okay typically there's a

574
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:10,640
biochemical bound and as we'll discuss

575
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:13,279
later those biochemical bounds depend in

576
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,559
large part on the capacity of the

577
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:17,760
enzymes that underly the different

578
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:20,080
reactions so generally speaking going

579
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:22,360
forward we're we're going to talk about

580
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:25,480
these bounds as being related to the

581
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:27,960
genes and and think about that as the

582
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:30,360
gene um somehow what we're really

583
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:32,960
represent in is the catalytic capacity

584
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:35,279
of the gene which is you know

585
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,399
contributed to by like the expression

586
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:39,960
level of the gene but also whether or

587
00:24:37,399 --> 00:24:42,080
not the gene product the enzyme is good

588
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,760
at doing its job okay so I'm not going

589
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,960
to differentiate going forward between

590
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,440
those things but just think about when

591
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:50,080
we talk about a constraint as having

592
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,679
derived from a gene it's just the

593
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,880
catalytic capacity of that which again

594
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,520
is is a combination of expression level

595
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:57,840
and whether or not the enzyme's a good

596
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:02,080
enzyme um and usually there's also

597
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:02,080
something called a fitness

598
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:11,960
function okay which might be in the

599
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,919
usual case the production of biomass

600
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:16,520
which we can think about as basically

601
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:19,000
the growth rate of the cell okay and and

602
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:21,760
you know production of biomass clearly

603
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,080
isn't always Fitness um but it's usually

604
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,360
treated as Fitness so there's something

605
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:27,000
called a fitness function those are the

606
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:30,520
inputs

607
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:33,279
um and and then the thing that we're

608
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,279
looking to get

609
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:38,240
out is

610
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,960
uh is the flux through every reaction in

611
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,919
the network so we have a big stoom

612
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:55,200
metric Matrix and I want to make a

613
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:57,320
prediction about the phenotype at the

614
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:00,520
level of flux through every reaction you

615
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:02,799
have a question no okay that's the

616
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:05,600
output um in order to do this we're

617
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:05,600
going to make some

618
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:15,080
assumptions and the assumptions include

619
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,080
a steady state

620
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:21,159
assumption I'll say formally what that

621
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:23,520
means in a second but it's related to

622
00:26:21,159 --> 00:26:28,240
this flux through all the metabolites

623
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:28,240
and also an assumption of optimality

624
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:37,480
okay all right so formally what um this

625
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,840
looks like we can incorporate all of

626
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:45,000
this into a constrained optimization

627
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:49,200
problem um that tries to um output

628
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:51,840
fluxes that are optimal with a steady

629
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:54,440
state constraint and the and a

630
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:57,640
constraint on the bounds of each

631
00:26:54,440 --> 00:27:00,080
individual reaction okay so usually the

632
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:03,600
way that this is is written down is that

633
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:05,919
we want to maximize over all the fluxes

634
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:10,279
we're going to use V to represent a

635
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:13,840
vector of fluxes V exists in uh how big

636
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:15,360
is v v is like uh yeah one by reactions

637
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:18,600
or whatever it's a vector of length

638
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:23,200
reactions big we want to maximize over

639
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:25,840
reactions now let's define our fitness

640
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:28,399
function usually this is just defined to

641
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:31,279
be something linear so a linear

642
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:34,159
combination of reaction fluxes is

643
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:35,880
somehow the fitness function and often

644
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:39,480
times that's represented with

645
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:41,080
coefficients beta okay so um we're going

646
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:43,720
to have a fitness function that looks

647
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:45,760
something like this in this simple case

648
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:47,760
when I have a biomass reaction let's

649
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:50,840
assume that the last column here is the

650
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:53,159
biomass reaction then beta is going to

651
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,159
look

652
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:58,720
something very boring like this beta is

653
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,360
going to say just take the flux through

654
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:05,080
the biomass reaction and that's the

655
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:06,600
fitness okay but generally speaking we

656
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:08,240
could have any old sort of Fitness

657
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,640
function here and and I'm going to

658
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:13,039
present everything as linear it actually

659
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:14,000
doesn't have to be linear um but uh uh

660
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:16,360
so we're going to have a fitness

661
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:20,200
function and so what we want to do is

662
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:25,159
find fluxes that maximize

663
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:25,159
Fitness subject to constraints

664
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:35,519
one is that we need steady state which

665
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:38,279
is really an imposition of conservation

666
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:40,240
of mass so this says if I take my

667
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:43,279
stochiometric

668
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:46,440
Matrix and I have a flux through every

669
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:49,600
reaction this product The Matrix x times

670
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:52,240
the vector v gives me the rate of change

671
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,519
through each individual metabolite so

672
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,919
we're just assuming and this is not the

673
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:58,880
world's wildest assumption we're just

674
00:28:56,919 --> 00:29:00,360
assuming that at least at the population

675
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,120
level we're not really saying anything

676
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:04,720
here about phenotypic variability but at

677
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:07,320
the population level we're assuming that

678
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,919
metabol each metabolite is at steady

679
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:10,480
state so we're not constantly

680
00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:12,919
accumulating any metabolites and we're

681
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,519
not constantly depleting any metabolites

682
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:16,840
and again this just follows from

683
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:19,440
conservation of mass basically so

684
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:21,559
somehow our flux Vector for you linear

685
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,559
algebra folk out there needs to live in

686
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:30,000
the null space of this Matrix S and then

687
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:31,720
we usually also have bounds um

688
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,840
on the

689
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:37,840
fluxes uh so this is a vector of lower

690
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:40,039
bounds and our fluxes have to be greater

691
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:41,919
than some lower bounds and this is a

692
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:44,519
vector of upper bounds and our fluxes

693
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:46,440
have to be less than um some upper

694
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:48,840
bounds so these are just biochemical

695
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:51,000
constraints okay so that's it this is a

696
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:54,399
linear program this is the basic setup

697
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:57,279
of flux balance analysis um and it can

698
00:29:54,399 --> 00:30:00,159
be solved you know numerically Simplex

699
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:02,360
method or whatever ever um and and again

700
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:04,840
that's the basic setup so the assumption

701
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:07,440
is that we're going to end up predicting

702
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:10,360
the flux through every

703
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:12,399
reaction and we're assuming the the

704
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:15,840
basis of our prediction is somehow that

705
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:19,559
the fluxes have been optimized by

706
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:22,880
Evolution to maximize a fitness function

707
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:25,720
but subject to constraints imposed by

708
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:28,039
the universe conservation of mass and

709
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:31,960
biochemical constraints on how quickly

710
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:34,720
we can run each individual reaction okay

711
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:37,480
that's the basic setup of a flux balance

712
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:40,399
analysis now we can modify this a little

713
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:43,360
bit if You' like we can have you know

714
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:46,640
the same sort of problem where we have

715
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:48,720
we want to maximize a fitness function

716
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:51,080
and we have conservation of mass

717
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,960
constraint but we can also have sort of

718
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:57,120
linear combinations you

719
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:58,840
know like this so we could have a

720
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,399
constraint that's not just on each

721
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:04,279
individual reaction but a constraint

722
00:31:01,399 --> 00:31:08,240
over linear combinations of reaction

723
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:10,000
fluxes okay and then later um Aiden's

724
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,960
also going to introduce how we could

725
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,960
generalize this even further and say is

726
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:18,799
this thing an

727
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:18,799
eraser look at that

728
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,559
whoa we could also generalize this later

729
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:28,919
and

730
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:32,200
say that our upper bound constraints in

731
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:35,799
fact somehow uh involve linear

732
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:37,799
combinations over um the catalytic

733
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:39,159
capacity of a bunch of genes this is

734
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:41,559
going to end up relating to your

735
00:31:39,159 --> 00:31:44,880
question of if there's a non-trivial

736
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:47,799
relationship between genes and

737
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:51,399
constraints on different reactions then

738
00:31:47,799 --> 00:31:53,960
G is going to look funny somehow but for

739
00:31:51,399 --> 00:31:55,760
for for a lot of purposes we're just

740
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:58,240
going to let G be something like the

741
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:00,880
identity Matrix so there's a one one

742
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:03,519
relationship between genes and

743
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:05,399
constraints on individual reactions and

744
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:07,320
we're going to let a be the identity

745
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:09,799
Matrix as well so you get back to a

746
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:11,200
situation that looks like this also

747
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:13,080
going forward I'm normally going to

748
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,880
ignore the lower bounds because I don't

749
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:16,919
want to have to write the basically the

750
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,240
same thing twice the lower bounds matter

751
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:22,080
the meaning of a lower bound or a

752
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:24,399
negative flux is um how much the

753
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,799
reaction can run in Reverse okay so

754
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:27,120
that's what a negative flux means is

755
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:29,399
you're just running the reaction in

756
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:32,960
reverse so flip all the signs of those

757
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:36,679
things for example okay but again so

758
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:40,720
this these types of rules here about how

759
00:32:36,679 --> 00:32:43,120
genes relate to an individual reaction

760
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:46,039
are going to end up manifesting in this

761
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:48,720
type of Matrix here and then it it ends

762
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:51,799
up being a key point of um the stuff

763
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:54,279
that we've sound found so far is that

764
00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:56,039
okay so A1 it just turns out that g is

765
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:58,159
not identity basically ever if you look

766
00:32:56,039 --> 00:33:01,760
in any organism there's all kinds of

767
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:04,559
stuff going on um but if G is degenerate

768
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:06,639
or G is not full rank um it turns out

769
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:07,840
that has a very interesting result um

770
00:33:06,639 --> 00:33:10,760
that we refer to as sort of

771
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:13,120
non-identifiability of genes by a

772
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:16,039
selective process so evolution in fact

773
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:18,840
can't tell if it's selecting on Gene a

774
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:20,880
or Gene B um that result it turns out to

775
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:22,440
be quite General um he's going to tell

776
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,760
you more details about that but that

777
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:29,200
relates to this G Matrix being not full

778
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:32,720
rank okay yes we assume that beta is

779
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:35,039
known a prior from like just what we

780
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:39,039
know about biology or experiments yeah

781
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:41,000
so we do um so again interpreting it as

782
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:43,840
a fitness function is a bit funny if you

783
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,320
think about it just as biomass then beta

784
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:48,919
is just going to be all zeros with one

785
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,880
one on the biomass reaction but your

786
00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:53,480
question then is also implicitly do we

787
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,840
assume we know the biomass reaction and

788
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:58,320
usually that we can do by looking at the

789
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:00,320
biomass composition of the the organism

790
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,519
of Interest what is the relative

791
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:05,320
abundance of different types of

792
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:07,559
macromolecules and so on but overall do

793
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:09,720
we know the real Fitness function I

794
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:11,839
would say is a fantastic ho in the

795
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:14,800
entire field of evolution that the

796
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:20,119
fitness function is a central object but

797
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:20,119
we generally can't say what it is okay

798
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:28,240
yeah our robust is this kind of

799
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:30,599
optimization problem generally to model

800
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:33,520
the specification like I guess mentioned

801
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:34,919
maybe the beta you might not know or

802
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,320
like maybe you're missing a reaction

803
00:34:34,919 --> 00:34:40,119
that you don't know about or you like

804
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:43,879
kind of got the upper bound incorrect

805
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:47,320
yeah so um again if you're trying to um

806
00:34:43,879 --> 00:34:50,800
predict a specific organism yes it

807
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:52,760
there's this is an entire big process if

808
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:56,599
I want to go make phenotype predictions

809
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:58,520
using FBA for some new organism the

810
00:34:56,599 --> 00:35:00,760
process of doing the genome scale

811
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:03,079
metabolic reconstruction is usually

812
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:05,160
quite an Endeavor is very hard these

813
00:35:03,079 --> 00:35:07,400
things are usually not so trivial to

814
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,560
decode and it really depends on what

815
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,280
you're trying to ask if you're looking

816
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,920
at like Central metabolism where we know

817
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:14,960
everything super super well and then

818
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,800
maybe it's not so big of a deal um but

819
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,480
if if you know you're looking for the

820
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,359
production of some more obscure

821
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,680
metabolite it probably matters if you

822
00:35:20,359 --> 00:35:25,480
get all of the reactions so it depends a

823
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:28,200
little bit for our analysis we're just

824
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:30,920
going to have like random S's and random

825
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:32,359
everything so you know um it doesn't

826
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,880
particularly matter we're going to we're

827
00:35:32,359 --> 00:35:38,200
going to assume we know s and that we

828
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:39,680
know beta um and yes if we didn't

829
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:42,280
actually know those things we would get

830
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:44,320
things wrong but but our goal is not to

831
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:46,079
take this one specific organism and

832
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:49,240
predict this one specific phenotype it's

833
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:50,920
to understand in general what are the

834
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:54,000
evolutionary Dynamics when you're

835
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:55,839
operating in the genotype to phenotype

836
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,920
mapping imposed by

837
00:35:55,839 --> 00:36:02,880
metabolism okay yeah thanks yep okay

838
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:06,200
great so now um I'm going to speed it up

839
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:08,000
a little bit uh in theory um to talk

840
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,800
about um what we're actually doing so

841
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,680
again there's you know whatever 10,000

842
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:13,560
papers doing flux balance analysis in

843
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,119
different ways trying to reconstruct

844
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:18,640
these types of things various things

845
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:21,720
that they do is they'll ask like suppose

846
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:25,079
I wanted um you know I want to predict

847
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:26,319
phenotype when I knock out Gene a so

848
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:28,960
what they'll do is they'll go to the

849
00:36:26,319 --> 00:36:32,720
reaction rules and say suppose I remove

850
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:34,839
X2 from The genome does that modify the

851
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:37,160
stochiometric Matrix plug the new

852
00:36:34,839 --> 00:36:39,440
stochiometric Matrix into this problem

853
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:41,800
and ask how the phenotype changes so

854
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:44,040
you're going to plug in a new s and ask

855
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:46,119
how the phenotype changes or maybe you

856
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:47,960
are able to con control some of these

857
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:51,160
bounds for example for things called

858
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:53,280
exchange fluxes meaning just importing

859
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:55,079
something into the cell or exporting

860
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,839
something from the cell if you're trying

861
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:58,400
to import something to the cell you

862
00:36:56,839 --> 00:37:00,920
could take it away from the environment

863
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:03,040
so now the upper bound on that import

864
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:04,680
reaction is now zero or something like

865
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:06,760
that okay so people do all manner of

866
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:10,200
different stuff in the realm of flux

867
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:12,200
balance analysis what we're doing is not

868
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:14,240
just this this is our starting

869
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:16,680
mathematical framework and as I

870
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:19,319
mentioned before we want to analyze um

871
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:21,599
what's known as The Duel of this problem

872
00:37:19,319 --> 00:37:23,839
okay so in in optimization this is a

873
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:25,200
constrained optimization problem happens

874
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:26,200
to be a linear problem and there is a

875
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:29,800
linear

876
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:31,880
program uh and we can call this the

877
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:34,480
Primal problem because it is the one of

878
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:36,720
primary interest we want to analyze

879
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:39,440
What's called the Dual problem so what

880
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:41,520
is the duel first it might be helpful

881
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:44,480
for me to write this out in What's

882
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:46,640
called the lran formulation so in the

883
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:49,160
lran formulation I'm going to write down

884
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:51,160
the same optimization problem but I'm

885
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:54,040
going to move the constraints up into

886
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:57,560
the objective so now we're going to have

887
00:37:54,040 --> 00:38:02,400
something that looks like um

888
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:02,400
I transpose V let me get my signs

889
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:20,680
right okay so again I don't want to have

890
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:22,800
to write twice as much stuff so ignore

891
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:24,160
the lower bounds the lower bounds are in

892
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,240
there they can also matter I'm only

893
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,960
going to write the upper bounds so I'm

894
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:30,520
taking you know this

895
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:32,839
type of optimization problem where we're

896
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:35,560
also going to ignore G for

897
00:38:32,839 --> 00:38:38,400
now this optimization problem and i'

898
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:40,280
I've moved these constraints up into the

899
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,400
objective with these things called

900
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:43,960
lrange

901
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:46,240
multipliers and these things it turns

902
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:48,680
out are going to be our Central object

903
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:50,839
of Interest so we want to know the

904
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:53,359
values of these parameters these might

905
00:38:50,839 --> 00:38:55,040
look familiar to people who are more you

906
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:56,760
know in the realm of statistical

907
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:59,560
learning and so on you you could think

908
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:01,800
of these as like the um penalty

909
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:03,520
parameters of regularized regression or

910
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,800
something like that and many regularized

911
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:08,200
regression problems you know could

912
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:10,200
potentially be mapped back to strict

913
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:12,960
constraints like this sort of depends on

914
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:15,359
what's going on um but they're analogous

915
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:18,040
to like the hyperparameters of your

916
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:20,760
penalized regression tells us in our

917
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:24,119
optimization problem how much do we

918
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:26,400
penalize violating the steady state

919
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:27,960
assumption they penalize it this much so

920
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,599
this is a vector

921
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:33,720
of length number of metabolites remember

922
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:36,520
s is metabolites by reactions so this is

923
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:37,839
like one um these things we're going to

924
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:39,200
end up calling Shadow prices for a

925
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:41,440
reason I'll explain in a second one

926
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:44,040
Shadow price per metabolite and over

927
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:46,880
here we have one Shadow price per

928
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:49,040
constraint okay so um you can write

929
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:52,400
those down in the lran or you can also

930
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,400
write them down in the

931
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:58,599
Dual of the Primal optimization problem

932
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:02,079
and the Dual is going

933
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:05,920
to show us a dual way to optimize over

934
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:09,560
this problem where in the Dual problem

935
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:11,920
um constraints in the Primal problem

936
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:14,599
become dual variables so now the

937
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:16,760
variables that we're optimizing over um

938
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:18,480
are related to the constraints of that

939
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:21,760
problem so we're going to be an

940
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:24,960
optimization problem over these lrange

941
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:27,960
multipliers and the variables in the

942
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:30,960
Primal problem become constraints in the

943
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:34,119
Dual problem also where we had a

944
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:36,400
maximization problem in the Primal we're

945
00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:39,480
now going to have a minimization problem

946
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:41,640
in the Dual okay so Duality theory is

947
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:44,160
you know sort of deep beautiful extends

948
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:46,960
well beyond this framework here slight

949
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:48,560
mysterious in some senses um but if we

950
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:51,359
want to write down the flux balance

951
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:53,280
analysis problem in the Dual formulation

952
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:56,240
it would look like this we're now going

953
00:40:53,280 --> 00:41:00,200
to have a minimization problem over

954
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:02,290
these lrange multipliers or

955
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:05,449
hyperparameters and we're going

956
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:05,449
[Music]

957
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:12,000
to uh what did I call this

958
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:14,480
2

959
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,520
okay this becomes the new objective

960
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:21,480
function and our

961
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:21,480
constraints now look

962
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:25,839
like this

963
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:38,720
okay that's the the Dual formulation of

964
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:41,400
the flux balance analysis problem and

965
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:44,000
again the idea is now we have

966
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:45,760
optimization that's a minimization of

967
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,480
this function where these are the upper

968
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:51,280
bounds on each individual

969
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:53,440
reaction these are these lrange

970
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:55,760
multipliers that tell us something about

971
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,880
each of the upper bound constraints

972
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:01,160
that's our new objective function

973
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:03,040
and we have a constraint here uh that is

974
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:05,079
this thing beta is equal to this stuff

975
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:07,200
this stuff there's these things called

976
00:42:05,079 --> 00:42:08,760
the kkt conditions and because I'm going

977
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:12,760
so slow I don't have time to walk

978
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:14,800
through it in um in entirety um but um

979
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:17,800
one of the important things to note here

980
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:20,800
is that um there's sort of a constraint

981
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:22,680
on these things that uh is related to

982
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,040
something called complimentary slackness

983
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:25,960
maybe I'll give the interpretation of

984
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:27,720
what these things are first so that we

985
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:30,520
can have a little bit more into of where

986
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:32,119
that arises what is the meaning of these

987
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:34,520
things does anyone happen to know the

988
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:36,520
meaning of these things anyone familiar

989
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:39,119
with duol Theory or these things I've

990
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:41,720
said the word Shadow prices

991
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:44,760
before okay great I'm so happy I get to

992
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:47,960
tell you the meaning of these things and

993
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:50,839
the term Shadow price is um it turns out

994
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:54,920
that these Lambda parameters here um

995
00:42:50,839 --> 00:42:58,960
that were optimizing over um tell us

996
00:42:54,920 --> 00:43:01,480
about the change in the optimum

997
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:03,559
especially this Optimum or you can think

998
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:07,280
about it as the change in the fitness

999
00:43:03,559 --> 00:43:09,760
function as we relax each individual

1000
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:12,480
constraint so specifically we have

1001
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:15,240
something like the lambdas are going to

1002
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,240
be equal

1003
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:20,000
to something like this again we're only

1004
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,640
or really this is all the constraints so

1005
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,839
we could think about um I'm going to

1006
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:27,119
write C for constraints there's some

1007
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:29,280
constraints on metabolites being at

1008
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:32,280
steady state and there's constraints on

1009
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:35,559
the upper bounds of each reaction so the

1010
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:39,119
lambdas tell us the change in the

1011
00:43:35,559 --> 00:43:42,760
optimal value of um the the Primal

1012
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:45,640
objective with respect to relaxation of

1013
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:49,400
each individual constraint so that is to

1014
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:52,800
say if I were to um increase for example

1015
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:55,000
the upper bound on reaction number one

1016
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:57,760
uh the Lambda or the shadow price for

1017
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:01,680
reaction number one tells me much the

1018
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:05,200
optimal Fitness would increase okay so

1019
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:08,160
for us these are like the most important

1020
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:11,720
things to analyze because these give us

1021
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:13,839
a lens into selective pressure and by

1022
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:16,160
give us a lens into selective pressure

1023
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:19,440
what I mean is we interpret these as the

1024
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:22,760
selective pressure okay this is why do

1025
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:25,800
we do that it's because um these Lambda

1026
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:27,839
parameters again the shadow price of an

1027
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:30,760
individual constraint

1028
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:32,960
gives me a fitness difference okay which

1029
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:35,040
in in in pop genen in like curra's

1030
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:37,440
formulas if we're looking at a selective

1031
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:40,440
coefficient The Selective coefficient

1032
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:42,640
usually represents a fitness difference

1033
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:45,760
and so these give me a fitness

1034
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:50,240
difference that would arise from a

1035
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:52,520
mutation for example that would uh relax

1036
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:54,760
a constraint move the upper bound up

1037
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:56,559
move the lower bound down or make the

1038
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:58,880
constraint tighter move a upper bound

1039
00:44:56,559 --> 00:45:01,760
down or move the lower bound up or

1040
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:03,640
whatever okay so these are our Central

1041
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:07,440
objects and again these are the Shadow

1042
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:09,680
prices Shadow prices arise in all manner

1043
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:11,920
of other scenarios or are interrogated

1044
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:13,839
in all manner of other scenarios very

1045
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:16,800
often in economics

1046
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:19,960
literature um but in principle anytime

1047
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:22,240
you have uh uh a constrained

1048
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:25,119
optimization problem you can look at the

1049
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:27,720
shadow price of the constraints okay so

1050
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:30,800
we have a mapping that goes goes from

1051
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:32,559
genes to which reactions are possible

1052
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,960
and also what are the constraints on

1053
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:37,040
each individual

1054
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:41,280
reaction now I have a way analytically

1055
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:45,319
theoretically to say if I were to mutate

1056
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:47,800
a gene such that a constraint is changed

1057
00:45:45,319 --> 00:45:49,920
how would that affect Fitness so these

1058
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:53,000
are what we want to analyze are these

1059
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:57,040
lambdas here these lambdas you can solve

1060
00:45:53,000 --> 00:46:00,319
for because this is just a nice linear

1061
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:03,200
program here we can solve for uh

1062
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:04,520
numerically or in some cases we will see

1063
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,480
well we won't actually see because we

1064
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:07,839
probably won't have time to go through

1065
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:10,440
the full derivation um but you may also

1066
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:12,760
be able to solve for them analytically

1067
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:15,319
um the point is you can find them

1068
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:17,440
numerically or analytically and so now

1069
00:46:15,319 --> 00:46:19,920
we can calculate um sort of what are the

1070
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:23,119
selective pressures on each individual

1071
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:25,920
Gene in a reaction Network okay let me

1072
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:29,440
see how I'm doing on time 949 I might

1073
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:31,359
take three two three more minutes um

1074
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:35,520
just to set up a final problem or just

1075
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:37,040
to um draw you some pictures of of um

1076
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:38,800
some of the types of reaction networks

1077
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:41,000
that we're going to look at in a second

1078
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,640
Brian f fstar is the value at the

1079
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,240
optimum just checking make sure I got it

1080
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:47,640
right exactly so if you're not at the

1081
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:49,160
optimum then you know we don't have

1082
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:52,920
anything to say about this this tells us

1083
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:54,920
how the optimal Fitness or the um yes

1084
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:56,520
the optimal objective value over there

1085
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:58,760
in the Primal would change it doesn't

1086
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:00,520
tell you about n sure yeah yeah it's the

1087
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:02,200
value at the solution or any of the

1088
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:04,280
solutions if it's non- Unique but that's

1089
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:05,800
correct yeah correct any of the

1090
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:09,000
solutions because they have all of the

1091
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:11,240
same the same value yeah yes yes exactly

1092
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,640
okay so now let's draw some pictures so

1093
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:15,800
let's think of a a very basic um

1094
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:18,160
reaction Network where we have just like

1095
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:18,160
two

1096
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,920
metabolites and a couple different

1097
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:26,960
reactions we'll have some import

1098
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:28,920
reaction and maybe you know we do

1099
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:32,559
something like this so here's a reaction

1100
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:36,440
Network and let's say that our our beta

1101
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:39,200
our fitness function

1102
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:42,240
um you know is just based on the flux

1103
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:44,960
through these two reactions so my my

1104
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:47,160
Total Fitness is the flux through this

1105
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:49,520
reaction plus the flux through this

1106
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:51,520
reaction okay so now we can also think

1107
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:54,800
about our steady state assumption one

1108
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:56,440
thing to note is that um we have this

1109
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:59,720
basic sort of conservation of mass

1110
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:02,599
steady State thing so um you know if I

1111
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:04,480
have any sort of flux through here

1112
00:48:02,599 --> 00:48:07,359
that's producing metabolite one the

1113
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:08,960
production of metabolite one needs to be

1114
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:12,880
balanced by the consumption of

1115
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:15,359
metabolite one so if I have a flux of a

1116
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:18,119
coming in through this reaction that

1117
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:20,319
needs to be balanced by the total flux

1118
00:48:18,119 --> 00:48:21,800
through these two things or if this

1119
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:23,119
thing is running in Reverse you know

1120
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:26,000
then this thing whatever the combination

1121
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:27,480
of flux is through these two reactions

1122
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,079
needs to equal

1123
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:30,960
um the flux through that reaction same

1124
00:48:29,079 --> 00:48:33,960
thing here whatever my flux that's

1125
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:38,000
producing M2 needs to be balanced by the

1126
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:39,839
flux that's consuming M2 okay so now you

1127
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,359
can imagine that there's some feasible

1128
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:45,800
space that exists and part of that

1129
00:48:42,359 --> 00:48:48,359
feasible space again comes from the

1130
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:52,000
fluxes that are allowed live need to

1131
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:53,440
live in the null space of s now you can

1132
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
also imagine that we have different

1133
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:57,559
constraints but let's ignore the

1134
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,440
constraints for a second and just or

1135
00:48:57,559 --> 00:49:02,000
rather let's think about every reaction

1136
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:03,799
has a upper bound of one there you go

1137
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,799
every reaction has a upper bound of one

1138
00:49:03,799 --> 00:49:08,079
now we can start to talk about solutions

1139
00:49:05,799 --> 00:49:09,920
to the Primal problem okay so flux

1140
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:12,960
balance analysis what can flux balance

1141
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:16,000
analysis tell us we want to maximize the

1142
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:19,920
flux through the sum of these two

1143
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:22,680
reactions such that we are at steady

1144
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:25,160
state and that none of the fluxes are

1145
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:28,440
over the upper bound of one okay so what

1146
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:29,680
are the things you could do

1147
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:31,880
clearly everything is going to be

1148
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:35,319
limited by this reaction because we have

1149
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:36,799
to balance the production of M1 with the

1150
00:49:35,319 --> 00:49:38,520
consumption of these things so let's

1151
00:49:36,799 --> 00:49:41,240
just assume that one's at a reaction

1152
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:42,760
flux of one all right so what's one

1153
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:45,400
thing we could do is that could be

1154
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:48,680
balanced by a reaction flux of one

1155
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:51,319
through this reaction there you go and I

1156
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:52,960
get one biomass point out of that which

1157
00:49:51,319 --> 00:49:54,160
seems like it's the most I'm going to be

1158
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,960
able to get if everything has an upper

1159
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:58,119
bound of one I'm not going to be able to

1160
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:59,400
produce more than one biomass unit per

1161
00:49:58,119 --> 00:50:01,799
time my growth rate is not going to be

1162
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:05,599
greater than one another possible

1163
00:50:01,799 --> 00:50:08,760
solution would be that I do that so I

1164
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:11,079
have a a flux at a rate of one through

1165
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:13,119
this reaction and then a flux at a rate

1166
00:50:11,079 --> 00:50:15,319
of one through there and through there

1167
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:18,359
that gets me the same number of biomass

1168
00:50:15,319 --> 00:50:21,559
points and in fact any linear

1169
00:50:18,359 --> 00:50:23,920
combination of those two solutions lives

1170
00:50:21,559 --> 00:50:26,240
at the optimum and it turns out that

1171
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:27,520
this is not uncommon in flux balance

1172
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:29,440
analysis

1173
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:32,040
that there ends up being not just a

1174
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:35,400
unique solution but a whole Space of

1175
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:37,160
solutions that could exist okay so now

1176
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:38,680
to finalize the setup here so everyone

1177
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:41,079
can have their breakfast before Aiden

1178
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:42,920
tells you the actual interesting stuff

1179
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:45,920
what we want to do is different from

1180
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:49,640
this in a couple of respects we're not

1181
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:49,640
going to assume

1182
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:55,040
optimality that is that Evolution has

1183
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:57,359
ended and that we are at the optimal

1184
00:50:55,040 --> 00:51:00,160
solution because we are interested in

1185
00:50:57,359 --> 00:51:02,760
the evolutionary Dynamics so we want to

1186
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:04,799
understand how this process changes over

1187
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:07,040
time the other thing that we're not

1188
00:51:04,799 --> 00:51:11,240
going to assume is that the constraints

1189
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:13,920
are fixed so here we either have in the

1190
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:16,200
Primal problem we have a problem of how

1191
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:19,119
is evolution effectively going to wiggle

1192
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:22,400
the fluxes around to optimize the growth

1193
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:24,599
rate or biomass under a set of fixed

1194
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:27,119
constraints but what we can see is that

1195
00:51:24,599 --> 00:51:28,559
the constraints are super important they

1196
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:29,920
tell you something and the constraints

1197
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:33,160
are the things that are actually

1198
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:34,359
directly mappable to genes so fluxes

1199
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:36,640
it's unclear if they're directly

1200
00:51:34,359 --> 00:51:38,880
mappable to genes probably in some way

1201
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:41,200
they might be but the constraints are

1202
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:42,400
actually directly mappable to genes so

1203
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:44,119
if we're going to be in the business of

1204
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:46,640
asking what happens when I allow the

1205
00:51:44,119 --> 00:51:48,119
genes to mutate it's immediately obvious

1206
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:50,240
that the constraints are going to wiggle

1207
00:51:48,119 --> 00:51:52,640
around so the second thing that we want

1208
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:55,680
to do different from normal flux balance

1209
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:58,520
analysis is to say in a reaction Network

1210
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:58,520
like this

1211
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:02,359
how what are the Dynamics going to look

1212
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:04,880
like as we allow the constraints to

1213
00:52:02,359 --> 00:52:06,400
wiggle around according to different

1214
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:10,200
selective

1215
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:11,839
pressures okay so if we move the start

1216
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:13,599
the constraints at whatever place you

1217
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:15,960
like and start the fluxes at whatever

1218
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:18,119
place you like and now assume that

1219
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:20,200
there's some process of mutation that

1220
00:52:18,119 --> 00:52:22,920
Wiggles some of the

1221
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:24,559
constraints and those constraints have

1222
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:26,079
some the wiggling of the constraints and

1223
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:27,480
wiggling of the fluxes has some effect

1224
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:29,960
on fit

1225
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:32,319
then we'll use his basic pop gen stuff

1226
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:35,240
like curra's formula of probability of

1227
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:37,640
fixation to say does that mutation fix

1228
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:40,200
in a population or not and now we want

1229
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:42,559
to know what's the overall direction of

1230
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:45,119
evolution where is the system going to

1231
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:48,400
go I've just told you that flux balance

1232
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:50,319
analysis very frequently doesn't tell us

1233
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:53,119
the real an they can't even tell us if I

1234
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:55,799
give you fixed constraints flux balance

1235
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:57,079
analysis can't even identify one unique

1236
00:52:55,799 --> 00:52:59,000
solution

1237
00:52:57,079 --> 00:53:01,839
so we have a harder problem my

1238
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:05,240
constraints aren't fixed and I want to

1239
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:08,359
identify one actual solution hopefully

1240
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:11,520
not just a space of solutions so that's

1241
00:53:08,359 --> 00:53:13,079
our goal we want to say in a regime

1242
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:16,480
where the constraints are allowed to

1243
00:53:13,079 --> 00:53:18,520
wiggle the fluxes are allowed to wiggle

1244
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:20,640
how is this network going to end up what

1245
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:23,440
is the phenotype we're going to end up

1246
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:25,680
seeing after some amount of evolutionary

1247
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:28,200
time and again as I mentioned in the

1248
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:31,000
introduction we think about that as the

1249
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:34,640
way in which a basic unit something in

1250
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:37,720
this case like a um metabolic process

1251
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:39,880
can arise and it turns out that I

1252
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:42,200
mentioned before flux balance analysis

1253
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:44,119
can't distinguish between linear

1254
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:45,760
combinations of going all the way

1255
00:53:44,119 --> 00:53:48,359
through this path or going all the way

1256
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:50,720
through this path the answer in this

1257
00:53:48,359 --> 00:53:52,559
particular Network just to give you some

1258
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:54,240
sense that there's something non-trivial

1259
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:58,440
that you wouldn't be able to just guess

1260
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:58,440
going on here uh ends up being

1261
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:04,400
this okay why the hell should that be I

1262
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:05,960
don't know math says it's true and we're

1263
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:08,680
going to do a bunch of simulations to

1264
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:11,040
check whether it's true as well okay so

1265
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:13,480
that's most of what I wanted to cover um

1266
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:14,839
in the primer um I don't know if there's

1267
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:18,359
any final questions but I'm sure I'm

1268
00:54:14,839 --> 00:54:18,359
over time uh

1269
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:29,480
anyway um yeah I'm in I'm in Brian's

1270
00:54:27,079 --> 00:54:31,240
at bu and I'm going to be talking about

1271
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:33,680
some of the results of the work we've

1272
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:35,760
been doing um specifically modeling

1273
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:39,000
genotype to phenotype and our search for

1274
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:39,000
the natural objects of

1275
00:54:39,079 --> 00:54:44,000
selection so get ass started in maybe

1276
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:45,359
some stories that don't quite make sense

1277
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,680
with what Brian just talked about we're

1278
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:50,000
going to talk about CLE cell

1279
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:52,319
disease as many of you probably know CLE

1280
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,720
cell disease is a recessive disease so

1281
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:58,040
to be affected by it you need two copies

1282
00:54:54,720 --> 00:55:00,599
of mutated hemoglobin

1283
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:02,880
these mutations cause hemoglobin to pize

1284
00:55:00,599 --> 00:55:04,960
and lead to the characteristic CLE shape

1285
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:06,960
of red blood

1286
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:09,760
cells the shape leads to poor

1287
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:12,520
circulation and eventually causes

1288
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:14,440
pain we can also look at this scenario

1289
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:17,480
where you're carrier for the disease and

1290
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:20,160
only have one mutated copy of

1291
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:22,079
hemoglobin in this scenario heem is more

1292
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:25,000
likely to be released from hemoglobin

1293
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:27,520
and this increases hem oxygen one

1294
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:30,079
activity this increased activity leads

1295
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:30,079
to malaria

1296
00:55:30,119 --> 00:55:34,720
tolerance and these are more just facts

1297
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:37,520
but we can make them stories by looking

1298
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:39,720
at them in an evolutionary

1299
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:41,359
context for example if we're in a

1300
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:43,559
malaria Rich environment you might be

1301
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:45,200
able to predict that the carrier a

1302
00:55:43,559 --> 00:55:48,000
single mutant of hemoglobin should be

1303
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:48,000
enriched in the

1304
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:52,079
population similarly we could predict

1305
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:54,960
that the pain caused by the double

1306
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:58,240
mutant keeps the double mutation from

1307
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:58,240
enriching in the population

1308
00:55:58,359 --> 00:56:02,359
I'm here telling you these stories about

1309
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,200
CLE cell disease because they're nice

1310
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:05,599
and

1311
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:07,839
simple I claim that they're nice and

1312
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:10,920
simple because there's a direct onetoone

1313
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:11,640
relationship between genotype phenotype

1314
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:14,200
and

1315
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:16,119
fitness knowing a change at the genotype

1316
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:18,680
level we can make a prediction about the

1317
00:56:16,119 --> 00:56:20,599
change at the phenotype this allows us

1318
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:23,039
to make a conclusion about how Fitness

1319
00:56:20,599 --> 00:56:25,160
will change and we can make a prediction

1320
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:28,240
about if the mutation will enrich or

1321
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:28,240
leave the population

1322
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:33,000
however many stories aren't like CLE

1323
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:34,960
cell

1324
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,400
disease for example we could look at

1325
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:38,680
serum urate levels which are controlled

1326
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:41,520
by many

1327
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:43,480
genes if we try to tell a story like we

1328
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:46,240
told about CLE cell disease you might

1329
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:48,839
ask if a mutation occurs in one gene

1330
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:51,480
what happens to the other ones it's not

1331
00:56:48,839 --> 00:56:54,240
as clear as the CLE cell

1332
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:55,599
scenario similarly in starting to get

1333
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:57,000
onto what Brian was talking about we

1334
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:59,920
could look at metab abolism in the

1335
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:01,960
citric acid cycle here again there's

1336
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:03,359
many genes involved but there's also

1337
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:05,680
some interesting

1338
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:07,359
structure you could ask what role this

1339
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:08,079
structure plays in the stories we tell

1340
00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:10,520
about

1341
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:13,000
Evolution if we see a mutation in one

1342
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:16,680
gene does the structure change what we

1343
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,680
might predict about mutations in other

1344
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:20,799
genes even in the simple stories we just

1345
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:24,160
told you can start to

1346
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:26,319
Foles for example in the carrier story

1347
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:28,240
what happens to H MOX one the gene that

1348
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:30,079
encodes H

1349
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:32,799
oxygenase I think you can make a few

1350
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:35,079
different arguments one is that the

1351
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:36,920
increased H oxygenase activity was what

1352
00:57:35,079 --> 00:57:38,559
led to the increase in Fitness so

1353
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:40,960
mutation should accumulate that also

1354
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:44,039
increase hee oxygene

1355
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:45,720
activity alternatively You could argue

1356
00:57:44,039 --> 00:57:47,400
there shouldn't really be any change to

1357
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:48,960
hmx one because the mutation in

1358
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,880
hemoglobin has already caused the

1359
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:52,039
fitness

1360
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:56,400
benefit the story we try and tell about

1361
00:57:52,039 --> 00:57:58,200
hmx one isn't so clear

1362
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:00,000
and this is the Crux of this project is

1363
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:00,960
that we want to tell complicated stories

1364
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,160
about

1365
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:06,640
Evolution we want to look at complicated

1366
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:09,720
relationships between genotype phenotype

1367
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:11,799
and fitness and in specific

1368
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:13,440
environments we might look at scenarios

1369
00:58:11,799 --> 00:58:15,480
where multiple phenotypes contribute to

1370
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:18,160
Fitness or where there's non-trivial

1371
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:20,160
genotype to phenotype relationships such

1372
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:22,319
as shown for GC which contributes to

1373
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:22,319
both

1374
00:58:24,039 --> 00:58:27,839
phenotypes additionally we might want to

1375
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,720
ask ask how our stories change if we put

1376
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:31,079
them in a different environment in the

1377
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:32,799
stories I told you about cyle cell

1378
00:58:31,079 --> 00:58:34,839
disease you can imagine that if we're

1379
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:37,640
not in a malaria Rich environment our

1380
00:58:34,839 --> 00:58:37,640
predictions might be

1381
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:42,079
different we can summarize these ideas

1382
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:44,359
by asking the question of how do

1383
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:46,640
non-trivial genotype to phenotype Maps

1384
00:58:44,359 --> 00:58:48,720
imp impact evolutionary

1385
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:51,000
outcomes and importantly we'd like to

1386
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:53,240
make quantitative predictions in the

1387
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:55,240
stories I told about hemoglobin the

1388
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:56,760
ultimate prediction we made was if a

1389
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:58,720
gene will be enich

1390
00:58:56,760 --> 00:59:01,039
or say away from the

1391
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:02,880
population it be might might be nice to

1392
00:59:01,039 --> 00:59:05,039
have a more precise picture and a

1393
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:07,799
quantitative

1394
00:59:05,039 --> 00:59:09,680
one we'll spend the rest of this talk

1395
00:59:07,799 --> 00:59:11,000
discussing the work we've done towards

1396
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:14,119
answering these

1397
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:16,799
questions first we'll discuss our

1398
00:59:14,119 --> 00:59:19,079
non-trivial genotype to phenotype map

1399
00:59:16,799 --> 00:59:20,839
which you might be able to guess is

1400
00:59:19,079 --> 00:59:23,599
metabolism then we'll perform

1401
00:59:20,839 --> 00:59:25,480
evolutionary simulations to see if what

1402
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:26,880
arises and if there is a story we can

1403
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:28,720
tell

1404
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:31,039
and then we'll use some of the analysis

1405
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:33,319
of Shadow prices to make predictions

1406
00:59:31,039 --> 00:59:33,319
about

1407
00:59:33,559 --> 00:59:40,200
Evolution as I mentioned metabolism is

1408
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:43,200
our non-trivial genotype to phenotype

1409
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:46,000
map we can map the genotype phenotype in

1410
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:49,359
Fitness using the citric acid

1411
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:52,200
cycle as you'd expect genes in the

1412
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:55,119
enzymes that they incode are the

1413
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:56,720
genotype we could imagine the gene mdh

1414
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:59,200
which codes for the enzyme that converts

1415
00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:01,200
malet to oxal acetate we could also

1416
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:03,559
consider the gene T which holds a

1417
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:03,559
similar

1418
01:00:03,839 --> 01:00:07,599
role I'm going to introduce the

1419
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:09,760
phenotype but we'll return to discussing

1420
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:12,440
genes to talk about their the

1421
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:15,680
quantitative role they

1422
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:18,160
have the phenotype is the metabolic

1423
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:19,960
fluxes we could look at the phenotype

1424
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:21,280
for the the metabolic flux through

1425
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:23,240
isocitrate

1426
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:24,839
dehydrogenase or we could consider the

1427
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:27,839
flux through Alpha keto glut

1428
01:00:24,839 --> 01:00:27,839
dehydrogenase

1429
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:32,799
importantly there's a non-trivial

1430
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:34,480
relationship between genotype and

1431
01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:37,000
phenotype through the biochemical

1432
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:39,839
constraints that physics and genes

1433
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:42,520
impose on metabolic fluxes we discuss

1434
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:43,960
conservation of mass and the require and

1435
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:46,480
operating at steady state as one of

1436
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:50,160
those constraints and similarly genes

1437
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:52,480
will impose specific constraints on

1438
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:53,680
flexes now we can discuss how we're

1439
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:56,119
representing

1440
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:58,880
genes Brian alluded to this idea of

1441
01:00:56,119 --> 01:01:03,319
capacity so we consider a gene to be the

1442
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:05,799
ultimate capacity for the a metabolic

1443
01:01:03,319 --> 01:01:07,280
flux Brian also discussed this that we

1444
01:01:05,799 --> 01:01:09,319
can think about that as coming from how

1445
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:12,359
much of an enzyme we could make or how

1446
01:01:09,319 --> 01:01:15,240
efficient that enzyme is for example for

1447
01:01:12,359 --> 01:01:17,039
the mdh gene if there's an excess of it

1448
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:19,960
in the cell it might have a higher

1449
01:01:17,039 --> 01:01:22,440
capacity compared to fuman however if

1450
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:24,520
you may had was a more efficient at

1451
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:27,920
catalyzing its reaction it could also

1452
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:27,920
have a higher capacity

1453
01:01:29,079 --> 01:01:33,480
now we can discuss Fitness and we'll

1454
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:35,440
view this as the growth rate here we'll

1455
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:38,520
view it as this Bri discussed as a

1456
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:42,240
linear combination of reaction fluxes

1457
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:42,240
beta is the coefficients for the

1458
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:48,079
sum this is a nice picture of metabolism

1459
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:50,000
we started to make it more quantitative

1460
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:51,799
but we need a mathematical formulation

1461
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:54,520
to really be able to analyze

1462
01:01:51,799 --> 01:01:57,839
it as Brian discussed in the primer this

1463
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:57,839
formulation is flux balance anal

1464
01:02:01,799 --> 01:02:04,960
shown here on the screen is our

1465
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:07,880
formulation a flex balance analysis and

1466
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:10,079
we can walk through the individual

1467
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:12,920
equations first we seek to maximize

1468
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:14,760
Fitness over the reaction flexes and

1469
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:15,720
then we impose conservation of mass as

1470
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:17,760
one

1471
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:20,880
constraint additionally we look at

1472
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:23,480
constraints imposed by

1473
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:24,680
genes here again s is the stochiometric

1474
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:27,640
Matrix of

1475
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:29,319
reactions and A and G are matrices that

1476
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:32,319
allow us to consider constraints on

1477
01:02:29,319 --> 01:02:33,559
linear combinations of reactions or

1478
01:02:32,319 --> 01:02:36,240
constraints imposed by linear

1479
01:02:33,559 --> 01:02:36,240
combinations of

1480
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:42,279
genes again this is implicitly included

1481
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:44,079
in FBA but they consider genes as being

1482
01:02:42,279 --> 01:02:47,319
on or off where we're taking a slightly

1483
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:47,319
more quantitative numeric

1484
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:51,760
perspective let's take a look at what

1485
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:55,200
FBA is doing visually we start with a

1486
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:59,160
phenotypic space in this case Flex space

1487
01:02:55,200 --> 01:03:01,400
here I've shown the 2D the 2D version

1488
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:04,039
with two reactions there's a reaction a

1489
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:04,039
and a reaction

1490
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:08,760
B we know the direction that increases

1491
01:03:06,839 --> 01:03:11,119
Fitness and that's beta and we can put

1492
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:13,520
that in this space as

1493
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:17,079
well then there are constraints imposed

1494
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:19,839
by genes with five shown

1495
01:03:17,079 --> 01:03:22,480
here these constraints Define a feasible

1496
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:24,920
region of fluxes that we can select

1497
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:26,880
from now that we have a feasible region

1498
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:30,000
we can perform the optim ization problem

1499
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:32,880
to arrive at our our optimal set of

1500
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:37,200
fluxes in this scenario b0 would be at

1501
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:37,200
the top right as it's most in line with

1502
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:43,799
beta importantly and as Brian discussed

1503
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:47,079
in the primer there's a lot fixed about

1504
01:03:43,799 --> 01:03:50,559
FBA the constraints and genes are fixed

1505
01:03:47,079 --> 01:03:53,400
beta is fixed and ultimately we arrive

1506
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:55,760
at one single optimal set of

1507
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:58,279
fluxes however we care more about

1508
01:03:55,760 --> 01:04:00,960
evolutionary Dynamics in traditional

1509
01:03:58,279 --> 01:04:02,480
FBA and this arises in two main ways

1510
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:04,640
that Brian discussed

1511
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:06,279
earlier the first is that we do want to

1512
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:09,119
see constraints

1513
01:04:06,279 --> 01:04:11,760
change here a mutation happens that

1514
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:15,279
changes the constraint c0 to C1 and

1515
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:15,279
expands the feasible region of

1516
01:04:15,319 --> 01:04:19,480
fluxes the second point is slightly more

1517
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:22,200
subtle in

1518
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:23,880
FBA there's an assumption that Evolution

1519
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:25,920
will eventually bring us to the optimal

1520
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:27,559
set of fluxes however however this

1521
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:29,480
assumption is made under fixed

1522
01:04:27,559 --> 01:04:31,039
constraints now that we're constantly

1523
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:33,520
changing constraints to examine the

1524
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:36,319
evolutionary Dynamics it's not as clear

1525
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:39,000
if this assumption is still

1526
01:04:36,319 --> 01:04:40,760
valid we address both these ideas and

1527
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:43,279
how we set up the simulations so let's

1528
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:43,279
discuss that

1529
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:50,200
now this again is our formulation of FBA

1530
01:04:48,359 --> 01:04:51,960
and we'll discuss it as we walk through

1531
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:54,039
each step of the

1532
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:57,079
simulation we start with an initial set

1533
01:04:54,039 --> 01:05:00,400
of fluxes and genes so we need some V

1534
01:04:57,079 --> 01:05:02,119
and some lowercase G U and GL which are

1535
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:04,760
the

1536
01:05:02,119 --> 01:05:07,200
genes then we perform a mutation by

1537
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:09,400
sampling a new constraint now the genes

1538
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:09,400
are

1539
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:15,279
changing then we also sample a new flux

1540
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:18,119
biologically we can think of this as a

1541
01:05:15,279 --> 01:05:20,240
noisy inheritance of

1542
01:05:18,119 --> 01:05:22,520
phenotype with this new flux we can

1543
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:24,200
calculate a new fitness and we can use

1544
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:26,200
this new fitness along with c's

1545
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:28,200
equations to decide

1546
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:30,279
if this new mutation should fix in the

1547
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:32,960
population or

1548
01:05:30,279 --> 01:05:34,920
not we can repeat this process as much

1549
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:37,079
as we'd like to examine Evolution and

1550
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:37,079
its

1551
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:41,440
trajectory let's look visually at what

1552
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:45,440
happens in a single

1553
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:47,559
step we start with our initial flux and

1554
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:50,599
constraints and we'll initially perform

1555
01:05:47,559 --> 01:05:51,520
a mutation to change from constraint c0

1556
01:05:50,599 --> 01:05:54,039
to

1557
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:55,680
C1 I've drawn this mutation as

1558
01:05:54,039 --> 01:05:57,160
increasing the feasible region over

1559
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:59,799
were're randomly selecting so we could

1560
01:05:57,160 --> 01:06:02,319
decrease the feasible region as

1561
01:05:59,799 --> 01:06:04,200
well this addresses our first difference

1562
01:06:02,319 --> 01:06:05,880
with FBA that we alluded to we're

1563
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:08,000
changing the constraints so now we can

1564
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:11,480
watch the Dynamics of

1565
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:14,119
them then we randomly sample a new

1566
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:16,200
flux here this is drawn as increasing

1567
01:06:14,119 --> 01:06:18,760
Fitness but we could also decrease

1568
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:18,760
Fitness as

1569
01:06:19,079 --> 01:06:23,599
well this addresses our second concern

1570
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:24,760
with FBA now instead of making an

1571
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:26,920
assumption about stepping towards

1572
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:30,520
optimality instead we just randomly

1573
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:30,520
sample and make no such

1574
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:36,440
assumption this is drawn as occurring

1575
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:38,920
somewhat within a single cell but really

1576
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:41,000
there's a population of cells we can

1577
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:43,799
think of this process as an having a set

1578
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:46,480
of cells that are all initially at flux

1579
01:06:43,799 --> 01:06:49,640
v0 then we perform a mutation to create

1580
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:51,480
a mutant cell which now has flux V1

1581
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:53,599
compared to the

1582
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:56,760
parents the question we'd like to ask in

1583
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:59,079
our simulations and this is a simple

1584
01:06:56,760 --> 01:07:01,520
is if the parent wins and eventually

1585
01:06:59,079 --> 01:07:04,319
overtakes the entire population or if

1586
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:06,039
the mutant will win we'll decide this

1587
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:08,400
based off of their respective

1588
01:07:06,039 --> 01:07:11,960
fitnesses beta times to be one for the

1589
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:15,799
mutant and beta times to be zero for the

1590
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:17,079
parent this setup is what we can use's

1591
01:07:15,799 --> 01:07:19,599
equation

1592
01:07:17,079 --> 01:07:22,760
for's equation describes the probability

1593
01:07:19,599 --> 01:07:25,680
that the mutant wins and takes over the

1594
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:27,400
population the key parameter of it is a

1595
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:29,520
The Selective Advantage which is the

1596
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:32,039
difference between the two fitnesses of

1597
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:35,119
the mutant and the

1598
01:07:32,039 --> 01:07:36,599
parent in this equation as a increases

1599
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:37,599
the probability of the mutant winning

1600
01:07:36,599 --> 01:07:40,760
also

1601
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:42,920
increases importantly if a is zero so a

1602
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:44,559
neutral mutation has occurred the

1603
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:46,240
probability of the mutant winning is one

1604
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:48,440
over the population size

1605
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:51,319
n so there is a chance that we can

1606
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:51,319
accumulate some neutral

1607
01:07:51,799 --> 01:07:56,000
mutations yeah uh and the population

1608
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:58,119
size is fixed

1609
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,119
the

1610
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:06,119
simulations a diagram of an initial

1611
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:07,839
population with one mutant right and

1612
01:08:06,119 --> 01:08:11,079
then mutants might be taking over or

1613
01:08:07,839 --> 01:08:13,319
maybe they're seled or dying out yeah um

1614
01:08:11,079 --> 01:08:16,520
so when I think about the population

1615
01:08:13,319 --> 01:08:18,080
size what should I think of the

1616
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:21,159
population looking

1617
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:23,520
like uh you could think the I'm not from

1618
01:08:21,159 --> 01:08:26,159
population genetics I might be asking no

1619
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:28,839
yeah this is a good question um so n is

1620
01:08:26,159 --> 01:08:31,520
the population size here you know it' be

1621
01:08:28,839 --> 01:08:33,279
like seven and that'll be fixed

1622
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:35,799
throughout the simulations so a mutation

1623
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:39,159
you're just assuming the in a Sim in a

1624
01:08:35,799 --> 01:08:40,199
population of like 100 cells yeah okay

1625
01:08:39,159 --> 01:08:42,480
we just pick for a lot of the

1626
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:44,719
simulations it's a thousand that's the

1627
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:46,679
size of the population we're considering

1628
01:08:44,719 --> 01:08:50,120
but generally we're considering sizes

1629
01:08:46,679 --> 01:08:51,600
that are so large that yes we can see

1630
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:53,920
neutral mutations but it's quite

1631
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:57,440
unlikely because it's one over the

1632
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:57,440
population size

1633
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:03,759
okay now we have a framework that we can

1634
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:05,679
perform some simulations we can repeat

1635
01:09:03,759 --> 01:09:08,799
this process a lot we can perform

1636
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:10,759
mutations wiggle the flux calculate the

1637
01:09:08,799 --> 01:09:12,640
probability of the mutant winning and we

1638
01:09:10,759 --> 01:09:14,600
can watch Evolution

1639
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:16,719
happened we're going to look at this in

1640
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:19,560
two different

1641
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:21,679
systems the first is a small toy Network

1642
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:23,640
which this is the same as the toy

1643
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:26,080
Network Brian drew it just looks a

1644
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:27,719
little different I think um

1645
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:30,920
and the second is we'll look at the

1646
01:09:27,719 --> 01:09:33,040
equal cor metabolism you can see the

1647
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:35,759
circle in the centers the TCA cycle and

1648
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:38,480
then BSIS is the long vertical column of

1649
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:38,480
reactions on the

1650
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:43,920
left we're going to spend a lot of time

1651
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:46,199
with the TW Network so we'll walk

1652
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:47,839
through it step by step I personally

1653
01:09:46,199 --> 01:09:49,440
have spent a ton of time with this TW

1654
01:09:47,839 --> 01:09:50,920
Network it's a great great Network to

1655
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:53,120
look

1656
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:55,679
at there's four

1657
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:57,480
reactions reactions 0 through three and

1658
01:09:55,679 --> 01:10:01,560
there's two metabolites metabolites X

1659
01:09:57,480 --> 01:10:04,280
and Y reaction zero is an exchange flux

1660
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:07,520
and it brings metabolite X into the

1661
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:09,679
cell then in our very simple scenario

1662
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:13,080
metabolite X can be consumed for growth

1663
01:10:09,679 --> 01:10:15,360
through reaction One alternatively

1664
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:18,480
metabolite X can be consumed and turned

1665
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:22,000
into metabolite Y and this can also be

1666
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:22,000
turned into growth through reaction

1667
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:29,080
three if these AR metabolized should I

1668
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:31,560
assume that the two can also happen in

1669
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:35,000
Reverse yeah here we'll talk about them

1670
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:35,000
they can happen in Reverse as well

1671
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:40,320
yeah there's also genes underlying these

1672
01:10:38,159 --> 01:10:42,159
reactions we'll have one gene for each

1673
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:44,640
reaction so here we'd have Gene zero for

1674
01:10:42,159 --> 01:10:45,640
reaction zero Gene one for reaction one

1675
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:48,400
and so

1676
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:50,840
on mathematically G in the FBA

1677
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:54,440
formulation the capital G's end up being

1678
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:58,080
the identity Matrix so nothing crazy

1679
01:10:54,440 --> 01:11:00,560
with these G rules have happened

1680
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:02,120
yet an important feature of this network

1681
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:05,040
is that there's two ways for the cell to

1682
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:06,800
grow you can either convert metabolite X

1683
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:09,080
into growth for reaction one or it can

1684
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:09,960
convert M metabolite Y into growth for

1685
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:12,360
reaction

1686
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:14,199
three this means our beta has multiple

1687
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:15,960
non-zero entries and in this case we're

1688
01:11:14,199 --> 01:11:17,840
assuming that both metabolite X and

1689
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:19,679
metabolite y are equally efficient at

1690
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:25,640
turning into growth so they both are

1691
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:25,640
just set to one they entries uh in beta

1692
01:11:27,239 --> 01:11:32,239
yeah two ways to goow um as Brian

1693
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:34,080
mentioned there's many different ways

1694
01:11:32,239 --> 01:11:35,800
for the same many different sets of

1695
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:37,960
fluxes that give the same Fitness in

1696
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:40,600
this network we could look at a scenario

1697
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:43,040
where only reaction one is used and this

1698
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:45,800
would correspond to one

1699
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:47,320
growth similarly we could look at a

1700
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:48,960
scenario where only reactions two and

1701
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:50,679
three are used and this gives us the

1702
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:52,679
same

1703
01:11:50,679 --> 01:11:54,120
Fitness again as Brian mentioned we

1704
01:11:52,679 --> 01:11:56,440
could look at any linear combination

1705
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:59,080
between these two extremes

1706
01:11:56,440 --> 01:12:01,520
here I've chosen a combination which as

1707
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:03,960
Brian hinted at will become important

1708
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:05,639
where the first reaction uses two thirds

1709
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:08,159
of reaction the flex through reaction

1710
01:12:05,639 --> 01:12:10,199
zero and the second and third reactions

1711
01:12:08,159 --> 01:12:12,199
both use a

1712
01:12:10,199 --> 01:12:14,000
third importantly these all give the

1713
01:12:12,199 --> 01:12:15,719
same Fitness so it might be difficult

1714
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:18,239
for us to tell beforehand if evolution

1715
01:12:15,719 --> 01:12:19,080
should have a preference to any of these

1716
01:12:18,239 --> 01:12:21,400
think you might be able to make an

1717
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:22,840
argument well reaction one is only one

1718
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:24,400
reaction compared to reactions two and

1719
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:26,960
three so maybe it should it should be

1720
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:29,120
used but also then you're missing out on

1721
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:31,480
using metabolite y so it's not quite

1722
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:34,080
clear right now if anything should arise

1723
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:34,080
as we perform

1724
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:41,760
Evolution now we can perform simulations

1725
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:44,120
and look and see how these systems

1726
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:45,920
evolve we'll start with the toy Network

1727
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:48,040
shown here is the growth rate versus

1728
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:50,040
time throughout the simulation for a

1729
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:51,840
single

1730
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:54,239
simulation as you can see the growth

1731
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:56,000
rate does increase at a somewhat linear

1732
01:12:54,239 --> 01:12:58,960
rate and we can see that this result is

1733
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:04,000
consistent across reactions a

1734
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:06,800
second simulation a third a fourth and a

1735
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:08,360
fifth there is some variability due to

1736
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:11,120
the randomness of these simulations but

1737
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:11,120
the results are quite

1738
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:15,639
consistent we can also look at the E cor

1739
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:18,360
metabolism and again see that the growth

1740
01:13:15,639 --> 01:13:19,920
rate does increase the time similarly

1741
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:25,280
the results are consistent across a

1742
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:25,280
second third fourth and fifth simulation

1743
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:28,719
at this point if you think back to the

1744
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:30,440
stories we told about CLE cell disease

1745
01:13:28,719 --> 01:13:32,480
in some sense we have the second half of

1746
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:34,639
those stories we know Fitness is

1747
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:37,199
occurring and we know evolution is

1748
01:13:34,639 --> 01:13:39,960
occurring and fitness is increasing but

1749
01:13:37,199 --> 01:13:41,679
it's not clear why in those stories we

1750
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:43,719
were able to tell the second half

1751
01:13:41,679 --> 01:13:46,560
because we knew the relationship between

1752
01:13:43,719 --> 01:13:46,560
genotype and

1753
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:51,080
fitness so as a good Next Step let's see

1754
01:13:49,719 --> 01:13:53,520
what's happening at the level of

1755
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:53,520
individual

1756
01:13:53,639 --> 01:13:58,000
genes as Brian suggested one way we can

1757
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:59,679
consider genes is by looking at the

1758
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:01,239
selective pressure on them which is the

1759
01:13:59,679 --> 01:14:03,760
difference which is related to a

1760
01:14:01,239 --> 01:14:03,760
difference in

1761
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:08,080
Fitness one way we can calculate this

1762
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:11,400
change in Fitness is by using the shadow

1763
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:13,880
Braes in this scenario G the gene would

1764
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:16,480
just be a vector of zeros and one one

1765
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:19,280
that corresponds to our Gene of

1766
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:21,199
Interest then the Shadow prices again

1767
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:24,800
correspond to the change in optimality

1768
01:14:21,199 --> 01:14:24,800
as you change a gene

1769
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:30,560
visually what's going on is we perform a

1770
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:32,480
mutation and then we take a step towards

1771
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:34,159
optimality we can look at the difference

1772
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:37,400
in Fitness and this gives us the

1773
01:14:34,159 --> 01:14:40,040
selective pressure on an individual

1774
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:42,480
Gene this neatly captures the first half

1775
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:44,840
of the stories we told about CLE cell

1776
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:46,960
disease we knew that if we saw a

1777
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:49,360
mutation occur in hemoglobin that would

1778
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:51,960
lead to a fitness benefit of Mia

1779
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:53,560
tolerance in the carrier scenario in the

1780
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:55,760
same sense The Selective pressure tells

1781
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:58,600
us if we change a gene what is the

1782
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:58,600
numeric Fitness

1783
01:14:58,639 --> 01:15:02,000
method let's take a look at the

1784
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:04,679
selective pressure on the individual

1785
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,679
genes in the to

1786
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:09,480
network we're going to look at a thin

1787
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:11,639
slice of a simulation to start so this

1788
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:14,280
is only the graphs I'm about to show are

1789
01:15:11,639 --> 01:15:15,800
only from between the two vertical lines

1790
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:16,880
importantly maybe it's a little

1791
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:18,679
difficult to tell but you can see the

1792
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:22,400
evolution is occurring in Fitness

1793
01:15:18,679 --> 01:15:24,520
increases over this short time

1794
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:26,159
period we'll start by looking at the

1795
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:29,239
selective pressure on the gene for

1796
01:15:26,159 --> 01:15:32,120
reaction zero initially it's constant at

1797
01:15:29,239 --> 01:15:34,800
one it drops down to zero before

1798
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:36,639
returning to one but then it starts to

1799
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:39,080
oscillate quite

1800
01:15:36,639 --> 01:15:41,239
frequently we can see similar results

1801
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:43,600
for all the other genes here's the gene

1802
01:15:41,239 --> 01:15:46,800
for reaction One the gene for reaction

1803
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:49,800
two and the gene for reaction

1804
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:51,719
three now then this was only a fin slice

1805
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:54,040
and you can see the gene for reaction

1806
01:15:51,719 --> 01:15:56,960
two The Selective pressure is nearly

1807
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:58,320
constant on it so you might want to ask

1808
01:15:56,960 --> 01:16:00,560
what does the rest of the simulation

1809
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:00,560
look

1810
01:16:01,639 --> 01:16:05,719
like these are the same graphs as I

1811
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:06,960
showed you on the last slide but over

1812
01:16:05,719 --> 01:16:09,159
the entire

1813
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:12,679
simulation here's the gene for reaction

1814
01:16:09,159 --> 01:16:14,120
zero reaction One reaction two and

1815
01:16:12,679 --> 01:16:16,040
reaction

1816
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:18,400
three The Selective pressure is

1817
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:20,480
oscillating so much that you can't even

1818
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:22,360
make out the individual

1819
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:23,520
trajectories there are some Thin

1820
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:25,320
vertical lines where you can tell

1821
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:27,920
nothing is changing but generally The

1822
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:30,719
Selective pressure is constantly

1823
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:32,679
changing this is our first result The

1824
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:35,400
Selective pressure on individual genes

1825
01:16:32,679 --> 01:16:37,199
is highly variable throughout

1826
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:39,320
Evolution if we think back to the

1827
01:16:37,199 --> 01:16:41,760
stories we told about CLE cell

1828
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:45,000
disease we can't quite use individual

1829
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:47,320
genes the same way we could

1830
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:49,159
there additionally this raises a new

1831
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:51,280
question if you think back to the

1832
01:16:49,159 --> 01:16:54,080
fitness growth I showed you a few slides

1833
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:55,560
ago those trajectories were relatively

1834
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:57,960
constant

1835
01:16:55,560 --> 01:17:02,400
however we see that genes are quite

1836
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:02,400
variable so what's providing this

1837
01:17:03,199 --> 01:17:07,040
consistency if it's not at the genotype

1838
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:09,239
level then maybe it's at the phenotype

1839
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:11,960
level so we can examine the fluxes and

1840
01:17:09,239 --> 01:17:14,400
the toy Network and the eoli

1841
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:16,440
network here's the flux the reaction

1842
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:19,719
zero and as expected for increasing

1843
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:21,560
Fitness the flux increases with time

1844
01:17:19,719 --> 01:17:23,520
shown here is the average of the five

1845
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:25,960
simulations from

1846
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:30,719
before we can o look at the flux through

1847
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:30,719
reaction One reaction two and reaction

1848
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:34,880
three as you can see the flux through

1849
01:17:33,239 --> 01:17:37,480
reaction zero is the highest as it's the

1850
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:39,040
entry we of the network reactions two

1851
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:41,880
and three have the same flux because

1852
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:43,440
they're in series and then reaction one

1853
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:46,280
has a slightly higher flux than

1854
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:46,280
reactions two and

1855
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:52,199
three we can also look at this in the

1856
01:17:49,639 --> 01:17:54,400
eoli to toy Network I'm going to show

1857
01:17:52,199 --> 01:17:56,400
you four fluxes that I randomly selected

1858
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:57,679
from the around 100 that are involved in

1859
01:17:56,400 --> 01:18:00,600
this part of the

1860
01:17:57,679 --> 01:18:03,719
network here's one here's another here's

1861
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:03,719
a thirdd here's a

1862
01:18:05,239 --> 01:18:10,719
fourth if you look at this closely you

1863
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:13,719
might see that after an initial period

1864
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:16,159
the flexes start to go

1865
01:18:13,719 --> 01:18:19,360
linearly this suggests that we might be

1866
01:18:16,159 --> 01:18:22,880
adding a constant Vector to the flexes

1867
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:25,679
at over each time step let me say that

1868
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:28,679
again at a specific time we have a set

1869
01:18:25,679 --> 01:18:30,760
of fluxes after a short period of time

1870
01:18:28,679 --> 01:18:33,280
it appears that we're adding some

1871
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:35,840
constant Vector to that new

1872
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:38,120
flux we can repeat this process again

1873
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:40,120
and again and this would give us these

1874
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:42,600
linear directions we're

1875
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:45,199
seeing one way we can isolate this is by

1876
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:47,600
looking at the relative flux so we can

1877
01:18:45,199 --> 01:18:49,719
normalize by the maximum flux within an

1878
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:52,400
individual time Point let's look at the

1879
01:18:49,719 --> 01:18:52,400
toy Network

1880
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:57,840
first we said before that the

1881
01:18:55,320 --> 01:19:01,040
the the first reaction had the maximum

1882
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:03,760
flux so when we normalize it by it

1883
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:05,719
reaction zero goes to one through its

1884
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:07,440
relative

1885
01:19:05,719 --> 01:19:11,080
flux however we can see that for

1886
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:13,040
reaction One it converges to around 66

1887
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:17,239
similarly we see that reactions 2 and

1888
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:17,239
three converge to around

1889
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:23,159
33 we can look at the same for reactions

1890
01:19:21,239 --> 01:19:26,199
from the equaline

1891
01:19:23,159 --> 01:19:28,400
network again we see that after a short

1892
01:19:26,199 --> 01:19:32,360
period of some change the relative

1893
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:32,360
fluxes converge to a specific

1894
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:40,880
value now we can look at all of the

1895
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:41,840
fluxes in the equal Network and their

1896
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:44,120
relative

1897
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:45,600
fluxes this is what that looks like for

1898
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:47,679
the around 100

1899
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:50,000
reactions as you can see there's an

1900
01:19:47,679 --> 01:19:52,120
initial period of some nonlinearity

1901
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,800
where fluxes are moving about but then

1902
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:56,639
they eventually start to converge to

1903
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:59,280
specific constant

1904
01:19:56,639 --> 01:20:01,960
values to give you a sense of what

1905
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:04,520
reactions are involved you can the

1906
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:08,639
reactions for ATP synthes cytochrom

1907
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:11,800
oxidase and GAP DH all involved in

1908
01:20:08,639 --> 01:20:13,280
glycolysis and oxidative oxidative

1909
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:15,880
phosphorilation which should be

1910
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:18,239
important for growth they all have high

1911
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:18,239
relative

1912
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:23,560
fluxes this brings us to our second

1913
01:20:20,679 --> 01:20:26,560
result Evolution prefers to grow Fitness

1914
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:30,480
in a specific Direction

1915
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:34,800
we call this direction the collective

1916
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:37,080
mode importantly this is a direction

1917
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:40,400
we're looking at the moves the evolution

1918
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:42,960
takes as it occurs it's taking a step in

1919
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:45,600
a direction to change the

1920
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:48,360
genotype however as we repeatedly move

1921
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:50,719
in this direction we eventually converge

1922
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:52,480
at the phenotypic level to this

1923
01:20:50,719 --> 01:20:54,360
direction so in this sense the

1924
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:56,679
collective mode is both a direction in

1925
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:58,800
that we're taking steps along it but

1926
01:20:56,679 --> 01:21:02,800
also a specific value that we eventually

1927
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:02,800
converge to after repeated rounds of

1928
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:10,600
evolution now then you might ask what's

1929
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:12,280
so special about this Collective mode

1930
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:14,760
one way we can look at this is Again by

1931
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:16,440
using this concept of selective pressure

1932
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:18,920
before we looked at selective pressure

1933
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:20,800
on individual genes and we calculated it

1934
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:23,280
using the Shadow

1935
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:24,800
prices we can generalize this idea to

1936
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:26,800
look at the selective pressure on

1937
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:28,679
directions we're still using the same

1938
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:31,159
equation but now instead of interpreting

1939
01:21:28,679 --> 01:21:33,159
G as a gene we can think about it as

1940
01:21:31,159 --> 01:21:34,560
taking a step in a specific Direction

1941
01:21:33,159 --> 01:21:36,840
along the

1942
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:38,639
genotype once again we'll use the Shadow

1943
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:41,440
prices which tell us how Fitness is

1944
01:21:38,639 --> 01:21:44,199
changing as we change a

1945
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:47,280
constraint for the toy Network we saw

1946
01:21:44,199 --> 01:21:48,800
the simulation converge to 1.

1947
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:51,320
6633

1948
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:53,159
and33 so this is the direction of the

1949
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:56,520
collective mode that we would care about

1950
01:21:53,159 --> 01:21:56,520
calculating the selective pressure on

1951
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:01,679
shown here are the same four graphs I

1952
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:04,679
showed you before where the selective

1953
01:22:01,679 --> 01:22:06,600
pressure on individual genes is

1954
01:22:04,679 --> 01:22:07,880
varying now we can calculate the

1955
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:10,320
selective pressure on the collective

1956
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:12,920
mode using this

1957
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:16,800
equation again this

1958
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:18,760
1.66 33.33 value is from the simulation

1959
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:21,679
of the toy

1960
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:23,800
note when we put the selective pressure

1961
01:22:21,679 --> 01:22:26,360
on the collective mode over the genes we

1962
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:29,080
see that it is cont

1963
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:30,719
Conant this might help explain how our

1964
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:32,800
evolutionary simulations were so

1965
01:22:30,719 --> 01:22:34,600
consistent they converged the collective

1966
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:36,600
mode which has a constant selective

1967
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:40,199
pressure and there are constant gains of

1968
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:42,520
Fitness as we move along the collective

1969
01:22:40,199 --> 01:22:44,120
mode however doesn't quite raise answer

1970
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:45,159
the question of why we end up at the

1971
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:47,760
collective

1972
01:22:45,159 --> 01:22:49,120
mode one way we can look at this is by

1973
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:51,480
looking at the cumulative selective

1974
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:53,040
pressure on individual genes and the

1975
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:55,960
collective

1976
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:57,679
mode in this to calculate this we are

1977
01:22:55,960 --> 01:22:59,440
just adding The Selective pressure on

1978
01:22:57,679 --> 01:23:02,040
the individual genes or Collective mode

1979
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:03,880
versus time for example here's the

1980
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:05,440
cumulative selective pressure on the

1981
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:08,639
gene for the first

1982
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:10,960
reaction the they the reaction zero

1983
01:23:08,639 --> 01:23:11,920
here's reaction One reaction two and

1984
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:13,960
reaction

1985
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:16,199
three before we get to the collective

1986
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:18,320
mode we can get some intuition for why

1987
01:23:16,199 --> 01:23:21,440
we see these

1988
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:23,440
results intuitively reaction zero is the

1989
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:25,320
entry way for the network so we would

1990
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:26,360
expect it to have more pressure on it

1991
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:28,840
than the other

1992
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:30,880
reactions if we ever want to evolve we

1993
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:32,520
have to mutate reaction zero to increase

1994
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:34,560
Fitness so it should have a high

1995
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:37,199
selective pressure on

1996
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:40,280
it similarly we see that reactions two

1997
01:23:37,199 --> 01:23:43,320
and three have nearly equal selective

1998
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:45,040
pressure they're in series so if they

1999
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:48,600
want to be mutated and contribute to

2000
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:51,120
increasing Fitness they must be mutated

2001
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:52,960
similarly if one if reaction two had a

2002
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:54,719
higher capacity than reaction three

2003
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:56,679
reaction three would be rate limiting

2004
01:23:54,719 --> 01:23:58,080
and you need to increase reaction three

2005
01:23:56,679 --> 01:24:00,360
and you could then make the same Claim

2006
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:02,440
about reaction

2007
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:04,719
two now we can look at the selective

2008
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:07,239
pressure on the collective

2009
01:24:04,719 --> 01:24:09,880
mode we see that it's perfectly linear

2010
01:24:07,239 --> 01:24:11,920
due to its constant value but we also

2011
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:14,880
see that it's

2012
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:16,800
maximal this is our third result the

2013
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:18,239
collective mode has constant and maximal

2014
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:20,719
selective

2015
01:24:18,239 --> 01:24:23,000
pressure this helps explain why we

2016
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:24,800
arrived at the flective mode flective

2017
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:27,360
pressure is capturing some idea of a

2018
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:29,040
fitness benefit and we see that the

2019
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:31,719
collective mode has a maximal

2020
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:31,719
Improvement of

2021
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:35,760
Fitness if we think about the stories we

2022
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:38,520
were telling at the start with CLE cell

2023
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:40,679
disease even with this complex genotype

2024
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:44,400
to phenotype map we're able to recapture

2025
01:24:40,679 --> 01:24:47,080
a simple story now using the collective

2026
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:48,920
mode if we take a step at the genotype

2027
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:51,560
level in the direction of the collective

2028
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:52,880
mode we know this increases Fitness in a

2029
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:55,159
maximal

2030
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:56,480
sense this means the evolution should

2031
01:24:55,159 --> 01:24:58,560
then enrich the genotype in the

2032
01:24:56,480 --> 01:25:00,400
collective mode and this process would

2033
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:01,920
continue and then we can make a

2034
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:04,480
prediction about where the genotype

2035
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:04,480
would arrive

2036
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:09,480
at one question you might ask is can we

2037
01:25:07,639 --> 01:25:11,159
generalize these results this is only

2038
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:12,960
for the toy Network and it only has four

2039
01:25:11,159 --> 01:25:15,639
reactions and two

2040
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:17,920
metabolites additionally we calculated

2041
01:25:15,639 --> 01:25:19,520
the collective mode by simulation so it

2042
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:21,360
might be nice to know if we could

2043
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:24,880
predict the collective mode without

2044
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:24,880
performing a simulation

2045
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:31,719
to make these predictions we turn the

2046
01:25:29,199 --> 01:25:33,280
constant in maximal selective pressure

2047
01:25:31,719 --> 01:25:35,199
into a mathematic

2048
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:37,520
framework we start with the collective

2049
01:25:35,199 --> 01:25:40,400
mode and first we seek to maximize

2050
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:42,719
selective pressure here Z would be a

2051
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:45,119
direction at the gene

2052
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:47,400
level then we impose a constraint that

2053
01:25:45,119 --> 01:25:49,239
the selective pressure must be constant

2054
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:51,199
to get some intuition for why this is

2055
01:25:49,239 --> 01:25:52,920
the constraint you can imagine taking

2056
01:25:51,199 --> 01:25:56,239
the derivative of the selective pressure

2057
01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:56,239
as genes are changing

2058
01:25:57,080 --> 01:26:01,560
we impose a positivity constraint to

2059
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:03,320
have physically possible results and

2060
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:05,239
then we can solve this optimization

2061
01:26:03,320 --> 01:26:07,040
problem to arrive at a prediction of the

2062
01:26:05,239 --> 01:26:12,159
collective

2063
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:15,119
mode importantly Lambda and damb DG are

2064
01:26:12,159 --> 01:26:17,639
functions of the specific S A and G

2065
01:26:15,119 --> 01:26:19,760
matrices that we discussed in the FBA

2066
01:26:17,639 --> 01:26:21,400
setup this means that each metabolic

2067
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:24,400
network will have a unique Collective

2068
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:24,400
mode

2069
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:29,040
under some specific scenarios we can

2070
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:30,480
solve this problem analytically we can

2071
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:32,119
always Solve IT numerically but looking

2072
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:34,920
at the analytical result give might give

2073
01:26:32,119 --> 01:26:36,639
us some intuition for what's going on

2074
01:26:34,920 --> 01:26:37,679
it's a bit of a mess but let's walk

2075
01:26:36,639 --> 01:26:41,199
through

2076
01:26:37,679 --> 01:26:44,440
it first we have this s Matrix which a

2077
01:26:41,199 --> 01:26:46,880
is a combination of the S and a

2078
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:48,679
matrices both of these matrices were

2079
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:50,440
related to imposing constraints on

2080
01:26:48,679 --> 01:26:54,440
fluxes so that might provide some

2081
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:56,360
intuition for why we group them

2082
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:59,360
then we perform some multiplication of

2083
01:26:56,360 --> 01:27:00,800
beta in this stil Matrix to calculate

2084
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:03,520
something that is akin to the Shadow

2085
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:07,040
prices Lambda that we're looking to

2086
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:09,480
maximize with Selective

2087
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:11,639
pressure however we impose the constant

2088
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:14,800
selective pressure requirement and this

2089
01:27:11,639 --> 01:27:17,600
involves projecting this special Vector

2090
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:22,080
made up of beta and stie into the null

2091
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:22,080
space of the D Lambda DG

2092
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:26,639
Matrix this part of the pro project is

2093
01:27:24,679 --> 01:27:28,400
what I've spent a lot of time on in how

2094
01:27:26,639 --> 01:27:29,920
we predict the collective mode this is

2095
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:32,119
all I'm going to say for now but if you

2096
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:33,880
want to discuss it more after I'm more

2097
01:27:32,119 --> 01:27:36,520
than happy

2098
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:39,000
to if you think back to the toy network

2099
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:41,199
from simulation we saw the results

2100
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:42,760
converge the relative flexes converge to

2101
01:27:41,199 --> 01:27:47,639
1

2102
01:27:42,760 --> 01:27:49,719
6633 and33 for reactions 0 through three

2103
01:27:47,639 --> 01:27:52,520
if we solve this optimization problem

2104
01:27:49,719 --> 01:27:57,760
for the specific s matrices of the toy

2105
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:59,320
Network we arrive at 1 2/3 1/3 and 1/3

2106
01:27:57,760 --> 01:28:01,480
these are the numbers Brian mentioned in

2107
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:05,800
primer and we can see that we're able to

2108
01:28:01,480 --> 01:28:05,800
predict the collective mode of the toy

2109
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:11,840
Network now then to really put this

2110
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:14,280
framework to the test we'll Generate

2111
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:17,199
random metabolic networks and see how

2112
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:17,199
well our predictions f

2113
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:22,679
up I'm going to put the S Matrix for a

2114
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:24,360
metabog Network that has 16 reactions

2115
01:28:22,679 --> 01:28:27,760
and 10 metabolites on it in the screen

2116
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:30,119
in a second there's a lot of numbers um

2117
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:32,520
but we're going to walk through it and

2118
01:28:30,119 --> 01:28:35,119
this is just an example of the type of s

2119
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:37,320
Matrix we could

2120
01:28:35,119 --> 01:28:41,239
generate this is what that Matrix looks

2121
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:43,159
like um as Brian mentioned reactions go

2122
01:28:41,239 --> 01:28:44,400
across the columns and metabolites go

2123
01:28:43,159 --> 01:28:46,880
down the

2124
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:49,560
rows among reactions there's a few

2125
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:52,119
different classes that we can look at

2126
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:54,119
first there's exchange flexes so here

2127
01:28:52,119 --> 01:28:55,800
the first reaction is just the first

2128
01:28:54,119 --> 01:28:58,719
metabolite appearing in the

2129
01:28:55,800 --> 01:29:01,520
cell and the second reaction is the

2130
01:28:58,719 --> 01:29:03,760
fourth metabolite leaving the

2131
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:05,760
cell then we can look at the set of

2132
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:07,880
reactions that are what we probably

2133
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:09,239
think of as traditional metabolic

2134
01:29:07,880 --> 01:29:11,719
reactions where we're converting

2135
01:29:09,239 --> 01:29:14,159
different metabolites into each

2136
01:29:11,719 --> 01:29:17,480
other finally we have a growth or

2137
01:29:14,159 --> 01:29:19,600
biomass reaction that uses all of the

2138
01:29:17,480 --> 01:29:21,880
metabolites and take some in and take

2139
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:25,560
some out but this is what is capturing

2140
01:29:21,880 --> 01:29:25,560
the growth of the cell

2141
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:29,800
when we perform these randomly generated

2142
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:32,320
matrices right now we're only going to

2143
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:36,000
make a random s Matrix But the A and G

2144
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:38,560
matrices from the FBA setup will be

2145
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:40,080
identity to generate a matrix like this

2146
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:42,520
we would first fix some number of

2147
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:44,920
exchange fluxes so here we picked one

2148
01:29:42,520 --> 01:29:46,800
influx and one efux

2149
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:49,080
reaction and then we would sample

2150
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:51,719
stochiometric coefficients as integers

2151
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:54,080
to generate the metabolic reactions and

2152
01:29:51,719 --> 01:29:55,960
then we would sample just real numbers

2153
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:58,520
to generate the growth

2154
01:29:55,960 --> 01:30:00,400
reaction we impose some what I'm going

2155
01:29:58,520 --> 01:30:02,800
to call neness constraints on the SM

2156
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:05,000
matrices such as like you have to use

2157
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:06,639
all the metabolites there can't be any

2158
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:08,880
metabolites that aren't used but

2159
01:30:06,639 --> 01:30:12,159
generally the process is randomly

2160
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:12,159
selecting Soom metric

2161
01:30:12,719 --> 01:30:17,800
coefficients we can visualize this s

2162
01:30:15,239 --> 01:30:20,040
matrix by looking at the metabolic

2163
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:22,960
Network here the orange circles are

2164
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:25,480
metabolites and the blue arrows are the

2165
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:28,520
reactions you can see reaction zero is

2166
01:30:25,480 --> 01:30:30,520
an influx and generates metabolite a and

2167
01:30:28,520 --> 01:30:33,040
reaction one is an efux and takes out

2168
01:30:30,520 --> 01:30:33,040
metabolite

2169
01:30:33,119 --> 01:30:39,199
D in the corner is shown the biomass

2170
01:30:35,719 --> 01:30:41,600
reaction which uses all of the fluxes or

2171
01:30:39,199 --> 01:30:41,600
all of the

2172
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:46,239
metabolites if you sare at this for a

2173
01:30:45,320 --> 01:30:48,119
little bit you'll see that some

2174
01:30:46,239 --> 01:30:50,239
reactions are simple such as the third

2175
01:30:48,119 --> 01:30:51,560
reaction which just converts a into G

2176
01:30:50,239 --> 01:30:53,639
but there's other more complicated

2177
01:30:51,560 --> 01:30:54,520
reactions such as reaction two on the

2178
01:30:53,639 --> 01:30:57,040
left

2179
01:30:54,520 --> 01:31:01,080
which is converting metabolite e into

2180
01:30:57,040 --> 01:31:01,080
one J 1 c and 1

2181
01:31:01,679 --> 01:31:05,960
F all right I've described how we're

2182
01:31:04,159 --> 01:31:08,080
generating random matrices but now we

2183
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:10,840
can see how well we predict

2184
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:12,920
them shown here is the correlation

2185
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:15,080
between the simulation result for a

2186
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:16,679
specific random Network and our

2187
01:31:15,080 --> 01:31:17,840
predicted Collective mode for 20

2188
01:31:16,679 --> 01:31:20,520
different random

2189
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:22,119
networks as you can see we're generally

2190
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:25,920
able to predict the collective mode

2191
01:31:22,119 --> 01:31:25,920
quite well and with high accuracy

2192
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:30,400
this brings us to our fourth result The

2193
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:31,880
Selective pressure mathematical

2194
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:34,239
framework accurately predicts the

2195
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:34,239
collective

2196
01:31:35,119 --> 01:31:40,080
mode these are the main results that

2197
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:42,199
we've feel have we fleshed out decently

2198
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:45,040
well and that I wanted to share with you

2199
01:31:42,199 --> 01:31:46,840
today but we can also start to look at

2200
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:48,320
some of the more interesting scenarios

2201
01:31:46,840 --> 01:31:50,400
where we start to use some of these Gene

2202
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:51,920
rules and turn the complexity up a

2203
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:55,520
little

2204
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:57,560
bit this is the same tetk as before but

2205
01:31:55,520 --> 01:32:00,280
now we'll change what the genotype looks

2206
01:31:57,560 --> 01:32:03,920
like we'll still have a single Gene for

2207
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:06,920
reaction zero reaction two and reaction

2208
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:08,159
three however now we'll have two genes

2209
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:11,880
for reaction

2210
01:32:08,159 --> 01:32:14,440
one here the protein encoded by Gene a

2211
01:32:11,880 --> 01:32:16,920
can catalyze reaction one and the

2212
01:32:14,440 --> 01:32:19,280
protein encoded by Gene B can catalyze

2213
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:19,280
reaction

2214
01:32:19,320 --> 01:32:25,560
one we view this as the reaction one is

2215
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:27,880
able to use the capacity of Gene a or

2216
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:27,880
Gene

2217
01:32:30,639 --> 01:32:35,560
B this toy Network this second toy

2218
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:38,520
Network only differs from the original

2219
01:32:35,560 --> 01:32:39,719
toy Network at the genotypic level we

2220
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:40,960
can take a look at what that difference

2221
01:32:39,719 --> 01:32:42,719
is

2222
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:44,400
mathematically first we'll look at the

2223
01:32:42,719 --> 01:32:47,760
original toy Network which only had one

2224
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:50,400
gene for reaction one in that scenario G

2225
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:52,760
was the identity Matrix and there was a

2226
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:55,560
column for each gene and a row for each

2227
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:57,159
reaction

2228
01:32:55,560 --> 01:32:59,880
now let's look at this new to network

2229
01:32:57,159 --> 01:33:01,960
where we have two genes for reaction one

2230
01:32:59,880 --> 01:33:04,080
now G looks slightly

2231
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:06,600
different it looks a little bit like the

2232
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:09,000
identity Matrix but we have a new column

2233
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:10,199
which corresponds to the second Gene for

2234
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:12,880
reaction

2235
01:33:10,199 --> 01:33:15,280
one again the rows correspond to the

2236
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:15,280
individual

2237
01:33:16,040 --> 01:33:21,159
reactions one thing you might notice if

2238
01:33:18,639 --> 01:33:25,159
you look at these G matri's is that for

2239
01:33:21,159 --> 01:33:28,080
the one gene uh version

2240
01:33:25,159 --> 01:33:31,360
this G Matrix doesn't have a null

2241
01:33:28,080 --> 01:33:34,040
space however the second version does

2242
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:36,920
have a nonzero n space and that'll be a

2243
01:33:34,040 --> 01:33:36,920
little bit important

2244
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:41,600
later all right before when I ran we

2245
01:33:40,239 --> 01:33:43,639
looked at the toy Network I showed you

2246
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:45,320
that Evolution occurs and that there The

2247
01:33:43,639 --> 01:33:46,280
Selective pressure on individual genes

2248
01:33:45,320 --> 01:33:49,840
is highly

2249
01:33:46,280 --> 01:33:51,040
variable that is all true now still true

2250
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:52,600
uh and I can show you those results if

2251
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:55,119
you'd like but for right now we're just

2252
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:58,080
going to skip straight to the collect

2253
01:33:55,119 --> 01:34:01,159
mode as we saw before in the one gene

2254
01:33:58,080 --> 01:34:04,520
version uh for reaction One the relative

2255
01:34:01,159 --> 01:34:08,480
fluxes converge to 1 66 and then 33

2256
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:08,480
and33 for reactions two and

2257
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:14,639
three now we can look at the version

2258
01:34:12,360 --> 01:34:17,920
with two genes for reaction

2259
01:34:14,639 --> 01:34:19,560
one here we see the collective mode is

2260
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:23,960
one for reaction

2261
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:26,000
zero uh 08 for reaction one and point

2262
01:34:23,960 --> 01:34:28,560
two for reactions two and

2263
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:30,760
three just by making a cal change at the

2264
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:32,960
genotype level we see a shift in the

2265
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:35,520
collective

2266
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:37,880
mode some intuition for why we see this

2267
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:40,440
shift can be explained by thinking about

2268
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:42,920
how evolution is occurring now that

2269
01:34:40,440 --> 01:34:45,719
there are two genes that somehow control

2270
01:34:42,920 --> 01:34:47,639
the capacity of reaction one you can

2271
01:34:45,719 --> 01:34:49,560
think that it is easier for mutations to

2272
01:34:47,639 --> 01:34:51,880
accumulate along this reaction and

2273
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:54,360
increase the

2274
01:34:51,880 --> 01:34:56,280
capacity this causes a sh

2275
01:34:54,360 --> 01:34:58,320
in the collective mode increasing how

2276
01:34:56,280 --> 01:35:00,920
much reaction one is utilized compared

2277
01:34:58,320 --> 01:35:04,280
to reactions two and three instead of

2278
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:06,320
using uh reaction one for 66% of the

2279
01:35:04,280 --> 01:35:07,920
total flux of the network now we use it

2280
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:10,480
for

2281
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:14,520
80% and similarly reactions two and

2282
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:14,520
three must shift down in flux to

2283
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:20,080
accommodate another interesting feature

2284
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:22,159
of a network like this is that multiple

2285
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:24,280
genes and directions in gene space can

2286
01:35:22,159 --> 01:35:25,320
satisfy the constant and Max selective

2287
01:35:24,280 --> 01:35:27,440
pressure

2288
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:29,600
criteria so right now I'm showing you

2289
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:32,440
the selective pressure on the gene for

2290
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:34,040
reaction two but we can look at the

2291
01:35:32,440 --> 01:35:36,400
selective pressure on a few different

2292
01:35:34,040 --> 01:35:38,960
versions of the collective

2293
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:41,960
mode we can look at one scenario where

2294
01:35:38,960 --> 01:35:45,040
we only take steps using gene a here we

2295
01:35:41,960 --> 01:35:47,360
see again a constant selective pressure

2296
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:49,719
and I will tell you that it's

2297
01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:51,600
Max alternatively we can look at a

2298
01:35:49,719 --> 01:35:54,119
version of the collective mode where we

2299
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:55,679
only use Gene B

2300
01:35:54,119 --> 01:35:57,040
as you can see the selective pressure is

2301
01:35:55,679 --> 01:36:00,199
the

2302
01:35:57,040 --> 01:36:01,639
same importantly at the flux level as

2303
01:36:00,199 --> 01:36:04,679
shown by the little

2304
01:36:01,639 --> 01:36:06,920
diagrams we haven't changed what we see

2305
01:36:04,679 --> 01:36:09,719
the fluxes the relative fluxes are still

2306
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:12,480
at one point8 and 02 and 02 for

2307
01:36:09,719 --> 01:36:12,480
reactions two and

2308
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:17,600
three this adds some new Nuance to the

2309
01:36:15,239 --> 01:36:19,880
story before if you think about the

2310
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:22,320
stories we were talking about CLE cell

2311
01:36:19,880 --> 01:36:24,159
if we took a step along the collective

2312
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:25,920
mode at the genotype level we could

2313
01:36:24,159 --> 01:36:28,320
confidently say this would increase

2314
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:29,639
Fitness and cause evolution to enrich

2315
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:33,440
the collective

2316
01:36:29,639 --> 01:36:35,159
mode however now we have a wrinkle I

2317
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:36,480
could tell you one story where I say I'm

2318
01:36:35,159 --> 01:36:38,560
going to take a step along the

2319
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:40,880
collective mode using only

2320
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:42,360
G because this has constant maximal

2321
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:43,920
selective pressure on it we know that

2322
01:36:42,360 --> 01:36:45,880
this should be enriched in the

2323
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:47,560
population I could tell you a similar

2324
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:50,639
story by saying I'm only going to take

2325
01:36:47,560 --> 01:36:52,320
steps using Gene B again this has the

2326
01:36:50,639 --> 01:36:55,639
same and constant maximal selective

2327
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:57,960
pressure on it so this change should be

2328
01:36:55,639 --> 01:37:01,040
enriched in the

2329
01:36:57,960 --> 01:37:05,159
population in essence Evolution cannot

2330
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:05,159
tell the difference between genes A and

2331
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:13,040
B at the start of the talk we set out to

2332
01:37:10,520 --> 01:37:16,080
tell complicated stories about Evolution

2333
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:18,400
with complex genotype to phenotype

2334
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:19,880
Maps we've worked toward this in a few

2335
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:22,520
different

2336
01:37:19,880 --> 01:37:24,760
ways first we saw the selective pressure

2337
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:26,880
on individual genes is highly variable

2338
01:37:24,760 --> 01:37:29,440
throughout

2339
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:32,639
Evolution this complexity limited our

2340
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:35,159
ability to tell evolutionary stories um

2341
01:37:32,639 --> 01:37:36,679
about genotype to phenotype maps for

2342
01:37:35,159 --> 01:37:38,440
example we couldn't tell a simple story

2343
01:37:36,679 --> 01:37:40,480
like we did a CLE cell disease where

2344
01:37:38,440 --> 01:37:41,880
just by looking at one gene you were

2345
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:45,320
able to make a prediction about

2346
01:37:41,880 --> 01:37:47,679
enrichment of that Gene in the

2347
01:37:45,320 --> 01:37:49,400
genotype this point is furthered by the

2348
01:37:47,679 --> 01:37:51,719
Redundant genotype example we just

2349
01:37:49,400 --> 01:37:55,440
showed here there were two genes the

2350
01:37:51,719 --> 01:37:55,440
evolution couldn't even different differ

2351
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:00,360
iate let me emphasize this point

2352
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:02,119
Evolution doesn't appear to

2353
01:38:00,360 --> 01:38:04,480
differentiate between different patterns

2354
01:38:02,119 --> 01:38:06,239
of selection and mutations at the

2355
01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:08,840
genotypic

2356
01:38:06,239 --> 01:38:11,320
level genes may not be the natural

2357
01:38:08,840 --> 01:38:11,320
object of

2358
01:38:12,920 --> 01:38:16,239
selection as we saw the selective

2359
01:38:15,119 --> 01:38:18,480
pressure

2360
01:38:16,239 --> 01:38:19,880
varied however even though we had this

2361
01:38:18,480 --> 01:38:21,880
issue with Selective pressure varrying

2362
01:38:19,880 --> 01:38:24,360
on genes we saw that the simulation

2363
01:38:21,880 --> 01:38:27,159
still converged to a Ive mode when we

2364
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:27,159
looked at the relative

2365
01:38:27,960 --> 01:38:34,280
fluxes this led us to examine these and

2366
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:37,080
provided us ability to retell the story

2367
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:37,080
using the collective

2368
01:38:38,440 --> 01:38:42,199
mode we saw by looking at the selective

2369
01:38:40,719 --> 01:38:43,760
pressure on the collective mode that it

2370
01:38:42,199 --> 01:38:46,520
was

2371
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:49,280
constant this suggested along with the

2372
01:38:46,520 --> 01:38:51,040
maximal criteria that the collective

2373
01:38:49,280 --> 01:38:53,679
modes may be the natural objects of

2374
01:38:51,040 --> 01:38:55,040
selection

2375
01:38:53,679 --> 01:38:57,320
another way we can think about this

2376
01:38:55,040 --> 01:38:59,719
difference between selection on genes

2377
01:38:57,320 --> 01:39:02,000
and selection on Collective modes has to

2378
01:38:59,719 --> 01:39:06,960
do with

2379
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:06,960
uh the genes and when they are

2380
01:39:07,040 --> 01:39:11,880
active as selection occurs whether or

2381
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:14,400
not mutating a gene is favorable depends

2382
01:39:11,880 --> 01:39:16,360
on the current state of the system if

2383
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:18,280
one Gene and its capacity is rate

2384
01:39:16,360 --> 01:39:20,920
limiting the network mutating that Gene

2385
01:39:18,280 --> 01:39:23,520
might be beneficial however if a gene

2386
01:39:20,920 --> 01:39:25,920
and its bound isn't rate limiting the I

2387
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:29,520
olic fluxes then mutations there will

2388
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:32,239
have a minimal effect on the

2389
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:34,080
fitness so the selective pressure and

2390
01:39:32,239 --> 01:39:37,480
the Gen roles depends on the current

2391
01:39:34,080 --> 01:39:39,920
state of the system however we see that

2392
01:39:37,480 --> 01:39:41,599
the selective pressure excuse me the

2393
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:43,560
collective mode is invariant to the

2394
01:39:41,599 --> 01:39:45,239
current state of the system The

2395
01:39:43,560 --> 01:39:47,679
Selective pressure is constant as

2396
01:39:45,239 --> 01:39:50,080
Evolution

2397
01:39:47,679 --> 01:39:52,520
occurs the collective mode was useful to

2398
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:55,159
us with some wrinkles from the last

2399
01:39:52,520 --> 01:39:57,119
point I made about done in genotypes and

2400
01:39:55,159 --> 01:39:57,880
being able to recapture simple stories

2401
01:39:57,119 --> 01:40:00,320
about

2402
01:39:57,880 --> 01:40:02,040
Evolution if we take a step along the

2403
01:40:00,320 --> 01:40:04,360
direction of the collective mode at the

2404
01:40:02,040 --> 01:40:07,080
genotype level this will lead to a

2405
01:40:04,360 --> 01:40:11,000
maximal change in Fitness and it lead to

2406
01:40:07,080 --> 01:40:11,000
enrichment of the collective mode in the

2407
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:15,920
genotype finally we found we were able

2408
01:40:13,960 --> 01:40:17,719
to predict colletive mode using this

2409
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:19,840
criteria of constant and maximal

2410
01:40:17,719 --> 01:40:23,040
selective pressure and able to do so

2411
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:23,040
quite accurately

2412
01:40:24,119 --> 01:40:27,920
this idea of constant selective pressure

2413
01:40:25,719 --> 01:40:29,320
is an interesting one and could arise in

2414
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:31,800
other

2415
01:40:29,320 --> 01:40:33,480
scenarios ultimately it arises from

2416
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:35,320
having constraints on the genotype to

2417
01:40:33,480 --> 01:40:37,480
phenotype map here there were

2418
01:40:35,320 --> 01:40:39,280
constraints imposed by genes and

2419
01:40:37,480 --> 01:40:41,480
conservation of mass but one could

2420
01:40:39,280 --> 01:40:42,400
imagine that other constraints might

2421
01:40:41,480 --> 01:40:45,080
also

2422
01:40:42,400 --> 01:40:47,280
impose lead to the a collective mode

2423
01:40:45,080 --> 01:40:48,880
coming about for example other

2424
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:51,280
conservation laws might lead to a

2425
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:51,280
collective

2426
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:56,520
mode Beyond this as we told in this

2427
01:40:54,199 --> 01:40:58,719
project these results give some

2428
01:40:56,520 --> 01:40:59,760
intuition and maybe help explain

2429
01:40:58,719 --> 01:41:02,440
polygenic

2430
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:04,520
traits for example we know that there

2431
01:41:02,440 --> 01:41:06,880
are observations that predicting the

2432
01:41:04,520 --> 01:41:09,159
phenotype is easier than the genotype

2433
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:11,599
after multiple rounds of

2434
01:41:09,159 --> 01:41:13,000
selection selection on a collective mode

2435
01:41:11,599 --> 01:41:15,000
might help explain

2436
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:18,239
this additionally we can think about

2437
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:21,239
gwos studies of polygenic traits Define

2438
01:41:18,239 --> 01:41:23,440
many hits for a trait this might be the

2439
01:41:21,239 --> 01:41:26,280
result of selection on Collective mode

2440
01:41:23,440 --> 01:41:26,280
rather than individual

2441
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:31,440
genes currently we're continuing to

2442
01:41:29,080 --> 01:41:33,520
explore the role of the G Matrix and

2443
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:36,199
redundant genotypes and complicated Gene

2444
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:38,159
rules like this one and what effect that

2445
01:41:36,199 --> 01:41:39,800
has on the collective mode and

2446
01:41:38,159 --> 01:41:41,280
additionally we're starting to consider

2447
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:44,480
what role the environment might have on

2448
01:41:41,280 --> 01:41:47,320
the reflective mode if you limit One

2449
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:49,199
exchange reaction by removing a

2450
01:41:47,320 --> 01:41:53,159
metabolite from the environment how does

2451
01:41:49,199 --> 01:41:53,159
that change the deflective mode

2452
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:59,040
with that I'd like to thank everyone my

2453
01:41:55,599 --> 01:42:00,679
lab uh thank you to Brian and Fage who

2454
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:02,599
is not here but great gave a lot of good

2455
01:42:00,679 --> 01:42:04,320
feedback on the talk and then thank you

2456
01:42:02,599 --> 01:42:06,480
to Sarah who's an undergrad that's been

2457
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:10,639
working on this

2458
01:42:06,480 --> 01:42:10,639
project thank you
