1
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:17,680
Okay. So

2
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:22,000
um so right so we're going to prove the

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:24,800
picard lindel theorem and it may we'll

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,240
see it may take us

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:31,760
it may um we may need to continue on it

6
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:34,480
also on Tuesday and then when we're done

7
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:37,200
with it we will just do review on

8
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,879
Tuesday but let's see how far we get so

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,879
the picinder theorem

10
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:55,600
is the following theorem

11
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:57,440
and it say that uh it's it's a it's a OD

12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:01,239
so it's a what's called ordinary

13
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,239
differential equation Okay.

14
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:15,600
And so again a differential equation is

15
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,600
something about an unknown function and

16
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,560
its derivative. Right? So differential

17
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:24,920
equation just mean it's an equation. So

18
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,920
this here means that it's an equation

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,159
in an unknown function

20
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,000
uh and its derivative.

21
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:52,399
ordinary just as we talked about last

22
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:56,799
time ordinary refer to uh that is just

23
00:01:52,399 --> 00:02:00,479
of one variable. Okay. And so the OD

24
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:04,640
that the picard line theorem is about is

25
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:09,840
so the unknown function is y. And the od

26
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:12,560
is is this that we want the derivative

27
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:16,560
of this unknown function to be equal to

28
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:19,680
a function of the unknown function plus

29
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:23,200
another function that just depend on x.

30
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:27,920
So y here is the unknown function and y

31
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:30,800
is a function of x right x is x is a

32
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:34,000
real number

33
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,400
right and and it's just a yeah so this

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,840
is the differential equation and then we

35
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:45,599
have some initial condition so at zero

36
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:48,400
we want it to take a value a okay so

37
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:52,640
this is the differential equation and

38
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:56,800
what we assume Assume here is so f and g

39
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:58,480
are function on r

40
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,720
and you should think about those as

41
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,720
being known

42
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:08,920
and uh they are an f here is

43
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,920
differentiable

44
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:18,080
and the derivative

45
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,080
is continuous.

46
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:28,040
and G is just continuous

47
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,040
doesn't need to be differentiable

48
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:40,440
and the pal Lindel theorem is so the

49
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,440
again the pard Theorem

50
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:52,959
is the following

51
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:55,519
that given

52
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:59,280
uh given f

53
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:03,680
uh g as above

54
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:08,480
and sorry n a was this constant. It's

55
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,480
just a real number as above.

56
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,239
There exist

57
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:27,240
uh delta greater than zero.

58
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:27,240
Um um such that and and and a solution

59
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,759
why

60
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,759
defined on

61
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:49,759
the integral from minus delta to delta

62
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:53,199
and and solution y to uh the OD

63
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:56,960
right and so again meaning that is uh

64
00:04:53,199 --> 00:05:00,479
that is solution that means that at the

65
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:04,320
in at zero it takes value a and then is

66
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:06,720
satisfying that equation okay

67
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:09,039
and Moreover,

68
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,880
and I'll get back to that, but we won't,

69
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:15,880
you know, that's it's quite possible. I

70
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,880
won't get to that uh today. Moreover,

71
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:23,400
uh um solutions are unique.

72
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:36,720
Okay. And so, so right. So this is like

73
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,639
a standard problem in when you're

74
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,440
looking at differential equations. You

75
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,759
have a differential equation that may

76
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,880
describe something in nature and you

77
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,400
wonder does this uh equation have a

78
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:53,039
solution

79
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:55,600
and uh and if it has a solution or

80
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:58,880
solutions unique. Okay. So this is what

81
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:01,039
this answer in this case

82
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,800
and the interesting thing or part of the

83
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,600
interesting thing I mean so this is a

84
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,840
fundamental question u used all over

85
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:11,280
science and engineering and one of the

86
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:15,039
interesting things is that it's uses the

87
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:18,560
proof of this uses metric spaces and so

88
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:20,639
the proof is has been used you know

89
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,520
various version of the proof have been

90
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,360
used to prove existence

91
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,600
uh and uniqueness of various

92
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:32,199
differential equations.

93
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,199
So the pro the proof

94
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:41,479
uses

95
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,479
the theory of metric spaces

96
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,919
which is sort of surprising because it

97
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,919
seems to have nothing to do with metric

98
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,919
spaces.

99
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:55,840
And so it uses in particular the metric

100
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:58,880
space that it's using is

101
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:02,360
uh the continuous functions on some

102
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,360
interval here

103
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:07,759
right and on the space of continuous

104
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:13,599
function we have the metric that we

105
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:16,800
talked about the metric so if f and g

106
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:21,039
sorry f is so bad uh because it's the

107
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,639
and g also let's call it h1 H1 and H2.

108
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:26,479
Suppose that these are continuous

109
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:29,199
functions. H1 and H2

110
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:31,520
are continuous functions

111
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:34,479
on an interval

112
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:37,280
like this.

113
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:39,919
Then the distance is this that we have

114
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,759
considered various times. This is just a

115
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:47,039
maximum

116
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:53,360
uh over uh x in this interval here

117
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:56,080
of uh f of x of h1 sorry h1 of x minus

118
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,720
h2 of x and then the absolute value of

119
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:01,440
that right.

120
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,599
So this is the distance on the space of

121
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,919
continuous functions that we have looked

122
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:10,160
at a lot.

123
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:12,960
Okay. And it's actually not quite this

124
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:17,639
space as I mentioned last time. It's a

125
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,639
ball in this space that is using

126
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:24,000
right okay

127
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:27,120
so what do we need about this metric

128
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:32,640
space? So one thing we've proven

129
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:35,599
couple of lectures ago is that uh that

130
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:38,599
this this space here of continuous

131
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,599
functions

132
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:46,279
uh with this metric here

133
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,279
uh is cushy complete.

134
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:58,240
So we're going to use that. Okay,

135
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:02,880
another thing we're going to use is this

136
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:06,320
notion of contracting map. So, um

137
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:08,240
another tool

138
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,040
will

139
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:15,959
be that

140
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,959
of a contracting map.

141
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:26,959
And so but and remember

142
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,959
this is a number of lectures ago we

143
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,399
talked about a contracting map but we

144
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,160
need a more general notion of

145
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:35,200
contracting map because when we talked

146
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:39,040
about it we talked about a map from R

147
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:44,160
into R. Uh and then we use this notion

148
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:48,240
of contracting map to u uh in to finding

149
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:50,240
zeros with using Newton's method. Okay.

150
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,000
And but here we're going to use it for

151
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,680
something different and so we need a

152
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:59,640
more general notion. So suppose that so

153
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,640
uh contracting map.

154
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:06,000
So this is the general version

155
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:09,440
as opposed to uh the version that we

156
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:13,200
talked about already that was for for

157
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:16,200
the line for for R. So contracting map

158
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,200
sorry.

159
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,800
And so this is so you have a metric

160
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,880
space XD. This is you know could be like

161
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,279
this but it also just could be any

162
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,680
metric space.

163
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:31,360
And then you have a map from this metric

164
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,320
space

165
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:38,160
into the self.

166
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:41,160
And T here is set to be T is set to be

167
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,160
contracting.

168
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,160
uh if there exist

169
00:10:53,680 --> 00:11:02,320
uh a constant C less than one such that

170
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:05,120
if you're looking at the distance

171
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:08,240
between the images

172
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,480
then they are squeezed together. So this

173
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:14,640
distance here between the images under

174
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:17,920
the map is less or equal to

175
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:20,240
this constant that is less than one

176
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:23,040
times the distance before you apply the

177
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:27,200
map. Right? So this means that under the

178
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:30,399
map sinks get closer together. Right?

179
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:34,000
So that's a contracting map.

180
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:37,440
And so now we proved a theorem when we

181
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:41,519
did the new measuring we proved a

182
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:43,760
theorem but we needed a about fix points

183
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:48,320
and we need a generalized version of

184
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:50,000
that. So um so if you take a map just in

185
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,360
general

186
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,240
from a space to a space then a fixed

187
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:59,800
point

188
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,800
a fixed point

189
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,560
is uh a point

190
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:13,120
x in the space

191
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,240
so that t of x

192
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:20,800
so t leaves X invariance. So T of X is

193
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:23,519
equal to X. That's a fixed point, right?

194
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:26,399
Okay. And so now if you have a

195
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:30,760
contracting map, so if

196
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,760
if T here is contracting,

197
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:41,639
then

198
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,639
T can have at most one fix point.

199
00:12:53,920 --> 00:13:04,200
Why? Because suppose that X so if

200
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:04,200
if X and Y are both fixed points.

201
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:16,959
Well, then you have that g of x

202
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:22,000
is equal to g of y. Sorry, g of x is

203
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:23,680
equal to tox and t of y is equal to one.

204
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,800
Right?

205
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:30,760
And so now you have that the distance

206
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,760
between t of x

207
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:38,160
uh let me make make a little more space.

208
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:41,839
Then you have that the actually we just

209
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:44,320
continue down here. So that the distance

210
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:47,200
between t of x

211
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:50,399
comma t of y

212
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:54,240
the map is contracting. So this is less

213
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:56,480
or equal to this constant times

214
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,120
this here. On the other hand they're

215
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,920
both fixed points. So t of x is x. This

216
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:05,920
here is x and this here is y. So if we

217
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:08,320
write this out so this is x comma y. And

218
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,800
so you see that this thing here is some

219
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,760
constant less than one strictly less

220
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:16,639
than one times itself. So this means of

221
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:19,760
course that this number here this non-

222
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:23,839
negative number must be zero. And so

223
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:26,959
this of course implies by the

224
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:31,199
actions of a metric space that X is

225
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:35,440
equal to Y. Right? So a contracting map

226
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:38,399
has at most one fixed point.

227
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:42,160
Now the other thing is that if you take

228
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:46,600
a metric space

229
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,600
um if you take a metric space

230
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:56,079
right so this here is cushy complete so

231
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:58,800
now I'm going to take a cushy complete

232
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:00,959
metric space so it could be continuous

233
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,600
function on some closed interval and

234
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:06,079
that's how we will apply it but it works

235
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,079
more generally

236
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:13,160
So we have a fin.

237
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,160
So if

238
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:20,199
if this here is a complete cushy

239
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:20,199
complete

240
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,639
metric space

241
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,399
uh and t

242
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:44,279
from x into x

243
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:44,279
is Yeah. Uh contracting map

244
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,480
then

245
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:58,000
t

246
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:00,959
has a unique fixed bot. We know it only

247
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,959
have it have at most one. So the

248
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:10,040
statement really is that that it has one

249
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:10,040
right? has a unique fix point.

250
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:19,320
Okay. So,

251
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:19,320
so let's try to prove this.

252
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:25,920
And you might remember and if you don't

253
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,880
that's fine but you might remember how

254
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:31,600
we used it in the new methods because

255
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:35,279
the new methods was like it was a

256
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:38,959
version of this on a

257
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:40,959
So you had a map from R to R and to find

258
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:42,959
the fixed point and so you wondered what

259
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:45,279
you were there and you knew the message

260
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:47,839
was something about finding a point

261
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:49,920
where a function vanishes, right? And

262
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,959
that was set up as a fixed point

263
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:56,240
theorem. And so what you did is you made

264
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:59,040
a good choice. I mean a choice that look

265
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:01,440
reasonable, right? This is not exactly

266
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,120
where the function vanishes, but

267
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,720
something that looks close to where it

268
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:09,760
vanish. And then you iterate, you took

269
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,520
the image under the map and you iterated

270
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:15,520
this. And so it's the same we're going

271
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:18,640
to do here. So, and this time we we we

272
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:23,520
don't even need to make a good choice.

273
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:27,600
So, we just take um we just take let

274
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:29,520
x here be any point in the metric space.

275
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,600
So, you're just fixing some point in the

276
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,679
metric space.

277
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:38,480
And now you're looking at so you're

278
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:41,440
looking at the sequence x t of x

279
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:44,160
and then you apply t to t of x. So this

280
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:47,679
is I write this as this. Then you apply

281
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:50,720
t to t squared of x. So that's right

282
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:53,919
like this. And so you keep applying t

283
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:56,880
more and more times.

284
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:59,440
Right? And so this gives you a sequence

285
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:02,480
and so on. So this gives you a sequence.

286
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:06,919
Okay? And now the claim is that this

287
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,919
sequence here. So claim

288
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:13,320
that this sequence here

289
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,320
converge

290
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:20,960
to right. So it converge and the limit

291
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:24,760
here this here

292
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,760
is a fixed point

293
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:34,640
for G. So that's a claim. Okay.

294
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:37,640
[Applause]

295
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,640
Now,

296
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:43,480
so we wanted to prove first that is

297
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,480
converging.

298
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:56,840
Okay. So we're going to prove first. So

299
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,840
we first show

300
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:10,360
that TN

301
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,360
is a cushy sequence.

302
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:20,960
Okay. So now let's look at um so we're

303
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:22,880
supposed to look if you're looking at a

304
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,120
if you try to prove that something is a

305
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:28,320
cruise sequence then you're looking at

306
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:31,120
the distance between

307
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:33,840
elements in the sequence

308
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:36,559
where both of these elements is

309
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:39,280
sufficiently far right that's what

310
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:43,039
you're supposed to look at

311
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:45,120
and so let me write the m here so I can

312
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:47,120
sing about one of them as being further

313
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:50,320
out than the other one. So I'm going to

314
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:55,280
think about m here as being n plus some

315
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:58,400
number k, right? Some integer k, right?

316
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:03,200
And so I'm interested in estimating the

317
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:07,120
distance between tn of x

318
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:10,360
and t n + k

319
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,360
of x.

320
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,880
Okay.

321
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:18,559
Now

322
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:20,799
in order to do that let me start with

323
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:23,520
something

324
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:26,960
simpler first.

325
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:30,799
Let me look at the distance

326
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:35,200
between T of X

327
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:37,520
uh let me look at the distance between T

328
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,559
um

329
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:46,480
L of X

330
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:49,679
and T L + one of X.

331
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:54,080
Okay. So two consecutive elements in the

332
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:57,919
sequence. Okay. Now I can sing it. So

333
00:20:54,080 --> 00:21:02,480
this thing here well this is equal to

334
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:05,440
the distance between t of t

335
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:08,080
uh l -1

336
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:14,799
of x

337
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:16,400
and then uh t of g l of of x like that.

338
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:21,360
Right?

339
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:23,840
I can write it like that. Right? I just

340
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:27,200
But now of course, so you see here

341
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:31,360
there's some elements in X in the spa

342
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:34,080
space X. Here's another element.

343
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:37,280
They both have T applied to it. T is

344
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:41,520
contracting. So you get C

345
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:44,159
T L minus one X

346
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:47,240
uh TL

347
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,240
of X.

348
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:53,200
So you see that if you take two

349
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:57,440
consecutive elements and you're taking

350
00:21:53,200 --> 00:22:01,120
the distance then it's bounded by

351
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:03,919
this constant C times right where you

352
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:06,720
have one less uh where you have have

353
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:08,720
have applied t one less time on both

354
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,840
right these are again consecutive

355
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:14,480
elements but but the highest one is one

356
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:19,480
less right

357
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,480
okay so now if you iterate this

358
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:32,000
uh okay so iterating this so let's see

359
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,880
maybe maybe okay maybe let me wait with

360
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:39,360
iterating let me just look at at what we

361
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:44,159
need so we have this in here

362
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:48,720
and this here I can write as as um so

363
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:53,919
here you see here I can write this as t

364
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:55,520
the distance t and then t n minus one

365
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,760
x

366
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:02,240
and then t

367
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:10,000
t n -1 + k

368
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:12,799
x like this right and so here I can

369
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:22,640
use the same trick that it get c and

370
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:27,240
then d t n minus 1 x comma t n -1 + k

371
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:27,240
of x right

372
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:35,200
and this one here I can keep going like

373
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:39,840
this right I can keep going until

374
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:42,720
there is the I' I've used up all my ends

375
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:46,000
right and so I can keep going and so

376
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:50,720
this is lesser equal to c to the n and

377
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:53,919
then the last one I get is I get x

378
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:56,880
and then I get t k

379
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:59,880
of x

380
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,880
right

381
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:08,720
I want to show that this thing here

382
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:11,200
becomes small as long as n remember k is

383
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:14,480
a positive integer as long as n is

384
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:17,200
sufficiently large right so I need but

385
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:19,440
this. So this is a hopeful sign because

386
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,679
when n get large this here get really

387
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,880
really small right but I still need to

388
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:27,039
estimate this here right now. So how do

389
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,720
I estimate it? I using what I did over

390
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:35,880
here.

391
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:35,880
So I um so you're looking at

392
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:45,760
so you have the distance

393
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:45,760
between x and t k of x

394
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:51,279
This thing here I can use this triangle

395
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:53,679
inequality. So I can say that this is

396
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:56,000
less than dx

397
00:24:53,679 --> 00:25:00,960
t of x

398
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:04,080
plus d t of x

399
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:06,720
g ^2 of x

400
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:10,799
plus

401
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:13,919
d t of x,

402
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:16,799
you know, like cube of x. and then all

403
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:18,320
the way up to

404
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:22,559
d

405
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:26,240
t k minus one of x

406
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:30,320
t k of x right so this is just a

407
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:32,640
triangle inequality right

408
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:37,279
now this may seems ra rather bad

409
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:40,320
estimate but let's see how bad it is so

410
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:42,240
uh right so now this first thing here

411
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,640
I'm just leaving it I can't do anything

412
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:48,640
about that so

413
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:50,960
I need to just take that this one here.

414
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,840
So I'm using this with between two

415
00:25:50,960 --> 00:26:01,200
consecutive. So in this case it's just

416
00:25:53,840 --> 00:26:04,880
bounded by C * D X

417
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:12,400
right and the next one here

418
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:16,480
this one here is bounded by C ^ 2 D X GX

419
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:19,200
and then and the next right and so on up

420
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:25,760
to this one here

421
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:31,360
is bounded by uh C K - one

422
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:34,880
uh D X T X

423
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:38,000
right and so you see that now this here

424
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:41,400
factor out so this here is so this

425
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,400
factor out

426
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:51,919
and then in this bracket you get 1 + C +

427
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:54,960
C^ 2 plus all the way up to C K minus

428
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:58,400
But this is a geometric series right

429
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:02,080
this is a geometric series and this is

430
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:04,640
certainly less than when I take remember

431
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,480
C is strictly less than one so it's a

432
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:09,120
geometric series it's a convergent

433
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:15,600
geometric series so this here is less

434
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:17,360
than d xt of x and then this sum well

435
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,159
it's less than when you're summing it

436
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:23,039
all the way to infinity so this is less

437
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:25,279
than one. This is the sum of the

438
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:27,440
geometric series. C is strictly less

439
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:29,440
than one,

440
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,400
right? C is positive and is strictly

441
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:38,159
less than one.

442
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:41,440
Okay? So you see now that we have

443
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:43,279
right so we have that so what we were

444
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,919
interested in is we were interested in

445
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:48,159
saying that as long as I choose little

446
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:51,840
and sufficiently large then this thing

447
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:53,760
here must be very small. Right?

448
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:56,880
And we know already that it's bounded

449
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:58,799
like this. And now I fill in this and

450
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:02,559
you see this here. So this means that

451
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:09,039
this is less than cn. And then what you

452
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:12,960
get here is uh 1 minus c and then times

453
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:16,000
d x g of x,

454
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:19,039
right? x is fixed.

455
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,200
And so you see that when n little n is

456
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:24,559
sufficiently large then this whole thing

457
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:27,360
here is as small as you want. Right? So

458
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:31,200
this means that what we have proven here

459
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:35,080
is that this sequence here

460
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,080
is a cushy sequence.

461
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:45,200
So we've proven that. Okay.

462
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:47,679
Now of course this is where the

463
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:51,120
assumption comes in that this metric

464
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:56,360
space is cushy complete

465
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:56,360
right. So, so uh since

466
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:02,919
x this metric space is cushy complete

467
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,640
and this sequence here

468
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:19,039
is a cushy sequence.

469
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,559
It is convergent,

470
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:35,039
>> right? Yeah.

471
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,760
>> I'm sorry.

472
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,840
>> Yep.

473
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:40,840
>> Are you able to explain again how we got

474
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,840
that

475
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,880
for the DXDX or we're just saying that

476
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:52,559
>> right? So I'm saying that X is fixed.

477
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:56,159
You you pick any point you want. And I

478
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:58,240
claim that if I you know it may be a

479
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:00,799
very bad candidate for the fixed point,

480
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,720
but it doesn't matter. It's okay. Uh it

481
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:05,600
may just take you longer to get to the

482
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:08,720
fixed point, but you fix X and then

483
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:12,000
you're looking at this sequence

484
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:15,919
and then I claim that this sequence will

485
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:19,200
be a cushy sequence, right? And so x is

486
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:23,520
fixed. And so we have this inequality

487
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:26,640
here. And what we need is that when

488
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:30,080
little n is sufficiently far, you know,

489
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:31,919
large, then for all k is positive

490
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:35,679
integer, right? This here is like

491
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:38,159
further out than n. Then for all k and

492
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:40,159
it should be independent on k. This

493
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:42,080
thing here is small. But this is

494
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,799
>> get rid of the whole thing from the

495
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:46,320
previous step was now not a TK of X,

496
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:51,039
right? So,

497
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:54,159
>> so so so since X is fixed,

498
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:56,320
X is fixed, TX is fixed.

499
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:59,320
>> So, this is just a constant.

500
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,320
>> Yeah.

501
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:06,720
Okay. So um right so what we have proven

502
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:09,760
is that so we have so we have this koshi

503
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:12,880
complete metric space and we have this

504
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:15,679
sequence x was fixed again that is a

505
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:18,000
cush sequence and so since this metric

506
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:23,200
space is cush complete this is

507
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:26,399
convergent and I can denote the limits

508
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:30,279
so I just call the limits x infinity

509
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:30,279
right so if you have is

510
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:38,840
now I want to show that uh that uh so so

511
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:38,840
the next claim is

512
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:48,519
is that x infinity is a fixed point

513
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,640
for for g

514
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:59,039
okay okay

515
00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:01,440
so if I'm looking at this sequence here.

516
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:06,120
Suppose I take this sequence and suppose

517
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:06,120
I take T of this sequence.

518
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:14,799
So if I take T of this sequence, this

519
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:17,440
here is nothing but the next element in

520
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:21,120
the sequence.

521
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:23,440
So this one here will still converge to

522
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:27,519
X infinit,

523
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:29,840
right? Because it's just shifted by one.

524
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:32,000
But then on the other hand, so now if

525
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:36,480
you're looking at

526
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:39,600
um at so so you have that if you're

527
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:44,240
looking at t so you want to we want to

528
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:47,039
prove that um

529
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:51,360
right so now uh so now if we're looking

530
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:54,640
at t of x infinity

531
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:57,640
the distance between t of x infinity

532
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,640
and

533
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:01,919
and

534
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:04,640
uh and t

535
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:06,559
uh n + one

536
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:10,240
of x suppose I'm looking at this

537
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:14,000
distance here right well this here I can

538
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:20,640
think about as the distance between t of

539
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:23,519
x infinity and t of tn of x

540
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:25,440
but here there are now both of these

541
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:28,880
element you can about this is just some

542
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:32,080
element applied t to it. Here there's t

543
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:34,159
applied to that. So this is less than

544
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:39,120
the distance

545
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:41,760
x infinity to t n. There's a constant c

546
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:44,720
less than one in front.

547
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:49,679
So like this

548
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:54,159
right by the contracting map property.

549
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:57,760
But now you see that as n go to infinity

550
00:33:54,159 --> 00:34:00,720
this thing here goes to zero. Right? So

551
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:03,600
this means that this thing here

552
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:08,440
converts to this point.

553
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:08,440
Right? So you have that.

554
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,760
So you have that

555
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:29,200
you have that that if you're looking at

556
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:30,960
uh if you're looking at um right again

557
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:34,000
as

558
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:37,440
as n go to

559
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:40,399
as n go to infinity

560
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:46,320
uh Since

561
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:48,480
since tn of x converts to x infinity

562
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:52,079
then we have that the distance this is

563
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:54,399
equivalent to that the distance

564
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:57,680
here

565
00:34:54,399 --> 00:35:00,720
goes to zero. And then by this

566
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:02,560
inequality it means that the distance

567
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:06,440
here

568
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,440
tx infinity

569
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:15,760
and t n + one of x goes to zero right

570
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:17,520
and so this means that this is just some

571
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:20,079
fixed point. It means that this sequence

572
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:23,079
here, so this implies that this sequence

573
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:23,079
here

574
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:31,520
converge to t of x infinity, right? But

575
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:35,119
on the other hand, we already observe

576
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:39,119
that this sequence also converge

577
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:42,000
to x infinity, right? But you can't can

578
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:44,480
you know there's the so it converges to

579
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,320
this and it converts to that, but it can

580
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:49,440
only have one limit. So those two things

581
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:53,440
are equal. So you conclude that x

582
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:56,160
infinity is equal to g of x infinity and

583
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:59,800
so x infinity

584
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,800
is a fixed point.

585
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:08,560
Right? So this proved this theorem. And

586
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:12,400
again we already knew that the limit was

587
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:16,400
uh was unique. Right?

588
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:20,640
Okay. So now what how is this related to

589
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:23,359
the picar linda lift theorem

590
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:25,520
and so it's related in the following way

591
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:27,520
and again this is uh something that have

592
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:29,440
been used to solve a lot of differential

593
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:32,440
equations

594
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,440
um

595
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,680
and so we need to define space and a

596
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,720
map.

597
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:47,760
the spaces initially but we have to

598
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:53,400
restrict it but initially let's think

599
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:53,400
about some continuous functions

600
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:59,119
on some interval

601
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:01,359
let's start with just continuous

602
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:04,000
function but it's not quite going to be

603
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:07,480
this space I will have to look at a

604
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,480
smaller yeah

605
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:18,079
Right. That's a good question. So, so

606
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:23,200
that's right. So, this comes with this

607
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:26,880
Newton method. So, we used the so we

608
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:30,720
used this contracting mapping for R in

609
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:32,560
the Newton method to find a zero. Okay.

610
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:35,680
And to some I mean that was a great

611
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:38,720
idea. Uh Newton was a pretty famous guy

612
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:41,119
for a good reason. uh but in a way this

613
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,800
is more ingenious I think because it's

614
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:44,480
like you know metric space what the hell

615
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,960
does this have to do with differential

616
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:50,160
equation right but and the reason why in

617
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:52,640
the other one we had to restrict it was

618
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:55,440
that the map we defined wasn't

619
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:59,200
contracting everywhere it needed sinks

620
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:02,160
to be pretty close initially for for

621
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:04,800
there to exist a c strictly less than

622
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:07,040
one right so that's where I came in it

623
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:11,320
wasn't really it wasn't really because

624
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:11,320
in in N or if Yeah.

625
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:16,240
Okay.

626
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,920
So now again so so we need to relate

627
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,520
this that seems to have nothing to do

628
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:22,000
with differential equation. We need to

629
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:24,880
relate it to the differential equation.

630
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,280
So again what is the space the metric

631
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:29,440
space that we're going to look at and

632
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:34,400
again it's not exactly this but it's

633
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:36,640
just a subset of it. So, so, so, so it's

634
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,800
it's this space and with the usual

635
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:42,720
metric that we have talked about, right?

636
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:46,000
That is going to be the

637
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:49,839
the metric space.

638
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:53,839
Now, what is the map T?

639
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:57,359
And so the map t is so t here

640
00:38:53,839 --> 00:39:00,920
um so t here is going to be a map from

641
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:00,920
continuous functions

642
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:07,800
uh into the space of continuous

643
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,800
functions

644
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,839
and it's going to be defined

645
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
um as follow

646
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:22,800
and if yeah I'll come to this in a

647
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:24,960
second so uh t of x t of y. So y think

648
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:29,040
about y as being a continuous function

649
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:34,079
on this integral, right? And t of y is

650
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:38,000
now equal to uh a plus and then the

651
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:41,680
integral in and then right

652
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:46,320
then the inte uh integral. So this is a

653
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:48,240
so t of y is of an element here. This

654
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:51,200
one here is also supposed to be an

655
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:53,520
element here. So this is a function.

656
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:58,720
So we want to find out what the value is

657
00:39:53,520 --> 00:40:02,640
at x. And it's a this constant a plus

658
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:08,560
the integral from zero to x

659
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:13,200
uh and then of f of uh y

660
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:15,920
uh plus uh g of x

661
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:18,560
and this here is a function of x right

662
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:20,960
also it's like this

663
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:23,280
uh and I shouldn't write x because I use

664
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:26,160
now x up here

665
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:28,720
so I write it like DF

666
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:30,640
okay that's how the map is going to be

667
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:35,760
defined

668
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:39,280
so again if you take so y here so y is

669
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:41,440
going so y is a continuous function on

670
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,760
this interval

671
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:46,560
and I will have to restrict it and this

672
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:49,280
is exactly when you asking what you know

673
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:52,000
in Newton methods right why why did we

674
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:55,520
have to pick this good choice it's

675
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:57,920
exactly like this that it's this map is

676
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:00,720
not contracting on this whole space.

677
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:03,359
Okay. So we have to in a way we have to

678
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:05,200
do the same stuff. We have to make a

679
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:07,839
good choice first and so that's why we

680
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:10,640
have to restrict the space. Okay. And it

681
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:13,119
actually is I mean it's part of the

682
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:15,520
beauty is that it's pretty much optimal

683
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:18,800
this stuff this sort of general

684
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:21,760
principle uh we can come back to that.

685
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,760
So this is the map t.

686
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,760
And so the first thing that you observe

687
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:29,839
is

688
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:32,319
that t. So this gives you a this

689
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:35,200
function here.

690
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:37,920
Right? Remember that. So if y is

691
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:41,200
continuous,

692
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:42,960
g is continuous. If y is continuous, f

693
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:45,359
is continuous. Everything here is

694
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:48,640
continuous. And so this means that by

695
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:50,800
the fundamental theorem of calculus this

696
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:54,480
function here is actually even

697
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:56,880
differentiable right and the derivative

698
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:59,440
this is just a constant so this function

699
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,760
here is differentiable

700
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:04,960
let alone continuous so it's definitely

701
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:07,119
in the space and the derivative of this

702
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,880
map

703
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:11,880
by the fundamental theorem of calculus

704
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,880
This

705
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,920
uh

706
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,800
so by the fundamental of calculus the

707
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:31,880
derivative is just what is inside here.

708
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:31,880
So this is just f of y

709
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:41,040
plus g of x right and if you want to

710
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:44,040
write x in then it should be like this

711
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,040
right

712
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:52,960
so that's so and then one more thing you

713
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:54,720
observe which is also immediate that if

714
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:57,119
you take

715
00:42:54,720 --> 00:43:00,160
a continuous function like this and now

716
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:04,319
you evaluate this now you evaluate this

717
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:07,280
at zero right if x is zero but then this

718
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:09,680
integral it's over just a point so this

719
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:12,240
here is zero so this means that the

720
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:15,839
value here is a

721
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:20,400
right okay

722
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:23,400
and so now the next thing you observe is

723
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,400
that

724
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:41,440
So the next thing we observe is that um

725
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,359
that if uh if you have a fixed point so

726
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,960
if

727
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:48,880
I mean I think this is another nice

728
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:51,280
thing is that you know that the way it's

729
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:53,520
set up is that you just need to use

730
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:56,000
continuous functions.

731
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:58,960
Right. But of course, if you want a

732
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:03,480
solution to this, it means that the

733
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:03,480
function must have a derivative. Yeah.

734
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Yeah. We don't know that yet. I mean,

735
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,680
that's a major point actually, right?

736
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,160
And again, just like in the Newton

737
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:15,119
methods, we have to restrict where we're

738
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:16,800
looking at it. Yeah. Okay. So but but

739
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:18,480
the first thing I want to observe is

740
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:24,760
that

741
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:24,760
if uh if y is a fixed point

742
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:32,319
well then t of y

743
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:33,920
is equal to y and so what does this

744
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:36,960
mean?

745
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:40,160
Well, the derivative. So it means that

746
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:42,079
if this is the case,

747
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:47,200
right?

748
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:49,520
Then we have that t of y is of this

749
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:51,839
form. So it has a derivative and that

750
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:54,079
derivative is this. Right? So this means

751
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:56,880
that y would have it because y is equal

752
00:44:54,079 --> 00:45:02,280
to this. So y is differentiable

753
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:02,280
and the derivative is equal to this.

754
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:10,480
And we always have whether it's a fixed

755
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:12,400
point or not. We always have that t y of

756
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:16,079
zero

757
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:20,160
is is a and since it is a fixed point

758
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:23,119
this is also this. So you see that if it

759
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:27,839
is a fixed point then it is a solution

760
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:31,760
to the differential equation. Okay.

761
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:35,760
Now then then the the the point comes in

762
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:39,119
the key point comes in with um

763
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:42,119
proving that the map is contracting.

764
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:42,119
Okay.

765
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,200
Okay.

766
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:13,480
And so so now so we need to prove

767
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,480
need to show

768
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:21,800
that t

769
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:21,800
is a contracting map.

770
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:28,040
Okay.

771
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:36,640
So

772
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:39,040
I define so set I I I I have to define a

773
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:41,520
number of things because again I have to

774
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:43,440
it's not t is not going to be

775
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:46,000
contracting on the space of continuous

776
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:48,480
function. So I have to look at some

777
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,119
subset of continuous function and the

778
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:54,800
right subset is just a ball. It's a

779
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:57,920
closed ball. So it's so

780
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:59,920
it's going to be so so

781
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:02,400
we're going to maybe I'll just say first

782
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:06,480
that we're going to restrict

783
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:10,000
uh t. So t here will be restricted now

784
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:12,720
to we will think about it as a map on

785
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:15,200
some ball

786
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:18,400
into itself.

787
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:21,920
But it's not at all clear that this map

788
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:24,560
takes a ball into itself. Okay. And what

789
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:27,599
do I mean by ball? So I have this bar up

790
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:30,599
here. So I just means that this thing

791
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:30,599
here

792
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:40,359
is going to be the function y that is

793
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:40,359
continuous. Sorry continuous.

794
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:46,319
And then it's not quite going to be this

795
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:49,359
either. I have to restrict but I'll get

796
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:50,720
to this in a second. So at the moment

797
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:53,760
you can think about it as being

798
00:47:50,720 --> 00:48:00,160
continuous function on the interval so

799
00:47:53,760 --> 00:48:03,200
that the norm of y at each point x

800
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:07,920
is less or equal to r

801
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:11,359
and this bar here refer to that lesser

802
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:14,319
that equal is also allowed. Right? Now

803
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:16,560
this here is really like the board right

804
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:19,760
these are are functions if you're

805
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:22,240
thinking about the function in the space

806
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:25,760
of continuous function that is constant

807
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:28,960
zero right then these are the functions

808
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:32,559
whose distance this is the same as the

809
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:35,599
space of continuous functions

810
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:40,920
whose distance to the constant function

811
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:40,920
zero is at most uh

812
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,079
this is the zero function is less or

813
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:49,359
equal to sorry this is getting a little

814
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:52,720
small over here

815
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:56,480
right so it's just

816
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:58,559
okay and again it's not it's going to be

817
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:01,599
I will have to restrict the interval

818
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:04,760
here to make to make sure that the map

819
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:04,760
is contracted

820
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:12,480
so but first I want to define and this

821
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:15,920
radius here. Okay. And so the radius is

822
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:18,559
so I'm setting r here equal a was just a

823
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:22,680
constant. I take the absolute value of a

824
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:22,680
and I add two to it.

825
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:29,680
Then I define two other yeah and there's

826
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:32,160
no way around it. Uh you have to define

827
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:35,720
we will require to define several

828
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:35,720
constants. First

829
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:43,520
L1 capital L1 is going to be another

830
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:47,760
constant. It's going to be the maximum

831
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:52,800
and then you take uh then you take of

832
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:57,119
over set where set here is less than R

833
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:59,680
and then you take the value

834
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:03,440
like this.

835
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:07,680
Okay, remember f is continuous.

836
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:11,760
So if I looking at where the norm of x

837
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:14,640
is less or equal to some constant

838
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:17,119
then this the maximum is achieved on

839
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:19,760
this. So this a

840
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:23,359
just some real number positive real non-

841
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:29,200
negative non- negative real number

842
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:31,839
and then I define L2 to be the maximum

843
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:36,800
of

844
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:39,920
where I of maximum on the unit ball here

845
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:42,720
and where norm of X is less than one of

846
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:45,680
G of X

847
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:48,319
like there.

848
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:50,240
Okay.

849
00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:53,520
And now

850
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:56,960
what I want to do is

851
00:50:53,520 --> 00:51:00,520
so the first step is so the first step

852
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:00,520
is the following.

853
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:14,000
So first first step

854
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:20,480
And the proof

855
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:23,480
uh is to prove the following that there

856
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,480
exist

857
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:26,839
there exist

858
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:37,119
uh uh uh delta zero. This is not the

859
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:39,440
delta that I will use eventually. Um I

860
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:42,240
would have to restrict it further. There

861
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:47,119
exist delta serum. So that if you're

862
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:50,559
looking at the space if y here

863
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:54,520
is in the space of continuous functions

864
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:54,520
on this interval here

865
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:10,720
then t of y sorry if y is in this here

866
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:14,720
and y is in the unit form

867
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:17,920
and not in the uniform that y here is

868
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:19,760
lesser equal to r

869
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:22,559
right so it's a continuous function on

870
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:25,119
this interval and the norm is lesser

871
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:28,079
equal to r so this means that so this is

872
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:30,720
of course the same as saying that y is

873
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:33,359
in this ball here

874
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:36,000
uh when I'm now thinking about this as a

875
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:39,599
space but you can forget about that if

876
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,599
you want it's the

877
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:48,559
Okay. But I and I want to show that t of

878
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:51,359
y is in the same space, right? So I need

879
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:53,839
so t of y.

880
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:56,400
So I need so I want to show so want to

881
00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:59,960
show

882
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:59,960
want to show

883
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:07,359
that t of y

884
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:10,800
at each x

885
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:14,000
here the norm is lesser equal to one

886
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:16,800
right then it if I have that I already

887
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,880
know that this function t of y is

888
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:21,680
continuous it's it's actually even

889
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:23,839
differentiable right But it's in

890
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:26,800
particular continuous.

891
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:31,720
And if I have this then I know that this

892
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:31,720
space is taking into itself. Right?

893
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:37,440
Okay.

894
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:41,359
So now how do I do that?

895
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:44,400
So I I that's where I need to restrict

896
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:47,520
the interval that I'm looking on and and

897
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:50,400
again we'll come back to it but there's

898
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:52,319
a good reason to rest that we have to

899
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:56,040
restrict otherwise it couldn't be

900
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:56,040
possibly be true.

901
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:01,040
>> Yeah. to be contracting. Do we need it

902
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:05,200
strictly less than?

903
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:08,000
>> So remember contracting means that there

904
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:11,280
exist a constant C strictly less than

905
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:14,000
one. This here had nothing to do with a

906
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:16,400
constant C. This here is just the space

907
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:20,400
that we're looking at the map on. Okay.

908
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:23,200
So, so, so and the reason why I make

909
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:25,280
here. So, again, so this have nothing to

910
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:28,559
do with that C. But the reason why I

911
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:33,599
want this lesser equal to is that I want

912
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:36,319
to have that the space is C complete.

913
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:41,119
Okay, sorry. So, let me just try to make

914
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:44,000
that clear. So I take I have a to get a

915
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:46,240
fix point for a contracting map you need

916
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,400
a space that is cushy complete right

917
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:51,760
that when we prove this for the metric

918
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:53,359
space we have a good candidate right we

919
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:55,119
have the candidate of continuous

920
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:57,760
functions

921
00:54:55,119 --> 00:55:00,160
on some closed interval like this right

922
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:02,640
this is cushy complete right with a

923
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:05,119
usual metric but I'm not going to look

924
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:07,520
at that space because my map is not

925
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:10,720
actually contracting on the case it's

926
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:13,920
contracting on a subset right and so I

927
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:15,920
need that subset so so so in the end I

928
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:19,280
sort of you know I'm not working on this

929
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:23,280
but I'm working on a subset right and I

930
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:25,440
need that subset to be complete so

931
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:27,920
basically what I have is that this here

932
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:32,160
is the metric giant metric space I start

933
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:35,760
with then I'm looking at a ball in this

934
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:37,599
and if I take the closed ball

935
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:40,240
and and it happened to be at the origin

936
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:42,640
but it could be just at any point right

937
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:45,520
if you take a metric space and you're

938
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:48,079
taking something like this if the metric

939
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:51,119
space is cushy complete then this subset

940
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:53,040
is also cushy complete and but this

941
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:56,079
require

942
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:57,599
I have less or equal to right because

943
00:55:56,079 --> 00:56:01,040
else it could kind of converge to

944
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:06,480
something where where you got equality

945
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:06,480
right so so that was why I I do it like

946
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:15,280
Okay. So um so let's see. So

947
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:18,640
we are trying we we defined we have

948
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:21,599
already defined this radius capital R

949
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:25,760
and then we have these two constant

950
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:29,599
uh L1 and L2 and what I need to prove is

951
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:32,319
the first step here is to prove that if

952
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:37,040
I'm going to look again so the first

953
00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:39,599
step is that I need to restrict so I

954
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:44,880
need to restrict so I'm going to look at

955
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:46,960
are subs these spaces of

956
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:50,079
this is a subset of the continuous

957
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:53,680
functions and I need to prove that if y

958
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:56,680
is in here then the image is in the same

959
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:56,680
space.

960
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:04,079
Okay. And so this is the statement that

961
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:08,480
if y is continuous

962
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:12,960
the norm of this function is less or

963
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:15,520
equal to r. So at each point each x the

964
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:18,559
absolute value of y of x is less or

965
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:21,599
equal to r. Then you have the same for

966
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:24,480
the image under t. We already know again

967
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:28,240
that the image under t of y is

968
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:29,920
continuous. Okay.

969
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:34,400
Okay.

970
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:37,280
And so but I and what I can do is I can

971
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:39,040
restrict my interval.

972
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:43,040
So

973
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:47,440
I will restrict the interval as follows.

974
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:50,680
So I'm going to pick delta zero to be

975
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:50,680
the minimum

976
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:56,559
of one

977
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:59,920
uh one over

978
00:57:56,559 --> 00:58:01,680
L + one. L is non- negative. In

979
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:05,200
principle it could be zero. I don't want

980
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:08,720
to worry about that. So I just add one.

981
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:10,319
And L2 could also be zero. Although it's

982
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:12,400
pretty unlikely that any of them are

983
00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:16,400
zero. But I'm just to be safe. if I'm

984
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:19,599
just adding so I don't divide by zero.

985
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:22,160
So that's why and the so and and the

986
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:25,359
first thing is that I'm so and then I'm

987
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:27,680
going to look at the interval from this

988
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:30,720
and this is not going to be my final I

989
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:32,400
will have to do some further restriction

990
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:36,319
but I'm going to look at this interval

991
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:39,119
initially okay and the one here just

992
00:58:36,319 --> 00:58:44,480
comes in that I want this here to be a

993
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:47,440
sub subset of this unit interval

994
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:50,400
Okay.

995
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:53,599
Okay.

996
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:57,160
So now let's let's try. So now we are in

997
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:57,160
good shape here.

998
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:10,000
So now let's look at t

999
00:59:07,839 --> 00:59:12,880
y

1000
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:15,760
and we need to estimate this at each x.

1001
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:20,000
Right? We want to say

1002
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:22,240
that the norm is less than capital less

1003
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:25,839
or equal to capital R. But let's just

1004
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:29,839
look at what this is. This thing here is

1005
00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:34,640
equal to this function t of y is defined

1006
00:59:29,839 --> 00:59:41,640
to be a plus the integral from zero to x

1007
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:41,640
of uh f of y of s

1008
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:48,480
plus g

1009
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:51,040
of s

1010
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:53,680
ds and then I have to have absolute

1011
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:55,680
value like that.

1012
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:58,160
And now I can just use the triangle

1013
00:59:55,680 --> 01:00:01,200
inequality of course sort of trially. I

1014
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:04,400
get absolute value of this and then plus

1015
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:07,880
and then the integral here

1016
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,880
uh like that.

1017
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:12,359
Oops.

1018
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:22,720
And then I can just take this absolute

1019
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:28,079
value in under. So I get less or equal

1020
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:31,680
to a plus and then the integral

1021
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:34,000
and then the absolute value of f of y of

1022
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:36,400
s.

1023
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,920
And here I can also take the absolute

1024
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:39,839
value

1025
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:42,839
using the triangle equals on each

1026
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:42,839
individually.

1027
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:50,480
So I can write it like this.

1028
01:00:48,799 --> 01:00:56,079
Now

1029
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:59,839
this is where I use. So s here will have

1030
01:00:56,079 --> 01:01:04,440
to lie between zero and x right

1031
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:04,440
and so x is between

1032
01:01:05,839 --> 01:01:11,799
let me write just draw it here. So here

1033
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:11,799
I have zero

1034
01:01:11,839 --> 01:01:17,359
here I have delta zero and then I have

1035
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:20,640
this is zero and here I have x.

1036
01:01:17,359 --> 01:01:24,000
somewhere X, right?

1037
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:27,520
But since, right? So this means that

1038
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:32,240
that um this means that so here you have

1039
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:36,480
X but but right but X itself X

1040
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:39,200
has to lie X has to lie between

1041
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:42,799
delta 0

1042
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:46,160
minus delta 0 and delta 0 and S has to

1043
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:50,880
lie between zero and X. So this means

1044
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:53,200
that s here lies between like x will lie

1045
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:55,920
in this interval

1046
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:58,920
also

1047
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,920
right

1048
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:04,920
but now you see that um

1049
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:17,359
so now if we're looking at so we have t

1050
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:21,599
of y in x again remember that x here

1051
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:24,559
is less than or equal to delta z. So we

1052
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:28,160
have that this thing here is less or

1053
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:34,799
equal to a plus and then the integral

1054
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:37,799
from 0 to x of f of y of s

1055
01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:37,799
plus

1056
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:46,240
g of s

1057
01:02:42,319 --> 01:02:50,960
ds. Right? And and the first thing I

1058
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:54,079
observe is that s here is is also just

1059
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:57,920
because x was in that interval, you also

1060
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:59,599
have that s because x is in that

1061
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:02,799
interval,

1062
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:07,440
s is also in this interval. The second

1063
01:03:02,799 --> 01:03:10,799
thing I observe is that I'm assuming

1064
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:12,640
that the function that I start with at

1065
01:03:10,799 --> 01:03:17,520
each point

1066
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:21,200
have no less than R.

1067
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:29,200
Now if I using these two things then I

1068
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:33,839
have that. So this means that g of s

1069
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:36,240
this one here this is how we define l2

1070
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:39,520
right because this interval here is

1071
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:41,760
contained in the interval between minus1

1072
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:46,160
and one this here is contained in the

1073
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:49,599
interval between minus1 and one right so

1074
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:54,000
we have that g of s

1075
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:56,720
is less than this l2 lesser equal to L2.

1076
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:59,200
Right?

1077
01:03:56,720 --> 01:04:02,559
The second thing we observe is that

1078
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:08,680
because we have

1079
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:08,680
this here for each S we have this

1080
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:20,000
then it means you see by the first

1081
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:25,680
by the f by the definition of L1 that uh

1082
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:30,160
f of y of less

1083
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:34,319
this thing here is less than L1.

1084
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:37,520
Okay, L1 and L2 are are now fixed

1085
01:04:34,319 --> 01:04:40,480
numbers, right? And so you see that this

1086
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:45,760
second thing here I can bound this thing

1087
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:47,039
here by so this is lesser equal to a uh

1088
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:49,680
and that should have been an absolute

1089
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:52,079
value somehow lost it when I copied from

1090
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:56,559
this line.

1091
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:59,359
um a absolute value of a and then on the

1092
01:04:56,559 --> 01:05:00,880
first one here the length of this

1093
01:04:59,359 --> 01:05:03,839
interval

1094
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:08,880
but that is of course bounded by delta

1095
01:05:03,839 --> 01:05:11,920
zero right so this is plus delta 0 and

1096
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:14,640
then the maximal possible value of this

1097
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:16,720
that would be l1

1098
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:18,720
and then likewise the length of this

1099
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:22,079
interval you're integrating over is at

1100
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:26,000
most delta zero and this one here cannot

1101
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:27,920
be larger than L2. So you have this

1102
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:32,000
right

1103
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:34,880
and now remember what delta zero was and

1104
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:38,400
I will just I have it I think on the

1105
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:42,559
both on board below here but let me just

1106
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:46,240
write it here. This here was what delta

1107
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:50,799
0 was chosen to be the minimum

1108
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:56,839
1 / l1 + 1

1109
01:05:50,799 --> 01:05:56,839
uh 1 / l2 + 1.

1110
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:59,960
Okay.

1111
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:10,480
So now,

1112
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:14,319
so now we have that this thing here is

1113
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:16,480
less than this here. We just keep

1114
01:06:14,319 --> 01:06:18,400
this thing here.

1115
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:22,720
Well, delta

1116
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:24,240
is in particular less than this thing

1117
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:27,920
here.

1118
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:34,480
So you see that if you put plug in this

1119
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:38,160
so it's like plus 1 L1 + 1 * L1.

1120
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:43,039
Likewise over here you're using this. So

1121
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:44,960
you're getting 1 / L2 + 1 L2. And now

1122
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:48,160
you see that this thing here is less

1123
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:50,640
than one. This is less than one. So this

1124
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:55,359
is less than a. It's actually strictly

1125
01:06:50,640 --> 01:07:02,920
less but it doesn't really matter. a +

1126
01:06:55,359 --> 01:07:02,920
uh plus uh 2 like this. Okay.

1127
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:13,599
So this means that so then but this here

1128
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:18,000
this here was exactly the definition of

1129
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:20,559
capital R right and so you have that and

1130
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:24,799
when I copied it over I also forgot to

1131
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:27,920
put absolute on here right so you have

1132
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:32,240
that the if so you have that if so the

1133
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:34,720
conclusion here is that if y here is a

1134
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:39,000
continuous function

1135
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:39,000
on this interval here

1136
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:49,200
and the norm of y at each point is less

1137
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:52,680
or equal to r. Well, then you have that

1138
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:52,680
t of y

1139
01:07:53,839 --> 01:08:00,799
at each point is lesser now lesser. It's

1140
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:02,960
actually strictly less, but we don't

1141
01:08:00,799 --> 01:08:05,760
care about that.

1142
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:09,839
Okay. So, so,

1143
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:12,799
so what you have now is,

1144
01:08:09,839 --> 01:08:15,119
so what we now have proven is that we

1145
01:08:12,799 --> 01:08:17,199
have this map t

1146
01:08:15,119 --> 01:08:21,520
and now I'm going to sing about this map

1147
01:08:17,199 --> 01:08:25,279
sorry on the space of

1148
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:29,400
of y that is continuous

1149
01:08:25,279 --> 01:08:29,400
on this interval here.

1150
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:39,199
Um and what you have is and also sorry

1151
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:42,239
and I'm thinking about with the norm at

1152
01:08:39,199 --> 01:08:44,400
each point this here is less than r and

1153
01:08:42,239 --> 01:08:46,000
again you can this is really a ball in

1154
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:48,799
this metric space but let me just write

1155
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:51,440
it out like this

1156
01:08:48,799 --> 01:08:56,560
and what you have is that sorry this is

1157
01:08:51,440 --> 01:09:00,159
the space and you have that t of y

1158
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:02,880
if y is in this space then t of y is in

1159
01:09:00,159 --> 01:09:04,880
the same space. So t of y is also

1160
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:09,679
continuous

1161
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:14,880
on that interval

1162
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:18,560
and t of y at each point x is less or

1163
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:22,520
equal to one. So the map map this space

1164
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:22,520
into itself. Okay.

1165
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:28,400
Now

1166
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:32,080
the next thing we will we want to prove

1167
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:35,080
is that the map is contracting.

1168
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:35,080
Okay.

1169
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:52,880
Right? You see that you need you know if

1170
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:57,120
this space is not stable right so

1171
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:59,199
imagine that you take so you we're

1172
01:09:57,120 --> 01:10:01,920
starting with some giant metric space

1173
01:09:59,199 --> 01:10:05,159
this is the continuous function say on

1174
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:05,159
this interval

1175
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:11,840
this

1176
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:14,159
and then we're looking at some subspace

1177
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:18,719
of that. So these are continuous on a

1178
01:10:14,159 --> 01:10:21,280
smaller interval. Okay. But this

1179
01:10:18,719 --> 01:10:23,840
but if the and then we have defined a

1180
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:27,920
map

1181
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:30,560
but if the you know if if if somehow the

1182
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:33,760
map was taking us out of the space where

1183
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:36,080
it's contracting then we couldn't keep

1184
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:38,719
applying the contracting map right it

1185
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:40,800
wouldn't anymore be you know by and and

1186
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:43,040
the thing is that you want to just

1187
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:45,520
iterate. You want to keep you want to

1188
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:47,920
pick some point and then you want to

1189
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:50,080
keep applying the contracting map. So

1190
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:51,920
you want it to stay in the space where

1191
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:54,400
it is contracting, right? And so this is

1192
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:57,120
what we did in one, but we haven't yet

1193
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:59,600
proved that the map is contracting. And

1194
01:10:57,120 --> 01:11:01,840
so now to prove that the map is

1195
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:06,560
contracting, we're going to further

1196
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:09,199
restrict the interval. Okay? And so this

1197
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:11,920
is so I'm going to set I'm going to

1198
01:11:09,199 --> 01:11:16,880
define now one more constant. Sorry

1199
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:20,400
about that. So this is m here and m is

1200
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:24,040
going to be just the max

1201
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:24,040
of fprime

1202
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:32,480
uh of uh fprime of set absolute value of

1203
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:34,080
this where set here is lesser equals

1204
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:40,480
one.

1205
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:43,440
Fine. So this is my uh this is my um

1206
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:46,920
the the well almost the second last

1207
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:46,920
constant unfortunately

1208
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:53,280
and now I'm going to define this. So the

1209
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:55,760
last constant is going to be the

1210
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:58,080
integral that I'm going to work with.

1211
01:11:55,760 --> 01:12:01,080
Right? So remember what I'm trying to do

1212
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:01,080
is

1213
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:08,480
I have this differential equation and I

1214
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:11,840
want to say that

1215
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:13,840
near zero there is a solution but near

1216
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:16,560
zero just mean that there exists some

1217
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:19,280
tiny interval around zero where I have a

1218
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:20,800
solution and again if I have time or

1219
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:23,840
else I will do it next time I will give

1220
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:26,000
an example where you can see that in

1221
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:27,840
general you would need to look at a very

1222
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:29,360
tiny interval for this to have a

1223
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:33,400
solution otherwise it doesn't have a

1224
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:33,400
solution on a very large set.

1225
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:40,480
Okay. So I define it like this and then

1226
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:43,520
I define delta here. So delta is now

1227
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:47,040
going to be the minimum

1228
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:53,000
of delta zero the one from before and

1229
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:53,000
then 1 over 2 m + one.

1230
01:12:53,600 --> 01:13:01,520
And now I want to look at the space.

1231
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:05,840
So I want to look at t.

1232
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:09,280
And then t is going to be a map from the

1233
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:13,360
continuous functions. So y here is a

1234
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:16,159
continuous function on now this little

1235
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:19,280
interval. So this interval here because

1236
01:13:16,159 --> 01:13:20,960
it's you have the minimum of this. This

1237
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:22,880
is interval is contained in the

1238
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:26,800
corresponding interval with the delta to

1239
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:29,520
zero. So it's y in this space such that

1240
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:32,320
the norm here at each point is lesser

1241
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:37,600
equal to r. That's a space I'm going to

1242
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:40,080
look at. And we already know that t maps

1243
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:41,920
this space into itself, right? Because

1244
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:45,360
there's really no new statement if the

1245
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:48,880
function is is right. So as long as you

1246
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:50,640
have this here and you apply t on it, t

1247
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:52,640
when you apply t on a function it's

1248
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:54,400
defined on the same interval. So it will

1249
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:58,080
automatically defined on this smaller

1250
01:13:54,400 --> 01:14:01,360
interval and and we already have this

1251
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:06,640
property. Okay. So so t maps this space

1252
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:09,760
here into itself. Okay.

1253
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:13,199
And now I want to prove I want to

1254
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:15,120
estimate. So I take two elements in this

1255
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:18,080
space.

1256
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:21,360
So I have y1 and y2. So you're looking

1257
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:26,000
at so y1

1258
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:29,840
and y2 are in this space.

1259
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:31,360
And you want to look at what is the

1260
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:34,480
distance

1261
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:37,800
between y1

1262
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:37,800
and y2.

1263
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:45,679
Right? So we want this here and we want

1264
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:47,679
what I want to prove is

1265
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:51,480
that it's contracting.

1266
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:51,480
So I want to show

1267
01:14:54,239 --> 01:14:58,159
and I want to prove I'm going to prove

1268
01:14:56,320 --> 01:15:00,640
it.

1269
01:14:58,159 --> 01:15:03,360
You know my constant C will be explicit.

1270
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:06,719
It would be just a half. So that

1271
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:09,360
certainly is less than one.

1272
01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:12,360
And this is what I want.

1273
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:12,360
Okay.

1274
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:16,120
So now

1275
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:23,239
um

1276
01:15:19,199 --> 01:15:23,239
So now let's look at then.

1277
01:15:26,719 --> 01:15:33,960
So t of y1

1278
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:33,960
minus t of y2.

1279
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:42,080
this thing here y t of y1 is defined to

1280
01:15:38,239 --> 01:15:44,480
be a plus the integral sorry and let me

1281
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:46,719
write so I'm going to let me just make a

1282
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:49,679
little more space here I worried I'm

1283
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:54,000
running out of time but let's see so

1284
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:56,560
this thing here minus t of y2 and I'm

1285
01:15:54,000 --> 01:16:00,960
just looking at the difference in some x

1286
01:15:56,560 --> 01:16:03,600
and again x here is now in x here will

1287
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:08,719
be in the interval

1288
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:11,679
um you were looking at x in the interval

1289
01:16:08,719 --> 01:16:14,239
in this interval

1290
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:18,000
and so I'm just writing down first here

1291
01:16:14,239 --> 01:16:23,760
what this is this is the integral of

1292
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:26,640
from a to x of f of y1

1293
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:28,159
uh s

1294
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:31,640
plus

1295
01:16:28,159 --> 01:16:31,640
g of s

1296
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:41,040
Um and then you have minus

1297
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:45,719
this is what you get for a2 for y2 a. So

1298
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:45,719
minus this thing here.

1299
01:16:56,960 --> 01:17:02,880
So this is the difference right.

1300
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:05,920
And what you see is the first thing you

1301
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:08,960
observe is that this a here cancels

1302
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:11,760
right but it not only does this cancel

1303
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:13,600
but this term here also cancel okay and

1304
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:17,040
that actually there's a good reason that

1305
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:20,080
there are lower order and and the point

1306
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:23,600
here is that right the the the the main

1307
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:25,760
point is in the unknown function anyway

1308
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:29,040
right and it's it's a what's called a

1309
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:32,400
nonlinear equation

1310
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:36,239
um So that's a difficulty.

1311
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:38,719
So but what you then get when you write

1312
01:17:36,239 --> 01:17:44,320
when you have when you have after the

1313
01:17:38,719 --> 01:17:47,280
cancellation what you get is f of y1

1314
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:53,840
of s

1315
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:58,000
minus f of y2 of s

1316
01:17:53,840 --> 01:18:03,040
ds. Okay. So you have that.

1317
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:05,520
Now I will now I will

1318
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:09,280
look at this thing here and that thing

1319
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:12,000
here and I'm going to and you have to

1320
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:14,480
now abstract. So, so now I'm going to

1321
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:16,480
look at this difference here. And then

1322
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:19,600
now the thing is that you have to kind

1323
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:23,679
of abstract from it and you have to

1324
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:27,120
think about S as being

1325
01:18:23,679 --> 01:18:31,280
if you think about S as being fixed,

1326
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:33,520
right? Then this is just two numbers,

1327
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:35,120
right? You could think about this as set

1328
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:39,040
one

1329
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:41,360
and this here as set two, right? This is

1330
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:46,000
set one and this here is set two. So

1331
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:50,640
it's like f of set one minus f of set

1332
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:53,679
two. Right? Now the mean value theorem

1333
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:58,239
tells us that this thing here is equal

1334
01:18:53,679 --> 01:19:02,080
to the derivative at some intermediate

1335
01:18:58,239 --> 01:19:04,480
point. Say let's say set three where set

1336
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:07,800
three is between

1337
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:07,800
is between

1338
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:18,000
set one and set two,

1339
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:19,520
right? And then times set one minus set

1340
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,360
two,

1341
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:24,960
right?

1342
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:28,640
And but you okay? So this is so this is

1343
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:33,280
just for you just for any xs you have

1344
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:36,320
this. Okay, but this means that

1345
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:39,760
this means now we almost out of time. Uh

1346
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:43,120
so this means that the when you're

1347
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:51,920
looking at the norm of this

1348
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:55,520
f of y1 of s minus f of y 2 of s

1349
01:19:51,920 --> 01:20:01,640
right that the norm here is so the norm

1350
01:19:55,520 --> 01:20:01,640
is equal to fprime at set three

1351
01:20:02,159 --> 01:20:10,679
times set one which is and set one I can

1352
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:10,679
write Again it's really this and this is

1353
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:15,760
set two.

1354
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:18,960
This thing here remember set is some

1355
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:21,679
point in between those two points right?

1356
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:24,080
But both of these points both of these

1357
01:20:21,679 --> 01:20:27,679
points here both this one here and that

1358
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:29,199
one here have norm less than r.

1359
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:33,440
Right?

1360
01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:36,800
So this here is so but now where the way

1361
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:39,040
that m was defined

1362
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:41,760
uh and it should have been on the same

1363
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:46,400
board.

1364
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:49,760
So m here was defined to be the maximum

1365
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:54,080
of fprime of set

1366
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:57,280
where set was less or equal to one.

1367
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:59,840
And so you see that this thing here

1368
01:20:57,280 --> 01:21:03,199
where you take the derivative that is

1369
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:10,080
bounded by m right. So this thing here

1370
01:21:03,199 --> 01:21:13,520
is less than m y1 s minus y2

1371
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:15,280
of s like that. Okay I so I'm not sure

1372
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:17,280
where we should stop. I mean we're over

1373
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:20,640
and I probably need a few more minutes.

1374
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:23,360
Maybe we should stop and it's not a

1375
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:27,840
great place to stop, but uh but that's

1376
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:29,920
how it goes. Uh so I will uh keep you in

1377
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:34,640
suspension

1378
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:38,320
uh and um and so we'll pick up uh from

1379
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:41,440
here on on Tuesday. And so I I want

1380
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:45,040
anyway to explain to you why actually

1381
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:46,640
this method which seems a little crazy

1382
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:48,960
in a way because it's bringing in all

1383
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:51,040
these things why it turned out to be

1384
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:53,760
basically optimal.

1385
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:58,280
Okay. And then we'll do a review the

1386
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:58,280
rest of the time on on Tuesday.
