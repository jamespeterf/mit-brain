00:00:01,319 --> 00:00:05,480
I'm Cara Miller and I'm Rob Stoner and

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,640
this is what if it works coming to you

4
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:09,599
from the MIT energy initiative and

5
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,440
looking at the energy solutions to

6
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:18,100
climate

00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:18,100
[Music]

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:26,519
change today large parts of the world

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:29,160
just don't have enough energy so how do

10
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:30,599
they transition to cleaner sources when

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,280
for many people

12
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,320
that's not the real

13
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:37,399
priority in the work I do I have to very

14
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:40,879
actively recognize that I am very

15
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:44,079
ignorant about many facets of a problem

16
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,559
and actively try to educate myself from

17
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,120
the perspectives of different

18
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:50,000
stakeholders around the problem that's

19
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,079
Amos winter a professor of mechanical

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,359
engineering at MIT and he's got a knack

21
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:57,640
for looking at technical problems a

22
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:59,600
little bit differently than most people

23
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,600
and he's tackled a lot of technical

24
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,519
problems

25
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,080
from designing a wheelchair that's

26
00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:07,759
usable and affordable in Tanzania when

27
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,320
you're working in a resource constraint

28
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:12,960
setting that often means lowering cost

29
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,759
or using maybe a more constrained set of

30
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,600
Parts like bicycle parts for a

31
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:20,119
wheelchair to creating a prosthetic foot

32
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,040
that fits the market in India can we

33
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:24,000
have something that's mass

34
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,000
manufacturable and cheap and rugged but

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,240
as developing countries seek to solve

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,360
more problems need more power and

37
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,960
consider the pros and cons of renewable

38
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,720
energy one of Winter's big beliefs is

39
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,200
that you have to tackle a whole system

40
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,240
and when you've got a system that's

41
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,840
created for a set of circumstances and

42
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:45,439
resources in Tanzania or in India

43
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,960
sometimes you uncover solutions that

44
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:50,520
provide significant insights into how to

45
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:53,000
make systems in developed countries more

46
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,960
energy efficient approaching these

47
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,399
large-scale challenges often brings into

48
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,360
play the idea of design thinking which

49
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:01,560
has gotten a lot of attention in both

50
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,520
business in Academia over the last

51
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,680
couple of decades making energy work for

52
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,840
a community means you've got to

53
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,800
understand people's lives if you live in

54
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:14,720
a place where you're not on the grid for

55
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:17,560
example can solar panels meet your needs

56
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,280
well it's an interesting question and

57
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:23,080
actually it kind of depends let's say

58
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,640
you want to just power lights in your

59
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,519
home and charge your cell phone that

60
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,560
doesn't require very much energy you can

61
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:31,280
have a relatively small array of solar

62
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:34,080
panels

63
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,640
it's low cost you can implement it when

64
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,200
you start wanting to run appliances in

65
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,760
your house the energy load is much much

66
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,159
higher and the power load is much higher

67
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:45,000
and that becomes a much trickier problem

68
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:49,319
and then the other thing that we face

69
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:52,440
all the time is there's a certain level

70
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:54,480
of power and energy needs that ends up

71
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:57,760
justifying having a

72
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,879
standalone power generation system so

73
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:03,799
for example it doesn't make any sense

74
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:06,519
probably to have a solar panel just to

75
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:08,879
run a single sprinkler on your

76
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:11,519
lawn but if you have that solar panel to

77
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:13,560
run the sprinkler and your TV well then

78
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,879
there's a stronger value proposition and

79
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,920
there's there's companies that have done

80
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:20,480
this they figured out additional power

81
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,239
uh needs that justify the capital cost

82
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,400
of installing that that power system for

83
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:29,120
us when we're talking about a community

84
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,040
scale or even Municipal scale and we're

85
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,720
working on that as well desalination

86
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,799
system those are plants basically and

87
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,560
they they are often in areas that have

88
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:40,280
enough spare area either on the roof of

89
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,599
the building or the surrounding area to

90
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:45,360
put in a solar array but if we're

91
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:47,519
talking about let's say a home scale

92
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:51,159
desalination system which are very

93
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,879
widely used across India for example it

94
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:54,599
doesn't make sense to have a a little

95
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,959
tiny solar panel on your roof for just

96
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:58,920
that one device so where's the energy

97
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,239
coming from where's the energy then

98
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,799
coming from for that homebased

99
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,480
deselenization system those are bought

100
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,120
by typically middle class or above

101
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,879
households that have grid access and

102
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,799
those systems don't need to run 24 hours

103
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,000
a day so even if you have intermittent

104
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,239
grid you can you can turn it on when you

105
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
have energy

106
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:21,040
access Rob do you have thoughts on that

107
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,520
notion of you know whether in emerging

108
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,800
economies people are skipping a

109
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:30,080
generation in terms of technology or or

110
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:32,440
they're scaling up by relying on many of

111
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,360
the things we've relied on coal and oil

112
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:38,080
and you know well I I think I don't know

113
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:41,960
if it's so much skipping a generation

114
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:44,280
yet but it's it's getting there before

115
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:46,160
the conventional electricity generation

116
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:49,280
and distribution Technologies are

117
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,680
economically viable for you so what's

118
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:54,120
happened is we've we've seen Villages

119
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,160
and remote communities or even even

120
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,800
parts of provinces and states and

121
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,280
countries that aren't that rural but but

122
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,600
are still

123
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04,919
far from where the the infrastructure is

124
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:08,000
we've seen them get electricity sooner

125
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:10,520
than they would economically because of

126
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,919
these new options becoming possible for

127
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:15,320
them Amos talked about the idea of

128
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:17,720
electrifying individual homes with a

129
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:19,800
very small amount of solar power it

130
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,960
didn't work out well solar prices and

131
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,160
battery prices were higher than they are

132
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:26,680
now but as they've Fallen it's become

133
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,400
more and more possible for poorer

134
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,319
families to be able to buy these systems

135
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,600
not the poorest yet

136
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:34,440
I think what he's really

137
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,800
done that's That's so exciting with with

138
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,960
desalination and we'll talk about

139
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:42,280
Irrigation in a minute is is figure out

140
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:44,360
how to make the systems work as systems

141
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:47,400
so much more efficiently that you can

142
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:50,120
get to even yet another layer of poor

143
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:53,080
people and and also by making them in

144
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,919
some cases Community serving you can

145
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,840
access people that who individually

146
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:58,800
couldn't afford them but as a community

147
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,800
can afford them and I think that's

148
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,120
that's exciting it's a providing public

149
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,479
infrastructure using these engineered

150
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,280
systems Rob is touching on such an

151
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:11,520
important point and I boil that down to

152
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:13,919
the question of how can you do a task

153
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:17,120
but with less energy than we do it with

154
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:18,680
in the US in Europe and I think I I

155
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,840
talked to like consumer product

156
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:24,199
companies and they realize there's just

157
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,599
massive fortunes to be made to figure

158
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:27,800
out who can make the air conditioners

159
00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:31,000
and the refrigerators and the you know

160
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:33,319
ovens and and these these higher power

161
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
appliances and amenities that you can't

162
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:38,240
run on small micro grids right now just

163
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,840
because of the power draw you know we're

164
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,039
going to talk more about irrigation but

165
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:45,240
also desalination that like we are

166
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:48,280
always trying to do the task with less

167
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:51,319
energy to drive cost down but in this

168
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:55,360
regard too just make the energy that can

169
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:58,000
be viable and available more usable to

170
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,680
do more tasks that add value to people's

171
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,440
lives so are you saying that there's a

172
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:07,680
race right now kind of behind the scenes

173
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:11,280
even in wealthier countries to pull bits

174
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:14,560
of energy out of air conditioning or

175
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,280
freezers or whatever and then money is

176
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,440
to be made at scale are you thinking are

177
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:21,039
you talking more about in poorer

178
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,680
countries so that race is there of

179
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,879
course like you know the energy star

180
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,800
appliances and all that stuff that's

181
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:28,680
been around forever and that's you know

182
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,360
Rob can speak more knowledgeably about

183
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,879
this than I can but but that you know

184
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,960
that's appealing to Consumers because of

185
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:36,160
cost energy it's it's appealing for like

186
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,599
a green mentality I think there's

187
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,440
there's subsidies for some of those

188
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:42,879
things I'm talking about step changes

189
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:47,199
though like thinking about how can you

190
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:50,599
do a task with like half to a tenth the

191
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:53,520
amount of energy as we use in the US and

192
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:56,520
that excites me and that that is what we

193
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,960
have done in in a lot of our work like

194
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:01,639
in the desalination work I talked about

195
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,720
previous ly you know we've lowered the

196
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:06,240
power system size well we've cut all the

197
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,039
batteries out of it that that's a

198
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:12,520
massive massive Capital cost sometimes

199
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:14,919
we actually want to use bigger solar

200
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:17,800
panels that are less efficient because

201
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:20,400
of the overall benefits of the rest of

202
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,360
the system like it's often it's often

203
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,960
cheaper to buy more solar panels than

204
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:26,720
you need than trying to buy batteries

205
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,639
and buffer all the energy you need in

206
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,440
batteries so you can use it at night

207
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,519
it's just better to get more energy

208
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:35,479
during the day and and blow it then so

209
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,919
yeah all these energy drivers that

210
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:40,240
dictate design decisions I think are

211
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,200
fascinating human behavior comes into

212
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,839
making that system work well sometimes

213
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,279
too right I mean absolutely you can you

214
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,680
can overpower the system during the day

215
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:50,279
with bigger solar panels and get the

216
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,720
batteries out of zero but people have to

217
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:54,760
decide to use the system during the day

218
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,519
and and you know it's interesting to

219
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,880
watch how communities adapt their

220
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:00,440
behavior to the availability of energy I

221
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,560
wish we did that more in developed

222
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:06,839
countries yeah like in our irrigation

223
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:08,680
systems when we did our first Pilots we

224
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:10,880
found that many of the farmers would

225
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:14,360
miss irrigation events they were

226
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,720
supposed to do because they had to pray

227
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:19,320
these were in Muslim countries and we

228
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,680
hadn't we hadn't built in those blackout

229
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,680
hours

230
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:25,320
yet and so you're exactly right rob you

231
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,959
you have to you have to design all of

232
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,920
this around the people's behavior it's

233
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:32,440
not just a tech problem we have the idea

234
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:34,959
of demand response in in the west where

235
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:37,000
people are paid to modify their behavior

236
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:39,720
because it's cheaper to pay them than to

237
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,240
add extra infrastructure investment to

238
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,079
make it possible for them to do any old

239
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:45,760
thing any anytime they want uh it hasn't

240
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:49,200
hasn't really had the impact that we've

241
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:50,399
we've wanted it to have uh because well

242
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,360
they want to do stuff when they want to

243
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,240
do it I think this is such a good point

244
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,680
too to to bring this back to talking

245
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,720
about design thinking I think as we look

246
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:00,640
to a green future in climate change and

247
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,680
energy reduction and all these things I

248
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,720
feel like tooo often we depend on well

249
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,560
people will change and people don't

250
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,760
change very easily and people tend to do

251
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,480
what they want most of the time so I

252
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,160
think the real sweet spot is if you can

253
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:16,240
find Solutions where people can still do

254
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,320
what they want and have what they want

255
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,720
but just by default they do something

256
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,200
better for the environment I find that

257
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:26,040
people are much more willing to do these

258
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,519
things when they're off grid than when

259
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,880
they're on grid and I think the reason

260
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,120
is that when you're connected to the

261
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,440
grid

262
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:35,720
you're you're buying electricity from a

263
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:38,120
system that's being managed by Financial

264
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,240
Wizards and people who are building the

265
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,560
system with the idea that it's going to

266
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:45,600
be paid off for many many many decades

267
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:47,279
so a unit of electricity that you buy is

268
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,720
inconsequential but you wouldn't of

269
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,160
course be willing to personally make the

270
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,720
billion dollar investment that it took

271
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,680
to get the electricity there when you're

272
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:56,959
building a offgrid power system you're

273
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,800
faced with that capital investment even

274
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,920
if you're able to borrow the money and

275
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,720
pay it off slowly you're not going to

276
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,800
pay it off for 50 years the way we pay

277
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,680
off the grid you're going to pay it off

278
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:08,040
in 3 years and it's painful to do that

279
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:11,120
and so they're they're much more willing

280
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:13,600
to buy into the idea that they're going

281
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,839
to modify their behavior if they can get

282
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,800
away with this much smaller upfront

283
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:21,279
capital investment and I've seen that in

284
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:24,200
in micro grids in rural communities in

285
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,880
solar home systems in solar pumps it's

286
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,600
an interesting phenomenon it's too bad

287
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:30,560
we don't have to pay with cash up front

288
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:33,079
for the the wires that come into our

289
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,600
homes where I bet we buy smaller ones

290
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:40,000
I've noticed it a lot in electric cars

291
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:42,040
in the last year where I think we there

292
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,560
was a slump in sales over the last six

293
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:46,519
months or so aside Amos is a huge car

294
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,800
guy so

295
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:52,240
yeah but but Car Guy aside I think

296
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:55,480
what's happened is that you initially

297
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:58,079
had early adopter who liked the new tech

298
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:00,360
and want to be green and so they were

299
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:03,800
buying electric cars and then as you get

300
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:07,600
near the mass Market electric cars right

301
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:09,959
now cannot deliver in all the use cases

302
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,480
that a gasoline or diesel power car can

303
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:14,240
do still in terms of range and fill up

304
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,600
time and towing capacity and all these

305
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,920
things and I think that is has slumped

306
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:21,720
the market and so probably most people

307
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:23,519
recognize that internal combustion is a

308
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,760
is a real negative contributor to

309
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,320
climate change they also have other

310
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:31,240
needs in their life and they they can't

311
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,320
you can't be a a farmer in Iowa that has

312
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:35,120
to pull a trailer 500 miles a few times

313
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:38,440
a week with an electric truck it just

314
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:41,720
the energy doesn't work out and so in my

315
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:45,440
work we have to very much recognize this

316
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:47,720
in like our irrigation in that we can't

317
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,160
really ask the farmers to do anything

318
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:51,720
that would be looked at in their eyes as

319
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,240
a detriment to their business or put

320
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:56,639
them at risk or like not grow as many

321
00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:00,360
crops or be arduous to

322
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:03,160
use and it's a very similar dynamic in

323
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:05,279
that I think most Farmers recognize

324
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:09,360
climate change is a huge issue for the

325
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:11,760
agriculture industry they know water is

326
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,959
stressed but they also want to maximize

327
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:17,079
their crop growth so if they have access

328
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:20,079
to water they're going to use it right

329
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:22,040
and so we we have done and we'll talk

330
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:25,959
about this more but a a huge amount of

331
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:29,120
work on water saving irrigation methods

332
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:32,079
that you can use less water but Preserve

333
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,000
crop productivity and and also ideally

334
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:36,320
instill that confidence in Farmers that

335
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,440
when they adopt this thing it's not

336
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,480
going to reduce their yield it's

337
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:42,760
actually going to make their life better

338
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,680
and and actually maybe enable them to

339
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,760
grow a lot more crops with because given

340
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:49,120
the water they have allocated to them

341
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:51,560
they can use it on a bigger area and and

342
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,199
grow more yield so talk about that I

343
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:55,079
mean how can you use less water to water

344
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:58,560
the same plant I mean doesn't plants

345
00:13:55,079 --> 00:14:00,600
need water so water saving irrigation

346
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,079
methods have been around for many many

347
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05,399
years the the technology called drip

348
00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:07,440
irrigation where you just drip out the

349
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:09,639
exact amount of water a plant needs so

350
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,160
you minimize water loss to evaporation

351
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:15,120
and drainage that was really popularized

352
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:17,320
in Israel in the 1970s and that's a very

353
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,079
effective way to reduce the water

354
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:21,519
required to grow plants so if you

355
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:24,279
compare drip irrigation with

356
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,759
conventional Furrow or flood irrigation

357
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:28,519
or even sprinklers often times you can

358
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:31,639
reduce water consumption by upwards of

359
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:34,959
60 % by using drip versus those

360
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:37,440
traditional methods so a big portfolio

361
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:39,560
of our work has been on how can we

362
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,800
promote greater adoption of drip

363
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:44,480
irrigation the big barrier to drip

364
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:46,399
irrigation adoption is cost it is more

365
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,720
expensive than just getting a diesel

366
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,199
pump and flooding your Fields um and

367
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,199
particularly in the markets where we

368
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:56,480
work where we don't necessarily have

369
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:58,680
grid access power cost is really the

370
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,720
biggest cost driver and that power can

371
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:03,040
be a diesel pump both the capital cost

372
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,480
and recurring cost of that energy or it

373
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,240
can be a solar power system both are are

374
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:10,279
about equivalently expensive when you

375
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:12,880
look at it over 10 years so a big area

376
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:15,720
of our work has been addressing how much

377
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:18,320
power and energy does it require to move

378
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,839
water through a drip irrigation system

379
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,759
we can't really change flow rate because

380
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:24,160
the plants need so much water but we can

381
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:27,120
change pressure and so because we cut

382
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:29,959
pressure our drip irrigation emitters

383
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:33,560
that we've designed cut pump power in

384
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:35,199
half compared to existing products so if

385
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:37,279
you're an on grid farmer Cuts your

386
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:39,399
energy costs in half if you're say

387
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:42,199
pumping from a pawn to your field if

388
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:45,040
you're an off-grid farmer it cuts a a

389
00:15:42,199 --> 00:15:46,839
solar powered irrigation system uh it

390
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:51,000
depends on a lot of factors but anywhere

391
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:54,199
from like 10 to 40% Still Still big big

392
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,240
uh reductions and then also again going

393
00:15:54,199 --> 00:15:58,319
back to design thinking we had to think

394
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:01,160
about what would incentivize companies

395
00:15:58,319 --> 00:16:02,880
to make distribute this and our big

396
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:05,639
commercial partner on this project is

397
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:08,399
toro they make lawn tractors and egg and

398
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:11,079
landscaping equipment and they really

399
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:13,759
instilled in us that for the bread andb

400
00:16:11,079 --> 00:16:15,560
butter markets like the US farmers are

401
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,839
not so sensitive to energy even though

402
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:22,480
they can save energy costs but what Toro

403
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:24,600
was sensitive to was the size of the

404
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,720
emitters that they make and if we can

405
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,480
make them smaller they're cheaper and if

406
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,040
we can make them smaller as well we can

407
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,399
ship more of them in a container to a

408
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,839
production facility where they're put

409
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:37,360
into the pipe so they're much cheaper to

410
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:39,800
distribute and so we have come up with

411
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,040
drip emitters that are half the size of

412
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,920
Toro's previous products and that

413
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,759
completely changes their business model

414
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,839
so now they can centrally manufacture

415
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,759
these emitters and do it under very high

416
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,519
Precision quality control and then put

417
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,399
them inside a box ship them anywhere in

418
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,560
the world and then insert them into the

419
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:57,199
pipe locally and you do that because

420
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:59,440
when you when you ship just emitters

421
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:01,240
they're really densely packed in a box

422
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,639
but when you make piping there's a lot

423
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:05,679
of air in the pipe so you never want to

424
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:07,720
ship that over a long distance and it's

425
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,439
been really fun working with Toro's

426
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:11,919
marketing department in the Middle East

427
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:13,720
in North Africa where we do our work

428
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:17,079
because they've instilled in us that

429
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:19,720
this ability to accommodate a much wider

430
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:22,199
pressure variation and run much much

431
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:24,199
longer lines has huge economic

432
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:27,160
advantages to Farmers because they need

433
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:29,960
less piping like big piping what are

434
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:33,000
called sub mains between the fields they

435
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:35,080
can just run longer hoses basically and

436
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,799
get rid of some of that infrastructure

437
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:39,400
so even though drip irrigation emitters

438
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:41,600
are more expensive they can actually

439
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:44,600
save costs on other Capital Equipment by

440
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,919
running longer lines so ironically these

441
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,760
these countries are getting wealthier

442
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:51,000
people are getting wealthier and moving

443
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:53,000
into the middle class as they get the

444
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,880
benefit of having these

445
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,120
Technologies how can we ensure that in

446
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,159
the future as as they become become

447
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,720
advanced economies they don't adopt our

448
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:05,280
bad habits and give up all these lovely

449
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:07,919
Frugal habits and and you know system

450
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:10,240
scale thinking that is required with

451
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:12,280
these sorts of systems is it possible in

452
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,960
other words that we're going to skip the

453
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:17,000
Revolution and go back to the same old

454
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:19,880
sloppy habits that we've adopted the way

455
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,880
I think about this is is a few ways one

456
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:24,600
when you're talking about water stressed

457
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:26,440
countries you have an incentive to to

458
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,840
not be wasteful like like the Middle

459
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:31,240
East in North Africa just doesn't have

460
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:33,159
the spare water we do in the United

461
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:35,760
States so you know that's a totally

462
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:38,520
different scenario the second in in

463
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:42,720
terms of being a designer is thinking

464
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:44,880
about how can you save water and

465
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,480
incentivize Farmers to adopt your

466
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:50,039
technology because the benefits of it

467
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:52,640
are are so much that it would be foolish

468
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:55,240
to go back to a more wasteful practice

469
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,760
and that has been critical in our

470
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:59,320
irrigation work in how we designed

471
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,240
system control

472
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:04,400
so I haven't talked about this yet but

473
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:08,080
the other big portfolio we have is how

474
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:11,000
we very judiciously use water and use

475
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:13,880
energy so at every point in the growth

476
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,679
cycle of a plant we're figuring out how

477
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,960
much water does the plant need to

478
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,400
maximize this growth potential how do we

479
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:22,360
not waste water to evaporation and

480
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,159
drainage and how do we account for

481
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:26,919
weather variation every day and how that

482
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:29,200
affects evaporation and transpiration

483
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:33,200
and water loss out of the soil so what

484
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:35,520
we've created is a a control system that

485
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:38,360
every day is predicting weather using

486
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,320
machine learning is knowing where the

487
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:42,120
plants are in the growth cycle is

488
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,080
figuring out the exact amount of water

489
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:47,559
the plants need in order to get water to

490
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:50,280
maximize productivity but not waste any

491
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:52,720
and it does that every single day as the

492
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:54,440
weather changes and it's also tracking

493
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,000
what the farmers do let's say they

494
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,799
forget to turn on the pump or turn on a

495
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,840
valve or something it will accommodate

496
00:19:57,799 --> 00:20:03,559
for that if they a water deficit and so

497
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:05,360
what we've shown now is that with that

498
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:08,799
very judicious tracking of water and

499
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:12,000
energy we are cutting water usage by

500
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:14,400
more than 40% compared to normal drip

501
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,280
irrigation practice so that already Cuts

502
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,640
water enormously we can cut it by

503
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:21,400
another 40% and we're also cutting

504
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:24,919
energy use by about 40% compared to

505
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:27,240
traditional solar irrigation Solutions

506
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:29,840
so you know that has huge benefits

507
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:32,280
energy and water but what's cool about

508
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:35,280
it as well is hearing Farmers feedback

509
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:37,200
about it because we were really wary of

510
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,240
of whether Farmers would want to adopt

511
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,919
something that kind of steps in for them

512
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:43,679
and makes decisions for them and we in

513
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:47,520
that work we had to go through a huge

514
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:49,600
amount of um farmer interaction and

515
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:52,880
storyboarding how the controller would

516
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,880
work with like a pictorial uh uh

517
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:58,039
diagrams of how they would interact with

518
00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:00,000
it and get that confidence that farmers

519
00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:01,440
were saying yeah you know we could use

520
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,480
this this makes sense we could interact

521
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,840
with it this way on our phone and then

522
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,880
the feedback we keep hearing from

523
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:09,039
farmers who have interacted with it is

524
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:12,640
that they like that decision-making

525
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:15,480
capability they they want ways to reduce

526
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,840
water and reduce costs and reduce energy

527
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,360
and they also know that they can

528
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:21,279
override it they still have manual

529
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:23,320
control but they've actually wanted that

530
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:25,679
intervention that that can help them

531
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:27,799
grow more crops in save water or use the

532
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,279
water they have on a water field to grow

533
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:31,880
even more crops

534
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:34,200
there's a long history around like

535
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:35,520
service learning programs in Academia

536
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:38,799
where you have students going to a

537
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:40,400
village to you know work on some project

538
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:42,240
and the villagers are like well what do

539
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,520
we get out of this in the end and

540
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,520
companies look at it and they're like

541
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,600
well there's no scalable model here but

542
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,320
I think if you go at it from the

543
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:52,240
standpoint of saying hey company there's

544
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:54,960
this massively underserved Market that

545
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,679
has tremendous purchasing power that you

546
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,120
could you could engage and it would

547
00:21:56,679 --> 00:22:01,440
dramatically grow your business and then

548
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,600
also discuss with Farmers like what

549
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:06,440
would make a meaningful impact on their

550
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:08,720
lives and why would they be incentivized

551
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:10,400
to adopt a solution that that informs

552
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,799
you in such a powerful way to make

553
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,640
something that's actually viable and I

554
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:16,559
like I literally have these meetings

555
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,640
with Toro where we're doing Market

556
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:20,720
projections in in the Middle Eastern

557
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,360
Market versus the US market and the

558
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,360
market size is smaller in the Middle

559
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:27,039
East but the growth potential is much

560
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:29,679
larger than in the US so in terms of

561
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:31,440
absolute like Revenue increase they're

562
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:34,039
actually pretty similar with our

563
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,039
technology

564
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,369
[Music]

565
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:48,080
portfolio I wonder if there's enough

566
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:50,760
groups of people with the right

567
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:53,720
incentives as you see it to be

568
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:56,640
innovating in the way that you think

569
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:59,120
Innovation Works best or do you know

570
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,320
what I mean like or academic doing one

571
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,120
thing because they have a career

572
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,320
trajectory and then companies are doing

573
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:05,360
another thing because they have a profit

574
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:06,880
motive and then like there's this sweet

575
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:10,679
spot but not enough people are hitting

576
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:13,200
it I think there's two big barriers to

577
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:15,559
better aligning academic Innovation with

578
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,720
real world impact the first is the

579
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:20,960
incentive structure you can be an

580
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:22,840
excellent accomplished academic by

581
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,279
having ideas that that you can raise

582
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:27,240
some money around writing papers on that

583
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:29,159
getting your colleagues to site them and

584
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:31,440
repeating but there's nothing inherent

585
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:34,400
in that process that necessarily

586
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:37,080
translates out to real world impact and

587
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:40,799
the second I think is is a lack of

588
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:43,960
skills necessarily to do what is really

589
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:46,039
product design where like most most

590
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:48,000
great technical Minds who are in

591
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:50,080
particularly fundamental scientists

592
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,240
they've never done ethnographic work

593
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,480
they're not working you know on field

594
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,880
sites interacting with end users it's a

595
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,440
totally different skill set and it also

596
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:00,720
takes a lot of time and money to do that

597
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:03,480
upfront problem definition work but also

598
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,840
the development of a technology um in

599
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,919
collaboration with stakeholders in a

600
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,320
real life

601
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:11,320
environment we spend crazy amounts of

602
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:13,880
money setting up desalination systems

603
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:15,480
across the world but the information we

604
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:17,600
get is so valuable because we're not

605
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:19,039
only seeing how they run technologically

606
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:22,320
we're seeing how people interact with

607
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:24,720
them and what they like about them so

608
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:27,240
this is actually a really good segue to

609
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:31,120
how I've been trying to address this on

610
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:34,000
a more holistic scale at MIT and so a

611
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:36,520
year ago um I I became the director of

612
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,440
the Kisa yangang Global Engineering

613
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:42,919
Research Center or gear Center and the

614
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:45,440
point of this whole Center is to help

615
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:48,360
grow the impact potential of academic

616
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,919
research by addressing these barriers

617
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:54,120
that I just talked about so the main

618
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:56,399
tasks of the center are first to have a

619
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:59,240
team of people well-seasoned researchers

620
00:24:56,399 --> 00:25:01,399
that can go out do the field work to

621
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:04,000
find really compelling high impact

622
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:06,039
problems but also distill the research

623
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,480
questions out of them that they can be

624
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:11,000
brought back to MIT where we can then

625
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:13,279
engage collaborators and say do the

626
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
great research you're amazing at but

627
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:18,159
please focus on these targets we'll

628
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,720
we'll fund you and we'll also have our

629
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,399
team integrate with you so we can have

630
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,480
your students working in the field we

631
00:25:21,399 --> 00:25:25,600
can help you build field prototypes so

632
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:27,440
we keep evolving the technology towards

633
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,200
impact and then the final part of the

634
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,480
center is having a lot of applied

635
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,520
engineering ability to not only make

636
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:35,760
prototypes but also do technology

637
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:38,120
transfer because an Achilles heel off

638
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:40,240
and of academic Innovation is let's say

639
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,559
if you This brilliant idea but you don't

640
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,520
have a student who wants to start a

641
00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:47,520
company around it we have staff that we

642
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:49,919
can bring in as uh future founders of

643
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,919
companies or who can work with existing

644
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:55,200
companies to facilitate technology

645
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:57,360
transfer through licensing

646
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,960
agreements I I think what what you're

647
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:03,480
talking about Broad is how we can

648
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:07,200
provide people with products or services

649
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:09,080
that are delivering the the capabilities

650
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:12,919
and characteristics that they

651
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:14,600
value it's the best blender or it's the

652
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:17,080
best lawnmower or it's the best

653
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:19,760
irrigation system or the best prosthetic

654
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:21,520
knee it doesn't have to be best though

655
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,960
it has to be one you want to use it's

656
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,799
good it's good where I want it to be

657
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,360
good I'm not making a tradeoff that I'm

658
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:30,320
conscious of that seems to me the sort

659
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:32,279
of gold and fleece of engineering design

660
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,840
if if we could really get there with

661
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:36,840
everything then we could be not

662
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:39,159
knowingly making sacrifices in our

663
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,279
choices and yet doing the right thing

664
00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:42,760
doing the right thing In Spite of

665
00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:45,159
Ourselves or is that a stupid objective

666
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:49,000
no I the reason I chimed in about the

667
00:26:45,159 --> 00:26:51,000
word best is that best drives so much

668
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,960
product development in in wealthy

669
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,799
countries you know you hear about the

670
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:58,480
new whizbang features of the new iPhone

671
00:26:55,799 --> 00:26:59,880
whatever 15 and you trying to get that

672
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,520
little bit better or like you know

673
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:06,320
horsepower in cars which is just so

674
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:08,240
arbitrary and I think a a big part of my

675
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,120
job and in other innovators jobs that

676
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,840
want to work in resource constraints

677
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:16,760
settings is you want to distill what is

678
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:18,240
the core value that consumers want that

679
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:20,720
that make them want to use a product and

680
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,840
derive value from that product and try

681
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:26,799
to trim out all the extraneous stuff all

682
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:28,840
the unnecessary features but then the

683
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:30,880
other side of that coin is you can think

684
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:32,960
about what specific features May

685
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:35,679
resonate with users from different

686
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,000
markets so an example of this is going

687
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:40,000
back to the wheelchair we talked about

688
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:43,080
at the beginning in developing countries

689
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,760
people would not ride in cars very often

690
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:47,799
particularly in rural areas in the US

691
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:50,159
they riding cars all the time so we had

692
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:53,120
to make our wheelchair frame collapsible

693
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:55,440
and the wheels removed really quickly

694
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:57,039
the chairs look very similar between us

695
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,799
and developing countries but that

696
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:00,440
feature was critical

697
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:02,880
to engage the US market so it's

698
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:04,440
transportable in a car and yet it still

699
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,760
has all of the other advantages it might

700
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:08,679
cost a little bit more not a lot yeah

701
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:10,519
well and and it retains the core value

702
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:12,919
which is the ability to propel yourself

703
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:14,640
on a diversity of terrains very fast and

704
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:17,720
efficiently and with an architecture

705
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,320
that's easy to repair using bike parts

706
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:21,320
so when you think about the energy

707
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:23,919
transition just from what you've seen

708
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:27,279
you've seen a lot of the world both here

709
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:31,519
in the US and um in poorer parts of the

710
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:34,480
world what's your thinking around um how

711
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:37,480
well we're doing how well we will do at

712
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:39,640
creating the systems to make that

713
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:41,880
transition I think it all depends on

714
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:45,480
what the pressures are that will drive

715
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:48,200
that adoption I think when you can

716
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:50,519
create a cleaner solution that doesn't

717
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:53,240
introduce any drawbacks and is easy to

718
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:56,720
adopt that's the best win you know if if

719
00:28:53,240 --> 00:29:00,279
a rivan truck could pull a 7,000lb

720
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,960
trailer a miles in a day oh my God that

721
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:05,279
would be amazing but it's not there yet

722
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:07,919
it can't do it I think in the absence of

723
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:10,320
those like one to one or even better

724
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:12,440
Replacements you have to add pressure

725
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,440
from from other standpoints and it and

726
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:17,159
it can be policy pressure economic

727
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:19,600
pressure what I think is a bit myopic

728
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:21,440
sometimes is when the governments get

729
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,880
together and say okay we're going to hit

730
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:26,480
these goals but there's not a real game

731
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:28,720
plan of like how to get there or even

732
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:31,399
when like GM says oh we're going to make

733
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:33,559
all our our vehicles electric by like

734
00:29:31,399 --> 00:29:36,200
2035 you know I think that's a great

735
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:38,360
goal I'm not knocking the goal but

736
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:41,559
without thinking through like not only

737
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:44,320
how you get there but how are you going

738
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:47,279
to actually satisfy existing needs and

739
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:50,640
requirements and desires and not create

740
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:53,039
drawbacks or impose really harsh

741
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,080
penalties you know so people accept the

742
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:56,880
drawbacks I I don't know how you get

743
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:58,640
there yeah you got to pay the piper too

744
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,840
much yeah

745
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,760
it it reminds me of what you talked

746
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:06,320
about with ethnography too like you

747
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:08,799
can't necessarily criticize somebody for

748
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,919
having range anxiety about their car

749
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:12,640
even if you can show them on a

750
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:15,559
spreadsheet see you don't normally drive

751
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:18,519
very far so you shouldn't worry but also

752
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:21,120
that one time you go to the in-law's

753
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:23,480
house a thousand miles away for

754
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,880
Christmas and you can't get there and

755
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,960
you're stuck charging in the middle of

756
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,880
the night that makes a big difference

757
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,159
even though it's one time

758
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:33,760
yeah we we look at this actually like

759
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:37,039
all our like our Dell systems are never

760
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:39,360
100% reliable because of the cost

761
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:41,360
implications to produce a given amount

762
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,080
of water every single day like even when

763
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:46,000
it's cloudy and R out with the solar

764
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:48,919
powered system is nuts so we have to

765
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,159
figure out kind of feel out well what's

766
00:30:48,919 --> 00:30:53,080
good enough and I actually love working

767
00:30:51,159 --> 00:30:55,320
in agriculture because plants through

768
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:57,120
Evolution have figured this out a plant

769
00:30:55,320 --> 00:31:00,240
doesn't need an exact amount of water

770
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:02,399
every day otherwise it it dies no

771
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,720
they've got buffer built into them so if

772
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:06,679
we just play Within that buffer we can

773
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,120
actually be pretty sloppy and still do

774
00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:09,840
pretty well so there must be those

775
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:12,360
natural buffers built into anything I

776
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:14,519
mean cooking yeah you don't starve to

777
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:16,279
death if you miss a meal heating your

778
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:19,840
home or cooling your home well you know

779
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:21,559
you don't need to be at 72.0 degrees at

780
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,399
all times you can tolerate all kinds of

781
00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:25,880
excursions where where do you think the

782
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:27,360
big opportunities are to kind of think

783
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,399
this way and take advantage of those

784
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:32,080
buffers besides the one you've already

785
00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:34,760
mentioned I think it always depends and

786
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:36,279
and it's so culturally it depends on

787
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:38,440
cultural context every time I'll give

788
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:40,279
you an example one of our our big

789
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:42,039
lessons we got out of a a partner we

790
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:45,240
worked with in India on

791
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:47,240
desalination is how people in India over

792
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:50,279
the last 20 years have developed a

793
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:53,039
pallet for very low salinity water that

794
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:55,159
had been treated with reverse osmosis so

795
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:57,519
brands that you would know like Aquafina

796
00:31:55,159 --> 00:32:00,080
or danani in the US they have very very

797
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:02,039
low salt content in them and you can

798
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:04,000
they you can maybe pick up the taste a

799
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:07,120
little bit different than than say like

800
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,960
a well water which may be higher so why

801
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:11,159
this was important to us is we had

802
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,360
designed our early systems around World

803
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:16,760
Health Organization standards of what is

804
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:19,120
healthy to drink and we realized from

805
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:20,840
our partners in India that healthy to

806
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,799
drink water would have too high of a

807
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:24,600
salt content and you and I probably

808
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:27,200
wouldn't pick up on it but people in

809
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:29,720
India would so we had to lower the salt

810
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,919
content of our Pro produced water which

811
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:34,320
had an enormous energetic cost it

812
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:36,760
literally doubled the energy we had to

813
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,279
put in to desalinating the water but I'm

814
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:41,720
glad we caught that because it would

815
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:44,039
have very likely created rejection of

816
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:46,600
the product water we make now that's not

817
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:49,000
the case everywhere if you in a flip

818
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:51,279
side contrast we also work in the Navajo

819
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,799
Nation and in the Navajo Nation people

820
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:56,919
will often drink quite salty water

821
00:32:53,799 --> 00:32:59,720
brackish groundwater and so there it

822
00:32:56,919 --> 00:33:01,760
might be very acceptable to have World

823
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:04,039
Health Organization standard water that

824
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:06,519
you know would taste normal to us taste

825
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:08,840
normal to people in the Navajo Nation

826
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:09,919
but not taste right in India knowing

827
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:13,080
your

828
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:15,159
customer yeah definitely and customers

829
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:17,440
are different everywhere have you ever

830
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:20,720
done focus groups in a rural community

831
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:24,200
in India or a Navajo all the time oh

832
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:27,480
really all the time yeah not only focus

833
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:29,440
groups we we do we will take storyboards

834
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:32,120
of particularly new technology that we

835
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:34,559
haven't designed or invented yet and say

836
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:37,159
Here's how we envision you would maybe

837
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:38,399
interact with it what do you think and

838
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:40,360
and we go through that kind of

839
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:43,240
imagination game and that was

840
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:45,320
tremendously valuable in refining our

841
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:48,080
controller for irrigation systems and

842
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:50,039
how it interfaces through a cell phone

843
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,480
that is what created the app that we run

844
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:53,600
now and we're we're finding it now to

845
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:55,440
make it even better but yeah we do

846
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,919
farmer field days where we get people

847
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,480
together and present the technology and

848
00:33:56,919 --> 00:34:01,039
demonstrate it and get feedback we do

849
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:03,039
lots of focus groups and one-on-one

850
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:05,279
interviews so we've done that very

851
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:07,519
recently in the Navajo Nation uh which

852
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:09,839
is also very water stressed but is a

853
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:12,639
incredibly unique Community because

854
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:15,000
people are so disperse the advantage

855
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:17,440
India has is you have much higher

856
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,560
population concentrations even in rural

857
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,159
areas so there's an economic

858
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,480
justification for having like a

859
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:26,440
community scale system that can serve a

860
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:29,040
few thousand people who are all within

861
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:31,679
walking distance in the navoo nation you

862
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:34,359
have like three families in walking

863
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:37,040
distance and so to do a centralized kind

864
00:34:34,359 --> 00:34:39,800
of big Capital cost system there doesn't

865
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:41,720
make any economic sense and we recently

866
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:44,159
did a study we're we're finishing a

867
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:47,240
publication on this now where we do the

868
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:49,839
economic modeling and we found that

869
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:52,960
individual home scale systems make much

870
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:56,280
more economic sense including the

871
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:58,560
service model of like how many repairmen

872
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:00,040
do we need for this community where

873
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:03,079
they're driving all over the Navajo

874
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:05,520
Nation but with a few service people we

875
00:35:03,079 --> 00:35:07,960
can actually make sure these systems run

876
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:10,720
reliably and we actually learned that

877
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:12,680
service model from an Indian partner

878
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,920
that makes homes scale desalination

879
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:17,240
systems so we knew the frequency and the

880
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:19,640
type of repairs and the cost of repair

881
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:21,680
that was actually economically viable

882
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:23,560
what is the project you're really

883
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:26,040
excited about like what's next what are

884
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:28,880
you working on well with the Advent of

885
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:32,000
gear Center that I'm leading now we are

886
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:36,000
focusing on three primary thrusts which

887
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:38,640
are the water energy food Nexus climate

888
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,880
change mitigation and adaptation and

889
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,920
Global Health Technologies and we're

890
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:45,440
building out portfolios of programs

891
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:49,200
around those themes so in the water

892
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:51,000
energy food Nexus we we are currently

893
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:54,079
trying to bring to fruition our

894
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,720
desalination and irrigation Technologies

895
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:57,839
and the new project right now is

896
00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:00,200
actually converging them do doing

897
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:03,200
desalination for agriculture cuz there's

898
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:04,920
a huge demand for that not only in very

899
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:08,000
water stressed places like the Middle

900
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:10,760
East but also if you look at big a areas

901
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,079
even the in the US the central plains in

902
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:14,160
the in the center of the country in the

903
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:18,079
Central Valley of California they have

904
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:20,280
rackish water so a good robust lowcost

905
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:23,319
solution for desalination for egg would

906
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:26,119
be tremendously valuable so we're doing

907
00:36:23,319 --> 00:36:28,200
that we will start a project this year

908
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:31,319
on hydrogen combustion

909
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:33,640
and the goal is to do a retrofit of

910
00:36:31,319 --> 00:36:35,280
existing internal combustion engines so

911
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:37,560
they can easily burn hydrogen and

912
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,599
ideally be able to switch back and forth

913
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:42,400
between their native fuel of gas or

914
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:43,920
diesel to hydrogen and that is trying to

915
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,880
replicate the model that's been very

916
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:49,240
successful with compressed natural gas

917
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:50,960
used on like taxis in Big polluted

918
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:54,040
cities where you can just switch between

919
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:56,400
gasoline and CNG and so we we've got

920
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:59,119
some ideas of how we could do this but

921
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,319
the ideal would be a bolt-on retrofit

922
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:02,560
where you don't have to change the

923
00:37:00,319 --> 00:37:05,400
engine at all and you can run it on in

924
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:08,520
either hydrogen or a petroleum Fuel and

925
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:11,599
then we're also um over the last decade

926
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:14,599
we've learned a lot about taking a Time

927
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:16,880
variable power source like solar or wind

928
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:19,599
and producing a product from it in a

929
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:22,119
Time variable manner be it desalinated

930
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:24,520
water or like Distributing water for

931
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:26,839
irrigation we are also looking at that

932
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:28,839
for hydrogen production and then the

933
00:37:26,839 --> 00:37:32,440
other the other area where we're just

934
00:37:28,839 --> 00:37:35,040
starting to conceptualize is looking at

935
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:37,839
the services and products and amenities

936
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:40,319
that at risk communities due to climate

937
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:42,359
change are going to need we are working

938
00:37:40,319 --> 00:37:44,240
with Gabriela carolini and the

939
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:46,440
department of urban studies and planning

940
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:50,119
who studies these populations in Brazil

941
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:51,839
is her Focus area and so we this is very

942
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:54,200
early we're we're going to go in and do

943
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:56,599
that ethnographic work to understand

944
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:58,000
what are the likely migration patterns

945
00:37:56,599 --> 00:38:00,040
these communities might have

946
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,359
what does their future look like where

947
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:05,480
will they live what sort of jobs might

948
00:38:02,359 --> 00:38:08,040
they want to do and see can we innovate

949
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:09,680
to try to maximize the productivity and

950
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:11,119
and Health and Welfare of these

951
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:14,000
communities and that gets back to what

952
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:16,000
we talked about earlier in can we do

953
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,370
that with renewable sources where you're

954
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:22,449
you're doing your job but with less

955
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:22,449

energy wow a ton of work a ton of

957
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:31,560
projects to check back in on Amos winter
