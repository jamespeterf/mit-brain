1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:04,319
before I start how many of you don't

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,240
know anything about the media lab or how

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:07,560
many of you know something about the

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,280
media raise your hands if you know

5
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,480
something about the me okay then I I can

6
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,480
go

7
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,439
home I'm I'm not exactly sure how to how

8
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:20,400
to introduce the laboratory to those of

9
00:00:17,439 --> 00:00:22,320
you who who aren't familiar with us so I

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,560
I'll give it a quick try now understand

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,119
i' I've been there since the beginning

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,960
I've been at the media lab for one and a

13
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,960
half times as long as the media lab has

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,680
existed so I'm sort of you know the

15
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,120
voice of Christmas Past in it but I I'll

16
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,719
give you a little glimpse of that when

17
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:42,879
we actually opened our doors in

18
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:45,360
1985 we were what the name implies we

19
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:48,199
worked on media and that is to say we

20
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,480
worked on digitizing sound light

21
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:53,640
pictures movies

22
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:57,079
voice text everything you could imagine

23
00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:00,239
because we had foreseen a future where

24
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:03,280
computers and Communications were going

25
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:06,680
to become part of everyday life which

26
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,840
wasn't true in the 1970s and the 1980s

27
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,159
computers were used for serious purposes

28
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,040
like ballistics and printing your

29
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:16,840
electric bill but they weren't personal

30
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:19,479
utilities and we saw that era coming so

31
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:22,040
these types of of transitions of media

32
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:24,759
to becoming digital was what we were

33
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,759
founded on and what was interesting

34
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:28,920
about it and well and many things that

35
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:32,000
are interesting about it but one that

36
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,960
that's a Hallmark in in my mind was said

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,439
by Nicholas Negron who's sort of really

38
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:41,439
the official founder of the laboratory

39
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:44,040
is that that we were at in those days

40
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:48,079
what he used to call a Salon de refu for

41
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:50,159
electrical engineers it was for kids who

42
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:53,079
were electrical engineers but couldn't

43
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,799
reconcile a career in engineering with

44
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:58,000
their love of mountain climbing or

45
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:01,119
swimming or horseback riding or painting

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,039
or playing music and so we took those

47
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:06,920
people I won't call them rejects I would

48
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:09,720
rather think of them as people plus okay

49
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:13,080
they were you know more dimensional than

50
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:16,800
than the average engineer which MIT was

51
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:19,239
very much about in in those early days

52
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,760
and so it was the ad mixture and breadth

53
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:25,640
and diversity of those those kids I

54
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:28,560
guess I was a kid then too that that

55
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:31,239
helped form what the media lab is really

56
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,160
all about and and this is what I think

57
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:35,760
our our our motto is essentially we are

58
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:40,200
technology and service of human

59
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:42,239
expression creativity and learning now

60
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:45,920
when we form the

61
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,760
laboratory um and this is this slide is

62
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,120
a sense of of what the scale of the

63
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,879
laboratory is now um it was obviously

64
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,120
quite a bit smaller but but we did

65
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,760
several things that were Innovative in

66
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,159
our organization itself notice I'm not

67
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,319
telling you anything about what we do

68
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:06,280
okay I will but others will say that

69
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:08,840
better than me um but the the point was

70
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,599
we threw all of these people together

71
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:14,200
into a tiny building where they all had

72
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,799
to interact with each other and we built

73
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,959
a model of

74
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:21,000
organization that made sure there were

75
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:23,879
no closed doors that everything was open

76
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,959
and everyone could cross fertilize ideas

77
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:28,519
and concepts with everybody else there

78
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:30,480
weren't pockets in the laboratory rather

79
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:32,599
it was one big cauld

80
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,640
and we did that through our funding we

81
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:37,280
had a Consortium model we were funded

82
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,840
and still are to a great extent by

83
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,439
industry and they fund the lab as a

84
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,640
whole in addition to sometimes doing

85
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:46,599
special projects with individuals but

86
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,319
that funding of the laboratory as a

87
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:52,159
whole promotes that openness and anyone

88
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:55,879
who joins the laboratory has access to

89
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:58,879
anything done anywhere in the laboratory

90
00:03:55,879 --> 00:04:02,000
and in return for that we give the

91
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:03,959
students the licensed to explore their

92
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,400
passions okay because they don't have to

93
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:08,680
write a proposal all they have to do is

94
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,840
spend the night there and in the morning

95
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,959
when their faculty lead comes in show

96
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:16,400
them a new idea and that person's going

97
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:18,120
to say yes go ahead and run with it and

98
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,320
those are the kinds of ideas and those

99
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,919
are the kinds of places from which

100
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,800
novelty and new ideas emerge sometimes

101
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:29,960
we think of the laboratory as building a

102
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:32,680
better world because in those early days

103
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:34,759
it was a world of possibilities whatever

104
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,680
you could do whatever you could imagine

105
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:38,759
you could do it was a very different

106
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,919
time now we're in a world of

107
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:42,360
responsibilities and what we do we have

108
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:44,600
responsibilities to we have

109
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,880
responsibilities to the Earth we have

110
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:49,560
responsibilities to people we have

111
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:52,440
responsibilities to the Future and those

112
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,800
responsibilities guide and bracket the

113
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:57,120
work so we sometimes say we're here to

114
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,919
Build a Better World I think that's a

115
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,199
byproduct we're here to build better

116
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:03,639
people and we're here to invent better

117
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,240
ideas and those better people and those

118
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:09,039
better ideas both our students and our

119
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,919
graduates and our sponsors better ideas

120
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:14,280
and better people those people will we

121
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:17,479
hope build a better

122
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:20,120
world through the course of the history

123
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:22,680
of the laboratory that

124
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:25,720
mission technology and service of human

125
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:28,800
expression and more okay has remained

126
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,160
constant but what's changed and evolved

127
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,400
over the years

128
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:36,199
is that the Technologies with which we

129
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:38,400
ex use to explore those ideas have grown

130
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:40,600
because as we have grown we have always

131
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,440
brought in people that brought a new

132
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:46,080
dimension to the laboratory so it's a

133
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,280
lot more than digital media now there

134
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,919
are people of course who still work on

135
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,039
things like Opera there are people who

136
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,319
work on human interfaces there are

137
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:55,919
people who work on Communications but

138
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:57,800
there are also people who work on

139
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,160
Prosthetics there are people who work on

140
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:03,560
medicine there are people who work on

141
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:07,840
biology all of those things are all done

142
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:10,360
in service of humanity and being driven

143
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:13,280
by human principles I I'll just give you

144
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:15,800
one quick example it's one of my one of

145
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,160
my people often say you know what what's

146
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,720
your favorite project in the laboratory

147
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,520
and you're not supposed to have one

148
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,240
right you know you're supposed to love

149
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:25,240
it all but I do have a project that in

150
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:28,120
my mind stands out and indicates the

151
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:31,680
passion that drives the work and this is

152
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:34,800
done by a young faculty member Janan and

153
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:38,440
what she has created is she has created

154
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:41,759
an electronic bra okay that does

155
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:46,319
longitudinal sensing via Ultrasonics to

156
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:49,680
test for breast cancer and that's works

157
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:52,400
well enough so that it is now in FDA

158
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,800
testing and because of the longitudinal

159
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,879
nature of it it can be more accurate

160
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,919
than a mammogram every six months or

161
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:02,680
every year so so this is now you can see

162
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:05,039
the passion there you can guess without

163
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:07,560
my saying it that there's probably

164
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:10,039
something in jinan's background that

165
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:12,800
drove her to do that and drove her to

166
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:14,919
think about that as a new idea but you

167
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,280
can also think of that project in two

168
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:20,319
ways and one of them is to say well it's

169
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,759
just another wearable and that's fine

170
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,280
but when we use the word wearable today

171
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:27,440
what comes to mind what comes to mind is

172
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,039
a watch right and oh we're going to put

173
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,440
a new sensor in we're watch and you're

174
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,319
going to tell if if you're anemic or

175
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,520
diabetic or how many steps you've walked

176
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:37,319
and all of those kinds of things and

177
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:40,360
that's what wearables are to some people

178
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:44,960
but you know what around the

179
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:47,919
world not everybody wears a $600 watch

180
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:50,599
but they do wear bras so this is a

181
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:52,919
revolution in the way you think about

182
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:55,879
health care particularly health care for

183
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:58,199
women that has impact around the world

184
00:07:55,879 --> 00:08:00,039
it's not another wearable it's a

185
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:02,759
dimensional change

186
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:05,960
in the way that problem is tackled and

187
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:08,440
that is in some sense the epitome of the

188
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:10,879
media laboratory but there's also fun

189
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:14,199
involved and that's the thing that makes

190
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:17,360
the place interesting we don't pick out

191
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:20,800
fun you know we don't say we do serious

192
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:23,680
work and we do fun your serious work is

193
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,960
fun and it better be fun because if you

194
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:29,560
don't merge those two things then you're

195
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:31,400
doing exactly the wrong thing so just

196
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,479
give you you know one example of that

197
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,240
and then I'm going to kind of get off

198
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,839
the

199
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,440
stage

200
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:42,039
um uh let me go see if I can go back to

201
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,320
the the original

202
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:46,240
slide this kind of you know kind of says

203
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,920
it all okay so you know years and years

204
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,600
ago we got a laser cutter right

205
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,640
everybody knows about laser cutters they

206
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,040
cut plastic they etch and they do all of

207
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,440
those kinds of things one of the people

208
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:58,120
in the laboratory took it and he etched

209
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,279
food so he took crackers and he etched

210
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,640
the recipe for the crackers on the food

211
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:04,920
he took zucchini and he took eggplant

212
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,560
and he took nuts and he he did those

213
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:10,040
things those are the things that to me

214
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:13,040
are the epitome of the laboratory the

215
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:16,120
notion of that combination of artistry

216
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:18,399
science design and Engineering not

217
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:21,000
necessarily in one head but pervasive

218
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:23,200
throughout the laboratory and encouraged

219
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,800
in all of the people who do it that's

220
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,320
the Laboratories all about over the

221
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,560
course of Our Lives you could say what

222
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:32,600
came of that well phone slave which was

223
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,000
done in the early days of the lab was a

224
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,720
a Hallmark a model that paved the way

225
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,200
for people to make conversational

226
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,920
systems we did space we did Ein in I

227
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,880
personally think one of our greatest

228
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:47,240
contributions to the world is CSS and

229
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,399
for those of you not familiar with these

230
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:52,480
kinds of acronyms that's cascading

231
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:55,959
stylesheets CSS is what makes the web

232
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:58,600
what it was because in 1995 we noticed

233
00:09:55,959 --> 00:10:00,880
it was anti-design because the author

234
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:03,279
could not lay out the page the way that

235
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:07,800
he wanted browsers would interpret it

236
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:10,079
differently so hwon Lee um developed CSS

237
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,440
we never made a scent off it but on the

238
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:15,760
other hand it's impacted billions and

239
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:19,200
that's what we hope to do passion Drive

240
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:21,560
diversity excellence and impact and

241
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:26,000
impacting billions and you are all

242
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:26,000
welcome to join in that thank you
