00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:32,960
hello everybody and congratulations on

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,960
on getting problem set seven in this is

3
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:40,760
Michael cubert and I'm going to unlock a

4
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:43,079
new set of features on chords for you

5
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:45,200
now that you have successfully

6
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:48,680
implemented some of them yourself so I'm

7
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:51,079
going to go ahead and um import the

8
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:53,359
chord module from music 21 and we

9
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:58,079
remember that within the chord module is

10
00:00:53,359 --> 00:01:02,320
the capital c chord class so we'll say c

11
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:06,680
um major equals chord. chord and we'll

12
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:09,479
say C4 E4 G4 um by the way when creating

13
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:12,640
a chord we can do um we can create it a

14
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:17,439
couple different ways uh you can put it

15
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:20,600
as um a list of strings we can make it a

16
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:23,280
single space separated string or if we

17
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:25,320
really want to do this um if we want to

18
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,600
be painful for ourselves but sometimes

19
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:33,439
that's how we'll do it we'll create um

20
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:37,880
four equals pitch p. pitch

21
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:41,759
C4 E4 is pitch. pitch E4

22
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:44,320
and the next one G4S pitch up Pitch G4

23
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,079
and then we can make C major

24
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:50,840
equals

25
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:53,399
um a list of those already created pitch

26
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:56,000
objects and depending on what context

27
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:58,600
you're doing one of these will be easier

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,200
than others um we could also do it with

29
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,200
a list of no objects but not going to

30
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,920
demonstrate that now in any case we have

31
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:09,280
C major and we have this chord going on

32
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:12,440
and that's all nice and fun okay do that

33
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,280
so in within this chord um one of the

34
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:18,000
things we can do is we can get the root

35
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,200
of it and takes a little bit of time so

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,120
I've made it a function call a method

37
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:26,000
call on that um so that seems to work

38
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,599
and get the base of the same chord and

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,640
that's the same thing here because the

40
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:33,840
inversion is

41
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:39,239
oops the inversion is zero great now

42
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:40,800
let's do um C major 6 um not in the

43
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:43,080
chord symol sense but in the Roman

44
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,159
numeral figured base six as in first

45
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:48,120
inversion we'll create chord. chord

46
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:52,280
think through it before you copy down

47
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:54,480
what I'm going to write great E4 C5 oh

48
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:56,200
let's let's go and put in open position

49
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:02,720
C major

50
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:06,519
6 root it's still C base it's still an e

51
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:10,239
but now oh is now an e uh because the

52
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:12,640
inversion is one great we can set the

53
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,640
inversion

54
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,640
here

55
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:26,239
and see that everything has moved up

56
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:29,280
above the G and um moved all the way up

57
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:31,920
it's pretty far up there so maybe we'll

58
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:37,120
do six.

59
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:39,120
transpose in place oops transpose down

60
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:44,200
let's say down two octaves and place

61
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:46,120
equals true and now we're here and uh

62
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,640
I'm just realizing that this inversion

63
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,239
thing should have returned a new chord

64
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:52,519
or something like that so I'll put in

65
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:56,560
Tod do let see make

66
00:03:52,519 --> 00:04:00,280
inversion not return uh

67
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,360
not in place

68
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,079
and just in case you're watching this

69
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:07,120
video later and you're inversion to

70
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:08,720
something else that's I fix that problem

71
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,760
okay so these are some of the things

72
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,599
that we can do here um notice let's go

73
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:17,959
back to create our original first

74
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:20,239
inversion chord um great

75
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:22,600
and some of the other things we can do

76
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:29,000
those notes are pretty far apart so we

77
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:32,479
can say um C Mage 6 closed equals c

78
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,320
major 6 in

79
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:39,240
closed

80
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:43,240
position and now we see see s in closed

81
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:46,960
position keep still keeps that e in the

82
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:48,800
base um but figured out that hey that c

83
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:54,080
that g could move all the way down to

84
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:57,080
octave 4 because C4 would be below E4 C5

85
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:59,479
only gets left there so these are some

86
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:01,120
of the things that we can be doing with

87
00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:03,440
uh with the kinds of things that we're

88
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,520
doing with chords in

89
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:10,759
our most recent problem

90
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:14,160
set here's an a a little interesting

91
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:16,080
thing with roots that I'd hoped to get

92
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:21,120
to in class but now we can talk about

93
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,120
it's one of these strange moments in

94
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:29,199
music so one of the things that came up

95
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:31,400
in our discussion was of course finding

96
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:34,039
the root and when you were working on

97
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:36,520
finding the rout you know on something

98
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:40,199
like uh C major

99
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:44,160
Triad okay that's pretty easy then um

100
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:46,720
you end up with a little bit harder is C

101
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,919
major tried an open position and maybe

102
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,160
even harder is you know let's do it an

103
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:55,000
open position and an inversion and all

104
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:58,080
of these of course the route is going to

105
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,560
be C but how did we do

106
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,319
this I haven't had chance to go through

107
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,639
everybody's um everybody's assignments

108
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:07,639
yet but there's different possibilities

109
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:10,039
some of which are more efficient some of

110
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:13,720
which are less efficient but basically

111
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:17,080
whichever route you chose it ends up

112
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:20,120
usually trying to find some way to

113
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:22,039
permute each of the U Notes so maybe we

114
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,080
we rewrite them all to be in the same

115
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:28,039
octave

116
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:31,400
so and then we try various permutations

117
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:35,599
maybe we rotate below so we take uh the

118
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:39,000
top note and move it down so um down to

119
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:42,680
here and we have some sort of a template

120
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,039
in mind and that template says that when

121
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:48,199
you have stacked

122
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:50,440
thirds then the lowest note is the root

123
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:53,400
so here we don't have stack thirds what

124
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:56,199
do we have we have a fourth and then a

125
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:58,240
third above it we would say 64 in

126
00:06:56,199 --> 00:07:00,599
figured base but you think of it this

127
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,280
way and here we don't have it we have a

128
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:05,400
third and a fourth above it we call 63

129
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:09,440
position and we don't have it so we go

130
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:17,120
one more time and here we have

131
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:19,560
um this which we know is um 33 or 53 and

132
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,240
this is our perfect solution and yay

133
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,840
we're super happy and the cool thing is

134
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:28,720
that this kind of work works just as

135
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:31,360
well with um with seventh chords so

136
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,599
let's say we're doing

137
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,479
um here we're going to use some of the

138
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:38,000
same notes but we'll be a dominant

139
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:42,280
seventh

140
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,599
type um position in F major something

141
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:47,919
like that and we can again start moving

142
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:50,840
things into the same

143
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:55,560
octave I always make little noises when

144
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:58,639
I make chords and um we can see nope

145
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:01,319
what do we have here we have third third

146
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:07,280
second so that's doesn't work we'll take

147
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:07,280
the top note bring it down an octave

148
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:14,120
oops just AAL enough that I want all my

149
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:17,800
notes to be in blue so today so we can

150
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:21,599
do something like this and voila we have

151
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:25,680
what do we have third third third and

152
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:27,759
we're all happy and so the route is C

153
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:32,599
again

154
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:37,000
but what Happ happens if we have um a

155
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:40,680
knife well I won't make it a knif chord

156
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:44,480
you can again put it into this

157
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:48,640
particular position and voila we have

158
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:51,839
C9 whatever inversion it's in and so on

159
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:54,399
uh but let's take a second and listen to

160
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,880
a piece of music that going to challenge

161
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:59,839
some of our assumptions about what does

162
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,640
a root mean maybe go beyond what we've

163
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,160
seen in our Theory classes but the type

164
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:07,480
of things we have to consider as

165
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:09,880
computational music analysis analysts

166
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,880
whatever we

167
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,040
are the piece we're going to discuss is

168
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,800
by Benjamin Britain it's his Opera Peter

169
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:21,360
Grimes from

170
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:23,640
1945 and we're going to be looking at

171
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,800
one of the last scenes of the Opera

172
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:29,519
where the main character Peter Grimes uh

173
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:32,480
has become deranged and lost his mind

174
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:34,920
and believes the accusations that have

175
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:38,480
been made against him that he has been

176
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:40,440
killing his assistants when uh really

177
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,920
the most recent one has just died in a

178
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:45,200
tragic mishap and uh the music that

179
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,200
we're going to be listening to there's

180
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,279
no singing It's the music that

181
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,279
accompanies him going out to sea to

182
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:54,360
drown himself so it's a very somber

183
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:57,560
moment I want you to listen particularly

184
00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:00,959
though to the arpeggiated chord played

185
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,959
by the harp

186
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:45,480
[Music]

187
00:10:49,610 --> 00:11:00,009
[Music]

188
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:12,759
[Music]

189
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,920
let's look at that chord from the harp

190
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:22,279
in detail

191
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:28,360
it's starts in the base cluff with uh f

192
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:30,480
a c contining up e g b d and then coming

193
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,760
back down

194
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:37,040
and when we put it into treble cluff and

195
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:39,399
stack everything up we see that fa d g

196
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:42,880
Etc we basically have a whole bunch of

197
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:45,959
Stack thirds going all the way up and so

198
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,959
that's an f13 chord so we know the rout

199
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:49,600
because we see all of the stack thirds

200
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:52,079
but now let's take the root and we'll

201
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:57,680
move to the top so we'll start on a c e

202
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:59,440
g b d f and hey that's also stack third

203
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:03,120
so our original chord could be an a a

204
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,680
13th chord um in first inversion I don't

205
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,320
know what the figured Bas symbol is for

206
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:10,360
that but then we can also Take the A and

207
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:14,000
put it to the top and see that hey c e

208
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:17,480
GB d f a that's also a stack of thirds

209
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,639
so this is a C3 chord in second

210
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:22,720
inversion okay let's see what happens in

211
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:27,120
music 21 when we try to do something

212
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:32,160
with this so we'll um import everything

213
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:34,199
oh Le we just need cord this case and um

214
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:38,440
let's create an f11

215
00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:39,680
chord and so we'll do it the same way as

216
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:43,720
the

217
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:51,120
um as we're doing with the Peter Grim so

218
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:54,800
F3 A3 C4 E4 G4 B flat 4 uh we're leaving

219
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,519
out that high D for now and when we look

220
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,760
at

221
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:02,440
f11 root is the F3 it's in

222
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:06,360
version We gu in root position great

223
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:09,600
let's take that B flat 4 down um to the

224
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:12,279
lowest part we'll put it in B flat

225
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:16,320
2 and now something like

226
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:18,839
that and will we find the root of this

227
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,600
it's still an f and it's in the

228
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:25,440
inversion where the 11th is in the base

229
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:27,480
which we all learned in no didn't uh is

230
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:31,320
fifth

231
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:32,800
oops is fifth in inversion here okay so

232
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:36,519
that's going along pretty well now let's

233
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:40,079
create the f13 chord in

234
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:47,040
inversion and we'll put same that B flat

235
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:51,720
2 F3 A3 C4 E4 G4 and we'll add that D5

236
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:54,160
at the top and what used to happen when

237
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:56,079
you called root in this point is it

238
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:59,480
would crash until you couldn't find the

239
00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:02,040
root this chord eventually I found that

240
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:04,519
to be kind of annoying that you had to

241
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:07,279
code around a special case that you

242
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:10,959
could have a 13th chord or something

243
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:15,959
would uh crash so I've just decided that

244
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:19,360
um the root of a 13th chord is always

245
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:21,880
whatever note is in the base so this

246
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:26,360
case

247
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:30,199
um now I put the BF in the base so now

248
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:34,480
that's the now that's the root and the

249
00:14:30,199 --> 00:14:38,399
inversion is always in root position

250
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:41,759
which is kind of uh you know that's also

251
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:43,959
maybe a problematic thing that you can

252
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:46,160
take the same notes rearrange them and

253
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:48,279
put them in a different place and uh the

254
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,399
inversion stays the same but the root

255
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:52,720
changes so that's just a little thing on

256
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:56,079
how 13th chords are a little bit

257
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:58,839
different than every other chord and why

258
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:01,079
computational musicology computational

259
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:04,079
music music theory is so much fun thanks

260
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:04,079
everybody
