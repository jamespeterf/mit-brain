1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,759
thank you uh my name is JJ I'm the uh

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,240
Chief scientist and co-founder of tupai

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,679
uh which is a startup SP of my lab MIT

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,080
uh focusing on Innovative optic

5
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:15,879
Solutions so today we all live in a

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,640
information era and nowadays more and

7
00:00:15,879 --> 00:00:20,160
more information are now being delivered

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,240
and processed in the form of light as a

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,640
result the optical systems are also

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,279
getting larger in size and more complex

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,599
this has become a showstopper for many

12
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,560
applications so now if you look closely

13
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,120
into Optical system you found that they

14
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,760
really have not changed that much over

15
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,960
the past few decades on one hand you

16
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,039
have glass lenses that deliver high

17
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,440
performance but they have to be

18
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:45,399
fabricated using grinding and polishing

19
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:47,600
that is costly and not scalable on the

20
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:49,760
other hand you have polymer lenses or

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,320
plastic lenses that can be manufactured

22
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,160
at extremely low cost using moding but

23
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,520
they suffer from concerns in terms of

24
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,559
performance and

25
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,359
reliability when it comes to packaging

26
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:02,519
assembly you also have to put together

27
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,320
one of these lenses are one by one piece

28
00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:06,720
by piece with a careful alignment

29
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,479
between them and as a result this Le to

30
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,560
traditional Optical modules that are

31
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:14,080
complex larg in size and also

32
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,799
costly so we at two Pi Optics have

33
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,560
developed this matter plus Optics

34
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:20,200
technology to address this challenge so

35
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,079
the main idea here is that we want to

36
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,759
leverage mature semiconductor technology

37
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:27,720
that's been developed in the IC industry

38
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:29,640
to transform Optics more specifically

39
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,759
unlike traditional Optics where we using

40
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,119
Cur curved surfaces to B propagation of

41
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,360
light we actually fabricate these tiny

42
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:38,600
little structures Optical antennas on a

43
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,360
wafer and they are designed so that they

44
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,360
can precisely control light proping

45
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:44,520
direction to impart different Optical

46
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:47,079
functions when it comes to packaging

47
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,680
assembly we can then actually stack and

48
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:51,719
bond multiple of these wers together

49
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,200
each of them containing array of this

50
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:57,240
flat Optics components with lithographic

51
00:01:54,200 --> 00:02:00,399
Precision in the end we then dice them

52
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:03,360
each wafer into hundreds or thousands of

53
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,880
packaged miniaturized Optical modules so

54
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,080
the end product are this Optical modules

55
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,160
that has a fo factor of a small chip

56
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,560
that deliver high performance Superior

57
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,519
compared to glass lenses and also low

58
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,840
cost and scalable manufacturing similar

59
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:19,080
to that of plastic

60
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,560
Optics so now just show you a couple of

61
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,680
examples where our technology has

62
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,480
already been applied uh one example here

63
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,920
is a driver monitoring systems of DMS so

64
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,239
DMS are basically small cameras on

65
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,239
passenger vehicles uh they essentially L

66
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,519
drivers when they getting distracted in

67
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,640
driving so traditional DMS requires a

68
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,720
stack of glass and polymer lenses

69
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:42,000
they're complicated to assemble uh in

70
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,760
our case we can replace all of them with

71
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,280
one single piece of our met plus Optics

72
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:50,519
and this give rise to Superior thermal

73
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,480
and mechanical uh robustness which is

74
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:53,720
critical to meet the stringent demands

75
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,319
of Automotive

76
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:58,280
regulations at the same time we can also

77
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,959
provide higher resolution which is

78
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,840
important to improve the detection

79
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:04,440
accuracy and lower the force alarm rate

80
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,519
so through a collaboration with our

81
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,440
Foundry partner we have already realized

82
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:10,280
mass production of this type of Optics

83
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:12,040
and they have been delivered to Leading

84
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,840
Tier 1 and tier 2 suppliers in the

85
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,519
automotive industry and we have received

86
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,840
excellent feedback from our

87
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:20,680
customers the second example where our

88
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,799
technology has made an impact is in

89
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,879
augmented reality and virtual reality

90
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:28,640
systems in state of the arvr modules uh

91
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:30,760
you typically has anywhere from 15 to 20

92
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,560
individual Optical sensors to perform

93
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:35,599
functions such as hand uh uh gestural

94
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,680
recognition eye tracking hand tracking

95
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:41,599
and so on and as a result the size and

96
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:43,720
weight of the sensors adds up quickly in

97
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,840
our case we can deliver sensors they are

98
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,640
far more compact lightweight and that

99
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,360
can also be similarly integrated with

100
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:52,799
arvr modules uh we can offer higher

101
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,799
resolution and also a large Field view

102
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,280
comparable to that of human peripheral

103
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:00,079
vision and this is crucial in delivering

104
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,920
an immersive user experience so this

105
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:04,560
performances has already been tested and

106
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,680
validated by key OEM vendors across the

107
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,799
world and we are now transitioning into

108
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:12,640
mass production of this

109
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:14,079
product so in summary we believe that we

110
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,680
have developed this kind of platform

111
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:17,759
technology that can Empower many

112
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,759
applications across different sectors

113
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,959
from consumer electronics to automotive

114
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,479
and robotic sensing uh to Medical

115
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:26,560
Imaging and Beyond so we definitely

116
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,479
welcome uh collaboration opportunities

117
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,320
and partnership with you so if you're

118
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,800
interested please do stop by our booth

119
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:37,560
and I would love to chat thank

120
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,560
you thank you so much JJ
