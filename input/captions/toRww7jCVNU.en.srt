1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:07,600
so it's a pleasure to kick off this

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:09,679
Symposium for the third time um my name

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,280
is Sumaya I am a senior group leader at

4
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,559
the Bro Institute um and running

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:17,199
bioinformatics and machine learning

6
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:19,960
group I have a couple of thank you to

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,439
give before we can start thanks to the

8
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:24,279
organizing committee the entire

9
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,800
committee is here I hope um it takes a

10
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:29,119
village to organize a symposium invite

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,000
everyone and a lot of time and effort is

12
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:34,280
invested into it so thanks to everyone

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,239
especially this year we started our

14
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:39,640
pre-symposium workshop and I received

15
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:43,239
very good feedback that it went

16
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:46,160
extremely well and it was an engaging

17
00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:49,039
Workshop uh then our advisers they

18
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:52,160
helped us through the speaker selection

19
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:55,239
and throughout the um year so thanks to

20
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,440
all our advisers um then our generous

21
00:00:55,239 --> 00:01:01,680
sponsors thank you

22
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:05,400
all um next uh comes our line of

23
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,640
speakers as you can see uh they are um

24
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,920
the Stellar scientist in Academia and

25
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:13,240
Industry and we are very thankful for

26
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,439
traveling all the way and attending this

27
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:18,720
Symposium and then our lightning talk

28
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:22,119
winners so this is kind of um the

29
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:25,079
spotlight of the show that we invite one

30
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:27,280
minute uh five minutes talk one slides

31
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:29,119
and I am looking forward to those talks

32
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,520
H and these are our winners for this

33
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:34,159
year you will get certificates and prize

34
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:37,040
money and we will have award session to

35
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:39,759
to uh recognize um your

36
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:43,119
achievements and next is we will have

37
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:45,880
poster winners four poster winners the

38
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:48,960
posters will be judged by its content on

39
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:51,719
the poster and visuals so don't don't

40
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,680
feel obliged to stay there and present

41
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:58,200
feel free to network and hang around and

42
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:01,680
we that those will be judged by the

43
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:04,119
content um then uh we have a QR code on

44
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,439
your program that you can scan if you

45
00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:08,640
want to look at the abstracts that were

46
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:10,000
submitted and the posters that are

47
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,760
displayed out

48
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,879
there okay so with that it's my pleasure

49
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:19,239
to introduce Pat Walters uh to kick off

50
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:21,560
the Symposium um uh Pat Walters uh is

51
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:23,920
the chief data officer in in relay

52
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,120
Therapeutics I think you probably all

53
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,000
know about Pat so I will not go into the

54
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:31,519
long bio but I'll give a shout out to

55
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,879
Pat's block post that I'm very much fan

56
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,400
of the Practical chem informatics go

57
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:39,239
there it's it's very resourceful and

58
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,239
with that Pat

59
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:44,599
Walters so many of you know me from

60
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:46,840
yelling at people about statistics um

61
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:48,760
I'll do a little bit of that but I was

62
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,599
asked to provide a rousing introduction

63
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:55,040
so I think this has been a really

64
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:57,920
exciting year for machine learning in

65
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:01,599
drug Discovery we all saw that both the

66
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:04,799
chemistry and biology prizes went to

67
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:07,360
work on machine learning in particular

68
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:09,319
the chemistry prize went to David Baker

69
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,480
and the team from Deep Mind for protein

70
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:13,920
structure prediction it was very

71
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,440
exciting that we saw the alpha fold 3

72
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,400
paper come out and then it was

73
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,040
incredibly disappointing because there

74
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:23,239
was no code and none of us can actually

75
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,599
do anything interesting with the API

76
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:27,239
that they've

77
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:29,840
provided however you know I'm happy to

78
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:34,480
see that there are a lot of efforts out

79
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:37,120
there now to reproduce Alpha fold uh

80
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,799
anybody who's interested in this I'd

81
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:43,439
highly recommend looking at Charlie

82
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:46,200
Harris's blog post that he updates

83
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:49,760
regularly and that kind of gets you up

84
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:51,560
todate on all the efforts to reproduce

85
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,400
Alpha fold 3 and Charlie is actually

86
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,920
trying things out

87
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,920
too you know I think it's been a bit of

88
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:02,519
a mixed bag in terms of clinical trials

89
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:04,319
for AI focused drug Discovery companies

90
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:07,040
during the summer there was this paper

91
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:09,480
that came out from drug Discovery today

92
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:12,159
written by a group at Boston Consulting

93
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,159
Group who clearly does not understand

94
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,919
our

95
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:18,919
field and this paper

96
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:21,519
claims that AI focused drug Discovery

97
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:23,800
companies have been more successful in

98
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,880
phase one clinical

99
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,960
trials somebody wants to come to me on

100
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,960
the break I'll explain to you the 12

101
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,000
things that are wrong with that paper

102
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,919
and Dereck low had a nice blog post

103
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
where he pointed out that the phase 2

104
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:39,639
results although there are only a few

105
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,880
have been a little

106
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:44,320
disappointing however you know insert

107
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:46,000
your favorite sports metaphor it's early

108
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,400
in the game and I don't know if we can

109
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,440
make any conclusions there yet one of

110
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:54,360
the things that I'm most excited about

111
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:56,960
though is data on Wednesday I was at an

112
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:59,720
AI and Drug Discovery Symposium at

113
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,800
Boston University there were two panels

114
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,800
in a row that came to the conclusion

115
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:08,280
that the biggest thing holding the field

116
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:11,680
back to this date is a lack of high

117
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:14,800
quality large data sets and you know

118
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,520
I've written extensively about all the

119
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,199
problems with molecule net and the

120
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,280
therapeutic data Commons and the fact

121
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:23,800
that those data sets should never be

122
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:26,440
used for anything however there's some

123
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,560
really exciting work going on one of the

124
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:32,000
things I'm most excited about is the

125
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,560
open admy consult so this is a an effort

126
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,240
that's spearheaded by Jamie Fraser at

127
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,639
UCSF John Cadera at Memorial Sloan

128
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:43,280
ketering and some of the folks at octant

129
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:46,680
bio and this effort has two aims one is

130
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:49,800
to generate large highquality adme data

131
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,680
sets and make them publicly available

132
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,319
second and I think I'm even more excited

133
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,960
about this is to do structural biology

134
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:59,720
on off targets the structural biology

135
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:02,479
Community has largely ignored her

136
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:04,639
cytochrome p450s pxr Other Drug

137
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:07,599
metabolizing enzymes so I think this

138
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,400
combination of highquality data and

139
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:12,759
structural information could be

140
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:15,960
incredibly powerful you know I'm a big

141
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:18,599
fan of using machine learning together

142
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:21,720
with DNA encoded Library data

143
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:24,240
unfortunately until very recently there

144
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:26,000
was one publicly available data set

145
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,360
there was a Carbonic and hydrates data

146
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,759
set from the broad was relatively small

147
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,479
it's it's great that there have been

148
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:34,199
some great papers that have appeared

149
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,800
this year there was a paper from Somaya

150
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:38,400
there was a paper from En silico there

151
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,720
was a paper from University of North

152
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,280
Carolina but even better people are

153
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:46,240
releasing more data sets it was a great

154
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,599
kaggle competition sponsored by leash

155
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,280
bio and the structural genomics

156
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:54,319
Consortium has an effort called air

157
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,879
check to collect all of these data sets

158
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,919
and make them available in a consistent

159
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:01,360
format so I'm hoping you with some of

160
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:04,240
these efforts around data we can push

161
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,840
the field forward a lot of people ask me

162
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,840
where should I go to find good data sets

163
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:12,199
there's a great effort that's been put

164
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:15,560
together by a group around a website

165
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:18,680
called Polaris hub.io Polaris is

166
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,800
collecting data sets making them

167
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:23,280
available but also providing

168
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,840
recommendations and having industry

169
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:30,360
experts evaluate those data sets Polaris

170
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:33,400
has workflows for data curation and it

171
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:35,599
has workflows for method comparison so

172
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:38,720
there's a lot of great resources there

173
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:40,879
for people who are interested in protein

174
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:44,000
liant interaction so docking coold

175
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:46,400
folding activity prediction we no longer

176
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,199
have to deal with pdb bind there's a

177
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,440
much better larger data set out there

178
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,759
there's been a group in both industry

179
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,919
and Academia that's put together this

180
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:59,800
plender data set it's very large it has

181
00:07:56,919 --> 00:08:02,400
rationally defined train and test splits

182
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:05,159
it's well annotated so I think there's a

183
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,360
lot of exciting data sources I can't

184
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:10,599
walk away without talking about model

185
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,800
comparison because it frustrates me when

186
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:15,000
I open up papers and I still see these

187
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,479
tables and people put their method in

188
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,520
bold and they don't do any statistics to

189
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:22,240
compare things I've been complaining

190
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:25,639
about this for a decade we finally did

191
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:28,759
something about it so there's a group of

192
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:31,879
us from a range of Biotech and Pharma

193
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:35,080
companies we put together a set of

194
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:39,479
guidelines for method comparisons we

195
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:42,320
also have a set of Jupiter notebooks

196
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:45,480
demonstrating best practices this paper

197
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:48,000
was submitted to Archive yesterday so

198
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:50,920
hopefully either today or tomorrow it

199
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,760
will be available so we've made a lot of

200
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,560
progress but I still think there's a lot

201
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,600
of things we have to figure out and

202
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,360
there's things that we don't do well and

203
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,680
it frustrates me when I see people at

204
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:03,240
nups you know doing yet another

205
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:05,279
diffusion model let's work on the real

206
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,800
problem so I've built a machine learning

207
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:11,160
model I have a new molecule how do I

208
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:13,600
know whether I can make an be confident

209
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:15,920
in my prediction so defining the

210
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,640
applicability domain you know yes we've

211
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,120
got message passing neural networks

212
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:22,160
we've got gnns but ultimately we're

213
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:24,560
still using the same molecular

214
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:27,000
representation based on topology that

215
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,880
we've been used for been using for 40

216
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,360
years we really haven't figured out how

217
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:34,959
to integrate 3D into our representations

218
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,440
we haven't figured out how to make

219
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:40,680
transferable representations you know

220
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:43,279
you see all these papers coming out on

221
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:45,880
you know various ways of generating

222
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:48,000
molecules but nobody's figured out how

223
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:50,079
to determine whether those molecules are

224
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,399
synthesizable or whether they're even

225
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:56,040
chemically stable and then finally drug

226
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:59,000
Discovery is not just optimizing potency

227
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:01,839
it's not just optimizing adme we want to

228
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,600
be able to optimize multiple properties

229
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:08,200
usually dozens and we still don't have

230
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:11,160
good methods for doing multiobjective

231
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:13,040
optimization so in case you missed any

232
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:15,200
of the links that I put up to any of

233
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:18,600
these wonderful data sources if you go

234
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:21,720
to my website there's a resources link

235
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:24,079
and that resources link has links to

236
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:29,880
everything that I talked about today

237
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:29,880
anyway that's that's my time thanks
