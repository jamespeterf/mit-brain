00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,839
many people believe that this captures

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,000
how you make good decisions you have

3
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:09,120
your goals your goals motivate your

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,800
decisions those decisions change the

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,960
state of the system and bring the world

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,960
closer to your goals well that's not how

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,880
it works let me give you an example I'm

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,560
a bicycle Commuter so every morning when

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,480
I'm riding down the bike path on my way

10
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,439
to MIT I know my goal stay on the right

11
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,439
hand side of the path too far the left

12
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,679
crash into somebody coming the other way

13
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,080
too far to the right hit a tree but just

14
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:32,040
knowing the goal doesn't tell me what I

15
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,480
really need to be able to do do I turn

16
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,000
the handlebars left or right right now

17
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,879
in order to make a good decision I also

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,879
have to know not just where I want to be

19
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:45,360
but where I am I have to have feedback

20
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:49,079
from the state of the system now we are

21
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,920
embedded in a far more complex set of

22
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,840
systems that's going to be quite

23
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:56,239
difficult to understand and to manage

24
00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:00,840
for more MIT moments from MIT open
