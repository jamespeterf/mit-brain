1
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:17,119
today and next lecture we are going to

2
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:20,680
turn to a topic that's as I've

3
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:22,600
highlighted previously woefully missing

4
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,880
from this class and from Bas a lot of

5
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:27,240
basic economics which is we're going to

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:30,080
start talking about Equity this class

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,399
has been totally focused on efficiency

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:36,079
we've come back and back again to ever

9
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:38,320
since we did the lecture on consumer and

10
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,960
producer Surplus we've talked about a

11
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,680
particular normative perspective which

12
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,879
is the goal of society is to basically

13
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,320
maximize total social surplus the goal

14
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,920
of societ is really to maximize the pi

15
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,239
and we don't really care how it's

16
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,760
distributed and this is Illustrated as I

17
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:58,160
mentioned before nowhere more starkly

18
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:02,359
than the fact that two different Market

19
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:04,439
outcomes have the exact same welfare

20
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:05,720
consequences one is a perfectly

21
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:08,439
competitive

22
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:10,119
market and one is a perfectly price

23
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:13,520
discriminating

24
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:15,720
monopolist both of those Market outcomes

25
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:19,040
yield maximum social

26
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,520
surplus yet they feel very different and

27
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,000
outcome where consumers and producers

28
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,759
split the pie feels to us innately very

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,360
different than an outcome where

30
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:31,560
producers get to keep it all and that's

31
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:35,360
because innately we as humans care not

32
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:39,079
just about efficiency but fairness about

33
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:41,439
equity and we actually care about not

34
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:42,520
just how much stuff gets produced but

35
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,479
who gets

36
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:48,159
it now in that particular

37
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:50,560
example you get two very different

38
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,360
distributional outcomes with the same

39
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:57,439
level of efficiency but that's actually

40
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:59,479
pretty unique it turns out generally

41
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,880
that different distributional outcomes

42
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:04,840
different levels of fairness come at

43
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:06,759
different levels of efficiency and that

44
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:09,080
we leads to what we fundamentally call

45
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:11,440
the equity efficiency

46
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:15,200
tradeoff that basically to get more

47
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,239
Equitable outcomes often requires less

48
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,560
efficient

49
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:22,720
outcomes and our goal as economists is

50
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:26,720
to decide is it worth it how do we think

51
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:29,959
about whether a potential sacrifice in

52
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,560
efficiency is worth a gain in equity

53
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:34,400
your fairness and the best way to think

54
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,760
about this was posed by The Economist

55
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,040
Arthur

56
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,319
Oaken about 40 50 years ago God it must

57
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,319
be 50 years ago

58
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:47,959
now Arthur Oaken

59
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:50,560
OK posed the example of the Leaky bucket

60
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:53,159
which is the best way to think about

61
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,840
redistribution he said imagine the way

62
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:58,040
imagine a society with the rich people

63
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,080
and poor people and imagine the way we

64
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,440
redistributed from rich people to poor

65
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,120
people was by literally the rich people

66
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,840
putting money in a bucket then someone

67
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,280
carries that bucket and dumps it out in

68
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,360
front of the poor people the simplest

69
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,040
possible view of distribution and we

70
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:16,159
probably and so Arthur Oak's question

71
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:19,000
was imagine simple world where a rich

72
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,840
person puts in a dollar someone carries

73
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,040
over and gives that dollar to a poor

74
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:26,760
person how many of us would favor that

75
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,959
probably most of us probably most of us

76
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,760
would think that the rich person would

77
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,400
miss the dollar

78
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:35,040
less than the poor person would value

79
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,159
the dollar so probably most of us would

80
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,040
think that if you could take a dollar

81
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,439
from the rich and give it to the poor

82
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,040
that's a good thing to

83
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:46,799
do now Oak can ask but what if the

84
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:49,120
bucket was leaky what if along the money

85
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,439
along the way some of the money leaked

86
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,200
out so the dollar you took from the rich

87
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:55,120
became less than a Dollar by time I got

88
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:59,120
to the

89
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:02,360
poor what if it was 90 cents 70 cents 50

90
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,439
cents 30 Cent 10 cents or Nothing At

91
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,480
what point do you stop wanting to make

92
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:08,439
that

93
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:10,439
transfer like I said for most of us if I

94
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:12,079
said to you you could take a dollar from

95
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:14,239
a very rich person give to a very poor

96
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:16,320
person you'd say well that seems like a

97
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,519
good deal what if I say get a dollar for

98
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,639
a very rich person and give 50 cents to

99
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:23,800
a very poor person is that a good deal

100
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:25,280
that depends that depends on how you

101
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,160
feel about the relative value of money

102
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,000
in the hands of the rich and the poor it

103
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:32,720
becomes a harder question and and that

104
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,560
is the equity efficiency tradeoff if you

105
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,720
can redistribute shares of the pie

106
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,039
without shrinking the pie we probably

107
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,880
would be in favor of that but once it

108
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:44,800
involves shrinking the

109
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:47,840
pie maybe it's not such a good idea or

110
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,280
maybe it is maybe even if the dollar

111
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,520
from the rich becomes nothing to the

112
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:54,080
poor you'll still favor it because you

113
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,479
think inherently there's uh there's a

114
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,840
problem with

115
00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:59,360
inequality so ultimately the question we

116
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,680
want to think about is where what's the

117
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,880
leak that you accept in your bucket

118
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,919
what's the leak that you're willing to

119
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:08,440
accept to transfer money and we're going

120
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:09,759
to discuss that issue in four steps in

121
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,680
the next two

122
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:17,160
lectures the first step is we're going

123
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:17,160
to ask about social

124
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:23,440
valuation of

125
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:25,680
transfers how does how do we

126
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,919
think the issue we've avoided through

127
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,280
this whole course how do we think within

128
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:33,440
our base economic framework about how

129
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:36,080
Society feels about taking money from a

130
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,080
and giving it to

131
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:44,120
B the Second Step we're going to ask is

132
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,319
what is the actual inequality that

133
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,960
exists in

134
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:50,840
society what are the facts on who has

135
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:52,600
the dollars what are the motivations for

136
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,039
potentially addressing these

137
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:57,319
distributional

138
00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:58,880
issues the third thing we're to ask is

139
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:00,479
where does the leakage what are the

140
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:04,080
sources of leak

141
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:06,440
leakage where does the leakage come

142
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,039
from where do the leaks that where do

143
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,240
the leaks that that leaky bucket come

144
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:12,080
from why is it

145
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:16,360
leaky and then finally we're going to

146
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,360
ask about transfer

147
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:23,479
policy how does government actually go

148
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,599
about taking money from some people and

149
00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:26,639
giving it to

150
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:27,520
others those are the four steps we're

151
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,080
going to go through we'll get through

152
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,039
the first three today and F focus on the

153
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,440
last one on

154
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:37,039
Monday so let's start with the first one

155
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,759
which

156
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:42,639
is how do we think

157
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:44,360
about

158
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,720
social

159
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,720
welfare of

160
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,560
allocation so far we've just thought

161
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,440
about the social welfare of total if

162
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,520
total efficiency we haven't thought

163
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,720
about

164
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,440
allocation imagine we with many

165
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,639
different

166
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,360
outcomes different levels of efficiency

167
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:07,560
but also different levels of equity a

168
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,160
world with different with with buckets

169
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,319
that are different leakages and

170
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:13,039
different amounts of money going to

171
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:16,160
different people how would we compare

172
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:20,039
them well here we're going to use the

173
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:23,240
same tool we started with in lecture

174
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:26,199
two how do we think about any valuing

175
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:28,560
any combination of goods from a consumer

176
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:29,960
well we say they have utility function

177
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,840
and we say how do those different

178
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:34,080
combinations of good enter the

179
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,120
utility well to think about socially

180
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,360
optimal

181
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,960
allocation we're going to think about a

182
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,400
social utility function or what we're

183
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:44,440
going to call a social welfare function

184
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,919
we're going to say look if we want to

185
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,400
think about the value of goods in the

186
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:51,159
hands of person a versus B we have to

187
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,720
write down a mathematical function for

188
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:55,720
how Society feels about the value of

189
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,759
goods in the hands of person A or B that

190
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:00,919
is Loosely a utility function for

191
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:04,199
society essentially

192
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:06,080
aggregation of each individual's utility

193
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:09,080
so the function per utility one utility

194
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:11,440
two all the way up to utility 3 150

195
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,879
million okay so this the social welfare

196
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,280
function for the United States is

197
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:19,280
literally some aggregation some

198
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:21,560
mathematical function of everyone's

199
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,479
utility and you should be able to see

200
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:26,840
for a given mathematical

201
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:29,720
function I can then evaluate how I feel

202
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,680
about transfers because I can look at

203
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,959
what those transfers done each person's

204
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,440
utility I can use this function to

205
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:39,760
translate to new social

206
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:41,959
allocation okay so to see that let's

207
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:45,519
look at figure

208
00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:48,080
231 these draw what we call isow welfare

209
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,839
curves now in our two-dimensional graph

210
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,519
the trade-off is between goods to two

211
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,959
people Homer and Ned okay we have Homer

212
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:57,200
and Ned Society consists of these two

213
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,600
people and we want to think about how do

214
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,320
we feel about resources in the hand of

215
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,480
Homer versus Ned and we could say for

216
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:08,160
example that we're indifferent between

217
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:11,200
the allocations u1h

218
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,399
u1n and u2h u2n say we're a different

219
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,399
between Ned having a lot and Homer

220
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:17,680
having a little or Homer having a lot

221
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:20,800
net having a little then they'd be on

222
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:23,040
the same isow welfare curve but by the

223
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:26,360
Moors better principle we're certainly

224
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,920
happy as a society with both having

225
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:31,240
more just like any indifference curve

226
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:33,079
the ISO Wells our curves the further out

227
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:38,240
the better off we

228
00:09:33,079 --> 00:09:39,720
are okay so basically um this is

229
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,880
essentially a

230
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,600
mapping of a social welfare curve of a

231
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,600
social welfare function just like

232
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,680
utility function gives us an

233
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:51,800
indifference curve

234
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:54,600
mapping a social welfare function gives

235
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:57,120
us an isow welfare curve

236
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,160
mapping so then we just simply have to

237
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,079
ask what does a social welfare function

238
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,399
look like we talked about what utility

239
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:06,399
functions look like we talked about

240
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:08,120
their General print properties and that

241
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,079
common example we use of the square root

242
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,720
utility function but we said basically

243
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,920
we can use a broad class of functions

244
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,880
you've seen on problem sets and exams a

245
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,839
broad class utility

246
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:20,480
functions what about social welfare

247
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:24,120
function social welfare functions

248
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,839
typically we work in economics with a

249
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,800
couple of different forms of social

250
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,320
welfare

251
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:33,680
functions the most common form of social

252
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,680
welfare function is what we call

253
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:39,920
utilitarian social welfare function the

254
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,120
utilitarian social welfare function

255
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:47,760
simply poses that social

256
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:52,279
welfare is simply the linear sum of

257
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:55,279
utilities U1 plus U2 plus dot do D plus

258
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:55,279
u350

259
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,839
million that is utilitarian it's

260
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,360
literally I I don't know I don't I have

261
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:03,920
no base Society for caring any more

262
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,480
about one person than anyone else just

263
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,920
going to add their

264
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:10,240
utilities the person this guy named

265
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,160
Jeremy Bentham a famous British

266
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,760
philosopher uh couple things to not

267
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,120
about Jeremy Bentham first of all he

268
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,440
also invented the modern he invented a

269
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,600
modern design of Prisons which is quite

270
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:23,959
interesting he was a broad thinkinking

271
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:25,760
philosopher he also um when he died his

272
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:28,240
stuffed body with the head separated was

273
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,760
on display at University College London

274
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,160
um until it turned out students would

275
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,920
take the head out and play soccer with

276
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:36,200
it so they no longer do that so um he's

277
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,560
a famous philosopher cample the

278
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,360
utilitarian social war function it's

279
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:42,959
sort of a natural starting

280
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,680
point and if you think about it it's not

281
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,320
really sort of cons you wouldn't look at

282
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,920
this this is conservative or liberal

283
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,600
right you look at to say oh that's a

284
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,519
lefty or righty it's just it's neutral

285
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,519
it's just saying look I care about

286
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:57,200
everyone equally that seems pretty

287
00:11:53,519 --> 00:12:00,680
neutral and yet this neutral social

288
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:03,240
utility function has radical

289
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:06,600
implications for

290
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:08,560
distribution in particular it says we

291
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:11,600
should always

292
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:16,040
transfer between any two

293
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:19,600
people if the transfer makes person two

294
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:23,240
happier than it makes person one

295
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:27,440
sad that means we're indifferent between

296
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:30,120
one udle to you and to Bill

297
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,079
Gates now that sounds kind of

298
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,320
conservative we're indifferent like

299
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,279
you're poor than Bill Gates we should

300
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,839
care more about you but remember I said

301
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,680
we're indiff in one udle between you and

302
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,880
Bill Gates that doesn't mean we're

303
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,959
differing than $1 doll between you and

304
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:46,760
Bill

305
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:48,440
Gates okay indeed who would we rather

306
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,440
with this social work function who would

307
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,680
we rather have the dollar you or Bill

308
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:55,320
Gates and why let's say there's a dollar

309
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:57,199
up for grabs with the utilit social

310
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,760
welfare function would social welfare be

311
00:12:57,199 --> 00:13:01,120
higher if you got the dollar or Bill

312
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:03,560
Gates got the dollar and

313
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,959
Y

314
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:09,760
yeah L the margin of dollars higher to

315
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:12,160
you to you and less to Bill Gates what

316
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,199
this says if you maximize this if you

317
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:19,199
maximize this this implies you should

318
00:13:14,199 --> 00:13:19,199
set the Marge utility of all individuals

319
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,120
equal I'm put 350 million because 350

320
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,360
million people in America okay this

321
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,839
implies you should put the margin

322
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,760
utility of every person equal that's a

323
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,079
pretty radical implication

324
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,399
that says literally you should reute

325
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:36,920
money until everybody values the dollar

326
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,680
the next dollar the same that say you

327
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,680
should massively redistribute from the

328
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,680
rich to the

329
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,920
poor right because the rich value the

330
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,959
next dollar way less than the poor Bill

331
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:48,160
Gates couldn't give a about the

332
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:49,360
next dollar where some poor homeless guy

333
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,560
mean could be difference between a hot

334
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:55,759
meal and not having a hot meal today on

335
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:59,839
a cold day so clearly this is fairly

336
00:13:55,759 --> 00:14:02,079
this suggests that we dimin as long as

337
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:05,360
there's diminishing margin

338
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:07,360
utility you should have fairly strong

339
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,440
preferences to redistribute from the

340
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,800
rich to the poor despite the fact that

341
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,959
when I wrote this you didn't look at it

342
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,320
and say wow this is some Lefty crazy

343
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:17,480
utility function it has sort of Lefty

344
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:19,560
implications right it says we should

345
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:21,600
redistribute strongly from the rich to

346
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,680
the poor it sort of makes sense the rich

347
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,839
care about the money less than the poor

348
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,839
care about and that's your sort of

349
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,120
underlying intuition why we all start

350
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,920
with this notion that redistribution

351
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:33,720
makes sense indeed this goes further if

352
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:36,320
individuals are all

353
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,600
identical this if individual are all

354
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,959
this suggests we should have an equal

355
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,079
distribution of income a pretty radical

356
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:42,720
concept that's never been achieved

357
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:45,759
anywhere in history by any

358
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,160
society if individuals are all identical

359
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:49,839
this says we should have an equal

360
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:52,360
distribution of income pretty radical

361
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:55,519
from a pretty straightforward

362
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:57,880
concept now in fact to many

363
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,040
people this is actually a very

364
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,480
conservative approach to think about

365
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,880
about income distribution indeed

366
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,040
typically conservatives often start with

367
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,920
this point many people on the left start

368
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:14,000
with an alternative approach what's

369
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:16,120
called a rollan w r awl rollan social

370
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,839
welfare function named up philosopher

371
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:23,560
John rolls famous philosopher at

372
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:26,480
Harvard RS said that utility that the

373
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:30,839
social welfare of society should be

374
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:33,800
measured as the men of everyone's

375
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:36,079
utility that a society should be

376
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:38,000
measured by the living standards of its

377
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:40,279
worst off

378
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,759
member that as Society we should care

379
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:44,800
about those who are poorly off and

380
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:47,240
Society should be measured by the

381
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:50,319
utility of the worst off member that

382
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:53,720
sort of has some appeal okay we should

383
00:15:50,319 --> 00:15:56,440
care about these people but it's

384
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:59,040
incredibly extreme in its implications

385
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:00,800
think about it for a second let's say

386
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,639
say there's a society consists of

387
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,279
everyone in the world everyone in the US

388
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,000
has

389
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:10,680
$40,000 except one guy has a billion

390
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,680
dollar and one guy has

391
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:16,480
$39,000 this says that we should be

392
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:17,560
willing to take the billionaire all the

393
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:22,360
way down to

394
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:25,360
40,000 just to get the 39,000 guy up to

395
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:27,079
40,000 that's pretty radical it says

396
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,920
that basically we don't care about any

397
00:16:27,079 --> 00:16:30,120
anything people have about the minimum

398
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,319
we just care about making sure everybody

399
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:34,079
gets to that

400
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:35,920
minimum so that is very that makes this

401
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:38,480
look like a conservative fantasy this is

402
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,959
an incredibly radical approach which

403
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,360
says we should take everything from the

404
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:44,040
rich just to make sure the poor have

405
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:47,880
enough

406
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:49,240
okay but that's that's um clearly under

407
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,600
utilitarian social war function that

408
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:54,000
make us bad off clearly Bill clearly is

409
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,959
the guy who goes from a billion to

410
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,600
40,000 is made sad than the guy goes to

411
00:16:55,959 --> 00:17:00,079
39 to 40,000 is made happier so clearly

412
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,480
that would not be a proper thing to do

413
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:04,639
under utilitarian social welfare

414
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,639
function but it would under

415
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:12,000
Ry now of course on the right there's a

416
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:15,079
on the on the conservative right there's

417
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,480
a crism that of both of these approaches

418
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:20,919
and that

419
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:24,039
view there's there's a criticism on the

420
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:27,640
uh uh which is that basically uh the

421
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:27,640
conservative criticism

422
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:41,720
criticism says that

423
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:44,280
basically look this whole discussion is

424
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,960
misguided it says look let's say we

425
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,880
started in society with everyone having

426
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:50,360
the same amount of

427
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,960
money let's say start everyone you and I

428
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:54,120
have the same amount of money and let's

429
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:57,520
say that you were willing as you should

430
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:59,600
be willing to pay $100 to hear me

431
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,080
lecture and so so you come in every day

432
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,400
and you give me a $100 to you hear me

433
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,280
lecture a

434
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:09,280
bargain okay at the end of the semester

435
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:12,440
I am richer or you are poorer is that

436
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,679
unfair what's unfair about that you paid

437
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:16,520
for something you

438
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:19,080
wanted I had something you wanted and I

439
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:21,000
end up richer how yet under utilitarian

440
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:23,640
social Ware function we'd call that

441
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,799
bad we'd say wait a second John's rich

442
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,840
or you're poor John should give that

443
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:29,480
money back to you but why you gave that

444
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:32,799
money to me voluntarily

445
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:38,200
so conservative criticism says that

446
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:41,679
look as long as everyone has equal

447
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:43,760
opportunity we shouldn't care about

448
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:46,039
outcomes that what matters is

449
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,120
opportunities not outcomes as long as

450
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:50,200
has equal opportunities then let people

451
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,559
spend their money as they want and let

452
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,880
people end up and whatever income

453
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:54,600
distribution results if Michael Jordan

454
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,960
ends up rich he's the best at basketball

455
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,480
so be it as long as everyone has equal

456
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,880
opportunities this is a theory which

457
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,880
says worry about

458
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,640
opportunities not

459
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,559
outcomes

460
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:12,640
now this

461
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:14,039
approach has two fundamental flaws it's

462
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,840
pretty compelling the story I told is

463
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:17,200
pretty compelling except for two

464
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,000
fundamental

465
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,120
problems okay the first problem with

466
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,559
this

467
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:29,320
approach is what does opportunities

468
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:32,159
mean by definition my kids have better

469
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:34,400
opportunities than the kids born to a

470
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:35,080
poor single mother living in a poor part

471
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,799
of

472
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:40,760
Boston they have more resources there

473
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:43,320
are better schools things like that so

474
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:45,159
in subsense equalizing opportunities is

475
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:48,520
actually by itself pretty radical that

476
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:50,600
would involve a large social structural

477
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,080
change okay so first of all equalizing

478
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,159
opportunity is not as easy as it sounds

479
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,600
we don't all start equal it a large

480
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:58,760
social upheaval to get us to that point

481
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:00,960
we started equal

482
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:03,360
the second problem with it is it turns

483
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:06,559
out that much of what accounts for

484
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:08,720
success in life is not skill or hard

485
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:11,280
work but

486
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,799
luck and in that

487
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,520
case it's not true that rich people are

488
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:16,799
rich because they deserve it or because

489
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,640
they have skills or or they're

490
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:22,200
just lucky and why do we necessarily

491
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:25,960
want to reward luck indeed can't we

492
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:28,960
think a redistribution is kind of luck

493
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:30,159
Insurance imagine a world where random

494
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,360
events going to happen to you you get

495
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:34,400
hit by a car we talked about why we want

496
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,559
insurance right want Insurance to make

497
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,000
sure if we get hit by the car don't get

498
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:39,640
hit by the car we're in the same off

499
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,720
well same thing RS talked about behind

500
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:43,640
the veil of ignorance imagine before

501
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:46,440
you're born you don't know if you're be

502
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:48,520
rich or poor you would choose a system

503
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:52,000
which would ensure you against being

504
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:54,400
poor and that system which would involve

505
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,640
transfers so if much of success is due

506
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,919
to luck we're going to want a system

507
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,679
that shoots the rich to the poor because

508
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:02,360
the rich got lucky the poor didn't

509
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:06,799
that's uncertain we want to ensure

510
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:08,320
against okay fascinating fact if you if

511
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,360
you interview people around the world

512
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,880
and ask

513
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:15,760
them is Success mostly due to hard work

514
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:19,520
or to luck in the US people say hard

515
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,919
work in Europe people say luck in Europe

516
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,679
they have much higher redistribution

517
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:25,640
than we do in the US because they have a

518
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:28,080
view that much more success comes from

519
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,960
luck now the answer is it's both in

520
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:32,559
every case but sort of an interesting

521
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:35,000
way to two ways think about the world

522
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:37,000
and then finally there's a totally

523
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:42,480
different alternative which has a lot of

524
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,480
appeal which is called commodity

525
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,360
egalitarianism commodity egalitarianism

526
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:55,360
this view has a lot of appeal as well

527
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,360
it's simply says

528
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,880
look let's get rid of this Focus on me

529
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,360
versus you that's just

530
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:06,960
destructive let's take a page from R's

531
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:09,880
book and say look let's just make sure

532
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,480
that the poor have enough to live and

533
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:15,279
beyond that let it

534
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:16,840
rip so Kam the view is much like RS who

535
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:19,320
want to make sure the poor are a decent

536
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:21,320
level but we don't care then how much

537
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,919
more the rich have as long as the poor

538
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:25,720
have achieved a standard of living where

539
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:27,919
they can survive then let it rip I don't

540
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:30,720
care how rich Bill Gates is as long as

541
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:32,320
each of you can have shelter and food

542
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,039
and basic health care and other basic

543
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:37,760
needs

544
00:22:34,039 --> 00:22:41,600
met it's kind of a compelling it's kind

545
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:44,679
of a compelling um argument right that

546
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,799
basically why should I care about guy

547
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:47,480
who was a billion versus the guy who was

548
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:49,640
a million all I care was making sure

549
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:51,760
everybody can lead a decent

550
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,880
life it's in some sense a nice

551
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,159
compromise between a lot of these

552
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,840
different views in many ways and it

553
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,799
speaks to a key issue we'll talk about

554
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,679
later which is should we really be

555
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:04,080
giving people money or should we be

556
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,880
giving people the goods like housing and

557
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,360
health care that make up a decent

558
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:10,360
standard of

559
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,679
living so these are four different views

560
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,039
only two of them can been easily

561
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:15,240
expressed mathematically these obviously

562
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:17,720
can write down models but they're more

563
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,919
complicated but the bottom line

564
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:23,200
is with all these

565
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:25,000
views given those views you can figure

566
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,880
out whether a given policy that

567
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,559
transfers a person a to person B makes

568
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,360
sense

569
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:32,559
these are different ways of providing a

570
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:38,760
social welfare

571
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:38,760
framework okay questions about that

572
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:50,919
yeah sure yeah they're related so here's

573
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:53,360
the difference let's say we all decide

574
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:54,679
that everyone needs $50,000 to lead a

575
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,360
decent life in

576
00:23:54,679 --> 00:23:59,120
America what commodity Garian say is

577
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,640
once everyone has $50,000

578
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:04,039
I don't care how rich people are above

579
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,840
that RS would say I do I don't want I

580
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:09,159
only if everyone is

581
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:10,760
$50,000 but one guy's 40 but but but if

582
00:24:09,159 --> 00:24:13,600
I was $50,000 and someone else is a

583
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:15,799
billion dollars we we' rather make

584
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,440
everyone else that $50,000 and3 and that

585
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:20,120
guy back come down to 50,000 and3 we

586
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,480
don't want anybody above the minimum we

587
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:24,279
want to make sure the minimum is high as

588
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:25,520
it possibly can be where T says as long

589
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:26,600
as the minimum is the decent state of

590
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,360
living let the rich guy have as much as

591
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,960
he

592
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:32,480
want RS cares about inequality is a

593
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:36,480
concept commodity G terrorism

594
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:39,880
doesn't good question other

595
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:43,200
questions okay so armed with these views

596
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:45,679
let's talk about the facts what do we

597
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,440
know about

598
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:49,880
inequality and here I'm just going to

599
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,840
run through some facts from my textbook

600
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:55,960
that I used from

601
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:59,240
1441 so let's start with figure

602
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:01,880
23-2 this shows relative income

603
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:03,840
inequality in the United States how do

604
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:06,720
we do that we divide the population to

605
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:09,600
quintiles that is fifths of the people

606
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:13,360
so each of these rows is 20% of the

607
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:16,840
people each number shows the percent of

608
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:19,840
income earned by that share of people in

609
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:22,760
other words in a perfectly equal Society

610
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:25,799
every number in this table would be 20

611
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:29,200
in a perfectly equal Society every fifth

612
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:31,679
of people would get a fifth of the money

613
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:34,679
but in fact that's never true anywhere

614
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:36,919
you see always the higher

615
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:39,960
quintiles control a larger share of

616
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:43,000
income that's always true what's more

617
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:45,880
notable is how it's changed over time

618
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,760
from 1967 to 1980 it stayed relatively

619
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:51,600
flat but look from 1980 to

620
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:53,520
2019 the share held by the poorest has

621
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:57,039
fallen by about

622
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:59,840
25% the poorest 20% of people used to

623
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:03,720
earn 4.2% of the income now they get

624
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:07,760
3.1% of the income the richest 20% of

625
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:09,880
people in 1980 had 44% of the income now

626
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:14,520
they have 52% of the

627
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:16,840
income Society has gotten much more

628
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:18,960
unequal this has been driven not just by

629
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:21,399
the richest 20% to be clear the richest

630
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,840
just to fix ideas here the richest 20%

631
00:26:21,399 --> 00:26:26,000
of people would be people with incomes

632
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:27,240
above say nationally PE with incomes

633
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,600
above say

634
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:32,720
$85,000 so it's not Mega Rich okay or

635
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,760
maybe $100,000 not Mega Rich it's well

636
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,240
off but not Mega rich but this trend has

637
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:40,200
been driven by the very

638
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:42,520
wealthy figure 233 shows the share of

639
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,720
income going to the top 1% of income PE

640
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:47,320
holders this people income above about

641
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,840
$500,000 these are the

642
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:52,919
rich

643
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:55,240
okay at the turn of the C 20 Century

644
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:57,880
1913 and peing right before the Great

645
00:26:55,240 --> 00:27:01,000
Depression the rich held about 25% of

646
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:04,200
all in income that is 1% of people got

647
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:07,039
25% of the income that fell then fell

648
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:09,200
precipitously till in the early 1970s 1%

649
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:10,960
of people only about 10% of income and

650
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,960
it's risen dramatically since so we're

651
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:17,240
back at the level actually above where

652
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:19,080
we were at the peak of the 20th century

653
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:22,080
with one with the top 1% earning more

654
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:26,240
than a quarter of all the resources in

655
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:28,520
society so it's a very unequal

656
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,760
Society now you might say well how do I

657
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,000
know it's an equal what's what's the

658
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:35,679
natural state what I want to do is

659
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:39,039
compare countries figure 234 Compares

660
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:42,399
countries this is just a small

661
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:46,799
comparison of some countries that are in

662
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:48,000
the um o just a subset alphabetically of

663
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,960
countries that are what we call

664
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,799
developed countries from countries that

665
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:54,440
we consider our peers like the UK or

666
00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:57,559
Sweden the countries that are poor like

667
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:59,640
Czechoslovakia or turkey what you show

668
00:27:57,559 --> 00:28:00,559
here is the share of income held by the

669
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:04,720
bottom

670
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:07,559
10% the bottom 20% and the bottom 40% as

671
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:10,919
well as the top 40% the top 20% the top

672
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:12,760
10% just compare the bottom two rows the

673
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:15,240
bottom row is the average for all

674
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:16,519
developed countries so on average on

675
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:19,760
average across all developed countries

676
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:22,760
the bottom 10% of people have 3% of the

677
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:26,240
income and the top 10% of people have

678
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:29,360
25% of the income in the US the bottom

679
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:33,240
10 perent of only 1.6% of the the income

680
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:36,080
and the top 10% have almost 30% of the

681
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:37,799
income so the US is unequal it's much

682
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,919
more unequal indeed we are the most

683
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:41,720
unequal what's considered developed

684
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,679
country except for

685
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,519
Mexico we're unequal that any other

686
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:47,559
country consider a developed country we

687
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:49,720
the most unequal except for Mexico and

688
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:53,159
maybe turkey there's some debate

689
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:54,919
there okay so we're very

690
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:58,440
unequal

691
00:28:54,919 --> 00:28:59,919
now many people particularly people in

692
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,919
these camps three and four would say

693
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:03,679
well look that's all well and good but

694
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,279
why you so worried about inequality sure

695
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:07,159
we got some rich

696
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:08,440
guys but we don't care about that we

697
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:12,000
just care that poor people have enough

698
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:14,679
to live that's what matters we want to

699
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,080
focus on what is the standard of living

700
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:19,440
of the

701
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:22,039
poor well in other words they want to

702
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,000
shift their focus

703
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:28,000
from

704
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
relative inequality

705
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:37,159
versus

706
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:37,159
absolute

707
00:29:39,399 --> 00:29:44,640
deprivation that is how what are people

708
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:46,080
actually living on well to do that

709
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,519
relative the problem with that is

710
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,960
relative income inequality is easy to

711
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:50,360
measure just look at what group has Rel

712
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,640
to another it's unit

713
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:55,200
free once you want to measure absolute

714
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,840
deprivation you have to make a stand on

715
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,480
what it means to be

716
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:02,360
deprived the the US has taken such a

717
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:05,039
stand and we've created something called

718
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:05,039
the poverty

719
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:12,240
line the poverty line is the US

720
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:14,960
measure of what you need to lead a

721
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:18,039
minimally acceptable life in the

722
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:22,360
US okay below which what does it mean to

723
00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:24,000
be in poverty now this is a pretty

724
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:26,919
foundational

725
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,039
concept yet its Origins are very modest

726
00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:30,120
for those of you who think that working

727
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:31,480
the government doesn't involve pH being

728
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:34,320
government bureaucrat doesn't that much

729
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:36,760
power in the mid 1960s a mid-level

730
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:39,559
government bureaucrat made this number

731
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:42,000
up she said well look her name was Molly

732
00:30:39,559 --> 00:30:44,240
oransky she said look poor people spent

733
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,799
about a third of their budget on food

734
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,760
let me just price out what a n

735
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:50,080
nutritionally adequate diet costs

736
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:53,880
multiply by three and we'll call that

737
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:56,159
the poverty line that exercise updated

738
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:58,559
by inflation is literally the way today

739
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,799
we transfer trillions of dollars in the

740
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:02,519
United

741
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:04,480
States okay so that has remained our

742
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:07,200
standard for what is

743
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,960
poor the poverty line itself is shown in

744
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,480
figure

745
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:15,039
23-5 so the poverty line for a family of

746
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:15,039
one is considered to be about

747
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:21,559
$133,000 it then doesn't double per

748
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:24,840
person because we view that living

749
00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:26,559
together has economies of scale we don't

750
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:28,880
think you need twice as much money for

751
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:30,360
two people to live together

752
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,320
as you do for one person to live

753
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,639
together because for instance a

754
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,679
two-bedroom apartment is typically not

755
00:31:33,639 --> 00:31:38,200
twice a one-bedroom apartment certainly

756
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:39,960
a so basically there's economies of

757
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:42,080
scale so it doesn't double but it goes

758
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:43,559
up thereafter So a family of four we

759
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,320
think as a poverty line of about twice

760
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:49,720
the poverty line for an

761
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:51,679
individual now is that a fair number is

762
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:53,399
that correct well that's a debate for

763
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:55,440
another day we can come to 1441 we spent

764
00:31:53,399 --> 00:31:56,760
a lot of time talking about it it's a

765
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,000
very controversial number for many

766
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:00,399
reasons let's take that as given for now

767
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,600
what does it implies happen over time

768
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:04,799
well look at figure

769
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:08,200
23-6 which shows poverty rates over time

770
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:10,880
what you see if you look at the blue

771
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:12,880
line that's all people you see for all

772
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:15,360
people poverty rates fell dramatically

773
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:18,639
until about

774
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:20,880
1979 and then have been pretty flat

775
00:32:18,639 --> 00:32:23,120
since that's been that's a combination

776
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,679
of a dramatic fall in poverty for those

777
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,799
I'm sorry that's not the Blue Line uh

778
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:28,519
yeah let's see no the I'm sorry the blue

779
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:31,039
line is I'm sorry the red line is all

780
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:33,120
people my bad it fell for dramatically

781
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:35,200
until about 1970 and then it's been flat

782
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:37,519
since that's a combination of a dramatic

783
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,960
Fallen poverty for the elderly which is

784
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:42,240
the blue line and actually poverty kind

785
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:45,000
of has been risen a bit for the for the

786
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,200
for youth that's under 18 but the bottom

787
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,960
line is you look at this line for about

788
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:52,399
1980 onward and it all looks pretty flat

789
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:56,279
right contrast that

790
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:58,919
to I'll go all the way back to table

791
00:32:56,279 --> 00:33:01,919
232 table 2 32 seem to show that

792
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:04,320
inequality's gotten a ton worse since

793
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:06,039
1980 so how you feel about what's

794
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,120
happened to American society depends

795
00:33:06,039 --> 00:33:12,480
very much on how you feel about fig

796
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:15,440
table 232 figure 232 versus figure

797
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,600
236 do we care about what's happened

798
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:20,480
relatively which is the rich Rel to the

799
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:21,760
poor which approach one and two would

800
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,440
say we should care

801
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:26,840
about or do we care which happen

802
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:28,279
absolutely which is what the poor have

803
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,039
which is what approach for we should

804
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:32,919
worry

805
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:35,399
about and there's no right answer but

806
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:40,720
how you think about it determines how

807
00:33:35,399 --> 00:33:42,120
you're going to um end up uh end up

808
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:45,519
thinking about the

809
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:49,399
problem to my mind I think you want some

810
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:52,360
of both but to my mind the simplest and

811
00:33:49,399 --> 00:33:55,039
most striking way to think about this is

812
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:58,600
the following example which is just

813
00:33:55,039 --> 00:34:00,600
stunning many of you may remember about

814
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:02,720
10 years ago there were the maybe less

815
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:05,159
there was the Freddy gray riots Freddy

816
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,919
gray was a prisoner arrested in a poor

817
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:08,000
neighborhood of Baltimore he was killed

818
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:10,159
in the police car on the way to the

819
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,919
police station it led to uh as part of

820
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,359
the black you know one of the founding

821
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:14,679
events of black lives matter movement

822
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:16,480
led to a lot of riots and things like

823
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:19,639
that in

824
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:21,480
Baltimore those riots highlighted how

825
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:25,000
much inequality there is in

826
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:26,040
Baltimore go to figure one of my I think

827
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,240
one of the most stunning figures I've

828
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:32,399
ever seen figure 237

829
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:35,760
this figure this is just a graph of

830
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:38,399
Baltimore this shows neighborhoods in

831
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:40,480
Baltimore and the life expectancy in

832
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:42,240
each neighborhood how long you expect to

833
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,440
live and I'm going to highlight two

834
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:46,399
neighborhoods Sandtown

835
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:51,000
Winchester which is where Freddy gray

836
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:53,040
was from and Roland Park which is three

837
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,079
miles

838
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:58,119
away where Freddy gray was from the

839
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:59,480
average life expectancy unless Roland

840
00:34:58,119 --> 00:35:01,359
Park Roland Park is a wealthy

841
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:04,800
neighborhood typical sort of wealthy

842
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:08,000
suburb the average life there is 84

843
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:10,040
that's above the US average three miles

844
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,960
away where Freddy gray is from the

845
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:14,800
average Lifey was

846
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:16,560
67 that is below the life expectancy of

847
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:20,560
North

848
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:22,480
Korea three miles and a 17year

849
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,800
difference and how long you can expect

850
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,119
to

851
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:28,480
live I don't see how anyone can look at

852
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:30,599
that and not care about inequality

853
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,960
how can you not care about a world where

854
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:35,119
people living three miles apart have a

855
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:38,359
17-year difference and how long they

856
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:40,520
expect to live what's going on three

857
00:35:38,359 --> 00:35:43,119
miles away the average income in Sant

858
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:44,760
toown is four times the average in the

859
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:47,160
average in sorry Roland Park is four

860
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:50,400
times the average income in Sandown in

861
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:54,240
Roland Park 2.5% of kids live in poverty

862
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:56,440
in Sant toown 55% of kids live in

863
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,560
poverty okay three

864
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:01,319
miles and and the odds a kid lives in

865
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:03,480
party is 20 times

866
00:36:01,319 --> 00:36:05,400
different these are the reasons why many

867
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:07,400
of us feel very strong that we need to

868
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,640
address inequality as well as simply

869
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:12,040
absolute

870
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:17,599
deprivation okay questions about

871
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:17,599
that now with that in mind let's talk

872
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:23,000
about what do we do about it so let's

873
00:36:20,839 --> 00:36:24,960
say I've got you at least

874
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,200
motivated let's say you came in this not

875
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,560
really thinking about rich versus poor I

876
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:29,480
hope at least motivated you think it's

877
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,760
interesting problem and think about

878
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:32,280
maybe it's something we might want to do

879
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:35,880
something

880
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:38,800
about well to do so we run

881
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:40,319
into an important problem because

882
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,680
remember with the Dismal science right

883
00:36:40,319 --> 00:36:48,480
nothing's

884
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:48,480
easy okay the problem is the efficiency

885
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:55,800
costs of redistribution remember I said

886
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,200
life isn't typically like our example of

887
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:00,599
perfect competition versus perfectly

888
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:03,000
pric monopolist typically in life if we

889
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:05,400
want to take money from one group we

890
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:08,079
give it to another there's a leak in the

891
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:10,599
bucket what is that leak in the

892
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:13,000
bucket okay well there's fundamentally

893
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:16,400
two leaks so let's say the way we do

894
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:20,079
redistribution in reality is we tax the

895
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:23,440
rich and give money to the

896
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:24,839
poor okay well that leads to S two

897
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:28,040
sources of

898
00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:32,000
leakage the first source of leakage is

899
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:35,359
when you is the dead weight

900
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,359
loss of

901
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:42,680
Taxation when you tax an

902
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:45,160
activity you create less of it and that

903
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:48,839
has a dead weight loss because there's

904
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:51,319
social optimal trades that no longer get

905
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:54,000
made that's the first source of

906
00:37:51,319 --> 00:37:57,640
leakage the second source of leeches

907
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:00,079
leakage is the is the dead weight loss

908
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:03,920
of transfers which is a little more

909
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:05,200
subtle but actually works the same way

910
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:08,480
when you

911
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:10,680
subsidize a lack of economic activity

912
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,599
you create more of it that's the moral

913
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:15,720
hazard problem we talked about last

914
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:18,520
time so you tax something activity you

915
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:21,960
create less of it when you subze a lack

916
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:24,240
of activity you create more of it

917
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:27,800
transferring from Rich to poor involves

918
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,760
both ends of that so it's double weight

919
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:31,839
loss you

920
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:33,960
create okay so to see that we're going

921
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:35,040
to go through a fairly large example

922
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,000
here we're going to end the lecture with

923
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:40,040
sort of a strong example which

924
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:43,839
illustrates this point okay in this

925
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:46,560
example we're g to say everyone earns

926
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:49,160
$20 an hour so our example the wage for

927
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:51,560
everyone's Society is be $20 an hour so

928
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:54,680
everyone has the same

929
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:56,400
underlying marginal product of labor

930
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:59,400
every side he ears $20 an hour marginal

931
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:01,720
revenue product of labor

932
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:03,520
but different people earn different

933
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:05,280
amounts of income and society's

934
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:08,000
utilitarian the government utilitarian

935
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:10,920
so it cares about that different

936
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,160
different amounts of income so let's say

937
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:15,839
that the government wants to make sure

938
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:17,560
that there's a minimum guarantee the

939
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:19,319
government's a commodity

940
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,240
galarian the government says you know

941
00:39:19,319 --> 00:39:23,440
what I want to make sure there's a

942
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:25,720
minimum guarantee of

943
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:28,520
$5,000 I want to make sure that everyone

944
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:30,480
in society has at least

945
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:32,880
$5,000 because I feel like you can't

946
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:36,200
survive with less than

947
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:37,560
$5,000 but I have to pay for that so the

948
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,800
way I'm going to pay for that I'm have

949
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:41,680
I'm gonna have a

950
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:45,359
tax and the tax is going to

951
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:48,200
be that anyone with

952
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:51,280
income

953
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:52,319
um oh I'm sorry let me go back so let me

954
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,000
go back let me finish this first there's

955
00:39:52,319 --> 00:39:55,760
a guarantee of $5,000 but here's the

956
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,960
thing I'm not going to give everyone

957
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,880
$5,000 I want make sure everybody has

958
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:01,119
$5,000 but if you have some money

959
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,800
already I don't want I don't want to

960
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:04,119
guarantee you have $7,000 I'm make sure

961
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,480
have $5,000 so what I'm going to do is

962
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:08,160
I'm set up a transfer program that's

963
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,839
what we call a negative income tax the

964
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:14,440
way it works is if you have zero I give

965
00:40:10,839 --> 00:40:17,240
you 5,000 you have 100 I give you

966
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:19,800
4,900 if you a th000 I give you 4,000

967
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:22,319
that is I top up your income to get you

968
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:25,440
to 5,000 in particular I give you a

969
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:28,480
transfer I give you a transfer which is

970
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:30,119
equal to

971
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:33,640
the

972
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:38,000
max of 0 comma

973
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:40,319
5000 minus y That's the transfer I give

974
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,560
you I give you if your income's above

975
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:44,319
5,000 I give you nothing if your

976
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:46,599
income's below 5,000 give you enough to

977
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:49,760
get up to 5,000 that's how I Implement

978
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:51,880
my commodi egalitarianism solution I get

979
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:55,319
everyone up to 5,000 people clear on

980
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:58,720
that I get them up to

981
00:40:55,319 --> 00:41:02,839
5,000 okay and to assment of a

982
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:04,720
tax the tax is going to be only on the

983
00:41:02,839 --> 00:41:08,880
rich so what I'm going to do is I'm

984
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:11,240
going to say anyone whose earnings is

985
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:13,560
above

986
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:15,319
$20,000 is going to be is going to pay a

987
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:17,160
50% tax

988
00:41:15,319 --> 00:41:20,359
rate

989
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:23,560
above 20K just on your earnings above

990
00:41:20,359 --> 00:41:26,480
20K so all earnings below 20K I don't

991
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:29,119
touch but on any earnings above 20K I'm

992
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:31,359
going to take back half of it to finance

993
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:31,359
this

994
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:35,040
program okay that's the way the program

995
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:38,040
is going to

996
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:39,359
work well let's see how that affects

997
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:42,040
people's budget

998
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:44,359
constraint let's go to figure

999
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:45,920
23-8 this is a standard Leisure

1000
00:41:44,359 --> 00:41:49,200
consumption

1001
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,760
tradeoff okay we people remember I said

1002
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,000
earn 20 bucks an hour so without the

1003
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:54,760
government the budget constraint is the

1004
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,720
black line they can work up to 2,000

1005
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:59,280
hours a

1006
00:41:55,720 --> 00:42:00,880
year and have no no

1007
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,960
consumption I'm sorry they can take

1008
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,920
2,000 hours a year Leisure my bad

1009
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:07,400
leisures on the exsis they 2,000 hours

1010
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:10,079
year Leisure and have no consumption or

1011
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:11,920
take zero Leisure and have 40,000 in

1012
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:14,040
consumption and let's assume we're going

1013
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,040
to measure price of goods is all one so

1014
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:17,400
consumption is just like this

1015
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:19,319
consumption bundle like we talked about

1016
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,520
this numer good idea that basically we

1017
00:42:19,319 --> 00:42:21,520
think of dollars and units of

1018
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:23,680
consumption

1019
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:25,599
interchangeably so basically consumption

1020
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:27,960
costs a dollar the price consumption is

1021
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:30,760
a dollar so basically the trade-off is

1022
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:33,359
simply for every hour I take of leisure

1023
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:36,319
I give up $20 of

1024
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:38,760
consumption and that leads that black

1025
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:41,440
line the program I just described

1026
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:46,880
changes that line as follows first of

1027
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:49,599
all on the leftand side if you

1028
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:51,160
take if you take uh first of all I'm

1029
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:55,520
sorry on the right hand side my bad on

1030
00:42:51,160 --> 00:43:00,200
the right hand side if you take more

1031
00:42:55,520 --> 00:43:02,480
than 17700 50 hours of

1032
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:06,000
leisure we're going to give you money

1033
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:07,359
why because if you take less than $750

1034
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,480
of leisure you're going to have more

1035
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:13,920
than $5,000 already look at the X look

1036
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:17,240
at the y- AIS 750 hours of leisure at

1037
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:20,119
a$2 wage means you're working 250 hours

1038
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:21,960
mean you got 5,000 in income so your

1039
00:43:20,119 --> 00:43:24,839
income's below

1040
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:28,599
$5,000 that means you must be taking

1041
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:29,880
more than 1,750 hours of Leisure for

1042
00:43:28,599 --> 00:43:31,359
those people who are simply going to say

1043
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:33,079
look we're going to make sure you have

1044
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:35,079
at least

1045
00:43:33,079 --> 00:43:38,160
$5,000 what does it do the budget con

1046
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:40,880
Str that says it becomes flat from the

1047
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:43,760
point of 1750 all the way to the point

1048
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:45,119
of 2,000 and then drops back down the

1049
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,520
new budget constraint on the right is

1050
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:48,040
the red segment it's a flat segment

1051
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:51,040
because we're saying no matter how much

1052
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:53,920
leure you take above 1750 you always get

1053
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:55,839
$5,000 in income we just send you a

1054
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:58,559
check for the

1055
00:43:55,839 --> 00:44:02,400
rest like likewise we're going to pay

1056
00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:04,280
for that by a tax on those who earn

1057
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:07,079
above

1058
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:08,760
$20,000 well at $20 an hour that means

1059
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:11,440
people who take less than a thousand

1060
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:13,599
hours of leisure are the ones who earn

1061
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:16,880
more than $20,000 so on those people

1062
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:18,960
were're taxing them 50% so that lowers

1063
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:22,480
the slope of the budget constraint now

1064
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:25,640
for every hour you work above a

1065
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:29,000
thousand you take home only $10 an

1066
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:31,480
hour so that lowers the opportunity cost

1067
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,839
of work lowers the budget constraint to

1068
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:37,920
the upper left right

1069
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:41,839
side okay questions about

1070
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:44,720
that okay now let's

1071
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:47,880
assume that there's three people in this

1072
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:52,400
world okay person

1073
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:56,359
A and B have the same utility function

1074
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:58,920
their utility function is U equals c to

1075
00:44:56,359 --> 00:45:02,240
the 34

1076
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:02,240
time L to the

1077
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:09,400
one4 person C has a different function

1078
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:12,040
they have

1079
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:16,760
C to the 1

1080
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:16,760
nth L to the 8

1081
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:24,559
9th okay so person C really likes

1082
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:26,440
Leisure rela to person A and B right

1083
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:27,920
person A and B have a 3/4 weight on

1084
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:29,800
consumption versus one quarter on

1085
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:31,800
Leisure person C is a one nth way to

1086
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:33,359
consumption Rel to eight nths on Leisure

1087
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:37,240
person C likes

1088
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:37,240
Leisure okay that's the utility

1089
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:40,640
function

1090
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:43,839
okay

1091
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:48,400
now in the optimal Choice

1092
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:51,440
set people are going to set their

1093
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:53,680
mrss equal to their

1094
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,800
MRT okay that's going to be the choice

1095
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:57,760
people are going to make in the optimal

1096
00:45:54,800 --> 00:46:00,839
Choice set

1097
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:03,119
okay so basically what they're going to

1098
00:46:00,839 --> 00:46:04,839
do is they're going to find given this

1099
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:05,640
budget constraint the one I depicted in

1100
00:46:04,839 --> 00:46:08,319
figure

1101
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:10,599
238 what is their optimal

1102
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:13,559
choice and what we're going to

1103
00:46:10,599 --> 00:46:17,480
see is

1104
00:46:13,559 --> 00:46:19,880
that um without the government scheme

1105
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:21,440
we'll see that in figure 239 and we'll

1106
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:23,839
we'll you we'll solve the math and

1107
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:25,920
section of this example we'll solve the

1108
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:26,920
math in section so you can go through it

1109
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,000
but I'm showing you what the answer

1110
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:31,160
answer is we'll go through the math in

1111
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:34,160
the section you'll see person A and B

1112
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:37,640
will choose to be at that intersection

1113
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:39,040
on the left on the black line A1 B1 that

1114
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:40,880
is the choice they'll make given this

1115
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:42,960
budget constraint and given these

1116
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:45,680
preferences they will choose in figure

1117
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:48,800
239 be the A1 B1

1118
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:50,319
intersection unsurprisingly person c

1119
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:52,800
will be choose to be way down on the

1120
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:55,480
right at the C1 intersection why because

1121
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:57,240
they love Leisure person C cares way

1122
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:59,960
about Leisure consumption it's the way

1123
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:01,520
down the right okay we'll work out the

1124
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:03,599
math just take it to me take take my

1125
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:05,960
word that's what the math

1126
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:08,839
delivers now we put in the tax and

1127
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:11,640
transfer scheme what happens to person C

1128
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:11,640
why do they move to

1129
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:16,599
C2 why do they move to

1130
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:18,599
C2 well if you think about it think

1131
00:47:16,599 --> 00:47:22,720
about income and substitution effects

1132
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:25,760
for person C the substitution effect is

1133
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:27,359
when you're at like person C there is a

1134
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,559
100% tax

1135
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:31,680
on your

1136
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:35,000
earnings look at this 100% tax because

1137
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:38,160
every dollar you earn you get less in

1138
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:41,800
transfer substitution effect says don't

1139
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:45,480
work right because if you work you get

1140
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:47,520
nothing the income effect is your richer

1141
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:50,599
you're getting a transfer income effect

1142
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:52,200
also says don't work so they don't work

1143
00:47:50,599 --> 00:47:53,119
turn that if you pay people not to work

1144
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:56,400
they won't we learned that in the

1145
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:59,760
Netherlands last time so all the people

1146
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:03,920
who were C1 go to C2 they stop

1147
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:04,800
working what about A1 and B1 well here

1148
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,960
it's

1149
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:10,720
unclear they now face a lower wage

1150
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:12,400
effective wage of $10 of $20 whether

1151
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:14,000
they work more or less depends on income

1152
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:16,119
versus substitution

1153
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,240
effects here I'm going to assume

1154
00:48:16,119 --> 00:48:20,680
substitution effects

1155
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:23,800
dominate so they work

1156
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:27,760
less so the new equilibrium is the

1157
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:29,800
person C works less

1158
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:34,599
and person A and B work

1159
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:37,880
less what have we found leaks in the

1160
00:48:34,599 --> 00:48:40,520
bucket we thought we could raise a bunch

1161
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:43,640
of money from taxiing and being given to

1162
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:46,559
C but we missed two things first of all

1163
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:48,160
A and B don't work as hard so we can't

1164
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:50,960
raise as much money from

1165
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:53,880
them second of all C doesn't work so

1166
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:59,319
hard so we need to get more money to see

1167
00:48:53,880 --> 00:49:00,760
so if you started with 0.1 A1 B1 and C1

1168
00:48:59,319 --> 00:49:03,280
you would have a certain estimate of how

1169
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:05,799
much money you have to take to get

1170
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:08,319
person C1 the transfer your estimate

1171
00:49:05,799 --> 00:49:10,280
would be too low why would your estimate

1172
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:12,760
be to too low because you'd miss the

1173
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:14,480
leakage you miss the fact that A1 and B1

1174
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:16,520
going to work less so you raise less

1175
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:19,119
money from them and C1 is going to work

1176
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:21,079
less so you give more money to C1 those

1177
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:24,079
are the leaks that's a graphical

1178
00:49:21,079 --> 00:49:26,839
illustration of the leaks in the bucket

1179
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:27,960
that is how the Leaky bucket works it

1180
00:49:26,839 --> 00:49:30,920
causes

1181
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:34,400
taxation causes assuming substitution

1182
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:36,880
effects dominate taxation causes the

1183
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:40,119
rich to work less hard which means you

1184
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:42,079
raise less money and it causes the poor

1185
00:49:40,119 --> 00:49:44,480
to work less hard which means you have

1186
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:46,359
to spend more money and those the tour

1187
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,839
so leaked that was very fast and

1188
00:49:46,359 --> 00:49:49,559
graphical in section you go through the

1189
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:51,839
math but that just gives you a sense of

1190
00:49:49,559 --> 00:49:54,839
how the leakages work we'll follow up on

1191
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:54,839
Monday
