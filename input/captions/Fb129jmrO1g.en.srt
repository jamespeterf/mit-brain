1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,920
And we look back at 2023, there was

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,519
about 26,000 terowatts of power that has

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,360
been computed by the world. No. And the

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,960
forecast is that this will increase by

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:19,439
about 40% in the next 10 years. 70 80%

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,320
of that power is still generated by uh

7
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,320
by hydrocarbons. So gas, oil and coal in

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,439
some countries on it. And looking

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,039
forward, this is not going to be

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,119
sustainable because the demand for power

11
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,279
is going to be much more than than what

12
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:34,399
we actually think. And it's not a very

13
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:36,160
linear increase. It's going to be cycles

14
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,680
where power demands actually spike all

15
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,760
over the place and then they go down

16
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,760
again. So it's not very very forward.
