I'm Katie TR Taylor CEO and co-founder

8
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:20,359
of narti AI it was founded four years

9
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,800
ago after we had essentially tuned an AI

10
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:25,160
model around best practices in

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,080
cross-functional collaboration and

12
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:29,320
communication as part of product

13
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,800
development and research and development

14
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,440
the result is we're working with

15
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,640
Incredible companies from cow and Boeing

16
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,320
to Comcast and and many others to help

17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,719
those product development and research

18
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:44,039
and development teams launch products to

19
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:46,800
Market faster and part of the backstory

20
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:48,840
of narti uh about three four years ago

21
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,600
we were tapped as one of the first seven

22
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,680
developer ambassadors at open AI thanks

23
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,280
to some of this groundbreaking research

24
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,719
we had done on predictive language

25
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,440
modeling and based on our um

26
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,800
Partnerships and understanding of how

27
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,400
innovation Communications happens across

28
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:07,720
Industries and from that uh engagement

29
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:10,200
narti was born and today we um are

30
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:13,360
supporting amazing teams helping them

31
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:16,159
save time and refocus their energy on

32
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,720
more strategic and Innovative work um

33
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,799
and I I'll share a little bit more about

34
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:22,320
what that means but let me share with

35
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:25,640
you a bit about why nartis is so special

36
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,920
um not just for uh Professionals in in

37
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,520
product development but um where we're

38
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,840
starting to see expansion even into to

39
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,960
again from R&D or innovation teams

40
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:37,079
through product Dev and into even

41
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,079
commercialization and Manufacturing

42
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:43,560
workflows narti is an AI that prompts

43
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:46,159
you it pulls your insights and enables

44
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,920
the organization overall to capture the

45
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,640
real-time insights of their people to

46
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:54,040
the people within your organization

helping them create everything from a

49
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,520
strong product requirements document or

50
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,880
Market intell ENT report all the way

51
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,600
through to fully designed slide decks

52
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:11,000
with the right technical story around a

53
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:13,920
pitch or a project status update narrati

54
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,680
helps teams analyze complex scientific

55
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,440
and Technical insights pulling it from

56
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,680
Individual contributors across your

57
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:23,239
organization but also from existing

58
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,120
Market literature so in narti you can

59
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:28,120
search through millions of peer-reviewed

60
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,800
Publications you can collect competitive

61
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:33,280
intelligence across uh your competitor

62
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,280
sites and generate evidence tables

63
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,879
literature reviews and AI generated

64
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,800
analyses within a few minutes work that

65
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:41,920
used to take a 100 plus

66
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,920
hours then you can capture these

67
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:48,080
insights and pull them into project

68
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,879
plans pitches um technical insights and

69
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,959
all of the documentation that's really

70
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:55,200
required to help teams accelerate

71
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:55,200
through a product development

72
00:02:55,879 --> 00:03:01,440
cycle what's so exciting is the advances

73
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:04,040
that are our team is making in reference

74
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,799
ability of data and insights especially

75
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,519
for larger Enterprises as you're

76
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:10,799
training your own models and you're

77
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,920
looking to make AI usable and accessible

78
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:15,799
to teams across their use cases and

79
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:17,519
you're also looking for the best ways to

80
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:19,840
structure that knowledge that

81
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:23,040
content-based knowledge through metadata

82
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:26,040
and enable it to help train your model

83
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,159
the seamless usability of narti stacks

84
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:31,000
right into that strategy and helps your

85
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:33,120
teams capture those insights at scale

86
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,200
and then learn from them securely and

87
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,439
privately over time I'm most excited

88
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,280
about all of the advanced knowledge

89
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:43,799
architecture and data architecture that

90
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:45,840
narti is achieving um and this is where

91
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:49,280
our partnership has been adding such

92
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,040
tremendous value so for example at um

93
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,480
Cal research and development

94
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,760
professionals are using narti to craft

95
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:57,799
project plans research and development

96
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,640
presentations for Global Leadership

97
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:02,200
scientific posters and more and a Boeing

98
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,480
product development teams are able to

99
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:07,120
use narti to write pitches technical

100
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,200
briefs and requirements we're excited to

101
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,000
be growing in scaling and seeing the

102
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:15,239
results of this work uh compared to

103
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,079
assistant style searchable AI assistants

104
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:20,479
like chat GPT or some of the tuned GPT

105
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,759
models that most companies are relying

106
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:26,160
on today most uh of the research that's

107
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,880
getting conducted in on narti as

108
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,800
compared to some of those assistants is

109
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:33,080
is quite exciting in terms of the

110
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:35,039
productivity the uh effectiveness of the

111
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:37,240
the work that's being generated and the

112
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:40,840
way that this overall can help move

113
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:43,240

00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,599
our customers Revenue gains through

148
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,599
speed through their product development

149
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:11,280
Cycles so we're measuring if your

150
00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:15,400
typical cycle is 90 days how do we cut

151
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:17,560
it down uh to 12 you know to to to four

152
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,039
weeks or six weeks through automated

153
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,319
documentation that's one of the biggest

154
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:23,120
ones the bigger picture kpis we're

155
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:25,160
tracking with customers are growth in

you saw that nine hours time saved per

161
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,800
person per week uh that's important

162
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,759
right and we need to make sure that

uh within Enterprise or mid-market Tech

183
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:28,479
Stacks so being able to very seamlessly

184
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,160
stack into the tuning models that you're

185
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,639
probably investing in

186

one of the biggest pain points we hear

189
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,080
is the challenge of working with

190
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,199
unstructured data um and the challenge

191
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:43,479
of capturing real- time content-based

192
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:46,280
knowledge and being able to grow upon it

193
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:48,879
so for example as people who are

194
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:50,879
luminaries and they've published several

195
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,919
patents in their career as they look

196
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,840
towards retirement how do you ensure

197
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:57,000
that you're capturing their insights for

198
00:07:54,840 --> 00:08:00,560
future Generations that those insights

199
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,879
are queriable and referenceable and um

200
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,000
and we need to start doing that today

201
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:05,280
and we need to start doing it in a

202
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,199
streamlined way and good news is if

203
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,000
you're making that a wonderful user

204
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,159
experience that's integrated into

205
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,680
people's workflows you're going to do

206
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:15,759
that uh you're going to achieve that

207
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:18,080
type of culture change required of AI so

208
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:21,080
much more seamlessly um so I I'm

209
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:23,560
thrilled about being part of that um and

210
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:26,120
and all of the new capabilities and in

211
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:30,000
AI tool kitting that make that possible

212
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,000
fantastic thank you KD
