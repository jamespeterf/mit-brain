1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,840
well thank you so much for that kind

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,759
introduction and uh it's a great

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,480
pleasure to speak at this conference on

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,920
a topic that's of critical importance to

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,440
not only every stakeholder here uh but

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,759
broadly defined uh the challenges around

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,920
sustainability for the globe uh so what

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,279
I'm going to tell you about is a science

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,240
story but very critically has really

10
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:24,439
really deep and important implications

11
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,480
for thinking about decarbonizing

12
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:28,400
chemical

13
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:30,840
manufacturing um and what I'm I'm hoping

14
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,360
to really convey to you is just enough

15
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,800
science so you can ask the right

16
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:36,520
questions when you're thinking about

17
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,160
implementing any of the frontier

18
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,399
decarbonization Solutions in your

19
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,039
industry in your company whatever it may

20
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,480
be that you're thinking about so without

21
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:45,079
further Ado I want to get started I want

22
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,559
to thank the people that did this work

23
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:48,640
this was really led by a really

24
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,079
phenomenal um graduate student in my

25
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,199
group who's now a postto at Lawrence

26
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,239
Livermore National

27
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:55,719
Laboratory so I want to start out by

28
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,440
just emphasizing that the chemical

29
00:00:55,719 --> 00:01:00,160
industry and chemical manufacturing

30
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:03,160
specifically contribute significantly um

31
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,760
to CO2 emissions so on this axis here we

32
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:08,520
have CO2 emissions here in in million

33
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,840
tons equivalent per year um and you can

34
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,680
see many of the compounds sort of the

35
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,640
top chemicals produced globally

36
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,400
contribute substantially to overall

37
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:20,520
emissions burden things like your btxs

38
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,159
propylene ethylene is one of the highest

39
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,000
ones that goes into all the Plastics we

40
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,960
produce methanol is a sort of Gateway

41
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,479
intermediate to a whole host of

42
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,079
Downstream products everything from

43
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,159
pharmaceutical manufacturing to to

44
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,799
chemicals to materials um you will

45
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,439
notice one very interesting thing

46
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:39,520
ammonia has to have its own axis um uh

47
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,360
separated from all the carbon containing

48
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,680
materials here uh and that's really

49
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,040
because ammonia feeds uh the world right

50
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,719
so so we produce ammonia at a scale even

51
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,520
larger than all of these but if you sum

52
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:51,159
all of these up you get to really

53
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,640
substantial fractions of the carbon

54
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:55,560
budget um and these only increase more

55
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,759
so when you think about some of these

56
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,560
intermediates being used as alternative

57
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:03,000
fuels in a future um decarbon Energy

58
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,000
System right this is only the uses right

59
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,920
now for chemical manufacturing itself in

60
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
many respects the demands for these may

61
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,480
go up in safs or in other areas where

62
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,360
you may want to use these chemicals so

63
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,959
given that there's this huge amount

64
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,080
largely of

65
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,760
carbon-based chemicals um that

66
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,160
contribute substantially to the carbon

67
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,239
footprint there's been a lot of academic

68
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,480
activity asking if there are ways to

69
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:29,160
Source these materials not from fossil

70
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,519
fuels in energy intensive and carbon

71
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,800
intensive process CES but rather to

72
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,360
actually use waste CO2 as an input to

73
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,440
the production of these materials um via

74
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:42,000
by and large electrochemical and in some

75
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:43,959
cases thermochemical processes as well

76
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,120
so this was really stimulated a lot by

77
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:49,159
the discoveries in the 70s and 80s that

78
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:52,760
showed that at even room temperature

79
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:55,040
electrolysis of el simple um uh

80
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:58,040
electrode materials like copper silver

81
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,239
and gold would serve to generate a wide

82
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:02,519
array of some of these particular matly

83
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,319
important products things like carbon

84
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:06,440
monoxide a key chemical intermediate to

85
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,720
a whole bunch of products um some of the

86
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,000
undesirable ones as well like methane

87
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,680
key intermediates going be talked about

88
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,200
in the next uh talk formate for example

89
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,760
ethylene ethanol propenol for example

90
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,000
that can be converted to things like

91
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,360
propylene ethylene and so forth right so

92
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,159
so there's been an enormous amount of

93
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,840
excitement in the prospect that room

94
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,599
temperature electrosynthesis May Avail

95
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:30,040
access to these products directly from

96
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:32,040
CO2 in a single step uh and in the

97
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,480
ensuing years there's been literally

98
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,360
thousands and thousands of papers I

99
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,720
think we're up to the point where

100
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:38,159
there's probably a thousand papers every

101
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:40,000
year on this subject and so I want to

102
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,120
help you cut through all that clutter

103
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,400
and make sure you know the right

104
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,280
questions to ask when you're thinking

105
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,439
about any of these Technologies right um

106
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,120
so one of the problems one of the key

107
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:52,079
problems is that the production of these

108
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,799
various products is not selective right

109
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:56,280
so the lack of selectivity means that in

110
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,959
order to actually make any of these

111
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,079
products at scale and to do so in an

112
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,760
economically V able fashion means that

113
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:04,200
the selectivity to these products needs

114
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,519
to be substantially improved and in

115
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,840
particular one needs to eliminate the

116
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:11,480
undesirable products usually C1 products

117
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,959
like methane that are of low value right

118
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,400
and that's still a very much a frontier

119
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,280
challenge we're making progress in that

120
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,840
area and I'll talk about that the the

121
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:20,720
the next topic you also make parasitic

122
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:23,400
hydrogen which can be valorized but in

123
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,000
certain cases is not the the principal

124
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,639
goal of this reaction the second point I

125
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,120
want to make here is that even for some

126
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,360
catalysts that are seleced it say

127
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,880
generating carbon monoxide there's a

128
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:37,479
really big elephant in the room problem

129
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,520
which is that to achieve the selectivity

130
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:42,080
you need to operate in an electrolyte

131
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,360
environment that is alkaline now if any

132
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,440
of you have had freshman chemistry

133
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,440
you'll know there's a fundamental

134
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:50,039
problem with that CO2 is an acid it

135
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,039
reacts irreversibly with alkaline

136
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:53,840
electrolytes and this is what has been

137
00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:55,720
appreciated in the last couple years is

138
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,639
what's known as the carbonate problem

139
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,039
though in the popular literature and in

140
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:01,400
a venture capital community that has

141
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:03,199
invested l Lally billions of dollars in

142
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,440
this effort it is completely not talked

143
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,400
about so let me explain what that is and

144
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,880
explain why that's critical to being

145
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,160
able to address that if you want to do

146
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,199
anything in CO2 reduction but the Crux

147
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,919
of the problem is that the conditions

148
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,280
necessary to allow for high efficiency

149
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,360
of producing one product from a

150
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,039
selectivity standpoint are the very same

151
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,080
things lead to inefficiency from a

152
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,919
carbon standpoint and from an energetic

153
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:27,680
standpoint I'll explain that tradeoff in

154
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:29,440
a moment okay so first part first we're

155
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,840
going to try to ask how can we control

156
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,720
this selectivity challenge in such a way

157
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,800
that we can eliminate methane production

158
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,400
and instead selectively form products

159
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,319
that we'd like to valorize and the next

160
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:42,160
part of the talk is really assessing how

161
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:43,720
can we unlock a way to do selective CO2

162
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,319
conversion without carbonating our

163
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,120
electrolyte okay so this is all kind of

164
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:49,720
recent work from our group and I'll try

165
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,919
to in a whirlwind fashion walk you

166
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,479
through what we've learned here so the

167
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:55,400
key things you want to try to maximize

168
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:57,120
for the production of the zyro products

169
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,759
things like ethylene multicarbon

170
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,520
products but not the single carbon

171
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:02,319
products like methane

172
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,120
right and and in doing so what you

173
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,120
really want to track is the relative

174
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,199
rate of these and what's been learned is

175
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:11,039
you can control this a lot by how you

176
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:12,880
tune the pH environment of the medium

177
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:16,360
particularly because some reactions are

178
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,919
pH sensitive while other ones aren't um

179
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,160
and that's really understood through a

180
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,800
lot of mechanistic thinking that our

181
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,240
group developed in terms of the

182
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,919
individual steps that lead to carbon C

183
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:28,759
coupling and ultimately the high value

184
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:31,400
C2 products but despite this The General

185
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:33,160
mechanistic ke for how CC bonds are

186
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,639
formed on the surface has remained

187
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:38,080
largely unchallenged and unchanged for

188
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:39,880
the better part of 40 years and so we

189
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,639
wanted to ask a very very fundamental

190
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,720
question could we design an electrolyte

191
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:44,800
that would fundamentally alter the

192
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,360
mechanistic manifold to allow us to

193
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,800
unlock a selectivity uh opportunity that

194
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:53,120
isn't available in traditional

195
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:55,160
systems so what we figured out was that

196
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,919
the key to this selectivity being

197
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:00,440
challenging is because most most

198
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:02,440
electrolysis is conduct in aquous

199
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:05,160
electrolytes and the problem with aquous

200
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:07,039
electrolytes is that water as a proton

201
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,599
donor though it is efficient is

202
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,199
extraordinarily promiscuous in a sense

203
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,199
it can deliver protons to many

204
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,440
intermediates along the reaction pathway

205
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,879
leading inherently to in un selectivity

206
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,240
in the overall

207
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:21,639
processes so what we figured out is if

208
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:24,240
we could instead exchange a water-based

209
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:26,960
electrolyte with something that was aoic

210
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:29,720
we could instead introduce a selective

211
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:32,360
proton donor that we could tune in its

212
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:34,120
structure and its PKA and other

213
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,440
properties to be able to engender the

214
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,160
desired selectivity that's exactly what

215
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,319
we decided to do I'll just quickly show

216
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,960
the data that we found here that in the

217
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:45,400
right type of medium a DMSO medium with

218
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,240
a phenol-based proton donor we can

219
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,479
completely eliminate the production of

220
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:51,720
methane altogether we don't detect any

221
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:53,560
from this type of medium and all of the

222
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:56,080
carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide that

223
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:58,080
we reduce is going simply to C2 products

224
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,800
that are valuable things like ethylene

225
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,520
glycol that can directly feed into the

226
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,560
market um athane ethylene that can then

227
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,520
be subsequently valorized these are

228
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,360
still baby steps towards an overall

229
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,360
system but what I'm trying to emphasize

230
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,400
to you is that we need to completely

231
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,879
reimagine how we're doing CO2 reduction

232
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,479
to be able to make viable uh access to

233
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,039
the types of systems that we would want

234
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,800
to use for decarbonizing chemical

235
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,840
manufacturing okay I'm going to skip

236
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,639
this real quickly this just shows the

237
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,680
kinetic details that we've uncovered

238
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,199
from this system and showing that the

239
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:31,599
Crux of it relates to changing the rate

240
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:34,039
liit step to a much later portion of the

241
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,719
reaction sequence that allows us to get

242
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:37,800
much higher selectivity for the desired

243
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:40,919
C2 reaction

244
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:43,039
products okay so by this sort of change

245
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:45,320
in mechanistic thinking we're on the

246
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,920
pathway towards the rational design of

247
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,680
the electrolyte environment in a way

248
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,800
that allows us to get high selectivity

249
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,800
without the other trade-offs I mentioned

250
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,160
early

251
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,760
on okay so let me switch gears now for

252
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,880
the remaining part of my talk and just

253
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,040
talk about this really key problem that

254
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:02,079
unfortunately no one outside side of a

255
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,680
small subset of the academic Community

256
00:09:02,079 --> 00:09:06,839
is talking about including hundreds of

257
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:09,600
millions of dollars spent by Doe to to

258
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,040
support some of these efforts so um uh

259
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,160
what is the carbonate problem it's

260
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,200
really comes down to pretty much

261
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:17,320
freshman chemistry which is the

262
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:19,200
realization that CO2 reduction catalysis

263
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:21,880
is most selective when your electrolyte

264
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,880
is alkaline essentially it's basic but

265
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:27,360
CO2 is an acid gas and and because CO2

266
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,800
is an acid gas you basically have these

267
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,120
very simple sort of freshman chemistry

268
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,560
type of reaction so CO2 reacts with The

269
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,839
Alkali in the electrolyte to make

270
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,000
bicarbonates that can react further with

271
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:41,120
Alkali to make carbonates and because

272
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,720
these reactions are irreversible in an

273
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,519
alkaline environment you will

274
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,480
irreversibly change the composition of

275
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:49,480
your electrolyte over time the biggest

276
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,279
advances in engendering very high

277
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:54,040
selectivity for the desirable C2

278
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,720
products have all come from conditions

279
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:57,480
where you're not running your reaction

280
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,800
at steady state you're essentially

281
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,079
irreversibly over time consuming the

282
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,920
reactor constituents that you need to do

283
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:06,480
the reaction that's fine for publishing

284
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:09,240
a paper it's impossible at an industrial

285
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,600
scale so what I just want to emphasize

286
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:14,560
is that if you start with an alkaline

287
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:17,040
media the base you generate in that

288
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,640
Medium will carbonate that will go into

289
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,519
the bulk of the electrolyte you will

290
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,279
lose that electrolyte constituent you

291
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:24,519
will alter the pH environment in the

292
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:26,320
medium and that will ultimately lead to

293
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:29,200
the carbonation and a reduction in the

294
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:32,040
CO2 utilization efficiency the problem

295
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,839
is is so pernicious in fact that if you

296
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,920
look at the math to being able to

297
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,880
actually reconvert those carbonates back

298
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,639
into CO2 and the alkal the energy cost

299
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,839
of that is larger than the energy you're

300
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:45,160
storing in the products you're making so

301
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:46,600
99% of all the papers you see in the

302
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:49,240
literature actually what should be

303
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:51,600
called fuel wasting devices rather than

304
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:54,360
fuel or chemical producing

305
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,920
devices right um and again I I can't

306
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,800
stress enough that this needs to be

307
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,760
really appreciated in deeper level in

308
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:02,000
the in the community outside of again a

309
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,320
small set set of the academic so how do

310
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,320
we decided to address this well we

311
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:09,959
realized is that the bad actor is the

312
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:12,320
water itself right water reacts with CO2

313
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:14,399
to make bicarbonate so if we could find

314
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,720
a media where the water activity is

315
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:19,720
lowered sufficiently we ought to be able

316
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:22,000
to orthogonalize the reduction of CO2

317
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,880
from its undesirable carbonation via an

318
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,760
irreversible reaction and so that's what

319
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,839
we basically did we found that if you

320
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,040
could if you can mitigate the water

321
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:32,320
activity by again choosing non- aquous

322
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:34,320
solvent and then designing a proton

323
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,600
donor that was itself non-nucleophilic

324
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,240
with respect to reaction with CO2 you

325
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,800
could actually carry out this reaction

326
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,760
in a way that could engender High

327
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:45,360
selectivity while also enabling and

328
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:47,760
cailing the actual conversion of CO2 to

329
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,440
an undesirable byproduct and this

330
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,079
actually works quite well so we can get

331
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,760
very very high selectivities in this

332
00:11:51,079 --> 00:11:55,120
case for CO2 reduction to carbon

333
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:57,360
monoxide rivaling the best values that

334
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,920
are observed in aquous media in this

335
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,240
DMSO acetic acid electrolyte media and

336
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,680
we've now studied many other

337
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:05,720
electrolytes for this process um the key

338
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,200
point I want to stress here is that we

339
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:10,920
can show quantitatively by NMR analysis

340
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,800
and other methods that any amount of CO2

341
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:15,000
that's taken up in the medium unlike in

342
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,639
water is IR is reversible it can

343
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,760
actually be exchanged in and out so the

344
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:21,399
reaction can run at steady state without

345
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:24,079
irreversible carbonation and what we can

346
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:26,079
also show is that after the reaction is

347
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:28,279
done you don't generate a substantial

348
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,680
quantity of any of the deleterious

349
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:31,480
carbonates that would other wise form in

350
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,760
an aquous alkaline

351
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:36,519
electrolyte okay so what I really want

352
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,680
to emphasize here is that the Crux this

353
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:40,880
problem is how you control the

354
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:43,560
electrolyte environment to be able to

355
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,800
steer selectivity versus CO2 reduction

356
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,639
without having compromising carbonation

357
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,600
reactions form in the medium we've

358
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:51,560
started to understand the principles for

359
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,360
threading this needle and we're just on

360
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,839
the verge of Designing more advanced

361
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,920
electrolytes to be able to develop

362
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:59,399
systems that might actually be viable um

363
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,600
for for industrial decarbonization uh of

364
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:02,839
these chemical

365
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:05,079
processes okay I just want to summarize

366
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:06,480
by saying that you know there's a large

367
00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:08,320
opportunity in thinking about

368
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,800
reimagining what's been done in the last

369
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,480
40 years to try to do CO2 reduction and

370
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,440
what's happened historically is people

371
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,560
have identified certain conditions and

372
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,079
tried to engineer the heck out of it and

373
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,440
and what we've sort of realized that you

374
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:22,079
have to take a step back and re redesign

375
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:24,000
from the start if there's some

376
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:25,519
fundamental impediment that's preventing

377
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,519
the viability of that system and I've

378
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:30,199
given you two kind of examples of that

379
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,760
in this case um and I just want to leave

380
00:13:30,199 --> 00:13:33,760
you with just saying that there's a lot

381
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,800
of opportunity in the decarbonization of

382
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,040
chemical manufacturing but it really

383
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:40,040
does require a deep understanding of the

384
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:42,440
mechanisms underpaying those processes

385
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:44,199
and how to control those precisely to be

386
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:46,000
able to engineer a system that's viable

387
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:48,040
for the overall reactions you'd want to

388
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,760
do so with that I'll stop and be more

389
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,760
than happy to take

390
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,720
questions so we don't have questions

391
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,680
online so

392
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,959
if you have questions the audience here

393
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:07,279
or those

394
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:07,279
remotely please feel free to

395
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,480
ask

396
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,880
okay thank you worldwind indeed but

397
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:22,440
fascinating I'm interested to hear your

398
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:24,480
opinion on what is the biggest barrier

399
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:27,320
then for industrial scaleup given that

400
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,519
you now have uh a viable chemical

401
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,399
approach yeah so we have a viable

402
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,320
chemical approach for doing the cathodic

403
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:35,560
reaction with selectivity without these

404
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:37,360
competing side reactions we're working

405
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:39,199
right now on creating a corresponding

406
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,759
anode reaction that would also be able

407
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,639
to efficiently operate in the overall

408
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:44,480
system we think that's very tractable we

409
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,680
made a lot of progress already towards

410
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,639
that um but one thing that should be

411
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:52,480
noted about really any electrochemical

412
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:54,880
technology is that they are in a sense

413
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,040
very bespoke maybe I can say a little

414
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,519
bit more about that you know if I have a

415
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,839
catalyst uh in a traditional thermal

416
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:04,160
thermal process right and I make it into

417
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:06,079
a palladized bed I can put that into a

418
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,519
standard off-the-shelf type of reactor

419
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,320
and there are many that are made many

420
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,759
manufacturers that make them and I can

421
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:14,639
use that as a sort of way to rapidly

422
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:16,399
scale that process um but when you think

423
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,959
about electrochemical Technologies the

424
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,279
nature of the electrolyte the nature of

425
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:22,519
the Catalyst all of them have to play

426
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:24,240
well with each other and so as a result

427
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:26,560
of that in many respects each

428
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:30,040
electrochemical technology is its own

429
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:32,000
bespoke scaling challenge um and that is

430
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:36,079
one of the things which is a whole topic

431
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,800
unto itself that that that places

432
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:40,040
challenges they're surmountable but that

433
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:43,199
places challenges towards Rapid scaling

434
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,199
of a lot of electrochemical

435
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:50,079
Technologies you had a on the on the

436
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:52,160
chart you had ammonia at uh at its own

437
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:55,279
Planet uh can you talk a little bit more

438
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,959
about it yeah well so um I think that

439
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:59,279
there there's a whole other side of my

440
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:01,560
research group that focuses on on how to

441
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,440
think about decarbonizing uh ammonia

442
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:05,160
production you know ammonia right now

443
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,360
contributes about 1% greenhouse gas

444
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,680
emissions that's only for the ammonia we

445
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,319
currently produce for fertilizer

446
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,639
production there's a view in the future

447
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:13,759
that ammonia will need to be generated

448
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:14,959
as a hydrogen Vector which means then

449
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,040
the needs for that are going to only

450
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:19,959
grow right um there are some particular

451
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:22,399
challenges with that because the current

452
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:24,639
process for making ammonia is performed

453
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,720
at very very large scale but it's

454
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:29,160
actually really efficient from an energy

455
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,240
standpoint uh the only problem is it's

456
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:33,279
very hard to downscale that technology

457
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:36,720
and it's particularly hard because that

458
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:39,120
large scale means that you often have to

459
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,319
pay billions of dollars to build a plan

460
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,279
and only actually get return on

461
00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:43,800
investment over a very very long time

462
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:45,480
right so so what we're trying to focus

463
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,839
on in our group is figuring out ways to

464
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:50,319
take traditional habbos synthesis of

465
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,759
ammonia and do it in a small enough

466
00:16:50,319 --> 00:16:53,959
scale that it can work with renewable

467
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,440
green hydrogen for example can be done

468
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:57,759
in a more portable fashion where they're

469
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,680
stranded renewable electricity those are

470
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,720
all the catalysis and science challenges

471
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:04,000
that revolve around that very very big

472
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:06,079
elephant in in the room I would say um

473
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,199
but they're very much needed if we're

474
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,319
going to use ammonia's erector and if

475
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:12,919
we're going to um uh see that as a

476
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:15,199
component to a future hydrogen economy

477
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:18,280
Yogi uh final question

478
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:20,559
here yep yeah similar to your that first

479
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:22,199
question your your Fe and selectivity

480
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,240
are impressive how about like your

481
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:26,760
current density how how high can you get

482
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,360
it up to so we're in the early stages of

483
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:31,919
the electrolyte design here but we have

484
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,720
had systems where we can in initial

485
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:36,240
efforts into the hundreds of milliamp

486
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:39,039
current density um but that's not yet

487
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,600
ready for industrial scale deployment um

488
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:42,880
and so there's still much work to be

489
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:44,440
done in those those respects right so I

490
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,520
I think we'd be the first to say that

491
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:48,720
we're still at the baby steps of this

492
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:50,360
process remember our competition has had

493
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,480
40 years on us but we'll get there in a

494
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,840
year or

495
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:58,840
two okay everybody let's uh thank

496
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,840
Professor seren jth thanks Yogi
