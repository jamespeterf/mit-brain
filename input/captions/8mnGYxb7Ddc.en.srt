1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:04,040
uh my name is sh from happily. We're the

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,160
magic behind happy High performing

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:08,120
culture over the past 10 years we've

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,240
been trying to figure out how to really

5
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:13,400
change organizational culture um we were

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,200
built on found foundational research at

7
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,000
MIT and people analytics where we found

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,119
that there were real patterns that just

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,800
showed us that people relationships

10
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:24,080
strong relationships were just at the

11
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,000
heart of all the um you know great

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,599
organizational health and also great

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,119
organizational performance and there's

14
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,439
also ample research that shows us that

15
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:33,840
companies with great culture just

16
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,440
outperform their peers by a very very

17
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,559
large margin um the problem however with

18
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,280
culture is that it's not very tangible

19
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:44,559
and it's very hard to measure and

20
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,480
because of this um all organizations uh

21
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,280
are just paying these hidden costs from

22
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,199
the very top of the organization where

23
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,120
you have CEOs that struggle to really

24
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:54,000
get alignment they spend more time

25
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,800
explaining their decisions than actually

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,600
trying to you know drive drive things

27
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,559
home we have middle managers who are

28
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,399
reacting to problems as firefighters

29
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:03,160
more than anything else and then we have

30
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:05,680
employees who you know when they joined

31
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:07,640
yesterday they take forever to really

32
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,360
build the the right relationships to

33
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,159
understand how things work here and

34
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,240
really understand their role and how

35
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,240
that aligns with organization purpose

36
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,680
and that's where culture comes in and

37
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:21,400
without this we have employee turnover

38
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:24,240
um rising and we have absenteeism and

39
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:26,240
and disengagement that plagues

40
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,560
organizations that's where happily comes

41
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,720
in we've built natively into our

42
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,320
platform Three core compon components

43
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,399
first is analytics where we have the

44
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,880
most fine grained people analytics in

45
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:40,520
the world getting realtime reliable data

46
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:44,159
on people secondly we use technology

47
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:45,680
like AI to really power um how we

48
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,719
understand people within organizations

49
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,119
and help them and finally we buildt this

50
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:52,159
behavioral change engine where we are

51
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:54,119
able to take feedback turn them into

52
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,360
insights and turn them into nudges

53
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:59,960
almost instantaneously and driving

54
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:01,600
behavioral change in a very powerful way

55
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,759
through Empirical research we found that

56
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,680
there were four main capabilities that

57
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,479
we need to bring into organizations to

58
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,959
really move culture in a very measurable

59
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,400
and and positive way the first of which

60
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,879
is creating psychological safety our

61
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,120
people science and our Behavioral

62
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,920
Science really Powers new ways to create

63
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,360
this openness and transparency within

64
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,000
organizations where people can share

65
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,360
their problems and opportunities in a

66
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,040
safe way secondly we've used AI to

67
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,319
develop human skills and emotional

68
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,720
intelligence in a measurable way uh

69
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:33,160
skills empathy and self-awareness that

70
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:36,280
sometimes are lacking more today than

71
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:38,760
ever we are also making active in their

72
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:41,519
roles today managers bleed and make

73
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,319
decisions mainly using intuition that

74
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,000
fails us even harder when we're not

75
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:47,720
working in person while now we have data

76
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,879
to help us make more informed and

77
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,879
precise decisions to support our teams

78
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:53,879
and finally what we didn't realize would

79
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:57,480
be so important but now is the pillar of

80
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:59,319
all is uh turning company values into

81
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,360
behaviors that drive daily actions and

82
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:05,159
decisions and these values become the

83
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:07,440
direction in which your culture

84
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:09,200
changes what we've done is we've

85
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,440
gamified the product so it's something

86
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,680
that people want to use every day um

87
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,040
it's led to this really sticky Hab

88
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,120
behavior that drives powerful habits so

89
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,239
today we have very high adoption rates

90
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,040
that lead to really powerful outcomes

91
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,720
and because we're able to create this

92
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:26,519
real meaningful feedback loop that

93
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,799
people want to participate in

94
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:30,000
organizations have a whole new way to

95
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,040
understand their people and their

96
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,959
organizational Health imagine having

97
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,080
Google analytics but about your people

98
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:37,920
so you know how happy everybody is you

99
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,439
know how engaged they are you know who

100
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,040
your impactful people are um just by

101
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:45,239
looking at the behaviors and and and and

102
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,599
the algorithms that we've built around

103
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:49,239
understanding people more effectively uh

104
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,360
with less bias as

105
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:54,400
well um the outcomes that we've been

106
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,920
able to produce um um over um the past

107
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,799
10 years have been on many many

108
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:01,599
different metrics and skills where along

109
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:03,560
creating great adoption we're able to

110
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,280
improve employee Satisfaction by in a

111
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:09,920
very very big way on average by 48

112
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:13,040
points on the emps scale um a operations

113
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,480
unit in a large luxury uh retailer was

114
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,120
able to go

115
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:20,160
from using employee listening surveys at

116
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:23,960
negative3 emps within a year they're at

117
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,880
positive 84 um a score so high that they

118
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,479
got call a call from HQ because they

119
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:30,039
thought the data was measured

120
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:31,560
incorrectly uh we're also able to

121
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:33,880
improve something as fundamental as

122
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,560
employee well-being and just showing

123
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,280
that there are different shapes of

124
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,919
change that can happen we these are

125
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,120
sample of four companies that we work

126
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:42,800
with and the change the distribution of

127
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,160
well-being scores before and after them

128
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,759
using happily uh we can uh increase

129
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,440
while being by as much as

130
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:53,800
37% um and the different variances here

131
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,440
are what we found is that it's dictated

132
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,680
one by the initial state of

133
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,639
psychological safety within the

134
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,320
workplace and two how responsive

135
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,120
marriages are

136
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,039
um and our partnership ask is that we're

137
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,479
looking to work with CEOs and HR leaders

138
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:09,199
who want to take culture to the next

139
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:11,360
level using wheel uh quality data our

140
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:14,120
ideal pilot is a 50 to 100 person

141
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:17,080
company or business units and so we have

142
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:19,240
um if you connect us with CEOs um and or

143
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,880
chief people officers or chro of

144
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,080
innovative Enterprise companies we'd be

145
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:27,280
very grateful thank you so

146
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:30,919
much thanks so much tarf great to know

147
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:33,120
so um tell us a little more about how AI

148
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:35,800
is used by happily.

149
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,199
AI sure um so you know starting about

150
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:41,039
eight to 10 years ago our AI was first

151
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:43,960
used to help us predict things and we

152
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:46,960
knew that a person was going to probably

153
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:49,840
leave the organization at enough

154
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,440
certainty we can proactively um help

155
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,600
retain them uh now it's we're using it

156
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,240
for a lot more we use generative AI to

157
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,360
improve the quality of feedback we're

158
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,800
also using it as a skill development and

159
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:03,400
learning tool as well

160
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,720
great and tell us a little more on how

161
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:08,360
you work with a corporate what the

162
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:10,039
onboarding is like and so on sure so

163
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,520
we're based in Thailand so we work with

164
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:15,080
companies across the world um primarily

165
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:17,120
in Asia but also now in the US um and

166
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,759
other parts as well um onboarding is

167
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,759
relatively light it takes less than two

168
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:22,960
weeks to really get started uh with a

169
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:25,039
platform like happily um and Within

170
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,720
These two weeks we're basically learning

171
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,360
more about the organization their goals

172
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,479
and their values so that we can tune our

173
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:33,280
Ai and also so configure um the

174
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:34,479
questions and and and the interactions

175
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,479
to make it

176
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:41,520
fit okay thank you so much again tar

177
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:41,520
thank you to learn there as well
