1
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,560
very very happy. I actually transitions

2
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,560
beautifully to Don Lassard's

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,640
conversation on business models for

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:25,600
deploying and how to get that upfront

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:28,880
cost spread out. And uh Don, I I as I've

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,800
done all all day, um you are much better

7
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,120
off introducing yourself and all of your

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,040
history than I I'll be brief on my

9
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,719
history. I'm I'm Don Lassard. I'm an

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:41,360
extinguished professor at MIT.

11
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,360
51 years in the Sloan School. Uh my my

12
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,200
claim to fame, I guess, here I I was one

13
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,719
of the two faculty leaders on the energy

14
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,120
minor that we built across all five

15
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:52,640
schools, which was really really one of

16
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,960
the most fun experiences at MIT. Uh I

17
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,039
also once upon a time I taught finance

18
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,800
and I came to realize this is largely

19
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,320
about financial engineering. Not largely

20
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,840
but financial engineering is

21
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,760
overwhelmingly important here. Okay, I'm

22
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,520
going to take just a little tiny slice

23
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,920
of Nikki's presentation which is

24
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,600
fantastic. Determining appropriate

25
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,400
pricing that balances utility

26
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,080
investments with customer usage. So to

27
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,520
me that's the business model. All this

28
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,920
other stuff is everything you need to do

29
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,400
to get there. It's terribly even that

30
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:26,159
piece is complicated enough. So, let's

31
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,720
just focus on that one. Um, problem,

32
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,560
right? High capital cost, but your

33
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,240
all-in monthly cost has to come out

34
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,240
about the same as the current all-in

35
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,799
monthly cost of gas plus electricity.

36
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,759
Otherwise, it's dead in the water. If

37
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,759
you run current costs of geothermal,

38
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,759
like your p even your second stage of

39
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,680
your pilot through current utility

40
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:49,759
models, it costs 2x at least. So it's

41
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,640
two to three times as expensive as it

42
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:55,200
needs to be to meet the cost right now.

43
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,040
How do we get there? Well, this is my

44
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,320
whole presentation. I have 17 more

45
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,920
slides, but this is the whole

46
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,960
presentation.

47
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:06,079
Um, let's see. So, high capital costs.

48
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,959
That's our issue. We are replacing ice

49
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,640
boxes with refrigerators.

50
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,280
We don't have to buy the ice every day,

51
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,200
but the refrigerator costs a lot. And

52
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,560
when I hear discussions of pricing, it

53
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,280
seems to me we're still trying to price

54
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,040
it. is if we're pricing ice whereas in

55
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,720
fact we're renting a we're renting a

56
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,120
refrigerator right so if you think of it

57
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,280
as renting a refrigerator that's the

58
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:31,040
analogy we want as opposed to we're

59
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:33,360
buying ice uh so one-third bore holes

60
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,440
one-ird system one-third customer and

61
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,760
system and conversion I'd like I thought

62
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:41,280
I'd corrected that how do we solve the

63
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,959
problem is this is now 2x right we need

64
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,879
to get monthly cost of the homeowner

65
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,400
near current electrical and gas bill

66
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,959
that's what we have to

67
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,640
2x. How do we get there? Well, we got to

68
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,879
reduce the capital cost. So, you got to

69
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,319
work like crazy. The unions have to work

70
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,440
like crazy. We have to get down a

71
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,440
learning curve. We really have to do

72
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,440
this, right? The capital cost must come

73
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,599
down.

74
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,920
We have to allocate. At the moment,

75
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:07,680
we're overbuilding these systems. Loop

76
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:09,680
one, 425 tons against 70 275 tons

77
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,280
actually used, right? You overbuild the

78
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,720
system or whatever the numbers are.

79
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,200
Overbuild the system by a massive

80
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,040
amount. Somehow or another the excess

81
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,720
capacity has to get banked and the

82
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,319
customers only have to get charged for

83
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,920
the actual used capacity. Third,

84
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,440
right, this is a lot of the discussion.

85
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,680
How do we monetize some of these other

86
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,599
benefits? How do we get a heat pump tax?

87
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,120
How do we get an investment tax credit?

88
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,440
How do we get some payment for the

89
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,159
avoided utility investments? Those are

90
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,720
huge.

91
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:41,280
Monetize other benefits and apply. So

92
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,519
and then the financial engineering part

93
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,599
is how do we spread the recovery of the

94
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:51,360
capital over 30 years in constant terms

95
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:53,200
inflationadjusted terms real terms

96
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,000
if we run it through the current utility

97
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,840
model it looks like this in real terms

98
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,239
it's big in the first year gets smaller

99
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,120
over time it's twice as high as it ought

100
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,920
to be because we're using we're not even

101
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,319
using a nominal level payment mortgage

102
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,799
we're using rate of return plus

103
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,720
depreciation, right?

104
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,920
Well, 30 years ago, we invented a level

105
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:19,040
payment novel mortgage. How do we spread

106
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:21,600
the cost of capital equally in real

107
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,479
terms over time? If we could do all of

108
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,759
those things, we'd be there. So, you do

109
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,160
your job in getting the cost down,

110
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,759
really build it neat. Uh we find a way

111
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,600
to bring in some of the other grants and

112
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:35,280
tax incentives. Uh we grab back some of

113
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,520
the avoided costs out of the electrical

114
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,080
system. Ideally, we get some carbon

115
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,000
credits for the carbon saved and then we

116
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,160
spread the capital cost evenly and then

117
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,759
people say, "Gee, this is more

118
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,000
economical

119
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,280
than the existing system and it's better

120
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,720
for our kids, it's better for our

121
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,160
community, we avoid the heat islands, we

122
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,320
avoid all the other stuff." So, we get

123
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:59,199
all these other bennies for free in a

124
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:01,520
sense. Okay. Uh learning curve. So,

125
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,880
learning curve, right?

126
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,400
There are learning curves out there.

127
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:08,000
There's evidence out there. It looks

128
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:10,000
like you've got 50% from one to two, but

129
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,400
probably this is going to be an 11 or

130
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,520
12% learning curve over time. Like a lot

131
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:18,720
there's a lot of evidence on this. So to

132
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,639
the ratebased folk, we'd say you got to

133
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,080
be willing to eat some of it because

134
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,639
you're investing against the learning

135
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,320
curve and there's an investment in the

136
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,919
learning curve. And so you can't load

137
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,080
all of the current costs onto the

138
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:32,639
current customers because part of the

139
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,560
current cost is a public benefit of the

140
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,960
learning curve that everyone else will

141
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,160
gain. And so this has to be built into

142
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,320
the thinking. Um

143
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,039
excess capacity well let's allocate only

144
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:47,360
the capacity used right and the excess

145
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:50,320
capacity is banked.

146
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,400
um mechanisms to monetize benefit. So,

147
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,720
assignment of carbon tax or renewable

148
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,280
energy, linkage of various incentive

149
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,520
systems, assignment of voided cost

150
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,120
credits. I mean, complicated, really

151
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,720
complicated and hard to do, but we've

152
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,440
got to get our act together and make

153
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,600
this all in one place.

154
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,479
Capital recovery model. And I don't

155
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:14,400
expect everybody to follow this at uh

156
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:17,360
3:30 in the afternoon. But if you take

157
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,360
cost of capital times unavertised

158
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,080
capital plus depreciation and you look

159
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,319
at your annual charge, it starts on a

160
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,960
50, you know, it starts high and it

161
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:29,039
comes down over time. If you have a

162
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,720
level nominal charge, right? It's like

163
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:33,440
that. A level real charge would be

164
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,680
rising over time with inflation.

165
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:39,039
Short story.

166
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,840
If you if you had a payment that looked

167
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:43,759
like an index treasury

168
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,160
and you could tell people that looks

169
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,880
like social security because social

170
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,560
security is indexed to inflation.

171
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,520
If you have a payment that's indexed to

172
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:56,400
social security, it can start at 1/ half

173
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,560
the level of a fixed nominal payment and

174
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:02,000
it will grow at social security over

175
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:05,039
time and it will give the utility the

176
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,759
rate of return that they're allowed full

177
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,759
recovery of capital.

178
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:14,639
It's fairly straightforward. Just have

179
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,160
to do it. Okay. Uh so constant real

180
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,639
capital recovery. There are ways to do

181
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,039
this. Uh I wrote it up in 1975 for

182
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:24,319
totally different reasons. Uh it's all

183
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:28,319
in there. Okay. Now, alternative pricing

184
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:31,199
models. Uh we could consumer purchase

185
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,360
inhome uh and the utility supplies the

186
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,479
common stuff or the utility supplies

187
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,720
everything. Right? Those would be the

188
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,800
two choices. And you could charge for

189
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,440
thermal usage or you could charge for

190
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,319
capacity. I personally like charging for

191
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,840
capacity. I'm being told five minutes. I

192
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,639
think thermal usage is a little bit like

193
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,800
charging for ice in the ice box. I'd

194
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,039
like capacities. These are fixed cost

195
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,039
systems. You're largely talking about

196
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:58,240
recovering capital costs. But one, two,

197
00:07:55,039 --> 00:08:01,919
or three or four. Okay. But now let's

198
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:05,039
get simple pass forward. Stage one,

199
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:07,440
pilot stage. Stage two, roll out stage.

200
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:10,479
Stage three, steady state. In pilot

201
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,240
stage, there are only very few systems.

202
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:15,680
They're incomplete. There's no market

203
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,599
for there's no thermal market and the

204
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,599
vintage for the technical types the

205
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:22,240
vintage of capital is too young. It's

206
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:23,680
all new and so if you have standard rate

207
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,720
recovery you're going to be recovering

208
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:29,440
way too high rates. What would I do if I

209
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:32,479
were in Jaime's position? I'd say in the

210
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,240
short run we fix the cost equal to the

211
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:38,000
current charge

212
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:40,320
per unit of capacity period

213
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,000
and we charge the customer with that

214
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:46,720
amount and the difference 80% of the

215
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,640
difference we stick on rate base

216
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,040
20% of the difference we give to Nikki

217
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,440
so she has an an incentive to bring the

218
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,040
difference down right we say basically

219
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,880
we're going to price it off current gas

220
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,240
plus electricity

221
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,080
and we're going to stick the rest of it

222
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,800
the rate base for learning curve for

223
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:05,279
learning for all of these other benefits

224
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,920
in the first and you might to protect

225
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:10,399
yourself you might say for up to 3% of

226
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,080
the ext installed base or up to 5% of

227
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:16,720
the installed base this is a learning

228
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:18,080
investment just matches the old one

229
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,560
roll out stage you're still going to

230
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,720
have relatively few systems but you can

231
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,959
you can do a cost of capital recovery on

232
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,480
those systems as long as it's level and

233
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,920
real as opposed to nominal and declining

234
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,279
steady state, it doesn't matter because

235
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,279
you're going to have investments of all

236
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,600
vintages and it's going to look like the

237
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,600
existing system and you could go back to

238
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,680
the existing system if you wanted to.

239
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,760
But by then, by then you would have

240
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,320
devised a new system. And remember this

241
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,000
is the problem for utilities in general.

242
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,480
We're going from operating cost to

243
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,160
capital costs. Renewables are capital

244
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,880
costs. We're getting rid of fossil fuels

245
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:56,720
which are operating costs. So this helps

246
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:58,800
us actually move from a volumetric to a

247
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,959
capacity charging system. Okay, I got

248
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,720
one more two more minutes. Uh

249
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,080
consideration for low-income lowwealth

250
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,080
households. I think this would be a

251
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,640
great area. Take the one-third that is

252
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,480
the retrofit in the internal system. Get

253
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,480
the Boston Foundation to work with you.

254
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,760
Get them to buy down the cost of the

255
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,680
household part for low-income

256
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,000
households.

257
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,480
Don't throw it at the utility.

258
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,880
say twothirds of it is a standard rate

259
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,959
and if you qualify low income we'll buy

260
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,800
down the other third and that will help

261
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:29,760
us get all of the 20 houses around the

262
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:35,240
culdesac to convert. Uh then their

263
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:35,240
appendices so that's it. Uh

264
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:42,160
so thank you Don. So so Don is a

265
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,000
neighbor and I went for a walk and I

266
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,519
said well here's here's where we are

267
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,720
with the cost. Can you figure out some

268
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:51,200
solutions? So uh

269
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,200
uh and I I just if you if you didn't

270
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,160
catch that in in the delusion of

271
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,760
information and ideas um he he's putting

272
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,480
out a whole bunch of series of solutions

273
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:03,360
to deal with the cost as it is today

274
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,040
with the first projects. And one of the

275
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,360
things I want to flag on that is that

276
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:10,800
that cost today with these first

277
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:13,360
projects includes the entire cost of the

278
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:17,600
building transition which incidentally

279
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:19,600
also includes all of the like challenges

280
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,600
of our aging. I think someone said

281
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,320
crappy buildings. Yeah, we we have

282
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,720
crappy buildings here. Just saying it.

283
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,440
and and all of those problems that are

284
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,279
ne from a hundred years of neglect, the

285
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,160
asbestos, the mold, the faulty wiring,

286
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:36,560
the code violations, they are a part of

287
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,600
the challenge of decarbonizing our

288
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,800
buildings because you cross the

289
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,800
threshold and you have to deal with

290
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:46,800
them. And so that cost is baked into

291
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:49,600
that total sum. Part of what Nikki was

292
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,920
referring to as going into new build is

293
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:56,800
you don't deal with that at all. And

294
00:11:51,920 --> 00:12:00,640
even today, those pipes and bore holes

295
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:03,279
can actually balance out for the energy

296
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:06,720
supply in a kind of more classic gas

297
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:10,160
utility approach. So, the incredible

298
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:12,000
news is that we might have tools to

299
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,600
remove the cost of all of our building

300
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,519
upgrades, which has all these other

301
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,079
incredible benefits like health and

302
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:22,560
well-being and comfort. Um, so I just I

303
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:22,560
just wanted to clarify that distinction.
