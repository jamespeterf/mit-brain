1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,480
I'd like to welcome everyone. My name is

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,120
Rayvon Gardner Williams and I serve as

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,120
an admissions officer here at MIT Sloan

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,639
School of Management. I'm excited about

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,960
the opportunity to host tonight's panel

6
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,880
discussion with a dynamic group of Sloan

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,199
who will introduce themselves shortly.

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,279
First and foremost, when we are doing

9
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,920
any presentations, we feel that it is

10
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:24,240
mission critical um for us to start off

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,880
each presentation highlighting the fact

12
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,119
that MIT Sloan is indeed a missiondriven

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,960
school. Um everything that we do comes

14
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,120
back to our mission and that's to

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,440
develop principal innovative leaders who

16
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,480
improve the world and generate ideas

17
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,480
that advance management practices. Um

18
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,640
this desire for our students to make an

19
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,320
impact is central to not only the MIT

20
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,640
Sloan experience but the broader MIT

21
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,440
experience as well. Um we are seeking

22
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,360
out students um who are missiondriven

23
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,280
and students who have a history of

24
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,840
leadership and impact who have the

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,399
ability to work with others and think

26
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,760
and act innovatively. With that being

27
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,920
said, I'm sure you are all probably

28
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,719
tired of hearing from me. Um so with

29
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,799
that being said, we're going to

30
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,479
transition to our panelists and have

31
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,600
them all introduce themselves in the

32
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,680
order in which they appear on the

33
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,320
screen. Um, I'm going to go on mute and

34
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,560
then if we can have Manuel start us off

35
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,680
and I'll jump back on shortly after we

36
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,439
conclude introductions.

37
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,159
>> Hi, thanks very much for that, Rayon.

38
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,680
Uh, my name is Manny Montes and I am the

39
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,720
director of procurement for Lineage

40
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,720
Logistics for now Lineage.

41
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,840
>> Hey y'all, my name is Alexa Katz. I am a

42
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:38,079
manager at Deote where I'm a consultant.

43
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:40,880
Um I was in uh NBA 2024 and had returned

44
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:43,280
to Deote after um or sorry I was at

45
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:47,799
Deote before Sloan and had returned um

46
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,799
just about uh almost a year ago.

47
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,360
>> Hi all. Uh I'm Brian Silverman,

48
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,479
classmates with uh two of these fine

49
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:59,119
folks on this call. Um since leaving

50
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:01,759
Sloan uh I've been working at Desire on

51
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:04,880
the finance team. Desire is a renewable

52
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,719
energy firm. We're a owner, operator,

53
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,879
developer of utility scale renewable

54
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,039
energy projects. And prior to Sloan, I

55
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,360
spent most of my career as an army

56
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:16,879
officer. So happy to talk about pivots

57
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:20,560
with anyone on this call.

58
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:23,520
>> Uh and I'm Jose. I was also um a Harvard

59
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,440
like MIT Sloan class 24. Um I was

60
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,800
actually part of the uh early admission

61
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,440
program which I applied to when I was a

62
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,280
senior at Harvard and then um that gave

63
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,800
me time to start a a company which I'm

64
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,640
still like working on called Zeta

65
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,640
Surgical. Um and I'm also in parallel to

66
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:42,360
the company I'm doing a PhD right now in

67
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,360
neuroscience at Cambridge.

68
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,760
>> Awesome. And then I'm also joined by a

69
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,280
colleague Morgan who's on the back end

70
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,280
answering any other questions that you

71
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,760
all may have. Uh Morgan, if you want to

72
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,440
just jump on and say hi really quickly.

73
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,360
>> Hi everyone. Thanks for joining

74
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,879
tonight's session. Really excited to uh

75
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,959
answer your all's questions and feel

76
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,720
free to answer or rather ask questions

77
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,720
throughout the session. Um I will be

78
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,879
highlighting some to answer live uh by

79
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:10,519
the panelists at the end. So uh feel

80
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,519
free. Thanks for joining.

81
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,319
>> Awesome. Thank you for that Morgan. Um

82
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,720
we're going to just jump right into

83
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,800
questions for our panelists and we uh

84
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,040
curated a few questions that we received

85
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,400
prior to the start of the session. Um so

86
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,519
I'll go ahead and get started with the

87
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:28,000
first one. Um out of curiosity um one of

88
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:31,040
our our attendees was wondering what

89
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,799
types of events does MIT Sloan have for

90
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:37,000
LGBTQ

91
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,000
uh plus MBA students?

92
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,560
Rayvon, do you want just any one of us

93
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,400
to take this or do you want to

94
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,959
>> Sure. This can be for anyone.

95
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,280
>> Um, sure. I'm I'm happy to start. Uh,

96
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,519
there's a couple marquee events, I

97
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,040
think. Um, one thing to highlight

98
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,680
MITwide

99
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,920
is the concept of a C function, a

100
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,239
cultural function. This is where every

101
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,360
club on campus

102
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:11,680
um, basically has a big sort of party.

103
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:14,000
Uh, the Sloan Pride one is, I think, one

104
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,200
of the more popular events. Alexa, maybe

105
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,280
you could speak to this. I think you

106
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:22,160
might have actually helped organize it.

107
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:24,320
Um, but, uh, so big event, super fun,

108
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,199
super popular across the organization.

109
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,120
And then the other one to highlight is

110
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,919
every year

111
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,240
um the whole crew would make their way

112
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,880
out to Petown

113
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,960
um and spend a weekend out there which

114
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:42,000
was really great. Honestly, some of my

115
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,440
more fond memories uh of time spent with

116
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,600
classmates just kind of getting away

117
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:49,199
from campus and and getting to know one

118
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,520
another um in a different setting.

119
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,600
>> Yeah. And I I'll pile on there. I love

120
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,520
in general at Sloan. There's a ton of

121
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,479
opportunities for travel obviously

122
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,479
internationally, but some of I think my

123
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:03,199
fondest memories are the ones that are

124
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:06,080
closer to home and having access from

125
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,639
Boston to a ton of nature. Um there's a

126
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,840
big uh usually like a big fall retreat

127
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:14,080
that we take um up in just like renting

128
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,240
a cabin out in New Hampshire or in

129
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,720
Maine. Um, and I think that was really

130
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,320
where I met most of my friends that were

131
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,320
in Pride because it was early on in the

132
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,680
school year and we had a chance to just

133
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:29,680
like buckle down like cooking at home um

134
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:32,000
and just having a good time um you know

135
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,080
out in a place that's not necessarily

136
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,600
right on campus. So that was definitely

137
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,919
a highlight for me. And then definitely

138
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,080
echo the C functions across the board

139
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:42,000
are super fun. I think definitely the

140
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,320
pride ca function is one of the most

141
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,840
attended and most memorable. I believe

142
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:50,479
we did a drag uh the first year, our

143
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,680
first year. Is that right, Brian? Um we

144
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:56,800
had a ton of classmates including mostly

145
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,720
allies honestly uh that were performing

146
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,479
on stage. We had this awesome venue and

147
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,320
it was just a lot of fun. So definitely

148
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,319
a lot of opportunities whether you're

149
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:07,039
into like smaller group settings. Um

150
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,199
there's also uh we did a lot of smaller

151
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,960
dinner groups or game nights and things

152
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,800
like that. Um, or if you're more into

153
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:17,240
like the big party settings, there's

154
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,240
opportunities uh for that as well.

155
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,600
>> Was there Manny? Did either of you want

156
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,600
to chime in?

157
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,560
>> Yeah. And I think agree with what was

158
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,400
said.

159
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,120
>> Awesome. Um, so I think that actually

160
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,919
segus perfectly into the next question

161
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:41,039
um, we got was what are ways that the

162
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:45,960
Sloan Pride um, club collaborates with

163
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:45,960
other clubs across uh, Sloan and MIT

164
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:53,120
and this can be for anyone.

165
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:55,840
>> Yeah, just I'll I'll start here as well

166
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,800
just because the the C function was a

167
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:01,360
good example of this. Um, right. Like I

168
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,000
probably split my time at Sloan between

169
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:08,000
three main clubs. Like I was in the

170
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:12,080
sustainability like energy club, um,

171
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:15,280
pride and then the vets club. And when

172
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,280
we were doing our C function, which like

173
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:20,720
Alexa was mentioning, it was big drag

174
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:24,240
show and like a giant club with mostly

175
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:29,039
uh, allies performing. like there were I

176
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:32,560
think two or three Sloan veteran club

177
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:34,319
like um you know squads that were up

178
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,440
there performing

179
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:41,039
uh and the fact that like the the vets

180
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:43,919
club is performing at the C function

181
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:46,000
um and was like h we were having events

182
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:49,759
together all the time right like I think

183
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,240
that just speaks to um I mean I guess

184
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,240
I'm I'm sort of alluding to some maybe

185
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,319
implicit expectations about how those

186
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,039
clubs might relate to each other. But

187
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:01,680
what I'm trying to say is that they

188
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:04,479
absolutely don't exist. The pride club

189
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:07,039
was super integrated with every other

190
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,720
organization on campus and over

191
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:12,720
overwhelmingly just could not have been

192
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:18,120
a more uh sort of welcoming and and uh

193
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:18,120
um you know equal environment.

194
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:28,080
One of I think if you asked most people

195
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,680
that I knew in our class like what my

196
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,200
brand was at Sloan, they would probably

197
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:35,599
would say beer. Um I started and led our

198
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,560
our beer club. And one of my favorite

199
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:41,680
events that I hosted was a collab with

200
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:45,360
Pride. We had uh we went out to

201
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:48,000
Dorchester to um a gay-owned brewery,

202
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,160
Dorchester Brewing Co. Um the owner is

203
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,680
fantastic. He is just like such a

204
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:56,480
wonderful human. Um and then brought in

205
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,320
the LGBTQ historical society. I'm

206
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,399
forgetting their name right now. Um but

207
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,600
they document and preserve basically

208
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:07,120
like Boston and New England LGBTQ his

209
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:10,240
LGBTQ history. Um so we had an awesome

210
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,320
presentation from that organization and

211
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,000
a presentation from the the owner

212
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,839
himself at this brewery and just a

213
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,240
chance for like everyone to chat. So, it

214
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,080
was a really cool way to like bring beer

215
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,320
people into like the queer space and

216
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,480
bring queer people into a beer space,

217
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,120
which is like two aspects of my identity

218
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,640
and my hobbies that I really enjoy. So,

219
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,120
um that was definitely a collaborative

220
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,120
memory of mine.

221
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,200
>> Alexa, you touched on a really great

222
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,440
point about just being able to utilize

223
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,519
not only Cambridge, but the the larger

224
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,600
Boston community as as as you leverage

225
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,440
your NBA experience. Um, so I was

226
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,360
wondering if anybody else could, Alexa,

227
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:51,360
maybe you can add on to this as well.

228
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:53,920
Um, describe the broader LGBTQ community

229
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,760
in Boston and Cambridge, um, and how it

230
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,120
relates to Sloan students. You provided

231
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,279
a great example, so I'm wondering if

232
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,880
there might be other examples that, um,

233
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:03,040
others might be able to offer or if you

234
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,839
want to maybe further elaborate on, um,

235
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,839
how that came to be.

236
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,000
I feel bad for keep that I keep talking

237
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,480
so other people please jump in. Um, I

238
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,839
think for that event specifically, it

239
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,120
honestly I think one of my favorite

240
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:26,720
parts about Boston is that it's truly

241
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:29,120
such a curious city and so obviously so

242
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,040
many top tier universities. So a lot of

243
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,320
thinkers and doers and just people who

244
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:36,480
are open to collaboration and so I and

245
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,320
with your MIT email address, you can

246
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,680
honestly like cold email people and they

247
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:44,079
answer which is amazing. So, I just cold

248
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,160
out like did cold outreach to a bunch of

249
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:48,320
different types of of organizations or

250
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,560
groups and everyone was very excited

251
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:54,079
about collaborating um and speaking to

252
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,680
students. And I think in general that is

253
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,920
very true across the board, not only

254
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,920
like in the queer community, but also

255
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,399
there's a you know the entrepreneurial

256
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,560
ecosystem is obviously huge, which is

257
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,079
great in terms of um and people are

258
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,200
super open in terms of like recruiting

259
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,720
if that's something that you're

260
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:13,920
interested in. Um, but there's always

261
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:17,760
people that are willing to take your

262
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:20,320
call. And so finding this organization

263
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,760
that had, you know, coming I live in New

264
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,680
York now and obviously like I feel like

265
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,160
there's so much documented history from

266
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,480
like Stonewall. Um, and that's something

267
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,920
that is very accessible. But coming to

268
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,240
Boston, I was like, what is the queer

269
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,760
community like here? It's not as big.

270
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,360
Like let's let's just be clear. It's

271
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,920
like definitely doesn't feel as

272
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,160
in-your-face as other maybe more

273
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,560
queercentric cities, but that's not to

274
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,800
say that there's not a ton of resources

275
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:47,440
available. And so, as part of this

276
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,839
event, we learned about the history and

277
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,720
historic taverns, many of which have now

278
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:55,839
closed, unfortunately. Um, but just

279
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:58,000
being able to hear some video testimony

280
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,920
and take a tour through some of, you

281
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,160
know, Boston's queer history was really

282
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,000
memorable.

283
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,600
>> Yeah. I would say too, I mean I've been

284
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,480
so I'm originally from Spain, but I

285
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,959
moved to um Boston 2014. So I've been

286
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,040
here like for like 11 years and for you

287
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:15,040
know uh college and then business school

288
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,200
and working like um in between and sort

289
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,560
of during during that time but um yeah I

290
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,360
would say I would say that like of

291
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,519
course like you know especially recently

292
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,720
with like Trump administration not to

293
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,839
get too political but obviously there

294
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:30,240
seems to be a lot of um um you know sort

295
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,800
of slashing DI programs kind of things.

296
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,120
I've in 11 years Boston has been the

297
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:38,399
most liberal like gay friendly like city

298
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,639
I've ever lived in. Um uh you know and

299
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:44,000
Barcelona is very very liberal as well.

300
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,680
Um, again, you know, I think like um as

301
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,320
as Alexa was saying, I think it's

302
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:51,120
definitely much smaller than than other

303
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,320
um other other cities just like also in

304
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,880
general, but it's kind of like a little

305
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,680
bit of a quirky um like there's a lot of

306
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:00,240
people here for you know in school um

307
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:02,240
like you know working in healthcare like

308
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,720
in the big universities and everything

309
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,839
and um yeah I mean I was I just just

310
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:10,079
remembering like this um this article I

311
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,760
I that I think like again from my

312
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:14,959
undergrad things that they published in

313
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,800
this um like Harvard like um parody

314
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,160
thing parody journal saying that four

315
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,040
out of three Harvard undergrads were

316
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:23,920
gay. So I think it's uh you know um

317
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,279
definitely definitely very um you know

318
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,760
definitely care friendly place to to

319
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:31,360
live in and I think you know from my

320
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,959
personal experience I um you know joined

321
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,440
Sloan with like a very specific like

322
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,880
purpose which was really to get more of

323
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,639
like a business background because my

324
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,399
background in undergrad was um in

325
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,519
molecular biology and I did I mean as

326
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,160
the company was sort of like growing

327
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,519
more and um actually you know starting

328
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,200
to raise like larger rounds of funding.

329
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,560
and it's still pretty early but like uh

330
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,240
selling the system and all this kind of

331
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,680
stuff. Um I think you know I really

332
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,959
wanted to do that and I had this early

333
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,560
admission like um in in there. So I um

334
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,680
you know spent most I mean I was kind of

335
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,360
like working like really full-time

336
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,279
during during during my time at Sloan

337
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,600
which is not not recommend but I think

338
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,959
Sloan is very I think people are doing

339
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,800
each person has their own thing going on

340
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:09,360
and um I thought it was great great for

341
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:12,000
that but um uh yeah I thought it was

342
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,440
like a really great experience and up um

343
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,959
you know really getting getting what I

344
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,399
what I want out of that but maybe was a

345
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,760
little less participating a a little bit

346
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:21,399
less in the in the events that Alex and

347
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,399
and Brian were mentioning.

348
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,320
>> Awesome. Um, the next question I have

349
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,560
is, um, how did you find community

350
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,639
amongst other LGBTQ,

351
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,199
uh, people at Sloan, both inside and

352
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:36,199
outside the classroom, um, and student

353
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:36,199
clubs?

354
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:57,040
I think obviously the the pride salon

355
00:14:52,560 --> 00:15:01,040
pride um for me was obviously like the

356
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:03,920
biggest community hub. Um

357
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:06,560
but not everyone was super involved the

358
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,560
whole time nor do you have to be. I mean

359
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,600
I think there's so many I love that

360
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,800
there's so many different types of

361
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,480
events. I was talking about them a

362
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,320
little bit before in terms of, you know,

363
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,600
folks who are tilted more towards

364
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:20,079
wanting to have smaller group hangs, um,

365
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:23,680
dinners, game nights, and things like

366
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:26,160
that or study groups. Um, and then those

367
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:28,639
who are more tilted towards wanting to

368
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,560
go on trips or to travel and and, you

369
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,720
know, go to parties, like there's it

370
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:36,079
really runs the spectrum. But I think

371
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:38,720
even just going to a couple um events or

372
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:40,720
meetings, you then have a familiar face

373
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,000
that you see in the classroom and maybe

374
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,399
you didn't have a chance to chat with

375
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,720
that person at the event, but you see

376
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,399
their face, you sit near them and then

377
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,480
you have a friend. Um and I think that's

378
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,720
true throughout your time at Sloan. will

379
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,399
find I mean you all the all the alums

380
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,240
that you talk to are going to you know

381
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,800
just go on and on about like the people

382
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,720
because it's true like you honestly can

383
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,639
meet someone one time they'll remember

384
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,399
your story and then you'll sit with them

385
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,639
in class and become actual friends with

386
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:10,560
them. So I think for me Sloan Pride was

387
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:12,000
definitely the the place um but I'm sure

388
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,519
other folks had different ways of

389
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,279
building community and sometimes you

390
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:18,519
find it in places that you don't expect

391
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,519
as well.

392
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,240
Anybody else want to chime in?

393
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,399
All right. Um, the next question that we

394
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,560
got uh from somebody that's joining us

395
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,800
this evening was, "What aspects of

396
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,519
Sloan's culture stood out to you the

397
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,360
most when you first joined, and how have

398
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:47,240
they shaped your experience both inside

399
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,240
and outside the classroom?

400
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,880
Yeah, I can talk a little bit about

401
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:53,440
about this because I mean sort of not

402
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,360
not speaking directly about like um you

403
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,920
know LGBT community but just like more

404
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:00,240
generally just my my own experience I

405
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,079
thought like um you know something I

406
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:05,360
really liked about Sloan I think is that

407
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:07,679
it's um I mean obviously from an acade

408
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:10,079
from an academic perspective like MIT

409
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:13,120
Sloan is like absolutely one of the best

410
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:15,199
um research um like you know like

411
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,039
programs in the in the in the world that

412
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,799
check like Nobel laureates receiving

413
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,959
Nobel Nobel Prize in economics. I mean

414
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:24,000
Sloan is consistently a place where

415
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:25,839
there's um you know like um Lorettz like

416
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,520
basically very frequently. I was kind of

417
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,799
interested in like you know like getting

418
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:32,559
a learning more about financial

419
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:34,080
economics and I really found that um you

420
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,320
know I was very interesting like being

421
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:39,200
able to take classes with um you know

422
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:41,280
really world experts. I mean there's um

423
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,360
like Merton for example teaches a class

424
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,760
on on on options which is obviously like

425
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,120
from BSM and it's it's a really really

426
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,039
special experience to to be able to that

427
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,679
or um Andrew Lo there's just like a lot

428
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:54,080
of very you know um important faculty I

429
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:56,480
think at Sloan that like uh teach MBA

430
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,799
students and um some so I really like

431
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,600
kind of like the very you know like I

432
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,720
mean I think I remember during my first

433
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,760
week or something at Sloan for the

434
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,120
orientation they were asking like what

435
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,720
do you want to get out of your program

436
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,400
and my classmates each person has their

437
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,640
own thing like for many people it's also

438
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,840
just like meeting new people or like

439
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,200
something like that. I think for me it

440
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,400
was very much like the class I want to

441
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,799
take and sort of like learning that was

442
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,280
sort of like maybe less typical I think

443
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,880
for for many many students. Um and I

444
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,880
thought that like the quality of like

445
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,320
teaching and um the ability of course

446
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,679
registering with other classes and sort

447
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,280
of the fact that like after the first

448
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,880
term you're basically free to take

449
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,960
pretty much any class you want for the

450
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,520
for the last two semesters I thought was

451
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,600
um spectacular and uh I was you know I I

452
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:38,000
felt I was learning a ton from seme

453
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,000
semester and um you know I basically

454
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,840
yeah I mean when went from really having

455
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,760
absolutely no background in in in

456
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,600
finance and finishing doing like a like

457
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,360
a finance track and taking classes that

458
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,799
were kind of like the the the hardest

459
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,840
class I could take at least at that

460
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,080
point. So, I thought that was like

461
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,520
really really great and um you know

462
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:58,919
absolutely would definitely go again if

463
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:58,919
if um if I was back back in 2022.

464
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,039
>> Always excited to hear an alum say

465
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,400
they'd like to come back if they if

466
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:09,039
they're the opportunity presented

467
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,679
itself. Um it makes what I feel every

468
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:13,919
single day that much more realistic um

469
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:15,120
whenever I step foot on campus. Uh

470
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,400
Manny, it looked like you were going to

471
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,960
come off mute. Did you want to say

472
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,960
something?

473
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,799
Yeah. Uh my experience is completely

474
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,799
different from every other panelists

475
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:31,440
here because I was part of the COVID

476
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:33,039
cohort uh from 2020 2021. So none of the

477
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,880
things that any of the panelists have

478
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,640
mentioned were available to us.

479
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,640
Unfortunately, because of the pandemic,

480
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,080
MIT did not feel like it would be safe

481
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,559
to, you know, have people in large

482
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,720
groups for obvious reasons. So all of

483
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:47,440
the infrastructure that everyone

484
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,760
mentioned um which is MIT essentially

485
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:52,960
creates for students to plug themselves

486
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:54,880
into was non-existent and so that meant

487
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,840
that we had to create it ourselves and

488
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,919
so I think from that perspective the

489
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,640
real test comes out right you put all

490
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,640
these people in the room and you want to

491
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,640
say okay what's what makes it special

492
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,640
what makes them all special uh

493
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,360
particularly when you don't have the

494
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:15,039
institutional backing of the institute

495
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:17,360
Right. Um, and so I am happy to say that

496
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:19,120
um,

497
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,960
if we're going to answer the question of

498
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:24,000
what sort of qualities did we see in

499
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:26,640
Sloan come out immediately, I would say

500
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,640
it was the ability of other people to

501
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:34,320
see what others before see in you what

502
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:38,320
others before would not see or could not

503
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:40,960
see. and then equipping you with the

504
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:43,679
tools to go out into the world and bring

505
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:46,679
that version of yourself to a broader

506
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,679
audience.

507
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:52,159
>> I really appreciate that answer. Um it's

508
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,840
funny. I actually started working um at

509
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,400
Sloan as we were phasing out of the

510
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:58,400
pandemic and to see just the the

511
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,039
differences from students experiences is

512
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,880
always um interesting to hear how they

513
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:05,039
were able to make that time during the

514
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,520
pandemic their own. Um, so definitely

515
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,880
appreciate that insight. Um, the next

516
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:12,480
question that we have before we

517
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:15,280
transition to the Q&A from our audience,

518
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:18,000
um, is how does MIT Sloan actively

519
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:20,080
integrate diversity and inclusion into

520
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,440
team-based projects or the classroom

521
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,440
experience beyond formal statements?

522
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:32,480
>> I think what I appreciated was the way

523
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:36,159
that this was done in a really natural

524
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:38,480
way. It wasn't like the forced DEI day

525
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:40,159
where you know it's just one day of the

526
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,080
year and you have to teach a specific

527
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,400
curriculum. Like I truly felt like it

528
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:47,600
was it was integrated into the cases

529
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:50,000
that we were learning into especially in

530
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,840
like our uh one of the core classes that

531
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,280
you take as an MBA in the fall

532
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:57,679
organizational processes. Um, I just

533
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:00,000
feel like the

534
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:02,559
some like so many of the lessons and so

535
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,039
many of the like business context were

536
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:07,679
so naturally incorporated into that

537
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:09,760
class in a way that felt natural and not

538
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,640
forced. Um, so I think that's that's one

539
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,640
thing. And then there's of course

540
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,280
there's intentional days as well where

541
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:18,960
there is more discussion around um

542
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:20,320
certain topics. Um, but I think part of

543
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,880
what I really liked about the program

544
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:27,080
was that it didn't feel like it was just

545
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,080
checking a box. Like it felt natural.

546
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:40,240
Thank you for that, Alexa. Um, Morgan, I

547
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,919
know we I can see on my screen that we

548
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,919
have a number of questions in the chat.

549
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:46,720
Um, so I want to spend the time now to

550
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:48,640
transition to um, questions that we

551
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,880
receive from anybody that's joining us

552
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,880
this evening.

553
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,200
>> Absolutely. Thank you, Rayvon, for

554
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,039
passing. Um, we do have some great

555
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:02,159
questions in the Q&A, so again feel free

556
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:04,320
to keep asking them. Um, we wanted to or

557
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,880
some folks in the chat are asking about

558
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:09,440
SOS or significant others, partners who

559
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,120
they're bringing to MIT. Um, were you

560
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,880
able to bring your partner into any

561
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,039
events or communities that you were part

562
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,960
of at MIT? Um, and how was your

563
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:18,880
experience?

564
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:21,440
>> Take it away, Manny.

565
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:24,080
>> Um, so there's there's a special sort of

566
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,679
um, so I'm in a Sloan Fellow MBA, right?

567
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,360
And the Sloan Fellows, as you saw in the

568
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,760
initial slide, there's a 12-month

569
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:33,280
residential program as opposed to like a

570
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:36,080
two-year standard MBA program. Um, a lot

571
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:38,159
of the two-year MBAs um, are still

572
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,240
single Pringles, right? as we like to

573
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,600
say. So they're not all not all of them

574
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,000
have their significant others yet. Some

575
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:46,720
of them do, right? It's a broad

576
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,640
spectrum. All the Sloan fellows pretty

577
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,440
much everybody brings their significant

578
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,640
other. Everybody. And so for me it was

579
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,880
interesting because I was like well I

580
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,760
have my husband right and he's here and

581
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,440
you know he makes empanadas and uh we

582
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:04,000
have a great place to welcome everybody

583
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:05,600
in. And um I am proud to say that um

584
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
during one of the activities that we

585
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:11,840
were able to have with Sloan, we had the

586
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:15,440
uh SFMBA Olympics, the virtual Olympics.

587
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:19,120
And um my husband won he so he is the

588
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:22,320
like only time in history Sloanfell FNBA

589
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:24,640
virtual Olympics winner and he is a gay

590
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,400
engineer from Argentina. So I'm going to

591
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:29,880
think that pretty much says it all when

592
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,880
it comes to Sloan.

593
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:41,039
Yeah. I mean, um I I I guess like really

594
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:43,440
um had just started dating my uh my

595
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:46,159
partner like shortly before Sloan and

596
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:49,520
then, you know, we were together all all

597
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:54,000
through the program and still are. Um

598
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:56,159
but like I would just add on to say that

599
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,919
um yeah, there's absolutely no barrier

600
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:02,559
at all. There's uh uh I would say every

601
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:05,360
organization, every social event is like

602
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:09,039
totally welcoming to plus ones. And

603
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:11,600
honestly, you know, a half the time uh

604
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:14,240
he was more popular than I was. So

605
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:16,720
there's no um

606
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,559
no limitations whatsoever.

607
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:21,440
>> I would jump on I just want to build on

608
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:23,039
that the point that Brian made about

609
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,279
your significant other being more

610
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:27,679
popular than you. Um, that was the case

611
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:29,600
in my case too. Sergio was way more

612
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:31,279
popular. Whenever people sort of had the

613
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,679
two of us in a room, they would always

614
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:35,840
go to him. And so it made you think made

615
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,520
you much more self-aware of yourself,

616
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:41,520
right? Which is an important thing that

617
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:42,960
we learn in Sloan. Um, but it also uh is

618
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,480
interesting, right? Because everybody

619
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,000
says, "Oh, well, you know, Sloan is

620
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,840
going to be transformed. It will be a

621
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,679
transformation for you." And it most

622
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:54,240
definitely is. However, the thing that

623
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:56,080
nobody says is that it is also a

624
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:59,120
transformation for your significant

625
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:00,960
other. When my when we started out, my

626
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,600
husband was, you know, more quiet than I

627
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,679
was. By the end, he was entertaining,

628
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:08,000
you know, houses full of people,

629
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:09,919
engaging with people much more. And so,

630
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,240
I think for me, that was one of the most

631
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:14,559
sort of amazing aspects of the program.

632
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:18,200
I wasn't just the one impacted. My

633
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:18,200
husband was too.

634
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:27,600
We do have some more questions if we

635
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,520
want to continue from the chat. Um I

636
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,799
also I know I not a panelist and you

637
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,440
don't want to hear from me but we do

638
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:36,159
have um significant others or so um

639
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,320
group group chats or WhatsApp chats. Um

640
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,840
so it is also like a formalized um

641
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,760
community. So, not only of course are

642
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,520
they welcome at any events um but we

643
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:46,000
also really do try to integrate folks

644
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:49,120
into the sun culture um and any events

645
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,480
that they're interested in. Um one great

646
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:53,440
question we had was are there

647
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:55,039
opportunities for LGBT related community

648
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:59,880
service in the area or volunteer

649
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:59,880
opportunities uh through onampus groups?

650
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:18,240
I'm trying to think about this. I no

651
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,679
immediate experience comes to mind.

652
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,679
Maybe that's just because I missed it or

653
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,600
or didn't participate, but maybe this is

654
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:26,240
an opportunity to highlight that just

655
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:30,799
for all organizations on on Sloan's

656
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:33,520
campus. um just like the curriculum is

657
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:35,760
uh is structured, it's really a build

658
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:39,120
your own adventure type place. So there

659
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:42,159
are resources available for you know if

660
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,520
if creating more opportunities for

661
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:45,919
community service is something that

662
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:49,760
you're interested in. There's absolutely

663
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:54,000
funding and um organizational support to

664
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:55,440
do that. Uh, and I know for a fact that

665
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,279
there are ample opportunities to get

666
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,600
involved in the community in Boston. I

667
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:02,399
just have to confess that I I wasn't

668
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:05,039
particularly involved myself.

669
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:08,159
Yeah, I I think um in terms of

670
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:09,919
specifically about you know um LGBT

671
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,600
related uh community service, I'm also

672
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,919
like not that familiar about that. But

673
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,039
um I mean I I like the reason I actually

674
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,640
wanted to really go to business school

675
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:18,399
was actually because of uh interesting

676
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,120
global health and sort of like seeing

677
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:22,240
the the ability of um you know my my

678
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,279
background was really sort of like in

679
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,120
research. I mean I was in the same

680
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:26,399
research lab for you know four years and

681
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,159
now I'm kind of doing PhD because I want

682
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:30,320
to go go to academia after this company

683
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:31,919
again. But um uh global health I think

684
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,360
was kind of like what got me interested

685
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,919
in sort of like seeing how

686
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,440
transformative sort of the impact of um

687
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,960
you know technology and like building a

688
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,559
company can be in the sense of going

689
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,720
from like coming up with the idea to

690
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:44,159
actually um developing it and and spend

691
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,559
some time like around like half a year

692
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:49,200
in in very rural part of Western Kenya

693
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:51,520
and working with um with a group of MGH.

694
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,120
So um Boston is a really good place for

695
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,880
if you're interested in just generally

696
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,919
like global health community service

697
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:59,840
there's like you know mass MGH Brigamin

698
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:01,840
Women's Hospital Beth Israel three

699
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:04,240
massive hospitals Dana Farber you have

700
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:06,000
Harvard has in like Harvard MIT have

701
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,840
like incredible programs doing you know

702
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,360
a lot of global health like developing

703
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,120
technologies for deployments in

704
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,320
developing countries and others and um

705
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,600
there's a ton of opportunities of

706
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,760
collaborating with groups doing this

707
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,760
kind of uh this kind of work. So, I'm

708
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:20,559
like completely sure that like if you're

709
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:23,440
looking to do um tackle any specific you

710
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:26,000
know like more LGBTQ maybe like um

711
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,360
related um you know line of like

712
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,960
research or others there's probably like

713
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,600
a million different groups tackling this

714
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:34,399
from like a more you know research like

715
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:36,000
um you know volunteering any kind of

716
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:37,600
aspect. So it's a really good place to

717
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,320
do this kind of work if um if that's

718
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,320
what you would want to do.

719
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:50,520
Manny, I think you had your hand raised.

720
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,520
You wanted to say something?

721
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:55,279
>> Yeah. As a uh was born and raised in

722
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,200
Boston, so I've got a pretty sort of

723
00:29:55,279 --> 00:30:00,000
familiarity of like what sort of groups

724
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:02,799
are out there for LGBT the LGBTQ plus

725
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,880
community. Um but um Jose and Brian I

726
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:07,760
think covered pretty broad spectrum in

727
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:10,399
that regard. you just add my experience

728
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:12,480
uh during the pandemic. I was also able

729
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:14,880
to see you know if you wanted to start

730
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,120
something on your own um for whatever

731
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,799
initiative there definitely was there

732
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:21,200
definitely was the infrastructural

733
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:22,640
backing support and funding for those

734
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,919
students who wanted to do that. So there

735
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,919
was nothing sort of stopping you from

736
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:29,360
starting your own thing because you may

737
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:31,120
have identified a

738
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,880
>> and I'll just add really quickly before

739
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,360
Morgan shares the next question that

740
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,679
still is the case. um you'll find that

741
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:39,919
MIT Sloan is a very much say yes kind of

742
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:42,240
environment and I'm sure our students

743
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,679
will will echo this. Um if you have a

744
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,840
rhyme or reason for why you want to do

745
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:48,640
something um if you can galvanize your

746
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:50,399
peers to come and help you um whether it

747
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,919
be through the student life office, the

748
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:54,240
program office, they're more than happy

749
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:56,480
to allow you to tailor your experience

750
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,559
to accomplish whatever it is that you

751
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:01,360
are hoping to accomplish um during the

752
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:04,720
time period that you're with us.

753
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:07,039
Morgan, the floor is all yours. Awesome.

754
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,720
Love it. Um, we do have more questions,

755
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:12,000
so please keep them coming, folks, in

756
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:14,159
the Q&A. Um, now we definitely heard

757
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,480
about quite a few C functions and I'd

758
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:18,159
love to hear about that Ptown trip. Um,

759
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,240
but this is a great question leading on

760
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:23,960
to that. What's your best memory in the

761
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,960
program so far?

762
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,799
I want Brian to go first.

763
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:36,240
>> Question.

764
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:37,519
>> Yeah, go Alexa, go ahead. I've been

765
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,440
yacking for a while, so

766
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,760
>> No, no, no. Go ahead, Manny. I was just

767
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:44,480
going to call out Brian, but

768
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:46,799
>> Okay. Well, it's that's pretty dangerous

769
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:51,120
question. Um, and you can answer it in a

770
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:53,440
number of ways. Um, oh, I know. So, we

771
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:55,600
had uh the the pandemic, right? And so

772
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:58,559
we didn't have our MIT graduation until

773
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:00,240
a year later. And so during our year, we

774
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:02,960
said we're going to sort of hold our own

775
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:05,440
graduation. And we did. And my favorite

776
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:08,960
moment from the year um didn't actually

777
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:12,320
involve me, but involved a it's a photo

778
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:14,720
um because um uh because we were putting

779
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:17,919
on this, you know, graduation virtually.

780
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:20,399
Um there was a sort of speakers room

781
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:23,120
right in the the venue where we held it.

782
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:26,480
And um one of the speakers was Stella

783
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:28,559
Machello and she is a Sloan fellow 2021

784
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,480
from Mosamb beek and she's the closest

785
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:32,640
thing anyone will ever come to meeting

786
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,720
an actual saint. It's amazing. She's an

787
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:37,120
amazing person. She's coming to my house

788
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:40,320
this weekend on her way to Mosambique to

789
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:42,480
visit her mother. And um the moment I'm

790
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:45,440
talking about is this very quick photo I

791
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:48,640
snapped her as she was reading off the

792
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:51,200
teleprompter here uh her speech for this

793
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:53,519
graduation. and my husband was holding

794
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,519
up the teleprompter to make it easier

795
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:58,480
for her to read. And to me, that

796
00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:00,799
encapsulates so much of what um Sloan is

797
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:03,760
about. It's about putting yourself to

798
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:05,360
the side and focusing on the task at

799
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:09,320
hand and doing what you need to do to

800
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,320
get that accomplished.

801
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:24,240
I I'll I'll jump in with a couple more.

802
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,919
I mean, there's like there's too many

803
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,000
great memories to count. Like honestly,

804
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:30,559
my two years at Sloan were probably like

805
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,360
the most enjoyable, happiest two years

806
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:34,880
of my adult life. Like

807
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:38,480
um

808
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:42,159
but I'll give a couple of examples. One,

809
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:45,519
like sort of just routine is, you know,

810
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:47,600
I loved um just hosting classmates while

811
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:49,519
I was at Sloan. Like I love to cook,

812
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,360
love to throw a dinner party, love to

813
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:55,200
throw a party in in the apartment,

814
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:56,880
whatever. Um, and every year, like this

815
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,279
is just a good example of how nice of a

816
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:01,039
place Boston, and I lived in Somerville,

817
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:02,799
um, is to live, but every year there's a

818
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:06,240
thing called PorchFest where all of

819
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:07,840
Somerville, uh, you know, camps out on

820
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,919
their front porches. It's all these like

821
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:12,560
triple triple-decker houses with with

822
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:14,159
big uh big decks and people play music.

823
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,320
And so I would open up my apartment,

824
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:19,520
have a million people come through, cook

825
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:22,320
a ton of food. Um, and that is just like

826
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:25,119
encapsulates a memory of, you know, how

827
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,720
tight the community was, like how good

828
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:28,480
of friends I was able to make during

829
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:32,320
those two years at Sloan. Just a great

830
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:34,159
time. Then another one is um Alexa and I

831
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:37,599
did one of these together, but uh

832
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:41,440
actually both years I went on study

833
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:43,200
tours um which are subsidized uh

834
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:46,639
programs for which you get academic

835
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:48,560
credit as well. um where you travel to

836
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,000
typically a a set of a couple of

837
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:52,240
different countries. So the first year I

838
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,720
went to Japan and Vietnam and the second

839
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:56,240
year I went all over Scandinavia. The

840
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,520
first one was more global trade

841
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:00,000
oriented. The second was more

842
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:02,880
sustainability oriented. Um and those

843
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,880
were just incredible experiences that I

844
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:09,040
never would have had were it not for

845
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:10,720
being um in the NBA program at Sloan. um

846
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,280
just to learn, to spend time with

847
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:15,520
classmates, to learn about them, and to

848
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,359
have these incredible uh sort of

849
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:20,240
tailored experiences abroad, learning

850
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:24,480
about, you know, business context, uh

851
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:27,040
cultural cultural context, and um you

852
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:30,320
know, all all manner of things, just uh

853
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:32,400
really really unbelievable experiences.

854
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,760
I was hoping Brian was going to say this

855
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:37,520
study tour or else I would have been

856
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:39,599
really disappointed because um I led

857
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:42,240
that study tour and we had such a great

858
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:43,760
time. Um and I think like on on the

859
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,280
organizing front it was just so

860
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:48,480
incredible to kind of like get a peak

861
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:50,480
behind the curtain in the like working

862
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:53,280
with administration and the program

863
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:55,920
office to like put on a curriculum for

864
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,760
half the semester. Um, so like we we

865
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,599
built a syllabus, we brought in guest

866
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,760
speakers, we taught a class, and then we

867
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:04,880
got to do this two-eek trip during

868
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:07,040
spring break where we got to meet with

869
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:10,560
um different companies and organizations

870
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:12,400
that we had um been learning about and

871
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:14,079
got a s just got a chance to actually

872
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,400
like see what they were doing and bring

873
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:17,920
back lessons learned to the US and also

874
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,000
have just a ton of fun while we were

875
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:23,040
there. So I think that's definitely a

876
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,440
big um one of my most one of my fondest

877
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:27,680
memories. And then also sticking on the

878
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:30,000
international front, uh there's another

879
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:33,359
class called Global Entrepreneurship Lab

880
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:36,160
or Gab, which was another one of my most

881
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:38,880
valuable experiences at Sloan. Had the

882
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:40,720
opportunity to work with a startup in

883
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,800
Indonesia. They were a glamping

884
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:44,560
manufacturer, so kind of similar to like

885
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:47,680
Getaway Cabins, if you're familiar with

886
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:49,760
those. Um but they have just completely

887
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,680
dominated the Indonesian market and they

888
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,880
were looking to launch in the US. So we

889
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,640
were working with them for the fall

890
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,640
semester to help them build the go to

891
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:59,119
market and then got to spend the month

892
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,800
of January in Indonesia working with

893
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:02,320
them in person. Got to do a lot of

894
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:06,560
travel just learn a ton about the

895
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:08,560
culture and I think it both of those

896
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:12,240
classes and programs just really embody

897
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:15,280
this like hands-on learning men's manus

898
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:18,000
if you will um at Sloan like everything

899
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:20,079
is just so practical and I really love

900
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,280
that. And not only are you learning, but

901
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:24,240
you're also building incredible

902
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:27,480
relationships with your peers and those

903
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,480
around you.

904
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,920
>> One other point to mention, I can't

905
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:37,280
believe I mean there were so many good

906
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,960
there were so many incredible memories

907
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,960
during that year, right? But because we

908
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,880
were the sort of cohort, you know,

909
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,560
things got a little bit extended for us.

910
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:47,359
You know, MIT is very gracious in that

911
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:49,760
regard. And um I don't know how we man

912
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:51,839
how this managed to happen but like it

913
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:54,880
did right

914
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:58,160
but um we actually got to do um an

915
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:00,640
economics unit of study in Lima Peru and

916
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:03,599
uh I'm from Peru my family's from Peru

917
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:06,720
and um we actually got to have the final

918
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:09,359
night of the course at my house in Peru

919
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:12,320
which was like five of the most wild

920
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:15,760
magical hours of my entire life because

921
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:18,240
everyone from uh my my came. But then we

922
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:21,520
also had the EMBAs come and it was just

923
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:23,599
wild to sort of see both worlds collide

924
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,599
together and two buses that were driving

925
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:28,320
up the road to my house and everybody

926
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:29,520
was in them and then you know uh like my

927
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,560
husband was filming everything and

928
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,320
everybody got off and there was like

929
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:34,160
music and dancers and this and that all

930
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,400
the great food and I sort of thought

931
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:37,839
like I never would have thought I never

932
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,320
would have thought that Sloan would be

933
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:42,880
the conduit to bring these two worlds

934
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:44,240
together and I know obviously as LGBTQ

935
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:47,200
plus individuals

936
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:49,040
That's a very fraught tank for a lot of

937
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:51,040
us, right? Bringing all these worlds

938
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,800
together as opposed to keeping them sort

939
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:56,160
of compartmentalized.

940
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:58,400
Um, but Sloan was the key, right, in a

941
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:01,200
lot of ways. So, um, I think that's also

942
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:03,680
another important topic to me. It Sloan

943
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:06,079
does. However, I don't know what the

944
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:08,480
magic is, but it breaks down barriers

945
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:11,800
that you yourself sometimes erect in

946
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,800
your own life.

947
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,240
Yeah and if I if I can say one more

948
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:18,079
thing just like for for for the

949
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,520
organizer I think uh the admissions

950
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:20,560
committee at Sloan I think I just want

951
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,839
to say that it's absolutely

952
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,839
extraordinary. I mean in my personal

953
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:25,200
experience I had a little bit of a as I

954
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:27,280
was doing this like the first admission

955
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:30,079
program I kind of missed the deadline

956
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,359
for me to um to actually metriculate for

957
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:34,000
the next year. I was trying to do five

958
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:36,240
years but I want to do four and um the

959
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,400
basically it was five months late or

960
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:40,320
something like that and um the for you

961
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,760
know like I spoke with spoke with the

962
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,839
team there and they were able to give me

963
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:46,079
give me a place at the like 10 days

964
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:47,599
before the course started and uh over

965
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:48,800
the program there I've met like other

966
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,920
students doing this the first admission

967
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,480
program through the through the through

968
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:54,160
the um you know the assistant directors

969
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:56,079
at the at the ATCOM and the rest of the

970
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:58,320
team there. an absolutely amazing team

971
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:00,400
and I think a great resource for um you

972
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,160
know for alumni as well and um but

973
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,680
really really grateful to to to the team

974
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,880
there because I think um yeah made made

975
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,800
at least my personal experience very

976
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:09,920
different from that and uh I'm not sure

977
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:11,520
if if the team remembers but 2018 was

978
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,520
the first year in which they were like

979
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,359
allowing like non MIT students to do

980
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:17,119
that program and uh I think they really

981
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:18,720
made it work sort of like in the late

982
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:20,000
decision until September so it's been a

983
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,079
really really amazing team to work with

984
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,440
and um yeah excited for anyone applying

985
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:25,440
to to interact with that team as

986
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,000
We appreciate that, Jose. Thanks for

987
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:34,240
sharing. Um, and I do want to give a

988
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,560
little plus one to Somerville Porchfest.

989
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:39,200
Um, that is a fabulous, fabulous

990
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:41,200
community event. Um, I think we have

991
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:43,280
time for just a couple more questions.

992
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,599
We have some questions from allies in

993
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,680
the chat. Um, as an ally, what are some

994
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:51,160
meaningful ways to contribute to Sloan's

995
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:51,160
inclusive culture?

996
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:09,680
I'll I'll jump in there. Um uh so um

997
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,960
it's probably a well-known fact amongst

998
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,880
you know the folks behind the scenes

999
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:15,760
that you know my house was like party

1000
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:18,400
central during you know co times and you

1001
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:22,000
know so I see Rayvon smiling so I have a

1002
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:25,119
feeling he probably I'm talking about um

1003
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,880
and that's okay and so u the question is

1004
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:29,760
you know how can ally support sort of

1005
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:31,599
LGBTQ events and folks at Sloan and the

1006
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,000
way that like I guess we didn't have any

1007
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:36,079
like club or anything like that but the

1008
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,280
way that folks supported us. I guess

1009
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:41,359
we're just coming to our parties and,

1010
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,800
you know, showing up and blah blah blah

1011
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:45,839
blah blah. And I don't know, that's

1012
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:48,880
created this weird sense of community

1013
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:51,680
like immediately, right? And so, um, I

1014
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:56,040
guess just the normality of it all was

1015
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:56,040
something that really stuck with me.

1016
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:15,920
All right. Um, I'm going to give you all

1017
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:18,319
one piece of homework assignment as I go

1018
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:21,280
over the next slide. Um, and that

1019
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:23,440
homework assignment is to um, as I'm

1020
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:26,240
covering the application slide, if you

1021
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:28,480
can think of um, one piece of advice

1022
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:32,000
you'd give yourself

1023
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:33,359
um, as you were in our our our audience,

1024
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,440
if you were in their seats, what would

1025
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:37,520
that one piece of advice be um, as you

1026
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:39,520
were preparing to embark on your your

1027
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:41,440
MBA journey or your um, time in the

1028
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,720
Sloan Fellows program at MIT? So, if you

1029
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,800
could think about what you would tell

1030
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:46,079
yourself,

1031
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,760
what would you would tell your previous

1032
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:49,680
self now before you start and join the

1033
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,520
program, that would be great. Um, I'm

1034
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:54,000
going to jump over to our next slide

1035
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:55,520
really quickly and then come back in the

1036
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,359
future you could answer. That's that'll

1037
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:59,280
be how we wrap up the the presentation

1038
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:01,359
today.

1039
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:03,280
All right. Awesome. So, just really

1040
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:05,359
quickly wanted to cover some information

1041
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:08,240
about um our upcoming application

1042
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:09,440
deadlines. Um, if you found that the

1043
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:11,040
things that our panelists shared with

1044
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,560
you resonated really well and you want

1045
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:15,599
to take the next step in potentially

1046
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:17,200
joining the MIT Sloan community, um,

1047
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:19,440
just want to go over our application

1048
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:21,680
deadlines for this upcoming cycle. Um,

1049
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,280
as you can see on the left hand side of

1050
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,560
the screen, we have application

1051
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:27,280
deadlines for each of the different

1052
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:28,800
programs that were um, spoke that were

1053
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:31,119
addressed today as far as the MBA and

1054
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:33,440
Sloan fellows program is concerned. But

1055
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:34,880
then for the LJGO program and the

1056
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,640
Masters of Finance and Masters of

1057
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,560
Business Analytics, you'll see that

1058
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:41,119
those two deadlines are going to be for

1059
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:43,040
the LJGO program in early November. And

1060
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:45,200
then for the early career programs, Min

1061
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:48,480
and MBAN, that's going to be in January,

1062
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:50,960
early January. Um on the opposite side

1063
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:53,760
of the screen, you'll see that there are

1064
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:56,160
um the application components. We

1065
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:58,319
require you to submit um pretty much

1066
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:00,400
everything that's standard for uh most

1067
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:02,000
applications. I'll highlight really

1068
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,359
quickly something that's unique to Sloan

1069
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,440
is the fact that we do ask you to submit

1070
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:06,960
an org chart. Um and that's something

1071
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:10,000
that a lot of times we get questions

1072
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:11,119
about um I'll just say really quickly we

1073
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,400
just trying we're just trying to get a

1074
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:13,440
sense of where you fit in the grand

1075
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,319
scheme of things as far as your

1076
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:18,640
organization is concerned. Um so

1077
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:20,800
highlighting maybe your team maybe two

1078
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:22,160
levels above or below you and then maybe

1079
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:25,520
to the right and the left of your team

1080
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:27,200
is all we're looking for. Um, if you're

1081
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,880
working at a big organization, we're not

1082
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,640
going to ask you to name the CFO if you

1083
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:33,359
don't ever, you know, interface with

1084
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:35,119
them. Um, so things to keep in mind. And

1085
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:37,760
then another thing that we typically get

1086
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:40,000
questions about is our 60-second video.

1087
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:42,000
Um, simply the prompt is introduce

1088
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,079
yourself to your future classmates. Just

1089
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,000
check two boxes, make sure that we can

1090
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:48,319
hear you and make sure that we can see

1091
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,760
you. You check those two boxes, you're

1092
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:52,240
off to a great start. Talk about

1093
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:53,920
whatever your heart desires. Um, we'll

1094
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:56,160
have additional um, opportunities for

1095
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:58,319
you to learn more about our community at

1096
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:01,359
other upcoming events um that I

1097
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:03,440
encourage you to join. Um, here's just a

1098
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:06,079
full list of the upcoming community and

1099
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:08,720
culture um, events that are going to be

1100
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:11,440
available to you to join uh, virtually.

1101
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:13,280
And then if you um, want to learn more

1102
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,640
about different DEI initiatives and

1103
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:17,280
things like that that are happening at

1104
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:19,680
MIT Sloan, I encourage you to visit this

1105
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,359
web page here. Um, but then also

1106
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:23,520
encourage you to visit our events

1107
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:24,720
calendar to see the full listing of

1108
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:27,040
other opportunities that you can

1109
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:28,640
participate in to continue to learn more

1110
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:31,359
about our campus community and ways that

1111
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:33,920
you can um make the most of your time

1112
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:36,400
here should you decide to to join us for

1113
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:38,000
either one year or two years. I'm sure

1114
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,960
if I ask our panelists, they'll tell you

1115
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,960
that that time flies by. It flies by.

1116
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:45,440
So, um, to make the most of it, it's

1117
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:47,200
always helpful to have a game plan. Um,

1118
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,880
and the best way to do that is to just

1119
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:51,200
get an early introduction into some of

1120
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:52,960
the resources that are available to you.

1121
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:55,599
Um, with that said, I'm going to turn

1122
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:57,920
the floor back over to our panelist um

1123
00:45:55,599 --> 00:46:01,040
to answer the question that I assigned

1124
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:03,599
to you before um going over that slide

1125
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:05,599
and we're we can go in alphabetical

1126
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:07,280
order. Uh, so Alexa, not to put you on

1127
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:09,760
the spot, but you're going to kick us

1128
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:11,200
off.

1129
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:13,200
>> What is one thing that I would tell

1130
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:16,079
myself? Is that what the question was?

1131
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:18,480
>> Yes. Um, I would say try to figure out a

1132
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:20,640
way to never have to leave because truly

1133
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:23,119
it's like every day I'm like I wish I

1134
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:24,720
was back at Sloan. Um, no. I I mean I

1135
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:26,960
think this is like you're going to hear

1136
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:28,880
this advice a lot but it's worth

1137
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:32,560
repeating like it's going to be drinking

1138
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:35,119
from a fire hose. have your top three to

1139
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:37,839
four priorities or objectives of what

1140
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:40,079
you'd like to get out of the program and

1141
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:42,640
use that as your guiding north star

1142
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:44,720
because in any day there's 10 different

1143
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:46,640
opportun like opportunities that or

1144
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:49,280
events or activities or things that you

1145
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:52,720
could be doing. So having that to kind

1146
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:54,480
of ground you and help you decide is, I

1147
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:56,000
think, very helpful to make sure you get

1148
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:58,720
what you want out of the program, but

1149
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,319
also give yourself some grace because

1150
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:01,920
now I look back at it and I'm like, "Oh

1151
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:03,440
my gosh, like how did I not know that

1152
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:05,119
this was a thing? Like I should have

1153
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:07,440
done this or, you know, taken advantage

1154
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:10,560
of these resources." Um, and the good

1155
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:13,280
thing is that it is a lifelong community

1156
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:15,839
and we have this network now. We have

1157
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:20,119
access. Um, so just give yourself some

1158
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:20,119
grace, but just enjoy it, honestly.

1159
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:27,319
>> Ryan, you're up.

1160
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,680
>> Yeah, I feel like Alexa basically stole

1161
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:34,960
the thunder there. I would say almost

1162
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:36,800
exactly the same thing. The number one

1163
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,800
advice that I give people when they're

1164
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:42,240
about to go into business school is to

1165
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:44,480
try to figure out exactly or as best as

1166
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:50,160
you can what you want to do at the

1167
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:53,760
program before day one. Um

1168
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:57,040
there there really is so much to do. Um,

1169
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:59,680
I think a different way of saying it is,

1170
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:01,760
you know, a lot of people approach

1171
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:05,200
business school, especially people who

1172
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:07,520
are pivoting, um, like I was, with the

1173
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:09,680
intent of using those two years to sort

1174
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:13,520
of figure out what you would like to do

1175
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:16,480
next. That's absolutely a viable path,

1176
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:19,440
but there are tradeoffs. And I think the

1177
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:21,760
experience is generally more productive

1178
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:25,200
if you have as best a sense as you

1179
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:27,040
possibly can of of what you'd like to do

1180
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:29,359
um when you're at the program. You know,

1181
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:31,200
it's like you get in, you think that's

1182
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:35,040
it, and then you show up on campus and

1183
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:37,440
recruiting starts in like October. Um

1184
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:40,480
and and things really do feel like they

1185
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:44,599
move at 100 miles an hour. So

1186
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:44,599
just game planning is helpful.

1187
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:53,359
Yeah, I think um it for for myself I

1188
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:55,040
think one of the the things I've kind of

1189
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:57,280
like wondered is I mean it sounds a

1190
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:59,839
little bit corny but it's sort of um you

1191
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:01,760
know I think the

1192
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:03,520
s like the you know thinking about

1193
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,960
whether NBA is like like a good fit for

1194
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:07,280
you sort of like belonging there I think

1195
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:09,119
in my experience particularly with MIT

1196
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,880
there's people that have like absolutely

1197
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:12,559
all sorts of backgrounds I mean actually

1198
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:13,920
one of our co-founders a professor at

1199
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:16,559
the bum of professor from neurosurgery

1200
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:18,240
and he was actually part of a Sloan's um

1201
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:19,520
EMBA program a few years ago. William

1202
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:21,680
Gormley, which I'm not sure if like

1203
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:24,720
maybe maybe your team like knows him,

1204
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:26,160
but um I I have a bunch of like surgeon

1205
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:28,720
friends from all the hospitals here that

1206
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:30,319
did MBAs at different programs. Um I

1207
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,839
think it's a degree that like I think

1208
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:33,040
with regards to what you would want to

1209
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:34,800
do, I mean like a more traditional

1210
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:37,760
business background or if you want to

1211
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:39,280
you know work in in in in research,

1212
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:41,440
healthcare, it's it's a great fit for

1213
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:43,599
that. And I think another very quick

1214
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:45,280
thing is like really uh you know doing

1215
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:46,559
work with the faculty at Sloan I think

1216
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:48,720
is absolutely extraordinary opportunity.

1217
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:50,960
I mean they're like the best people in

1218
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:53,200
in the world in in in their fields and I

1219
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:54,800
did some work with um Eric so during my

1220
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:57,359
time there which I think was absolutely

1221
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:59,599
like incredible and the Sloan's

1222
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:01,520
librarian team is extraordinary as well.

1223
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:02,880
I mean like very helpful in terms of

1224
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:04,720
like getting to know the research there.

1225
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:07,680
So, um, yeah, that's what I would

1226
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:09,200
probably tell myself for looking back.

1227
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:10,319
And also feel free to add me on LinkedIn

1228
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:12,000
