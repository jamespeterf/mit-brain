1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:12,559
[Music]

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,000
uh my name is corad and I'm the

3
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:19,000
executive chairman and founder of AMD

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,119
Amity Solutions uh to be honest uh I was

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,519
not exactly fully aware of the format

6
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,599
until um but I was anyways asked to

7
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,679
present talk a little bit about uh what

8
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:32,399
we do and what Amity is um so actually

9
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:35,160
we started amate in 20 2 um I was 17 at

10
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,879
the time um and uh you know since then

11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:40,200
we've been building uh software and

12
00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:42,879
Cloud products uh from here in Thailand

13
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,039
um to basically Ser help with call

14
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,719
centers customer Communications customer

15
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:50,559
engagement that's the sector that we are

16
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:52,920
in um throughout our time we've raised

17
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:56,039
about $100 million um and we have about

18
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,640
600 colleagues across the world today um

19
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:59,039
and basically in the last two years

20
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:02,160
we've shifted our business model

21
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,080
significantly um our objective is very

22
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:08,119
simple our objective is to be a global

23
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,119
leader um in AI gen applications so

24
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:11,960
obviously you've all heard of the llms

25
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:14,439
and the large on all the foundation

26
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,759
models you know which sit at the very

27
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:18,640
you know bottom of the funnel uh we aim

28
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:20,119
to be the best at applying those

29
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,960
Foundation models and those large

30
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:24,280
language models um for usage especially

31
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,520
around customer communication and

32
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:29,119
customer service so we actually are a

33
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,720
rollup play uh what we do is we grow

34
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,560
through acquisition

35
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,399
um and what we do is we essentially

36
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,280
acquire uh Legacy software companies

37
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:40,439
where we see huge

38
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,119
potential um for generative AI to create

39
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:45,360
uplift and upsold so this year we did

40
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,200
four Acquisitions uh most of them in

41
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,600
Europe and we deployed about $200

42
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,439
million um to acquire a few software

43
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:55,640
companies in the call center and

44
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:58,039
customer communication uh space so for

45
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:01,399
example we acquired one company in the

46
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:03,399
UK called toing they serve 20,000

47
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:04,840
businesses in the UK and Europe and

48
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:07,360
they're a market leader in call

49
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:10,560
analytics so what they do is they

50
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:13,239
basically uh provide analytics on all of

51
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,080
your calls inbound and outbound and do

52
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:18,280
uh give you all the qu do do quality

53
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:20,480
assurance do analytics um you know and

54
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,400
before generative Ai call analytics is

55
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,160
very boring right because it just uses

56
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,519
keywords it just checks your sentiment

57
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,920
and it tells you what it can do but with

58
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:30,640
generative AI you know we see the call

59
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,080
analytics and call Center management

60
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,120
space is being

61
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,200
revolutionized um and so that is why we

62
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,519
acquired this company um and what we

63
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,840
have in Thailand is we have something

64
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:44,280
called our AI lab and what our AI lab

65
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,879
does is essentially um study do deep R&D

66
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,760
in order to be the best at applying

67
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:50,280
generative AI um into this use case so

68
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:53,440
now we work with the companies that we

69
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:56,040
acquire to apply generative AI um into

70
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,200
their offerings into their products uh

71
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:02,440
and to make it you know competitive and

72
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:05,360
create value for them um so today uh we

73
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:08,560
are based in Bangkok uh but we generate

74
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,879
about 80 90% of our um profit uh from

75
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,120
the European and UK Market we believe

76
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,440
that Thailand is a really really great

77
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,040
place for production um and so here

78
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,680
where we have about 300 400 Engineers we

79
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:23,400
produce uh build help to build and and

80
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:26,200
invest and research on generative Ai and

81
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:29,280
work with our portfolio companies to

82
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,799
apply them um so that is the the model

83
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,319
that we do and here in Thailand we

84
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,239
service almost every uh we service the

85
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:37,760
majority of the largest the 40 largest

86
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:40,480
companies uh we provide everything from

87
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:43,280
uh generative AI debt collection uh to

88
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,920
call center inbound um to you know for

89
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,080
example if you go to San Paragon or icon

90
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,640
sayam you can find our AI machines that

91
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,159
you can ask for recommendations or

92
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:54,519
restaurants so anything uh customer

93
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:57,959
facing we we you know I I believe that

94
00:03:54,519 --> 00:04:00,640
we do uh most of you are our customers

95
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:03,200
um so uh I think that you know our goal

96
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:07,079
again just to uh our goal is to build an

97
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:10,720
AI Champion for Thailand um today uh we

98
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:14,040
we do about $120 million in run rate um

99
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,439
and we are uh in fact uh probably the

100
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,600
largest software company in Southeast

101
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:20,079
Asia now um and our goal is to you know

102
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,759
develop the AI ecosystem here in

103
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,960
Thailand and we're always open to

104
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,680
partner we work with many big companies

105
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:28,120
um in the country uh and I think and and

106
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,080
you know we're always open to partnering

107
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,320
to develop different gen uh generative

108
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:36,919
AI Innovations um different uh

109
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:40,240
applications for llms uh and uh yeah um

110
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:42,400
that's pretty much it I uh apologies

111
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,080
didn't uh didn't have any slides or

112
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,880
anything but always open to discussion

113
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:49,680
and I think that uh you know uh we look

114
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,560
forward to working with uh all all of

115
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,450
our partners and customers to advance

116
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:56,360
generative AI in Thailand thank

117
00:04:54,450 --> 00:05:00,840
[Applause]

118
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,840
you thank you very much
