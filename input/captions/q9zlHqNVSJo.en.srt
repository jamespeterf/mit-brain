1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,679
Thanks so much for having me and uh hey

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,600
everyone, thanks so much for joining us

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:07,359
today. My name is JQ. I guess my

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,360
government name is Jonathan. I go by my

5
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:10,480
initials. Uh wanted to rebranded high

6
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,480
school. There's too many Johns and

7
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,000
Jacks. So JQ was the way to go and it

8
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,560
rhymes with GQ. So it worked out

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,680
perfectly. Um so yeah, I am now a

10
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,600
secondyear MBA. I graduate next May. Um

11
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,640
my former career was in the government.

12
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,680
So I worked for the Department of

13
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,119
Defense. And this past summer I was in

14
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,359
defense tech. So I worked at a defense

15
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,679
tech startup. And what I really wanted

16
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,520
to get out of my MBA experience was to

17
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,040
really be able to pivot away from the

18
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,120
government side and better understand

19
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,800
how that private sector worked out. And

20
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,640
I feel that I have had a lot of great

21
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,320
tools and a lot of opportunities both

22
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,879
interacting with classmates and then

23
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,399
professors and then doing certain

24
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,879
conferences and the like and that's been

25
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,440
really useful for me um to develop on my

26
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:54,239
own and then also to build that network

27
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,320
with other individuals

28
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,239
I think. Yeah. Yeah. And then I guess on

29
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,840
the side what I'm also a part of, I am

30
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,719
the current co-president of the

31
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,239
Asian-American Alliance. We have a very

32
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,840
robust community of other affinity

33
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,560
groups. We also have different clubs

34
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,159
that focus on industry. So on top of the

35
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,320
Asian-American Alliance, I'm also part

36
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,640
of the global security tech club. Um and

37
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,159
then um there's also additional other

38
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,759
clubs. So like a big focus of other

39
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,840
individuals could be like tech and then

40
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:24,799
also um PM individuals. I guess that's

41
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,240
kind of my intro and if the panelists

42
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,240
are ready, Terrell, do you want me to

43
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,280
start with their introductions? Give

44
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,040
them a chance to speak.

45
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,560
>> Yeah, for sure. Go ahead.

46
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,920
>> Awesome. Why don't we start with Katie?

47
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,680
Katie and I actually over overlapped a

48
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,200
year. So Katie, why don't you give us

49
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,799
your intro, your name, your program,

50
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,400
your year, and what we were doing before

51
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,040
and after Sloan.

52
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,840
>> Now, can you hear me? Um, hi everyone.

53
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:49,119
My name is Katie Dao. I just graduated

54
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,680
um in this past spring. I was part of

55
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:54,880
the regular full-time MBA program. So,

56
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:59,119
two years before Sloan, I worked in life

57
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:03,240
sciences consulting and um I'm now in a

58
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,240
rotational program at a biotech.

59
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,439
Is that everything I was supposed to

60
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,920
say?

61
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,920
>> Thanks, Katie. How about we go to MK or

62
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,920
Manit?

63
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:17,520
>> Hi, everyone. Uh my name is Manit. I uh

64
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,239
did the Sloan fellows MBA program which

65
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,800
is one-year accelerated program. Uh

66
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:25,680
before Sloan I was in industry uh in

67
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,800
aerospace on the manufacturing side and

68
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,120
post Sloan I have been in consulting uh

69
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,800
still attached to aerospace industry but

70
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,080
now more focused uh on PE sector. Glad

71
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,519
to be here.

72
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,760
>> Thanks so much Mik. Greg.

73
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,560
Hi

74
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,519
>> everyone. I'm Greg Kim. Uh, I was an MBA

75
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,519
from the graduating class of 2018, which

76
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,840
means I applied 10 years ago, as someone

77
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,400
pointed out to me, unfortunately, a

78
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,519
couple weeks ago. Um, before school, I

79
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,680
was in IT consulting. Um, focused mainly

80
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,560
in the healthcare and education space.

81
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,560
And after school, I bounced around a few

82
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,560
places in like sort of the esports and

83
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:09,640
sports industry, including Riot Games,

84
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,640
Madison Square Garden, and now Oak.

85
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,360
Thanks, Greg. And then Elizabeth, I

86
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,480
don't know if you were granted the

87
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:19,840
panelists function. I think so. Right.

88
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:23,519
>> I just joined. Okay, cool. Um, hi

89
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:26,319
everyone. My name is Elizabeth How. I

90
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:29,599
graduated in 2022.

91
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:32,959
Um, I was part of the LJGO program. I

92
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:34,879
started before or before, um, joining

93
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:38,000
Sloan, I was a software engineer at

94
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:40,720
Wayfair for a couple of years. And then

95
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,040
after that, after school, I moved into

96
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:46,000
Johnson and Johnson

97
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:49,599
um working in the data strategy, data

98
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,239
engineering, the general data space. So

99
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:55,040
um I'm with their contact lens business

100
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:59,040
based outside of Jacksonville, Florida.

101
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,879
And um yeah, getting I've been doing

102
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,439
data engineering, data strategy, some

103
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:05,760
cloud computing, and we're getting into

104
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,360
a little bit of of Gen AI stuff now as

105
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,519
well.

106
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,120
Thanks Elizabeth and thank you all for

107
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,439
your intros. As you guys can see, it's a

108
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,879
fairly diverse um group of individuals

109
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,959
we have for our panel and again this is

110
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,880
focused on you know with uh the club

111
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,320
that we were all a part of and it's cool

112
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,079
to see that you can interact with people

113
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,720
from different programs. So the LGOS's

114
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,080
FM SFMBAs and there are certain classes

115
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,479
and certificates that you can take where

116
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,400
you can learn from those experiences. So

117
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,600
with that, just kind of want to start

118
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,120
with the first question. We'll go with

119
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,759
Greg and then we can go with Elizabeth

120
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,880
and then I'll go

121
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,320
actually let's just go with the the

122
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,759
other order. So that's easier.

123
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,560
Elizabeth, you can start first. Uh the

124
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:45,759
question is why do you choose Sloan?

125
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:49,120
>> Sure. Um I've always known that I wanted

126
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:51,440
to do an MBA at some point in my life as

127
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,320
a even as a software engineer. I felt

128
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,520
like maybe that wasn't what I wanted to

129
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:00,479
do forever. I didn't want to code

130
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:02,639
forever and to get into more of the

131
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:05,280
business space. I just felt like my

132
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:08,880
undergrad was too technical and I needed

133
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,880
some more business education. Um, with

134
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,199
that being said, I still really enjoyed

135
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,639
the technical aspect. So, I started

136
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,039
looking around to see if there were they

137
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:21,680
had dual degree programs out there

138
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:26,479
offered by um the top MBA schools. So

139
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:30,000
MIT came up actually um as one of my top

140
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:31,600
options. I visited um the campus. I was

141
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,600
already living in Cambridge so that

142
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:39,199
helped. Um but

143
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:42,320
having met Sloan, I also did other

144
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:44,240
visited other schools to see um the

145
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,720
culture and do some tours, join some

146
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:50,080
online and in person admission events

147
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,000
and just felt like the people that I met

148
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:56,400
with Sloan

149
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:59,600
um like I I could see myself here and it

150
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:02,639
had a good blend of the kind of

151
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,639
technical a little bit nerdy um

152
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:08,960
background with like a very downto-

153
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:11,039
earthth and nice culture which I didn't

154
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,520
always feel at other schools. So I felt

155
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:16,319
like my personality, my background and

156
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:20,400
my interests mixed really well with with

157
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:23,360
what Sloan is is for as well.

158
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,440
>> Great. Thanks Elizabeth.

159
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,880
>> Yeah. Um for me well I'll start with

160
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,479
YMBBA and then I'll quickly switch to

161
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:32,080
YO. the YMBA I think you know getting my

162
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,360
professional career start in consulting

163
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,600
like I mentioned I was in the healthcare

164
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,600
and education space really great

165
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,759
learning experience developed a really

166
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,919
great toolkit was kind of bored out of

167
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,360
my mind so I wanted to do something with

168
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,120
my career that was more exciting or I

169
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,039
was more passionate about so that was

170
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,520
why MBA and then why Sloan I think two

171
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:52,160
reasons one you know at my firm there

172
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,240
happened to be a few Sloan alumni who I

173
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,680
really looked up to uh one of my direct

174
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:00,080
managers was a Sloan um So there was

175
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,560
sort of like a I knew alums in the space

176
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,080
I I knew alums from the school uh that I

177
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,160
looked up to. And the second one which

178
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,240
is kind of a cheap answer is like Sloan

179
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,840
is unique in that we we have the Sloan

180
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,120
Sports Analytics Conference and that was

181
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,440
something I knew I wanted to be a part

182
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,319
of sort of since college when I read

183
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,479
about in the New York Times. So uh

184
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,160
coming to Sloan for for an MBA was sort

185
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,319
of full circle to to all of those

186
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,639
things.

187
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,160
>> Yeah. conferences were also what got me

188
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,280
uh involved with like Sloan hearing

189
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,440
about it. There's the national security

190
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,520
conference that I was able to attend

191
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:37,319
even before I joined Sloan officially.

192
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:37,319
So yeah, it's a great point MK or Manit.

193
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,960
>> Sure. So for me um similar to Elizabeth,

194
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,880
uh I have a technical background. I I'm

195
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:50,479
a material science engineer. So MIT is I

196
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:52,800
see it as a Mecca of uh uh engineers for

197
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:56,240
engineer for engineers. So it was a

198
00:07:52,800 --> 00:08:01,120
natural um attraction affinity to the

199
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:04,240
school and I um by the time I was

200
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,919
looking into MBA programs I was uh a

201
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,720
decent amount into my career. So I

202
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:12,080
wanted to look at programs that are more

203
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:14,240
towards executive MBA and uh Sloan

204
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:17,680
Fellows is a unique program because it

205
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:20,400
is an executive MBA but it's a full year

206
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,160
uh full-time uh one year full-time. So

207
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,039
you're you are actually stepping away

208
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,759
from your career, taking a break and

209
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:30,879
kind of resetting. So I like that aspect

210
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:33,519
of it. And then thirdly, I was al

211
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,519
already in Boston. And I I had visited

212
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,880
other campuses, but it it was either

213
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:41,839
like they're uh too big or in a too

214
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:44,720
small of a town. So Boston already felt

215
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,800
like home and it was just a comfortable

216
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,320
transition.

217
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,519
>> Yeah. Thanks, man. Yeah, I can

218
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,279
definitely speak to just like the

219
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,800
different amounts of skill sets that I

220
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,640
mentioned earlier. I mean, even the

221
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,120
greater undergraduate community too in

222
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,000
general, graduates, PhD students. I've

223
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,279
taken some classes with those

224
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,560
individuals and just learned a lot and

225
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,880
everyone's trying to build something

226
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,680
together, have that passion, which is

227
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:09,600
awesome, Katie.

228
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:11,279
>> Yeah. Um, I think I echo a lot of what

229
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,240
everyone else said. Um, so I won't

230
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:16,800
repeat it too much, but um, one thing I

231
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,480
will say is I I think a few of us have

232
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,880
technical backgrounds. I also had a

233
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,680
technical undergrad degree and so I did

234
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,279
want business I did want to get an MBA

235
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,480
to get a business degree, but you

236
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,880
definitely don't have to have a

237
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,120
technical background to come at to MIT.

238
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,120
Some of my friends were journalists,

239
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,600
like English majors, things like that.

240
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,959
So don't let that intimidate you. Um,

241
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,880
just because quite a few of us have

242
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:43,040
technical backgrounds. Um but yeah, I so

243
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,920
I I wanted to learn more about business.

244
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:48,640
I wanted to get um I wanted to pivot out

245
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:52,399
of consulting so was looking at business

246
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:54,320
schools. Um and yeah, again echo a lot

247
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,720
of what other folks said, but I really

248
00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:00,240
loved kind of the innovative culture of

249
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,080
MIT and of Sloan. Um you know, there's

250
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,440
so many people working on like really

251
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,920
interesting things, trying to solve

252
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:09,200
really interesting problems. So that was

253
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,560
a big plus for me. Additionally, being

254
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,920
interested in healthcare and life

255
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:16,160
sciences. Um the Cambridge area is

256
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:19,519
obviously extremely strong. There's tons

257
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,279
of small biotechs. Um obviously lots of

258
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,760
research going on at MIT. So it felt

259
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:26,079
like a good fit for me industry-wise.

260
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:29,600
And then last thing I'll say is that I

261
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:31,360
really liked the class size of Sloan.

262
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,000
Um, so Sloan is a little bit of a

263
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:37,440
smaller class size than a lot of other

264
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,200
similar schools. Um, and I really

265
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,680
appreciated that because, you know,

266
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,920
roughly 400 people, and this is for the

267
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,959
regular MBA program, but roughly 400

268
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:49,440
people, you can kind of get to know most

269
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,720
of them. Maybe not, you're not best

270
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,399
friends with every single one of them,

271
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:56,240
but it felt like a very manageable class

272
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:58,240
size, and I really liked that.

273
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,440
>> Yeah, thanks, Katie. Yeah, definitely

274
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,040
really appreciate that. right now,

275
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,120
especially as I've made like more of my

276
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,480
friends in the second year, I can really

277
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,399
get to really hear their thoughts

278
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,079
outside of some of the um you know, what

279
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,519
I was used to in undergrad. Um all

280
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,640
right, so for the next question, I'll

281
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,959
start with Greg and then we'll go with

282
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,880
Elizabeth and then Manita and Katie and

283
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:17,120
it'll be focused on the community at

284
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:20,560
Sloan. So just describe it for us what

285
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,519
your experiences were, pros, no cons, no

286
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,880
cons,

287
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,920
>> no cons. Um I think I think everyone's

288
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,320
going to say this, but I think it was

289
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,640
super collaborative. Um, I'll be honest,

290
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,399
like I came into an MBA program

291
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,160
expecting

292
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,839
sort of what you may from what I hear

293
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,360
get at some other schools like a type A

294
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,120
super competitive environment just there

295
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,440
to network. But like I think one of the

296
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,000
biggest things that quickly surprised me

297
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,160
about Sloan was just how how

298
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,680
collaborative everyone was and that like

299
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,519
you know I made friends for life at

300
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:52,800
school. Uh I wasn't necessarily

301
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:55,279
expecting to, but um just hitting the

302
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,200
ground running our first core semester,

303
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,839
getting to know everyone in my core team

304
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:02,079
and my section like I you know I made

305
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,079
fast friends very quickly and they've

306
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,760
stayed my friends since school and like

307
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:08,480
sure the networking elements really

308
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:11,360
helpful but um I sort of really

309
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,040
appreciated how all my classmates and I

310
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,720
one banded together to get through some

311
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,320
of the coursework but two just like you

312
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,240
know just being in Boston together for

313
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,720
those two years. Um, I definitely would

314
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,079
not trade that for anything. So, um,

315
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,519
yeah, I think really supportive and

316
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:28,920
collaborative. That's how I describe it.

317
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,920
>> Thanks, Greg.

318
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,600
>> I Yeah, I don't remember.

319
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,160
>> Sorry, I Elizabeth. Okay.

320
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,880
>> Okay. Um, definitely echo what Greg

321
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:44,000
said. Very collaborative

322
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:46,399
um, ex um, culture at Sloan. um first

323
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,959
core semester, a lot of the work you do

324
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:52,160
is with your core team and so a lot of

325
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:55,279
the projects are team projects um if not

326
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,600
most of them. And

327
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:59,920
my experience is a little bit different

328
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,680
first few semesters just because I

329
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,240
actually said yes to Sloan the week

330
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,560
before the country shut down in 2020.

331
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,120
So, the first semester was a little bit

332
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,959
more a little bit different, but but MIT

333
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,360
definitely tried to still give us the

334
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:15,360
inperson experience, which we did get,

335
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,519
we just couldn't like all 400 of us

336
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:22,560
couldn't have been on campus at the same

337
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:26,320
time. Um, but even though maybe a lot of

338
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:28,880
the traditional more um get to know you

339
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,720
in person networking experiences weren't

340
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,040
um available to us right away, I think

341
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,120
we were all very creative in coming up

342
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:39,680
with different ways to get to know each

343
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:42,800
other. Um so smaller um dinners, people

344
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,639
had like online cookbook clubs where

345
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,040
where people who liked to cook would

346
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:50,320
would join Zoom at the same time and

347
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,760
each week somebody would pick a dish

348
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,160
they wanted to teach everybody how to do

349
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:57,600
and send the ingredients beforehand. So

350
00:13:54,160 --> 00:14:00,000
I think um class-wise it's very

351
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,920
collaborative. People are very friendly.

352
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,480
It's very innovative. And I think that

353
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:09,120
also um goes to show even in like the co

354
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,959
pandemic how we were able to work with

355
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,680
the situation that we were handed with

356
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:16,639
and still um

357
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:19,680
come out lifelong friends and get the

358
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:22,560
the work done and

359
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:27,920
yeah I think it was pretty much

360
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:31,680
everything that I expected and more. Um,

361
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:34,320
so yeah, there are honestly no cons from

362
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:39,440
my end. I was very happy with with the

363
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:43,120
decision with going to Sloan.

364
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:45,600
>> Thanks, Elizabeth. Elizabeth Manique.

365
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,920
>> Uh, I would say again this is

366
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:52,639
incremental. Um,

367
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:56,000
I was very pleasantly surprised by uh

368
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:58,240
everyone's humility. I think um coming

369
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,519
in of course everybody is very well

370
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:04,079
accomplished and uh you know we we

371
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,760
that's the first thing generally we

372
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:08,240
project especially in this kind of

373
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,560
environment with a very uh prestigious

374
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,920
school very competitive admissions

375
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,920
process. Um, but it was really great

376
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,920
once you start working together and you

377
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,959
know you get past all of that. It was

378
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:23,920
just uh really pleasant to find out that

379
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:26,399
people are so smart and they're experts

380
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,000
in whatever area they work in or they're

381
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,639
coming from, but they're still very

382
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,199
humble and they're very um if very

383
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:35,440
helpful, collaborative, if you have any

384
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:38,079
questions, you know, they'll they will

385
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,959
go out of their way to help each other

386
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:43,600
out. So,

387
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:46,560
what I would say about the community.

388
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:49,040
>> Absolutely, Katie.

389
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,800
>> Yeah. No, I mean I agree with everyone

390
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,399
everything that's been said. Definitely

391
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:57,279
a culture of Sloan's helping Sloan. Um I

392
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:59,519
also think just uh a really passionate

393
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:01,440
community. Everyone is like really

394
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:04,079
excited about the things they're working

395
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:07,360
on or the clubs that they're helping

396
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:10,000
lead. And I just found it to be like a a

397
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,519
really invigorating community um where I

398
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,720
could just learn so much from other

399
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:16,639
people and everyone is always willing to

400
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,800
yeah take the time to help you and give

401
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,079
you feedback on you know whatever you

402
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:24,399
might be working on and things like

403
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:26,160
that. So yeah really really great strong

404
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,560
um community.

405
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,480
>> Thanks Katie and thanks everyone. Yeah

406
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,399
love it and I'm still appreciating it

407
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,320
right now. I mean today is a big club

408
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,839
fest day. So that's where all of the new

409
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,279
students get to interact with all the

410
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,800
different clubs they can be a part of.

411
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,240
So there's that club culture. There's

412
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,519
also just that general sense as Katie

413
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,959
was talking about like Sloan is helping

414
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,040
Sloan. And we'll go into a question

415
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,399
later on about the alumni community. Um

416
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,600
but there's I'm sure there's some

417
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,680
anecdotes that people have to share

418
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,360
about that. But for our next question,

419
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,040
we're going to ask um we're going to

420
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:57,240
start with Manite on just how were you

421
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,240
involved in the community at Sloan?

422
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:03,199
So for uh I'd say for SF MBA program

423
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:05,360
it's a little bit tricky because we are

424
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:07,520
we're there for a very short amount of

425
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:10,400
time. Um

426
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:12,240
but we I think we still made the most of

427
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,400
it. Uh in terms of community of course

428
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,880
you have clubs, conferences, people have

429
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,039
already mentioned that but a big part of

430
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,839
your community is going to be your your

431
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:24,880
classmates, your cohort, your core teams

432
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:28,799
and things that you plan with them. So

433
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:33,039
um outside of the of the the structured

434
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:35,039
uh environment I'd say like you find um

435
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:37,440
there are hackathons that you can find

436
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:40,240
people of your same interest connect

437
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,559
with them uh through hackathons through

438
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:45,120
clubs uh you also as you learn more

439
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:47,039
about each other um you connect on

440
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:51,200
things so we like did lot of hiking

441
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:53,120
trips around um there al also tres that

442
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,120
you can do uh and if you're doing any

443
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:58,160
certification you get to participate in

444
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:01,120
those tracks. Um and then one thing

445
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:04,000
that's very memorable for me is that um

446
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:06,960
there are these C c functions that that

447
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,039
get hosted through clubs and our cohort

448
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,200
we did our like our own version of C

449
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:14,240
function where we in uh had the whole

450
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:18,559
cohort do different cultural themes. So

451
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:23,360
we had like a um um what is it like an

452
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:25,600
Indian indo um Southeast Asian night. We

453
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,160
had a Japanese night. So we did all

454
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,400
these different cultural events and it

455
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,080
was just really great to immerse in

456
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:36,280
other people's culture and learn more

457
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,280
about uh their traditions.

458
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,080
>> Thanks Manate. I hope Katie so she

459
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:43,039
doesn't have to regurgitate everyone's

460
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:46,400
statements.

461
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:50,080
Thank you, JQ. Um, yes, on campus,

462
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:53,440
there's lots to join on campus. Um, so

463
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:56,000
for me, I was uh I was one of the

464
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:59,039
co-presidents of the yarn, which is

465
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,039
Sloan's um kind of storytelling

466
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:05,120
organization, but it's essentially it's

467
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:07,679
this really awesome um event. It's

468
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:12,480
basically happens almost every month

469
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:14,400
where uh four Sloanies will get up and

470
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,840
they'll kind of talk about their life

471
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:20,400
story for 20 minutes in front of um

472
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,640
roughly 200 people, 300 people, whoever

473
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,400
wants to show up that night. Um but it's

474
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,880
this really awesome experience to

475
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,880
connect with your fellow Sloonies and

476
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,720
kind of like get to know them um a bit

477
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,160
better and help just understand the

478
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,280
different walks of life that people come

479
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:37,840
from. So I was co-president of that. So

480
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:41,200
that took up a lot of my time. Um but I

481
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:44,000
was also involved in the helping run the

482
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:46,480
healthcare conference which was fun but

483
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,640
a lot of work. Um as folks mentioned

484
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,679
conferences are a really big thing and

485
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:54,720
they are a tough but rewarding

486
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:56,080
experience. It's really um it's a really

487
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,679
cool experience and a big accomplishment

488
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,080
to say that you helped put one of those

489
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,760
on and like bring together really

490
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,679
interesting speakers and come up with

491
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,679
interesting panels and just put a whole

492
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,679
operation on.

493
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:11,520
And then I was also part of the

494
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:14,480
Asian-American Alliance board with JQ um

495
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:16,080
which was also a really really wonderful

496
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,240
experience, a really great way to

497
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:21,200
connect with fellow Asian and

498
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,960
Asian-American Sloanies. and we put on

499
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,280
several different events, some of them

500
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:28,240
being like the C functions like Manique

501
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:30,080
mentioned. Um, and then I think one of

502
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,919
the highlights also of kind of my like

503
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:37,840
club involvement was I um kind of held

504
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:40,320
like a a panel for um you know different

505
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,919
Asian and Asian-American Sloan to talk

506
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,919
about their experiences and just kind of

507
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:48,080
share with the broader Sloan population

508
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:49,919
of you know what are things that the a

509
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:53,440
that Asians and Asian-Americans go

510
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:55,440
through just in in the world and in the

511
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,200
day-to-day. Um, so that was a really

512
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,200
cool experience to kind of think about

513
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,720
the questions that we wanted to ask and

514
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,520
the different elements of the

515
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,919
Asian-American experience that we wanted

516
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:09,120
to showcase to kind of the broader

517
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:10,799
broader Sloan population. Yeah, that was

518
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,799
a little bit of what I was involved in.

519
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,880
>> Can attest to Katie's involvement. And

520
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,640
then she also was the chief merch

521
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,039
officer and she helped us create this

522
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,720
sweater which all the students

523
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,320
areounding over right now. So, good job,

524
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,320
Katie.

525
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,559
All right, Elizabeth.

526
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,760
How were you involved um in the

527
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,799
community?

528
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:34,000
>> Sure. So, being in the LJGO program,

529
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:36,480
there are certain committees within the

530
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,679
program that are all run by students on

531
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:42,159
top of the the Sloan clubs that kind of

532
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:44,000
circle around the

533
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,880
requirements we also have in our

534
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,720
program. So I was um one of the

535
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:52,320
co-chairs of the internship committee

536
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:55,280
which helps

537
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:58,400
filter through all of the so in the LJGO

538
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:00,480
program it's a 24-month full-time

539
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,559
two-year program where one of your

540
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:05,280
semesters so full six months you're

541
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:09,919
actually off with a company doing a six

542
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:12,400
month internship and so um all of these

543
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:15,200
companies that propose projects need to

544
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,039
come through MIT and the students groom

545
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,280
through them to see depending on which

546
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:22,720
engineering major you are and what

547
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:24,320
project it is what majors can do it.

548
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:27,200
Anyways, I was on that internship

549
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:29,520
committee. Um I also my first year I

550
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:33,039
worked on the the sports analytics

551
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:35,039
conference which was

552
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:37,679
like like folks mentioned a lot of work

553
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:41,440
but very rewarding. Um it was the first

554
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:43,280
time it was online again. So different

555
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:46,640
challenges that we had to work through

556
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:48,480
than previous years, but um it was it

557
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,640
was fun either way and got to meet a lot

558
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:54,720
of people and make connections that I

559
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:57,280
otherwise probably wouldn't have. Um, I

560
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,840
went on a lot of tres, as many as I

561
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:02,640
could, um, because I really like

562
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,720
traveling and I, a lot of these trees

563
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:08,080
are planned by students from these

564
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:10,960
different countries. And so, um, going

565
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:15,360
on these trucks gave me a way of

566
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:17,440
experiencing a country that that people

567
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,600
from that country want like to put

568
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,720
together for you and like do the local

569
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:25,440
things, but also some of the the

570
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:28,400
traditional like touristy things. It was

571
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,400
a good blend of that, but also I think

572
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,000
what was really cool is on the Israel

573
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,080
track there were there was a lot of like

574
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,200
learning that I wouldn't have gotten.

575
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:39,120
They had speakers, they had like

576
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,039
um people from the local community come

577
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:44,320
come talk to us and we even had like a

578
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:47,840
panel. So I think it was a good blend of

579
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:50,480
learning and and fun with a lot of good

580
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:54,480
friends and meeting new friends.

581
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:57,039
Um what else did I do? I think I went to

582
00:23:54,480 --> 00:24:00,799
a lot of C functions. That's also a lot

583
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:04,640
of fun and a a good way to experience

584
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:08,080
different cultures, different clubs. Um,

585
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:12,440
but yeah, I think that was that was most

586
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:12,440
of what I did.

587
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,000
Yep.

588
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:18,000
>> Thanks, Elizabeth. Yeah, the C functions

589
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,279
were the culture functions. So, it's

590
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,600
where the affinity clubs, all the

591
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:23,039
affinity clubs host kind of a event

592
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,799
where they kind of showcase their

593
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:27,200
culture, be it through food, be it

594
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:29,520
through dance. Um, and yeah, those are

595
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,679
so much fun. Um, I think our first one

596
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,760
is next week with the Hispanic Business

597
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,279
Club. Um, and yeah, for the sports

598
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,679
analytics conference, fingers crossed

599
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:39,120
for Caitlyn Clark and Tom Brady. I mean,

600
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,320
you never know.

601
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,840
>> I'm just pointing that out there. I just

602
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,120
hope. Who knows,

603
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,520
>> Greg?

604
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:47,440
>> Yeah, that's a good segue. Um, so, so I

605
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,640
was that my crowning achievement at

606
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,520
Stone was working on the sports

607
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,919
conference. Um, I was co-lead my second

608
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,600
year and that was the year we were lucky

609
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,919
enough to bring in President Barack

610
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:00,480
Obama. So, not quite Caitlin Clark, but

611
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:02,559
maybe close. Um, so that that consumed

612
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:06,480
my life. uh pretty much all of second

613
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:07,679
year. Uh happily so um the first year I

614
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,200
was also involved. I just kind of did

615
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,559
like the esports panel and like we did a

616
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,720
Super Smash Brothers tournament which

617
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:14,720
was kind of funny. Um so that that was

618
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,640
like my main extracurricular and I think

619
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,400
you know some people do a broad range of

620
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,400
stuff. Some people really focus in on

621
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,000
like the one they really care about. Um

622
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,640
I would say the latter path is sort of

623
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,440
what I did when I was at school. Um

624
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,960
otherwise community-wise I think like I

625
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,400
kind of alluded to it. I had a really

626
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,080
great experience my first year with my

627
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,240
ocean and my core team. Not everyone

628
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,240
does, but we were a pretty tight-knit

629
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,679
group. Um I don't know if they do it

630
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,360
anymore, but there used to be like a

631
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:42,000
Sloan Olympics thing, which is basically

632
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:44,559
like a small field day. Um we won that

633
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,400
our first fall. We're obnoxious and came

634
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:48,799
back as a team in the spring, which most

635
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,640
people don't do. And we also did it our

636
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:53,039
second year as like a second year Baltic

637
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,799
Ocean team, which was really obnoxious.

638
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:57,520
Uh but it was a lot of fun for all of

639
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:59,840
us. So, um, yeah, pretty much like the

640
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:02,240
conference and just just hanging out

641
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:05,200
with my close friends, you know, I think

642
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,520
Boston's both Boston's a great town when

643
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,120
you have a community around you and

644
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,480
Sloan gives you that. So, just, you

645
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:13,440
know, being able to hang out all over

646
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,679
Cambridge or people's houses, um, you're

647
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,120
just like grabbing dinner together, just

648
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:19,279
like playing board games at someone's

649
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,919
house. Um, those are some of the like my

650
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:23,200
best memories at Sloan. So, I would say

651
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:26,240
like those are the kind of the two

652
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:28,480
things. Uh, two ways I most engage with

653
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,919
the community.

654
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,159
>> Thanks, Greg. Yeah, listen to all your

655
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,760
reflections makes me really privileged

656
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,279
to still be at school and really

657
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,880
>> goes by fast.

658
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,559
>> Goes by really fast.

659
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,080
>> That office quote where it's like, I

660
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:42,480
wish I knew I was in the good times when

661
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,000
I'm in them. So, good good reminder.

662
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,240
Thanks, guys. We're going to do one more

663
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,640
question. We'll pass over the Q&A to I

664
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,080
think if that makes sense um the last 20

665
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,720
minutes or so. All right, this final

666
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:55,200
question is how have you engaged with

667
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:58,799
the alumni network either as a student

668
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:01,679
uh and since graduating?

669
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:06,159
So, we'll go with um let's see, we'll

670
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:07,919
give Katie another shot. Katie, all you.

671
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:10,480
>> My answer will probably be the shortest

672
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:13,840
because I've only been out of school for

673
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:17,039
um like three months, so I am a fresh

674
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:20,240
alum. Um but yeah, I mean I so I live in

675
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:22,960
New York now. there's super strong alum

676
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:25,039
representation in New York. And I'm I

677
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:29,520
think I'm hanging out with Sloan people

678
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:31,279
at least once or twice a week. Um so

679
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,799
that's kind of I I can't really speak to

680
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:34,720
too much further than that because I

681
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:37,840
haven't like had to network for a new

682
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:39,600
job or anything yet. But um no, I I

683
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,279
think I mean actually I'll take a step

684
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,600
back. When I was recruiting and looking

685
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:45,600
for my internships and my jobs, I will

686
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,600
say that the alum network was very

687
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:50,480
responsive. like pretty much anyone I

688
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:52,000
would reach out to on LinkedIn would

689
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,159
respond to me and respond to me pretty

690
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,880
quickly um and just want to be as

691
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:59,600
helpful as possible. So yeah, I think

692
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,840
the the alum network is is quite strong,

693
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,200
but I'm a fresh alum, so I'll hand it

694
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,760
over to the others.

695
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:08,320
>> Thanks, Katie. Oops. Uh let's see.

696
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:10,640
Elizabeth, why don't you go next?

697
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,480
>> Sure. Um

698
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:15,200
agree with what Katie said. The alum

699
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,679
network is is definitely strong. Being

700
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:21,840
in Jacksonville, Florida, there isn't a

701
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:24,399
huge Sloan presence here, but um I've

702
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:27,360
stayed connected with actually some of

703
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:30,559
the alums that I connected with while I

704
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:33,760
was still in school, either through like

705
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:35,440
while I was doing my my six-month LJGO

706
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,440
internship. I did a ton of networking

707
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:40,080
then because outside of work, there

708
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:44,960
wasn't like homework to do. So I stayed

709
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:47,679
in touch with them and I

710
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,520
the el the LJL program puts together a

711
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:53,840
alumni conference every year. So right

712
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:55,919
out of school I went to the the first

713
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:58,240
the conference for for that year. I

714
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:02,720
haven't been back since because work got

715
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:06,720
busy. But I think those are just um

716
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:10,799
examples of how um the alums continue to

717
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:12,399
stay connected and um with my friends. I

718
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:14,559
still meet up with them whenever I go to

719
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:16,559
Boston. A lot of them stay in Boston. So

720
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:19,440
that's sort of like peer-to-peer

721
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:23,200
connections with with alums, but kind of

722
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:25,279
more upward wise. Um agree with what

723
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:29,200
Katie said. People are always super

724
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:32,240
responsive. I've been to panels or um

725
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:35,279
meetings with alums where they literally

726
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,880
said, "I will hire you just because you

727
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:39,520
graduated from here and we went through

728
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,840
the same experiences." Um which is

729
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,679
something I've never heard before and

730
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:46,240
I've heard it from multiple people. So I

731
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:48,320
think the fact that

732
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:52,320
um we all went through the same

733
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:55,120
experiences and um the alums know what

734
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:59,600
education we got through through the the

735
00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:02,799
program gives them enough belief in our

736
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:05,440
in our abilities to be able to take up

737
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:08,159
um jobs that we're interested in in in

738
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,880
their space and develop into it even if

739
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:14,399
we didn't necessarily have the skills um

740
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:17,600
at the very beginning. Um

741
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:22,159
yeah, I think overall the alumni

742
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:26,799
community has has been very strong. Um

743
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:29,440
I think our and then I guess through

744
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:31,520
me as an alum now I've had people reach

745
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:35,200
out to me on LinkedIn as well interested

746
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:37,360
in exploring applying to MIT and also

747
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:40,480
like why would you apply to a dual

748
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:42,320
degree program? um kind of wanting to

749
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:45,840
know more about the experiences and

750
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:48,240
walking through their their story to see

751
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:50,240
if if the program is a good fit. Do they

752
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:53,279
want to go the full-time MBA or do they

753
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:55,679
want um something like the LJGO program

754
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:58,720
where you get a degree in the in

755
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:02,240
engineering and a degree in M in your

756
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:05,360
MBA all in two years. It is more school

757
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:08,880
work for sure, but um if it's something

758
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:11,679
that you're interested in, it is it is

759
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:15,679
worth the work.

760
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:18,960
>> Thanks, Elizabeth. Rick, how about you?

761
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:20,159
>> Yeah, I would say like the the network's

762
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,520
both like there when you need it, but

763
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:23,840
it's also there when you don't, right?

764
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:26,799
Like I think Sloan's helping Sloan is a

765
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:28,080
very real thing. I think anytime

766
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:29,919
um I've been considering new

767
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,080
opportunities or my peers have like it's

768
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:35,039
really easy to just link like link up

769
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:36,799
with any other alum on uh any other alum

770
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:38,720
like through LinkedIn or or just through

771
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:41,360
your own personal network and someone's

772
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:44,399
always willing to lend a helping hand.

773
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:46,080
Um I would say the most frequent way

774
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:47,519
manifests itself is just like with my

775
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:50,240
peer group, right? Just like having the

776
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:52,000
group chat, right? Like um the other day

777
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,600
like one of my analysts was bothering me

778
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,440
so I was just like I just like hopped on

779
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,440
WhatsApp like hey guys like how do you

780
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,440
guys handle this kind of thing right or

781
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,360
or how do you deal with these situations

782
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,399
or you know when it's time to have comp

783
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,840
conversations like how are you

784
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:05,919
navigating these things I think just

785
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:09,279
like just having that group of people

786
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:10,480
who share that set of experiences. It

787
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:11,919
also so happens that a bunch of people

788
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,679
in my group chat are Asian-American, so

789
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:15,200
like I think that helps too. But just

790
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:17,279
like being able to like have those

791
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,039
shared experiences and background, know

792
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:20,399
someone's coming from a similar place

793
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:22,640
even if they're in a different industry

794
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:24,559
or something like I think that's been a

795
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:27,840
huge plus and it's just kind of like a

796
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:30,080
great day-to-day relief. Um, and also

797
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:32,480
like now, you know, my I I work for like

798
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:34,320
a sponsorship agency part of our

799
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,399
company. So, like when we're doing

800
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,799
business sales, like I actually like

801
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:40,559
have a network of people who are like

802
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:42,320
mid-level senior at a bunch of companies

803
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:44,080
now that like I can try to get in touch

804
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,679
with to help our sales people try to

805
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,360
actually sell some sports sponsorship.

806
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:48,880
So, it's had a little bit more practical

807
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,120
value in the last couple years too,

808
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,559
which I didn't necessarily expect. So,

809
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,000
both formally and informally, I think

810
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:55,919
it's it's it's a really tight-knit

811
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,960
community.

812
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:02,720
>> Awesome. Thanks, Greg. Manit.

813
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:06,320
>> Yeah. um resonate with each uh point

814
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:09,360
everybody made. Um it's great. I mean

815
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:12,080
I've been keeping in touch or tapping

816
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:13,919
into the alumni network uh for any you

817
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:16,960
know if you want to get any perspective

818
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:19,760
on industry or want to understand uh

819
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:21,440
something in gather some insights on a

820
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:24,880
particular industry. It has been great.

821
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:27,519
It has been great for warm intros. Uh so

822
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:29,039
um you know I've reached out to people

823
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:31,519
uh whom I know and then they have

824
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:33,840
offered to connect me to three or four

825
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:38,080
other people and warm introductions are

826
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:40,880
always um more responsive than cold. Um

827
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,720
other than that I would say they're uh

828
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,679
another great asset to have when you're

829
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:48,640
traveling. So I'm in I'm still in like

830
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:50,399
these uh big WhatsApp groups and if

831
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,080
somebody is going to be in a city they

832
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:54,080
just post it like hey going to be in

833
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,720
London these days is anybody around and

834
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,960
people are usually very responsive and

835
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:01,840
you know even though you have may have

836
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:03,200
not gone to the same program or the not

837
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,440
overlapped at all but just because

838
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,440
you're associated with the with the

839
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,359
school people will show up to meet you

840
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:13,040
like complete strangers but you still

841
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:15,119
have something woman.

842
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,879
>> Thanks, Minnie. Thanks, guys. So, we're

843
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,639
going to go into some Q&A from the

844
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:20,320
attendees. Terrell, do you want me to

845
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,679
take this or do you want to? I'm happy

846
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,119
to.

847
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:24,720
>> Take it away, JQ.

848
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:26,079
>> Awesome. So, we're going to start with

849
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:27,839
Elizabeth. Someone had a question

850
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:29,440
specific for the LJGO, but while she's

851
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:31,520
answering that question, I want you guys

852
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,520
all for the next question just like your

853
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,599
best memory or like the most rewarding

854
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,560
experience of Sloan for you. So, for

855
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:39,520
Elizabeth, we're going to start with

856
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:41,200
LJGO specifically. Um, how' the LJL

857
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,440
experience compare with the with your

858
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,960
MBA counterparts? Specifically, did you

859
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,960
find that you missed out on networking

860
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,280
opportunities or had less time to engage

861
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:52,280
with the MBA class because of your MS

862
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,280
requirements?

863
00:34:52,560 --> 00:35:01,839
Um short answer is yes. You do have less

864
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:04,880
time to do maybe some of the other um

865
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:07,040
MBA activities like I wasn't as involved

866
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:10,800
as as Katie or a lot of people were in

867
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:14,400
in Sloan clubs um because of the

868
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:16,079
engineering classes but I chose to take

869
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,079
more engineering classes slightly more

870
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:20,079
engineering classes than required. I

871
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:21,839
think people can choose to tailor their

872
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:24,160
experience to just the minimal

873
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:28,480
requirements and take the rest of your

874
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:31,280
classes all within Sloan. Um or do half

875
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,680
and half or somebody in my class did a

876
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:37,040
minimal Sloan requirements and all

877
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:41,040
engineering otherwise. Um, so short

878
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:44,640
answer is yes, but I think you can

879
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:48,800
tailor it to to be more Sloan focused if

880
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:51,920
you wanted to. And also just a caveat

881
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:54,079
that my experience was during COVID and

882
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:56,079
so a lot of the large group activities

883
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:58,720
that you normally we normally would have

884
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:01,520
gone to as a whole cohort wasn't

885
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:04,320
available to us. So it was also more

886
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:06,720
more effort on the individual to to

887
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:10,000
schedule these smaller gettogethers to

888
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:13,599
get to know groups and instead of like

889
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,920
five oceans normally we had eight my

890
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:18,560
year. So they added some rivers and

891
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:20,800
called them oceans anyway. So I was part

892
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:23,200
of the Amazon River and they had other

893
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:25,200
rivers as well. So each cohort was also

894
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,520
smaller.

895
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:29,920
um which makes it easier to get to know

896
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,760
your co your cohort but also not not

897
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,520
that easy to get to know the whole class

898
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,520
when you're not on campus at the same

899
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:37,520
time. But going back to the normal

900
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,440
experience, I definitely had classmates

901
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:42,640
who who were way more involved on the

902
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:44,880
MBA side and wouldn't say that that they

903
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:48,320
missed out on too much because of their

904
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:49,839
their engineering requirements. Um

905
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,680
within the engineering courses, you can

906
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:54,400
also choose to take easier classes or

907
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:57,520
harder classes. So I think it's very

908
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,200
very much still even though there are

909
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:01,839
additional academic requirements there

910
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:04,839
are ways that you can tailor it to your

911
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:04,839
need.

912
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:09,680
>> Thanks Elizabeth. So now I'll allow you

913
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:11,599
some time to think about your your best

914
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:15,560
memory most rewarding experience.

915
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:15,560
Manique are you ready?

916
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:21,119
Yeah, I I don't know if I will be ready,

917
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:23,520
but I'm just like scrolling through my

918
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:27,119
down the memory lane to pick one because

919
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:29,520
it is so difficult. Um, I'm going to go

920
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:33,040
with like a celebrity shock type of

921
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:34,880
experience. Um and this is again like

922
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:38,880
there's so many experiences to pick from

923
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:43,520
but Indraui was a guest speaker on uh

924
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:46,480
campus and uh she was in um the Samberg

925
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:49,920
conference room upstairs. Um, and I

926
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:52,720
remember like I mean

927
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:56,240
given her accomplishments and just how

928
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:58,480
uh uh well celebrated of a CEO she has

929
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:00,960
been and a board member um you know

930
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:03,200
you're I was sitting in the first row

931
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,920
and I remember like being that close. I

932
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:08,800
I'm usually not a fan of people, but it

933
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:12,320
was just like, wow, this is amazing that

934
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:14,720
you're you get to be in presence of such

935
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:17,280
a great personality and actually have

936
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:19,280
the opportunity to ask questions, you

937
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:22,000
know, even after the talk, have

938
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:25,200
one-on-one conversations. So, I think

939
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,599
just um it the school providing that

940
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:32,480
opportunity and having these celebrity

941
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:34,320
type people on campus is awesome.

942
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,920
Thanks, Manatee. Katie, you're gonna go

943
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:40,119
last. Well, actually, Elizabeth will go

944
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:40,119
last. Greg, how about you?

945
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:46,560
>> Um, for me, aside from the conference,

946
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:48,800
um, I think it was like I think it was

947
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:50,160
the payoff of second year spring. This

948
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,839
probably isn't the right topic for an

949
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,440
admissions panel, but I think just like

950
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:55,280
being able to spend time with all my

951
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:58,400
friends like going all over the place

952
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:00,320
essentially once like you know all the

953
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,480
like most of the work was done and I had

954
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,480
the job offer like that was when I

955
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:06,079
really got to I think enjoy my time at

956
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,800
school and connect with my classmates

957
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:10,079
most like like literally the week after

958
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,520
the sports conference I just like

959
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:13,119
grabbed my four closest friends like

960
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,200
you're coming with me to Disney World

961
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:17,280
and we just like skipped class and went

962
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,880
to Disney World for like four days. Um,

963
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,800
but but I think it was all those little

964
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,400
moments. Like I think it was it was

965
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:25,040
doing that. It was going on like a New

966
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,800
Zealand study tour. It was like going on

967
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:30,000
a trip with my friends to Europe for

968
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:31,760
graduation. Like I think the classroom

969
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,079
stuff was great. The network I built was

970
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:37,599
great, but this the my favorite moments

971
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:40,800
were all on my classmates for sure.

972
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:43,040
>> Thanks, Greg. Katie.

973
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,040
>> Yeah. Um, having just gone through

974
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:47,599
second year spring, I can definitely

975
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:49,440
definitely agree with Greg. It's uh

976
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:52,880
really chaotic but really fun and a lot

977
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:56,160
of like really good bonding and memories

978
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:58,640
um with friends. Um, but for me, I would

979
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:02,000
say probably my like proudest memory

980
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:04,560
from Sloan was doing a yarn, which is

981
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,200
like kind of what I described earlier.

982
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:10,079
Um, of like getting getting up in front

983
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:13,520
of 200 of my classmates and just talking

984
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:15,839
about my life for 20 minutes. Um, which

985
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:18,400
for me was like an extremely rewarding

986
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:20,400
experience because like going into the

987
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,079
MBA, going into the MBA, if you had

988
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:25,119
asked me if I would ever do one, I would

989
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:27,680
have been like a million% no. like you

990
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:29,200
could not force me to I would not want

991
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:34,160
to go in front of that many people and

992
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:37,280
just like be vulnerable. Um but like

993
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:40,240
being Asian-American and like there's

994
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:42,000
you know I obviously it's generalities

995
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:45,920
and you know stereotypes but I

996
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:48,000
definitely um struggled with like being

997
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,440
quiet and not using my voice enough and

998
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,240
that was a lot of the feedback that I

999
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,359
got coming into the MBA. And so it was

1000
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:57,599
definitely something that I really

1001
00:40:53,359 --> 00:41:01,200
wanted to push on and work on and and

1002
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:02,960
grow in. And so yeah, doing the yarn was

1003
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:05,760
kind of like a culmination of all of

1004
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:08,079
that and something that I very proud of

1005
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:11,119
myself for doing.

1006
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:12,640
>> Thanks Katie Elizabeth.

1007
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:14,880
>> My

1008
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:19,280
maybe because I'm also further away from

1009
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:21,760
from from being in school. My my first

1010
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,839
um thought when you asked the question

1011
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:26,880
was also trip related with my

1012
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:29,839
classmates. It was also towards the end

1013
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:33,760
of of our time there. Um it was a trip

1014
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:36,000
to Argentina where our first flight got

1015
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:38,560
cancelled and we were running around the

1016
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,359
airport trying to rebook ourselves to to

1017
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:43,280
go to Argentina. And it kind of just

1018
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:46,240
running through the airport with my

1019
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:48,400
classmates and like it felt like an

1020
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:50,160
amazing race moment where everybody was

1021
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,920
like running from terminal to terminal

1022
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:55,680
trying to get a flight that would get us

1023
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:57,920
there as soon as possible. And then and

1024
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:00,640
then yeah, just just small moments that

1025
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,720
make up the whole whole story that end

1026
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:06,079
up being bits and pieces of of memory

1027
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:10,319
that you take with take with you

1028
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:12,160
forever. I think is is

1029
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:13,599
like what's what stuck with me when you

1030
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:17,920
first asked the question. But of course

1031
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:19,920
like the classroom was was great and

1032
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:22,800
um but all of all of those things kind

1033
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:24,880
of build together to into the different

1034
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:28,800
relationships that we that you have that

1035
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:31,040
you end up um making memories with these

1036
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:34,400
different people that that stick with

1037
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:36,000
you and and take going forward.

1038
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,000
>> Thanks, Elizabeth. All right. So, we

1039
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,319
have a question for Manit focused on the

1040
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,240
SFMBA. So, we're going to do that next,

1041
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:44,240
but uh in the background as our last

1042
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,839
question, we'll close out with um a

1043
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:48,240
question for everyone on how the

1044
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:50,400
Asian-American community has at Sloan

1045
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:52,319
has helped you with like your career

1046
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,079
progression or how it's helped you along

1047
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:55,920
the way. So, Manique, for you with the

1048
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:59,040
SFMBA program, there's like kind of two

1049
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:02,880
questions. Um but so the SFMBA is known

1050
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:04,880
to leave no fell behind. Um and they are

1051
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,000
asking specifically how much support

1052
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,520
would you say you have received from

1053
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,599
your fellows in moving through career

1054
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:11,599
switch post SFMBA and what kind of

1055
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:13,280
support was that? They mentioned that

1056
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:15,040
they have a background in aerospace. So

1057
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,200
they're interested in also uh switching

1058
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:18,960
I believe and then also speaking to the

1059
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:21,359
fact of the one-year program versus the

1060
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:24,319
two-year program if you're able to

1061
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:27,599
provide a succinct answer there.

1062
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:29,520
>> I'll do my best. Um yeah, so as far as

1063
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:33,040
support, I would say a lot of support.

1064
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:36,000
So as I was um entering the program, I

1065
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:39,119
knew what I wanted to get out of and

1066
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:43,119
what my path was going to be post MBA,

1067
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:45,520
but I was um you know, you you meet

1068
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:47,839
people from different walks of life and

1069
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:50,079
different experiences, industries. And

1070
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:51,839
it was really good to learn more about

1071
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:54,880
different industries, not just from the

1072
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:58,240
outside, but actually understand what a

1073
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:02,240
a day in the life of um a consultant or

1074
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:04,480
a day in the life of a um a PE analyst

1075
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:08,400
would be like. So I think it was very

1076
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:11,760
helpful to know the the true picture and

1077
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:14,240
even after the program um just

1078
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:16,160
connecting to the alumni as I was going

1079
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:17,920
through the recruitment process to like

1080
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:21,520
make the right connections was very

1081
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:24,400
helpful. So definitely like we uh live

1082
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:29,520
behind.

1083
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:32,480
Um as far as the second part was about

1084
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:34,480
what was it other than the support

1085
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:36,640
>> the one and two years.

1086
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:38,480
>> Okay. The one one to two years. Uh yeah.

1087
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:40,960
So I

1088
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:43,599
one year definitely feels very short and

1089
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:46,000
at the end of one year we were all like

1090
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:48,400
oh where did it was just blink of an eye

1091
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:52,000
and here we are at graduation. So

1092
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:54,160
definitely 2 years would have felt a lot

1093
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,599
better because there's not there's

1094
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:57,440
you're you're doing your program and

1095
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:59,599
then there's loan but then there's MIT

1096
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:01,359
so you want to experience all of it and

1097
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:05,040
it's just juggling a lot of different

1098
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:08,480
priorities. Um, it would have been nice

1099
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:11,440
to do the two-year program, but then uh

1100
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:14,240
you just have to know what what your

1101
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:17,040
what works best for you because one year

1102
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:19,440
also allows you to go back into uh

1103
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:22,880
workforce like after one year you're not

1104
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:26,160
away from your career for two years. Uh

1105
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:28,720
so I it it's it's a balance. Um, if I

1106
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:31,280
could if I could have made everything

1107
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:35,040
work with the two-year, perhaps I would

1108
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:36,560
have chosen that. But it is what it is.

1109
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:39,040
>> Hey, if it was going to be five years

1110
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:44,040
for two years of tuition, I'd do it.

1111
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:44,040
>> Yeah, there you go. Exactly.

1112
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:48,400
>> All right, Greg, you spoke a little bit

1113
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:50,079
about um how you are in WhatsApp groups

1114
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:53,040
with uh your fellow Asian-American

1115
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:55,359
Sloan. Can you speak a little bit to how

1116
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:57,040
that community at Sloan has helped you?

1117
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:57,760
>> Yeah, I think I mean I think that's more

1118
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:59,359
like

1119
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,280
>> Yeah, I think that's more natural social

1120
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:03,839
evolution, not like Sloan helping me.

1121
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:06,400
Um, but I would say like I think in that

1122
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:07,920
regard I I think you know my career is a

1123
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,440
bit off the beaten path, right? Like I

1124
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:11,599
went into this video game thing for a

1125
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:13,119
couple years. I came back to traditional

1126
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:15,359
sports and there weren't there aren't

1127
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:17,839
exactly a lot of Sloan alumni in my

1128
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:19,440
space that are Asian-American. So it for

1129
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:21,440
me I think it hasn't been as helpful in

1130
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:23,680
that regard. that the way I think it has

1131
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:25,839
been helpful is kind of like I alluded

1132
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:28,400
to earlier from like a peer-to-peer

1133
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:30,240
experience, right? Like there's I like I

1134
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:33,359
just like have the sounding board of of

1135
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:36,319
my friends. Um you kind of have like all

1136
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:37,839
your friends is like a barometer for for

1137
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:39,520
you know how you're approaching your

1138
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:40,960
career. You're helping them solve their

1139
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:43,200
questions which is like gives you more

1140
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:45,280
perspective uh on like the challenges

1141
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:47,040
that you face. I you know I think in the

1142
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:49,040
same way just as like with any strong

1143
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:51,280
educational institution like most of

1144
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:53,359
your learning happens not in the

1145
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:57,119
classroom but from your peers and I I

1146
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:58,720
think in that way um just like the

1147
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:01,119
Asian-Americans who happen to be my

1148
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:03,599
closest friends have been like you know

1149
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:05,599
immense in in my like personal

1150
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:08,560
development and like in some of the ways

1151
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:10,480
I approached my career. So, uh, I think

1152
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:12,160
in that way, uh, I think both

1153
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:15,359
Asian-Americans in Sloan and the broader

1154
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:17,359
Sloan community are, um, you have been a

1155
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:21,079
powerful thing.

1156
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:21,079
>> Thanks, Greg, Katie.

1157
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:27,359
>> Yeah, I mean, um, I think I'm lucky that

1158
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:31,040
some of my close friends who are

1159
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:33,920
Asian-American were also ines.

1160
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:35,920
So, um, we were able to like take

1161
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:38,000
classes together and like work on

1162
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:41,119
project teams together. And then as we

1163
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,880
were going through like recruiting and

1164
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:44,319
like negotiating our offers and things

1165
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:47,040
like that, it was really great to be

1166
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:48,960
able to just like bounce

1167
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:50,240
ideas, bounce questions off each other,

1168
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:53,920
just like understand what they were

1169
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:55,920
going through. Um, and actually some of

1170
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:58,079
those people like I got to know through

1171
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:00,160
the AsianAmerican Alliance and through

1172
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:03,359
like the Asian-American Alliance events

1173
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:05,760
and ski trip and things like that. So, I

1174
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:07,280
probably would have known them through

1175
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,480
the classes we had taken, but I don't

1176
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:11,359
think I would have been as close to

1177
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:14,160
them. So, I feel like I was very lucky

1178
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:18,440
in that sense.

1179
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:18,440
>> Thanks, Katie. Elizabeth,

1180
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:26,240
>> sure. Um, similar to what Greg and Katie

1181
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:29,920
already shared, a lot of it um

1182
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:32,400
are a lot of the how has being part of

1183
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:34,160
the community helped. Um, while I was at

1184
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:38,000
Sloan, I think something that stood out

1185
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:40,079
to me is is like being

1186
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:43,040
having maybe similar cultural

1187
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:46,160
backgrounds and understanding um our

1188
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:48,559
upbringing being and like Katie shared

1189
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:51,119
before too, like coming into school

1190
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:53,119
knowing maybe we were known as more shy

1191
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:55,760
people or soft-spoken

1192
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:58,800
that it is something that we wanted to

1193
00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:01,760
work on or even as an Asian-American

1194
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:05,680
woman noticing that often often times we

1195
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:07,119
say sorry when it is not necessary. Um

1196
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:08,480
during school I remember that was

1197
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:11,119
something that a lot of us wanted to

1198
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:14,800
work on. And so in just daily life and

1199
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:16,640
conversation when somebody says it when

1200
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:19,040
it was not needed that we would call

1201
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:21,839
each other out on it and and through

1202
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:25,280
time you you start noticing that you

1203
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:28,240
start doing it less. And so I think that

1204
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:32,559
is just I think something interesting

1205
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:35,839
with the with the shared um experiences

1206
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:40,400
and um through the friendship and

1207
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:44,079
openness and just people being very very

1208
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:47,920
open and opening open to be vulnerable

1209
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:50,559
with each other was was definitely

1210
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:54,800
um something that I think was very

1211
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:57,200
refreshing and and

1212
00:49:54,800 --> 00:50:00,400
memorable that

1213
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:02,240
still to to this day we we share similar

1214
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:04,160
similarly even though we're in different

1215
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:06,319
industries with with my friends like

1216
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:07,920
what we're going through our challenges

1217
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:10,319
and how we might navigate through

1218
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:11,839
different situations

1219
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:14,319
and

1220
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:18,559
and it's always a learning experience as

1221
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:21,839
well as a just sometimes a nice nice um

1222
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:23,760
set of ears to to vent to.

1223
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:26,559
Yeah, definitely. Thanks, Elizabeth.

1224
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:30,720
Manise, close us out.

1225
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:33,440
>> Sure. Uh, so I'd say I mean, Sloan and

1226
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:36,800
MIT in general is a very diverse place.

1227
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:40,079
So, I think it it provides us the a

1228
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:43,520
platform or the ability to connect with

1229
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:46,480
a lot of our identities. So, we're we're

1230
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:48,800
like Elizabeth mentioned, we're uh we're

1231
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:51,040
woman, we have a certain way, and we're

1232
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:53,839
Asian-American, and we're other things.

1233
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:56,800
We are technical background people. So

1234
00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:59,680
it just you you find uh because it's

1235
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:01,520
such a diverse community uh in all

1236
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:03,200
aspects not just in our physical

1237
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:06,079
attributes or backgrounds in many

1238
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:08,720
aspects that you it allows you to find

1239
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:12,720
others that that are similar in that and

1240
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:14,559
just uh be yourself be your natural self

1241
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:17,599
u while you're going through this

1242
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:17,599
transformational experience.
