1
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,000
And now a big welcome to our next

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,240
presenting startup in Patatica with

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,759
their novel AI enabled wearables for

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,599
continuous health monitoring and

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,160
research. Welcome to stage David

6
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,240
Crowley. Uh before I start just hands up

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,960
has anyone got a wearable like a

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,640
smartwatch, a smart ring, anything to

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,320
collect data. Great. So what we do is we

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,840
have wearable devices that are used to

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,160
collect data but mainly for clinical

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,519
trials and clinical research. Um, and as

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,440
one of the last speakers before your

14
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,040
lunch, I very much understand my role

15
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,520
here, so I will keep this short and

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,040
sweet. So, I am David Crowley. Uh, I

17
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,559
work in the pharma partnerships team.

18
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,800
It's my job to help with a lot of our

19
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,480
industry partners to understand how to

20
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,200
use wearables and how to use digital

21
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,879
data uh from these wearables in how they

22
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,079
conduct clinical trials and clinical

23
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:54,399
research. So, Impatica as a company, we

24
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,120
were co-founded in 2014 by Professor

25
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,359
Rosen Buchard of MIT, who is still our

26
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,039
chief scientific officer today. Um, and

27
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,559
we are based just across the river in

28
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,640
Boston. So, we haven't moved too far,

29
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:07,600
but we also have locations in Milan,

30
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,119
Italy, and Soul in Korea. Um, we are a

31
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,119
fullstack company. So, everything that

32
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,560
we do from the wearable technology to

33
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,360
the different digital biomarkers and

34
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,159
algorithms are all developed inhouse. Um

35
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,640
and really you know our our focus is to

36
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,880
create uh specific digital biomarkers

37
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,560
and specific wearables to capture

38
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,439
different measures as you go through a

39
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,880
clinical trial. We primarily work in the

40
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,720
kind of clinical research and clinical

41
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,680
trial space. We work with a lot of top

42
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,479
20 pharma companies um supporting over

43
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,479
120 trials to date uh and over 100,000

44
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,600
people have worn different variations of

45
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:43,280
our products.

46
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,119
So when we talk about clinical trials

47
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,040
today there are obviously challenges

48
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,600
associated with clinical trials. Uh one

49
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,720
of the most ones that we talk about is

50
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,720
subjectiveness. Uh so a lot of clinical

51
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,880
trials are based on different patient

52
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,320
reported outcomes which can be hugely

53
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,640
beneficial in terms of getting a

54
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:02,079
patient's perception and a patient's um

55
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,360
kind of um measure of a disease state

56
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,439
but it does lack a certain

57
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,759
objectiveness. So these measures can be

58
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,679
subject to different recall bias. Uh how

59
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,280
a patient is feeling on a certain day.

60
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,879
You know intermittent monitoring comes

61
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,440
into place where you may be only seeing

62
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,959
a patient once a month. Um so depending

63
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,840
on how that week has gone for them that

64
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,120
can influence their um responses. Uh

65
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,440
it's obviously costly to bring

66
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,599
participants um patients into a clinical

67
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,200
trial site to monitor them and then you

68
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,879
know from the participant aspect it is

69
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,800
burdensome to to travel to different

70
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,760
places to travel on site and have

71
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,440
different tests uh in place.

72
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,440
So what we've designed is the emphatic

73
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,959
health monitoring platform. Um and

74
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,800
essentially that is there to remotely

75
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,720
monitor patients and capture this data

76
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,160
in a more objective manner in a

77
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,840
continuous fashion. So this is the uh

78
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,840
wearable itself that's part of this

79
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,360
platform. Anyone who's looking can see

80
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,920
I'm wearing one right here and we have a

81
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,440
few more outside. Um and essentially you

82
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,239
can capture over 300 different digital

83
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,800
measures using this uh quite neatly

84
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,480
designed um quite unobtrusive watch.

85
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,560
There are five different sensors on

86
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,159
board. Depending what a a company is

87
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,319
looking to measure, we do tend to tweak

88
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,319
those sensors in different frequencies.

89
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,760
Um we do have kind of accelerometer,

90
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,680
gyroscope, skin temperature, pretty

91
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,519
standard. As you go towards the bottom,

92
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,280
we have more customized sensors.

93
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,519
Vententral EDA, which I'll be talking

94
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,440
about in a minute, looks at electromal

95
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,680
activity. So that looks at your galvanic

96
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,080
skin response. Uh very good at detecting

97
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,640
kind of periods of excitation or stress.

98
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,720
Uh and then optical PPG is uh what you

99
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,120
may be familiar with in certain kind of

100
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,959
health monitoring uh devices that look

101
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,400
at pulse rate, pulse rate variability,

102
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,920
respiration rate, blood oction and

103
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:42,159
saturation. So this is the flow of data

104
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,080
again just to to show you how the whole

105
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,440
platform works. Obviously we start with

106
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,200
the wearable device but then it

107
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,120
transfers to an app and goes up into a

108
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,480
centralized location in the cloud. Uh

109
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,920
importantly a participant doesn't really

110
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,360
need to do anything on this which is

111
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,519
great. they just put it on and it

112
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,120
collects this data continuously uh and

113
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,720
researchers and sponsors are able to

114
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,799
capture this data centrally in one

115
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:05,599
location. So in terms of our use case

116
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,879
and how this can be used um there you

117
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,480
know we've done a lot of research in

118
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,239
clinical trials and clinical research

119
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,879
not all published but I have chosen one

120
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,959
that is publicly available and we're

121
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:17,280
currently working with the US Department

122
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:20,560
of Defense to look at post-traumatic

123
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,440
stress disorder monitoring. Um so I

124
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,840
think 7% of uh veterans will develop uh

125
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,520
PTSD in their lifetime. That percentage

126
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,680
goes even higher when you look at more

127
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,199
recent uh deployments and and combat

128
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,520
zones. So what we're working with the

129
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:36,080
DoD is is to have continuous monitoring

130
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,080
using our devices um and looking at

131
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,400
different measures to try and predict a

132
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,400
novel digital biomarker to either

133
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,440
monitor disease progression or predict

134
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:48,720
risk factors of developing PTSD uh in

135
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,639
these uh populations.

136
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,240
So last but not least, thank you very

137
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,600
much. Uh in terms of

138
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,040
partnership, as I said, we primarily

139
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,199
work in the clinical research and

140
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,800
clinical trial space. Uh so if you are

141
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,720
interested in incorporating wearables

142
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,199
into your trial, uh a lot of the

143
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,360
wearable use is in CNS disorders, but we

144
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,280
are uh therapeutic area agnostic. We

145
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,479
work across metabolic disorders across

146
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,080
cardiology, obesity, oncology. So if

147
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,600
you're ever interested in using this

148
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,160
technology, please do come and talk to

149
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:21,560
us. I'll be outside and yeah to meet you

150
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,560
all. Thank you.
