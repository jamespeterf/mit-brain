1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Our

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:12,400
next speaker is Vir Shvet who is a

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:16,080
professor at the MIT computer science

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:19,119
and AI lab. He is also a co-founder of a

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,960
company called Neurom Neurom Magic which

6
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,519
uh right now I believe is part of Red

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,640
Hat and also which is part of IBM. So

8
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:30,080
let's uh join me in welcoming Shamir.

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,480
>> Hi everybody. Um yeah, so uh I'm going

10
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,399
to tell you a little bit about um

11
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,079
inference. AI inference sounds boring

12
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,440
relative to all these fantastic things

13
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:43,040
that people do with real materials. Um

14
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:45,600
so um

15
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:48,239
um you know

16
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,440
AI models especially open AI models have

17
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:55,520
been just through a fantastic journey in

18
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,360
the last um couple of years and people

19
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,039
use them everywhere and I think this is

20
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:04,640
just going to keep on going. Now these

21
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:08,640
models kind of belong to a different

22
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,799
family of um software.

23
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,840
Um there's been like a fundamental

24
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,159
change in how what the software is that

25
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,759
we're building. In the past we used to

26
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,840
build software that I would say was kind

27
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,840
of input driven.

28
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,240
You have a small program with a few

29
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,400
parameters and then you know you run the

30
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,400
program and it is the data right the

31
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,040
huge data that you run on whether it's a

32
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,720
database or or another application that

33
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,479
determines you know how much time it

34
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,560
takes you to run this thing. So

35
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,479
everything is proportional to the amount

36
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,079
of input

37
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,240
and this is kind of fundamentally

38
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:47,840
changed because now we have these AI

39
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:50,479
models and these models actually the

40
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,560
program is enormous right the number of

41
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:55,439
parameters actually determines your

42
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,840
performance and so we've now gone from

43
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,719
what I call input driven to parameter

44
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,119
driven and this kind of means that we

45
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:06,320
have to change the way we actually

46
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:08,239
orchestrate running these programs

47
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,599
in particular, right? This has to do

48
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:13,920
with what we call um AI inference. So I

49
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,480
want to go back for a second and think

50
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,080
not about AI inference but about

51
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,599
inference in general. What we think

52
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,920
about inference which is running

53
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:25,280
software in data centers, right? And if

54
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:27,680
you look at um you know the historical

55
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,200
way that we run software is we have

56
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,680
essentially this thing called an

57
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,080
operating system, right? So the

58
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,000
operating system is a layer that sits

59
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,400
between the applications which are

60
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,440
historically I I guess mostly databases

61
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,319
but also other types of servers and u

62
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:48,239
web servers things like that right and

63
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:50,160
the hardware which are CPUs

64
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,319
and this has been like that for many

65
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,360
many years and we're at a kind of

66
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:57,040
beautiful stable point if you you know

67
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,599
we have brilliant operating systems

68
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,800
researchers at MIT but kind of their

69
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:05,440
work now is kind of boring for industry.

70
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,400
Okay, I'm not I I don't wish to insult

71
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,879
anybody, right? But everything's stable.

72
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,640
Okay, there's not much changes in the

73
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,319
hardware. There's not much changes in

74
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,760
the software and therefore there doesn't

75
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,080
have to be a lot of change in the

76
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,920
operating system. We're pretty happy.

77
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,720
The thing that the operating system is

78
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:25,440
doing for the software is kind of giving

79
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,000
us this buffer, right? where the writers

80
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,760
of the um you know the applications the

81
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,159
databases they just have to write to the

82
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,159
operating system or the virtualization

83
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,239
layer right and then the people that

84
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,400
design the hardware they just write

85
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,159
drivers for the operating system you

86
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,319
know and comes a company like Red Hat

87
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:45,040
IBM right sits in the middle and

88
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,480
provides you this kind of smooth way of

89
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,879
running everything so that you can

90
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,879
change the hund hardware underneath you

91
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,640
can change the software above and it

92
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,640
doesn't really matter to you that's

93
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,319
really what an oper operating system is

94
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,000
doing.

95
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,760
And now the world has changed and we

96
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,319
have these parameter-driven

97
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:05,760
um you know algorithms this all this Gen

98
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:09,200
AI inference right and now right we have

99
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:12,319
a different game the applications are no

100
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:16,079
longer databases they are actually you

101
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:19,519
know um you know kind of uh models

102
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:22,079
bigger and bigger models as we go along

103
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,880
with all kinds of agentic applications

104
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,919
and things are kind of moving right

105
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:32,240
moving really really fast here, right?

106
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:34,960
And in the same at the same time because

107
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,360
our demands in terms of the software are

108
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,840
changing so rapidly, the hardware is

109
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,479
also trying to catch up. So we've got

110
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,720
all these types of new accelerators. You

111
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,160
know, every other every few months

112
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,000
there's a new version of some

113
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,720
accelerator, some piece of hardware that

114
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,400
somebody's designed.

115
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:56,960
And so what we need right is a new layer

116
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:01,680
there in between something that will

117
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:04,800
play the same exact role that you know

118
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,360
that that uh the operating system played

119
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,280
this time for the models and the um and

120
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,000
the hardware that they run on top of.

121
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,360
Okay. And the the beautiful thing about

122
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,320
this game, the thing that makes it

123
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,639
interesting, right, for scientists,

124
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,800
right, for developers is that it's

125
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:23,840
rapidly changing.

126
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:27,039
Okay. And this means that this layer,

127
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:30,000
okay, is changing like I I want to say

128
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:32,320
every week, okay, new versions of

129
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,960
things. We need to invent invent

130
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:37,680
technology. Now, it's kind of funny

131
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,000
because a lot of this technology, okay,

132
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,919
is are these are just variations of what

133
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,919
we already have done in operating

134
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,840
systems research. So we have to thank

135
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:48,000
you know people like like France Kashuk

136
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,960
at MIT who have already given us

137
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,199
wonderful ways of actually designing

138
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:56,000
scheduling and control and all these

139
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,240
other things. Okay. And now though we

140
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,199
have to apply them in a different way to

141
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,759
a different problem. Okay. And so this

142
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:09,120
is actually what's happening in this um

143
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:13,199
in this space. Um and you know and um

144
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:16,400
the kind of reason why um Red Hat IBM

145
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,960
bought my my my startup Neural Magic. I

146
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:22,240
started that company in 2018. We started

147
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:26,560
doing inference and um with the advent

148
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:29,520
of LLMs. Okay. Things just exploded.

149
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:32,240
Okay. And the reason right is because

150
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,319
suddenly we need a replacement. A

151
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,039
replacement for this operating system

152
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:40,800
paradigm. We need a new way of

153
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:43,039
insulating the models from the hardware

154
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,240
so that any new player in the

155
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:49,440
accelerator space can join in and

156
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,520
replace an Nvidia GPU without a problem

157
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,840
that you can have a data center that is

158
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,840
not uniform all Nvidia GPUs. I mean,

159
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,199
it's nice to do it with a uniform thing

160
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,639
if you're doing, you know, if you're

161
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,319
doing training, but if you're doing

162
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,080
inference and you're doing this in a

163
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,000
modern data center, you want to let the

164
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,400
customer pick what type of hardware he

165
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,479
wants to run on. Okay? You want

166
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,680
competition. You want to encourage that

167
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:15,199
below. Okay?

168
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:17,039
And so if you build this intermediate

169
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,840
layer, you're allowing any changes you

170
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:22,800
want underneath. And in the same time

171
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:25,120
right the applications the actual models

172
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:28,479
can change very rapidly. All they have

173
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:31,199
to do right is fit to this intermediate

174
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:33,840
layer right they only need to fit to the

175
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,759
inferencing layer. And if we achieve

176
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,319
this okay and we're very by the way

177
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:43,199
we're very far from achieving it. Okay

178
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:46,080
but if we do we'll be golden. And so VLM

179
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:49,520
okay which is kind of the specialtity of

180
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:52,319
my company. We are the core uh

181
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:56,080
developers of the VLM kernels and the

182
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:59,919
VLM internals. Okay. What VLM gives you

183
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:03,759
is one of those um you know kind of

184
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:05,759
operating systems for ML and this is

185
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,599
really I think this is where we're

186
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,400
going. So we're going to have open

187
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:13,120
software above a variation a variety of

188
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:16,400
hardware below and we're going to have

189
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:19,120
um you know VLM style um intermediate

190
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:22,400
layers that are essentially going to um

191
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:26,319
you know replace the operating system.

192
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:29,520
So a modern kind of um operating system

193
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:32,399
replacement right um the the inference

194
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:35,120
server will be able to connect any type

195
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:38,320
of software any type of model with any

196
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,800
type of hardware and make it you know a

197
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,880
level playing field for everyone to to

198
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,640
kind of exist in and there's incredible

199
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,680
buyin from all of the hardware and

200
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,920
software providers for this kind of a

201
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,000
solution

202
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:56,680
and I think with that I'll finish and

203
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,680
Um, you're welcome to ask any questions.

204
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,240
>> Questions for near.

205
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,760
>> Yeah.

206
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:18,880
>> Hi. Um, so I was I was also like I I

207
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:21,360
know a little about like VRM and uh I

208
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:24,320
read like there was a opensource

209
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,480
community out there that was uh they

210
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:30,160
have like all the codes auditable and

211
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:34,000
everything. Uh so like what does your

212
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:36,399
company do like uh in this field?

213
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,720
>> Great question. So, so when you have a

214
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:42,320
piece of open- source software like

215
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:45,680
Linux an operating system or VLM a uh

216
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:48,240
you know runtime right so the open

217
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:51,600
source developer developed this uh

218
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:54,720
software but enterprise companies cannot

219
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,600
rely on the open-source software to run

220
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:01,279
missionritical applications and so

221
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:04,080
companies like Red Hat, IBM, Oracle etc.

222
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:06,240
companies like that provide right a

223
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,560
solution that is stable and so for the

224
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,600
business world the stability of the

225
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:14,000
software right is the thing that is

226
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,880
given and of course you know there's a

227
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,040
there's a little bit of a kind of a also

228
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:22,160
uh uh when when you say open source

229
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:24,800
right uh VLM is an open-source uh

230
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:27,600
product developed by I would say three

231
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,120
companies really together so yes there

232
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,720
are developers out there that are

233
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,839
sitting at home and coding for the fun

234
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,600
of But mostly it's done within companies

235
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:40,040
that have an interest in the success of

236
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,040
the product. Yeah.
