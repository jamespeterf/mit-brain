1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,280
Ready to learn some uh AI and software

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:14,480
engineering today? Good. Uh my name is

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:18,080
Jim Flynn. I am a program director here

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:22,160
at MIT corporate relations and I want to

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:26,640
welcome everyone to the MIT AI in

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:29,840
software engineering forum. Since uh

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,920
this forum is being sponsored by MIT

8
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,640
corporate relations, I'm just going to

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,440
take a couple of minutes to talk about

10
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:41,200
the program that we have here and then

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:44,079
we'll kick it off.

12
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:48,000
If you hang around campus enough, you'll

13
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:52,000
hear the term men's at Manis and uh that

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,079
is the MIT motto. And what that means is

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,399
mind in

16
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:58,640
hand. And uh what we're trying to

17
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:02,559
emphasize with that is that we not only

18
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:06,479
focus on the accumulation of knowledge

19
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:09,280
but the practical applications of it.

20
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,240
And that spirit infuses a lot of what we

21
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,280
do here. Some MIT students doing things

22
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:18,159
with their mind in

23
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:22,600
hand. And uh that's also helped to

24
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:25,840
create what we call the MIT innovation

25
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:28,240
ecosystem. Uh a couple of years ago, a

26
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,280
few of our colleagues over at the MIT

27
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,759
Sloan School of Management identified

28
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,840
the key stakeholders that you need in

29
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,079
order to create something like the MIT

30
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,280
innovation ecosystem, the sort of hot

31
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:43,280
bed of innovation that surrounds that uh

32
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:47,119
where you are right now in uh Kendall

33
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:49,320
Square in Cambridge. And uh it not only

34
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,759
is centered around a

35
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:56,159
university and this is true of other

36
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:57,799
hotbeds of of uh innovation but also

37
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,320
includes the

38
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:02,719
entrepreneurs that are come out of that

39
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,280
university. Either they could be

40
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:08,080
students or people attracted to the area

41
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:11,120
by the university like faculty members

42
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,720
as well as the risk capital, the venture

43
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:18,040
capitalists, the investors that fund the

44
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:20,440
ventures and then uh the co corporate

45
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:22,720
collaborators or as I like to say the

46
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,640
customers that will buy those

47
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,879
innovations.

48
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,120
uh as a major research university, the

49
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,920
government support that we've

50
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:37,120
traditionally had here.

51
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:40,720
So MIT is organized into five schools

52
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,879
and just recently in 2019 we formed

53
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,599
another college that's the Schwarzman

54
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:49,519
College of Computing and with that was

55
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:53,200
created actually mostly uh in order to

56
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:55,840
promote AI and then infuse that into

57
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,920
other disciplines across campus. So at

58
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,000
Schwarzman, you might have a mechanical

59
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:03,599
engineering professor using generative

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,440
AI to create new designs sitting next to

61
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,480
a philosophy professor who's looking at

62
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,480
AI

63
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:13,879
ethics. In addition, within these five

64
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:17,440
schools in one college, we have 65

65
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:19,840
significant lab centers and programs.

66
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,640
And the key takeaway I want you to know

67
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:25,120
from this slide is that whereas

68
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,400
wonderful things come out of this

69
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:32,400
ecosystem this uh uh this institute it

70
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,720
is very chaotic uh in a way and that's

71
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,400
part of what the creative process is and

72
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:41,519
very decentralized. So navigating

73
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:44,480
through MIT is challenging and that's

74
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:47,440
why we have jobs here because what we do

75
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:51,120
at MIT uh in the industrial liaison

76
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:55,040
program the sponsor of this forum is we

77
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,959
help companies to engage across that

78
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,000
ecosystem.

79
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:02,319
Uh, I like to say that I could talk

80
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,599
about what my job is here at MIT for two

81
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:08,080
days or I could sum it up by just saying

82
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:10,480
matchmaking. So, we try to get the our

83
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,760
corporate partners, our ILP members

84
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:17,120
engaged with the best place on campus

85
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:19,840
for them to work with. It requires a

86
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:23,360
significant knowledge of both MIT and

87
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:28,160
the company's business.

88
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:30,479
And uh there are over 200 ILP members.

89
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,639
As you can see, unsurprisingly, we have

90
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:35,120
a pretty significant presence in North

91
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,639
America, but also we have a pretty large

92
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:42,080
footprint in East Asia as well as in

93
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:44,560
Europe and in upand cominging uh of

94
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,639
increasing presence in places like

95
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,639
Southeast Asia, Latin America,

96
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,639
Oceanania.

97
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:58,320
Now uh the ILP was formed in 1948. So we

98
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,199
are over 75 years old. Makes us one of

99
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,520
the oldest industry engagement programs

100
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,440
around. But about uh I think it was

101
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,080
eight or nine years ago. We realized

102
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,880
that there was a gap and that gap was

103
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,280
that while a lot of innovations that are

104
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:16,560
happening in our labs today will be

105
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:19,199
reshaping industry in four or five 10

106
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,720
years from now what a lot of our ILP

107
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,400
members the companies you saw on the

108
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:27,600
last slide they want to be able to find

109
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,120
things that they could use now so

110
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,960
somebody had the brilliant idea of

111
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,720
saying let's leverage this

112
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,520
entrepreneurial ecosystem that we have

113
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,880
around MIT all the startup ups that we

114
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:41,080
have in in tremendous

115
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:43,600
frequency and create the MIT startup

116
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:46,479
exchange and we can introduce those

117
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,080
companies to our ILP members because

118
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,680
they're taking the innovations that

119
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,080
happened in our labs and they're

120
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,199
creating real products and services that

121
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,600
you could use today. So we have so

122
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,840
there's 800 MIT connected startups.

123
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:05,440
These are startups that are founded by

124
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:07,039
MIT faculty in many cases MIT alumni uh

125
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,280
where it could be even a company that

126
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:11,120
just licensed MIT intellectual property

127
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,759
a patent.

128
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,800
So uh in this slide what I want to do is

129
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:19,039
emphasize the fact that the ILP for

130
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,080
companies that wish to engage across the

131
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:24,319
MIT ecosystem. The ILP is the only

132
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,960
industry-f facing program we have at MIT

133
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:30,080
that covers the entire institute entire

134
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,160
ecosystem. So we don't provide any

135
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,800
research ourselves here that we try to

136
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,840
engage companies with. Our job is solely

137
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,800
to connect you to the most the best

138
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:43,120
place at MIT for you to engage with. So,

139
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,680
uh I apologize in advance for this slide

140
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,000
because uh one of the things I tried to

141
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,680
do is create one that shows all the

142
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,479
different parts of MIT that are working

143
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,160
on AI uh and put it on one slide. The

144
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,240
problem is that out of those five

145
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,240
schools, one college, 65 labs and

146
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,759
centers, it's really hard to find

147
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,440
somebody that's not working on AI. Uh so

148
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:06,000
in in just about every one of those

149
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,800
places again it's infused across campus.

150
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,759
Uh but that makes this point that if

151
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,240
your goal is to not simply engage with

152
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:18,160
one lab but engage across campus and

153
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:20,880
across the ecosystem uh then the ILP is

154
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,280
a great place for you to go.

155
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:26,400
So, in just uh wrapping things up here,

156
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,960
I I know that uh uh at least a quote

157
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,599
that's attributed to Charles Darwin is

158
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:34,160
that it's not only the strongest and the

159
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:36,080
smartest that species that survive, but

160
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,400
it's the ones that can handle change the

161
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:41,360
best or the most adaptable in other

162
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,120
words. So, uh probably why human beings

163
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,400
have survived because we are an

164
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,800
adaptable species. So, and and that's

165
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:53,280
really the point of the ILP is that we

166
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:57,360
help our ILP members adapt to change.

167
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:59,599
So, if you are an ILP member and you

168
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,080
want to again leverage your ILP

169
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:04,000
membership, you should talk to your ILP

170
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,560
program director. Uh that would be

171
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,560
somebody like me or somebody like Jose.

172
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,120
Can uh any of the program directors

173
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,520
raise your hand right now? Okay. if if

174
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,440
if you're not an ILP member or if you

175
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,840
are, you can you could talk to a program

176
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,720
director about the about it. If you're

177
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,879
ILP curious, meaning that you're uh

178
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,720
probably should be an ILP member, uh

179
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,599
then you could talk to us as well. You

180
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,960
can go to our website

181
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:30,960
ilp.mmit.edu or just send an email to

182
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:37,479
askpmit and we will help you adapt to

183
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,479
change.
