1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,200
Now we'll focus on how disorders of

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:08,000
adipose tissue can contribute to

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,400
metabolic diseases. We'll focus on

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,360
obesity which is characterized by excess

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:16,000
adipose tissue and lipodistrophe which

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:19,119
is characterized by lack or abnormal

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,600
distribution of adipost tissue. Despite

8
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:24,000
the contrasting effects on total mass

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,960
between these conditions, both can

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
result in lipid overflow and deposition

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,079
in other tissues which will lead to

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,239
complications including insulin

13
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:37,280
resistance, which is the inability of

14
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:40,079
the hormone insulin to properly regulate

15
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,399
blood glucose levels, which can also

16
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,920
lead to increased risk of type 2

17
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,800
diabetes.

18
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,760
Obesity is a complex disease involving

19
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,640
many factors and include lifestyle

20
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:55,280
components which include diet and

21
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,800
physical activity patterns which also

22
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,680
interact with genetic predisposition.

23
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:05,360
The plots show obesity prevalence trends

24
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,520
worldwide both in women and men which

25
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,320
clearly highlight the magnitude of the

26
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:13,520
problem which affects over 600 million

27
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:17,040
people and also how quickly this evolved

28
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:19,360
over a time span of 40 years. Now

29
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,320
obesity is associated with a vast range

30
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,799
of health complications. The most widely

31
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,360
recognized are the impacts on endocrine

32
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,600
systems and cardiovascular systems which

33
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,479
will increase the predisposition to type

34
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,720
2 diabetes and heart diseases. However,

35
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:38,079
there's also many other implications to

36
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,400
the nervous system, pulmonary, immune

37
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:43,360
system, and even increasing the risk of

38
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:46,399
some kinds of cancer which then really

39
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:49,759
shows the wide ranging of complications

40
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:51,680
involved with obesity.

41
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,159
On the other end, we also have

42
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,560
lipodistrophe which is characterized by

43
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,880
the lack or abnormal distribution of

44
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,119
adipose tissue which then can be

45
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,560
classified in different types based on

46
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:06,320
its severity, the causes and genetic

47
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,920
predisposition.

48
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:12,800
Here are some magnetic resonance images

49
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,920
where we have subcutaneous fat shown in

50
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:19,360
blue and visceral fat showing in yellow.

51
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:22,319
And when we compare to healthy controls

52
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,959
here on the far left, we can see

53
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:29,200
different kinds of uh lipodistrophe

54
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:32,080
cases characterized by both

55
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:36,080
almost complete depletion of all adipose

56
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:38,879
tissue and also other patterns of

57
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,680
depletion of subcutaneous adipose tissue

58
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,519
and increased deposition in the visceral

59
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,519
compartment

60
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,239
associated with this abnormal pattern.

61
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:51,519
patterns of fat mass and distribution.

62
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:54,239
We see a range of increased risk for

63
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,879
metabolic complications including

64
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,879
insulin resistance which will affect

65
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:02,080
blood glucose regulation and

66
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:04,640
predisposition to type 2 diabetes.

67
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,519
And how does obesity and lipodistrophe

68
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,599
affects adapost tissue directly?

69
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,239
Under normal adipos tissue formation

70
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:14,480
conditions, there is a healthy expansion

71
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,560
that will adapt to normal calorie

72
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,720
intake.

73
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,800
Under conditions of prolonged calorie

74
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,599
access and other preconditioning

75
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,080
factors, there's unhealthy expansion of

76
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:28,400
adipost tissue leading to abnormal

77
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,200
patterns of hormone, lipid and

78
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,799
inflammatory cytoine release which will

79
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,519
further impact metabolic health

80
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:40,000
in conditions of lipodistrophe. either

81
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,400
due to the impaired formation of adipost

82
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,319
tissue or due to acquired factors

83
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,760
leading to the depletion of adipost

84
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:50,000
tissue. We also see abnormal hormone

85
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,720
release patterns that will impact

86
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,720
metabolic health.
