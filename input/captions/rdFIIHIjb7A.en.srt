1
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:19,000
before we go to the test I just want to

2
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:21,920
point out this PCP is nonadaptive okay

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,400
the what are the queries of the verifier

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,760
he behaves like

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:30,480
a a verifier of of the gkr or in other

6
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,800
words verifier for Su check and and some

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,719
check is a public coin protocol so the

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,840
messages don't depend on anything you

9
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,960
just choose some Randomness and that

10
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,920
defines the queries so uh so it is a

11
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,680
non-adaptive the the questions you ask

12
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:48,160
don't depend on the answers you get this

13
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,879
is because the Su check is public coin

14
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:54,079
okay so that we do get nonadaptive and

15
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,480
as we said though we do need to check

16
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:59,440
that the witness sitting in the PCP is

17
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,920
of low degree so let me just do that

18
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,920
quickly

19
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:09,240
so a what how do we check it so the

20
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,560
prover what he does he you know there's

21
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,720
the H to The

22
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:21,040
N he should put a some witness here 01

23
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:21,759
02 0 w0 W1 W2 and so on uh so all the up

24
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:27,119
to

25
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:28,439
WM okay m is over uh up up to let's say

26
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,680
let me call the number of bits in the

27
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:35,479
witness s we'll just have a lot of of

28
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:38,680
zeros a a appended just so because m is

29
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:41,040
taken to be log s so not to confuse and

30
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,240
now he's giving kind of he takes the

31
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,360
extension right so this is f to the

32
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:47,439
m and this should be this is just what

33
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,840
it should be this is what the honest

34
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:53,200
mover does this is the low degree

35
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:59,840
extension uh of H ofm which should be of

36
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:59,840
degree hus one in each coordinate

37
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,840
and I want to check that now okay here's

38
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:13,360
the sad truth I can't actually check

39
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,160
this this thing is low degree with uh

40
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,840
degree H minus one in each coordinate I

41
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:20,599
can't check it because maybe maybe it is

42
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:24,040
but here he put something

43
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:26,720
bad I can't check it I mean I'm not how

44
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,760
how can the the verifier has small

45
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,680
queries so he can't actually check that

46
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:33,280
this is low degree that's

47
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:36,080
impossible okay so what does he what

48
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:39,000
does he do instead he's going to check

49
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,800
that it's close to low degree okay so

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,519
here's the guarantee the guarantee we

51
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,120
want is to say that this I'm going to

52
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:49,280
check I'm going to do a test and if the

53
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:51,800
test passes the guarantee I want not

54
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:55,440
that this is low degree but it's close

55
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:58,480
there's another polinomial of low degree

56
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,239
that agrees with this at most

57
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,599
points okay so we have we have a low

58
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,599
degree

59
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:11,920
test is a check at the end of the check

60
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,480
what the verifier the guarantee the

61
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:17,959
verifier has is the guarantee we want is

62
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,920
that with high

63
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:23,879
probability there

64
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,879
exists a low degree

65
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:32,040
polinomial W till

66
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,760
such

67
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:38,799
that dou

68
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:43,519
Tilda such that for most

69
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,519
Z or the probability over a random

70
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,280
Z the w z

71
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:55,760
equals is

72
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,000
uh greater than one minus Epsilon for

73
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,640
some Epsilon okay that's what we want to

74
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,799
check for Mo Z now if if we got this

75
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:07,000
check if we succeeded in this if we

76
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:10,239
succeeded in this check then now what we

77
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,599
know is that okay let's think in our

78
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:15,519
head that this is he put this up there

79
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:19,120
yeah he put He put this but they're so

80
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:21,759
close let's put this up there anyway the

81
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,000
probability that we'll ask on a z for

82
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:27,960
which they're different is only exson

83
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,080
mostly they agree on so all we need is

84
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:33,000
to to verify

85
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,759
that you know there's the be because we

86
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,840
check V Zer on a random Z at the

87
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:41,560
end most likely it's disase for which

88
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:43,560
they agree so all we need to check is

89
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,160
that they agree almost everywhere the

90
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,960
fact that there's few location that they

91
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,479
don't agree a there's nothing I can do

92
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,160
about it because if I don't query them I

93
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,240
don't know if they ex I don't know you

94
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,080
know what they what's sitting there but

95
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,039
actually I don't care that much cuz

96
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,840
they're not going to I'm not going to

97
00:04:55,039 --> 00:05:00,800
query them anyway with high

98
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:03,240
probability so really all to say is that

99
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,120
there exists a w Tilda that is low

100
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,680
degree and agrees with that with high

101
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:11,720
probability how do I do that how do I

102
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:16,880
check that this W that this

103
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:19,840
V completely malicious vzero

104
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,160
Tilda behaves close at least as I said

105
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,280
we can't assume it's low degree but

106
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,759
close to low degree agrees with the low

107
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:29,759
degree polinomial in many

108
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,759
places yeah

109
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,400
exactly exactly let's check on some

110
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,440
random let's do a random sample the way

111
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,280
it's done the way it's done so there are

112
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:43,000
many low degree tests out there by the

113
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:46,319
way uh but one kind of common one is the

114
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,319
following I'm going to take a random

115
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:53,319
line in F to the

116
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:55,400
m and I'm going to check like I'm going

117
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:59,759
to ask open this random

118
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:01,360
line now this random line should be of

119
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:05,160
degree

120
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,240
M times H minus one that's what it

121
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,400
should

122
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:12,120
be I'm G to check that that's the degree

123
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:14,400
if it's not the degree I reject then

124
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:17,919
you're immediately

125
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:20,000
rejected okay so now what I know is that

126
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:24,199
in a random

127
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,199
line you agree with the low degree

128
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,840
polinomial okay because otherwise you're

129
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:31,840
rejected now one needs to argue that

130
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,000
because you agree on a random line with

131
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,280
a low degree polinomial why does that

132
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,120
mean that you're actually close to a low

133
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,319
degree polinomial all all

134
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,000
around okay but this is the test this is

135
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,160
really one of the low degree tests

136
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,400
that's out there you the verifier choose

137
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,080
so this is sitting in the PCP the

138
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:52,520
verifier will choose a random line and

139
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:56,560
he will test uh he can even test like M

140
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:59,759
* H random point on this line uh you

141
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,879
know he'll take M times or you can test

142
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,960
this plus one it doesn't really matter

143
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:05,360
uh depending on how you know soundness

144
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:09,199
you want but you can even take this plus

145
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:12,400
one this defines a you know this defines

146
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:14,000
uh polinomial of low degree of of this

147
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,319
of this degree and now you check that

148
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,599
the additional Point agrees with

149
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:21,240
it or if you want you can ask the entire

150
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:23,440
f f is only anyway only poly log s bit

151
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:26,599
so you can just read the entire thing

152
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,080
and see that it you by interpolation

153
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:31,360
that it's a low degree polinomial and if

154
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:34,520
it's not you reject

155
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,800
okay and then one needs to check though

156
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:40,479
okay so a random line agrees with a low

157
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:42,120
degree polinomial why does it imply that

158
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:47,240
everything agrees with the lowre

159
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:51,000
polinomial that's uh leap or with high

160
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:52,720
probability okay so we're g to I have a

161
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,680
good homework problem around that so

162
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:59,560
let's uh let's leave that alone a I have

163
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:02,599
a lot of this this a I have a lot of

164
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:05,319
good homework problems today a which is

165
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:08,319
nice because it summarizes the all the

166
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:11,479
information theory part of of the class

167
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:13,680
um okay any any questions before before

168
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:13,680
we

169
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:19,960
proceed yeah so is there some argument

170
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:23,159
here that if the Pol is low degree that

171
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:26,840
corresponds some witness in in this like

172
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:29,000
PCP um yeah so okay so if the argument

173
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:32,120
if you can argue that this this is close

174
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,440
to to low degree then take the actual

175
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:37,519
low degree that it's close to okay now

176
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:40,880
this defines a witness Oh by

177
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,760
by and and yeah now yeah now this is

178
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,760
going to be the witness that you

179
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:49,640
violated on exactly

180
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:51,399
exactly great so a okay so yeah oh I

181
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:54,399
feel like we don't really need to like

182
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:57,800
do a l layer circuit because if three

183
00:08:54,399 --> 00:09:00,320
side it's like an gigantic end of

184
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:03,000
several like three

185
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,920
uhhuh bra sing and you can just do a

186
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,959
single to do this to to to to do the and

187
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,800
you're sing yes some kind of because we

188
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,760
don't need to like

189
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,560
okay yeah yeah yeah so what you're

190
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:17,200
saying is what you're saying look there

191
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,320
may be ways to do optimizations here

192
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,000
what I the way I showed you is very kind

193
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:26,200
of generic it said well you

194
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,760
know this is low depths H you no saying

195
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,399
wait it's not just low depth look it's a

196
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:33,360
very specific circuit it's one big end

197
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:35,800
with three ores and you know maybe you

198
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,440
can do it much better so let me say

199
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:40,800
you're 100% correct there's a lot of

200
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,720
optimizations on gkr I kind of showed

201
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,480
you the just kind of a feasibility

202
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,120
result but as I said these things are

203
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:50,120
used and they're not used as I as I

204
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,000
showed it uh because they optimized so

205
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,640
there's a lot of optimizations that they

206
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,120
do in a lot on the circuit level as as

207
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,519
you say like what's the best way to

208
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,399
arithmetization

209
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,519
we don't want to just maybe open it to

210
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:05,279
just random like degree 2 degree two

211
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,240
degree two maybe we don't want to do

212
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:10,399
exactly the gold maybe we want to do

213
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:13,240
something else that how to generate the

214
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:15,200
circuit to make it the most efficient

215
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:18,279
possible there's a lot of optimization

216
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,800
and on that part um so yeah I I showed

217
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:22,160
you and as I said today you can use

218
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:24,240
actually GK to be like the GK protocol

219
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,760
can be linear time prover they managed

220
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,440
to get to actually I don't actually I

221
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:31,560
know how they got to poly to quasi

222
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,560
linear the linear is actually new work

223
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:36,000
that I didn't yet have time to dive into

224
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:37,920
but apparently they have really nice uh

225
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,959
optimization that they use and most of

226
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:43,120
them I think is exactly on the circuit

227
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:48,160
level around ideas that you

228
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:49,639
mention a great so uh any any other

229
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,800
questions you have you guys have great

230
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:54,000
great questions so this

231
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:56,519
fantastic okay so I want to say a few

232
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,200
things that I didn't talk about maybe

233
00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:00,560
they'll show up in the in in the

234
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:03,240
homework maybe not but I and it's

235
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:07,360
related to to questions that people

236
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:08,200
asked that Leo asked and others so first

237
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,040
of

238
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:14,320
all you know I said I I showed poly

239
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:17,000
login I said we can go all the way down

240
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,040
to three okay let me just mention three

241
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,160
is the best we can do we can we cannot

242
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,399
go below three okay uh from poly login

243
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:27,519
you can do kind of log Logan using

244
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,360
recursion you can do kind of PCP on the

245
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:32,120
poly login queries you can kind of Rec

246
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,040
first and then from a log log n to three

247
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:36,480
you can do kind of there these

248
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:38,440
exponential size proofs but to take a

249
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,120
log log n and make it exponent there's

250
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:42,240
like exponential size PCP with only

251
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:44,440
three queries so you apply kind of an

252
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:47,200
exponential size PCP to this log log n

253
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:50,279
size PCP they have all these cool

254
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:54,519
tricks uh and they manage to get to

255
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:57,639
three three bits okay three bits can you

256
00:11:54,519 --> 00:12:00,079
go to two bits no yeah is that only for

257
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:02,160
sound as half like if if no any constant

258
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:04,639
soundness no what about for like

259
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:08,240
negligible sound

260
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:12,000
ah yeah no I constant soundness okay

261
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:15,600
constant soundness yeah for constant

262
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,079
soundness you can't we can get three the

263
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,800
con actually I think is better than half

264
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:24,639
but whatever uh but uh you can get three

265
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:27,680
and can you get constant sounds for two

266
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:30,880
no and no I think you just can't the

267
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,800
point so I don't want to get I I I yeah

268
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,920
I don't want to get and can you get one

269
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:39,839
definitely not how so can you get two no

270
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:42,639
however you can get two if you make each

271
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:45,360
the answer to each query like a block so

272
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:47,639
if you want two queries where each query

273
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,199
gives you an answer a bit you cannot

274
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:51,920
have PCP and the reason actually you

275
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:55,519
could intuitively the reason you cannot

276
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:58,880
have a PCP is because like because two s

277
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:02,680
is easy if you have only two query two

278
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,920
kind of queries intuitively the reason

279
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,920
why it's because too sad it's easy I

280
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,680
don't want to go into it maybe it's

281
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:11,240
going be homework so let's leave that

282
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:13,360
but you can have what you can have and

283
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:16,320
we do have it's not just theoretic like

284
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:20,160
we do have pcps that have only two

285
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:22,079
queries but the answers are large not

286
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,120
not I mean okay you can have one query

287
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:26,800
if the answer is aside the witness okay

288
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:30,760
that's easy but we can have two queries

289
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:34,680
where the size of each answer is polylog

290
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:37,320
okay but not one or constant for all I

291
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:39,639
know so maybe we'll do some homework

292
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:41,320
kind of to get you know intuitions

293
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:44,920
around these things yeah actually I

294
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:47,399
think do have like two B if we like

295
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:50,120
allow to have like imperfect

296
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:51,360
completeness you have oh if you allow to

297
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,920
have imperfect

298
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,639
completeness then a you're right the

299
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:59,120
situ sorry everything I'm saying is for

300
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:02,680
perfect completeness once you allowed to

301
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,680
reduce completeness to 1 minus

302
00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:09,600
Epsilon things change so what do we know

303
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:12,480
um

304
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,160
with yeah with two if you have yeah I'm

305
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,560
not I don't remember off from top of my

306
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:20,279
head what two but what's the soundness

307
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:24,120
two queries constant soundness two bit

308
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:25,680
two 1/3 two3 okay okay con yeah yeah

309
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,399
yeah yeah okay yeah you're right so here

310
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,480
I'm assuming yeah you're right yeah good

311
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:32,360
point thank you yeah so if if you're

312
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:35,839
willing to relax completeness we can get

313
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:39,360
to but perfect completeness you can't

314
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:40,600
yeah thank like and you like two blocks

315
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,000
it's possible are you talking about

316
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:45,320
contigous bits blocks yeah so yeah think

317
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,160
think about it each query you read so

318
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:51,320
the PCP consists of like instead of bit

319
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:53,560
bit bit think about it like a word a

320
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:55,639
word a word a word and each word is like

321
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:57,600
polog and bits for example and now you

322
00:14:55,639 --> 00:15:01,680
can read only two words so because I

323
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,680
want to word read Word I am more

324
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,160
J yeah

325
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:13,680
yes okay good no so good good good

326
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,240
question so the question is now do we

327
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,040
have perfect completeness and the answer

328
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,399
is yes because if you're honest if

329
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,360
perfect competance means if you're

330
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:22,759
honest you'll be accepted with

331
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:25,639
probability one so if you're honest you

332
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:28,000
are going to give W Tilda which is the

333
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:29,959
the low degree extension of your witness

334
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,600
and when I take a random line it's going

335
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:33,959
to be of low degree for sure everything

336
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:37,120
is low degree if you're if you're

337
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:39,560
malicious then so

338
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,399
sound the soundness exactly that you

339
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:43,040
lose you're right good point what what

340
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:44,560
you mentioned is you say because we do

341
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,120
the L degree we lose a little bit in the

342
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,440
soundness because you know maybe you're

343
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,959
a little malicious and we don't catch

344
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:53,160
you or you know and that goes yeah so

345
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:54,600
you'll need to make you'll need to make

346
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,680
the sound a little bigger so that you

347
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,720
can eat up what you lose a little bit in

348
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:01,079
the low degree yeah yeah great question

349
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:05,279
yeah when you repeat the prot

350
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:07,560
bring the same Che yeah yeah yeah good

351
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:09,000
so the question is when you repeat so

352
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:11,240
let's say you're not happy I you know we

353
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,199
have soundless half we're not happy what

354
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:16,000
do you do you need to actually repeat

355
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:19,199
the entire PCP or no you don't because

356
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,199
uh like why the the Prov will just give

357
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,519
you the same PCP over and over so no you

358
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:26,040
keep the same PCP all you do is you run

359
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:29,399
the r the verifier the PCP verifier

360
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:30,639
fresh with fresh Randomness more times

361
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:32,600
so if you have soundness half and you

362
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:36,440
want to have soundless 1 over two to the

363
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:38,920
K what you do is you run the PCP

364
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:41,120
verifier K times so he generates one set

365
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:43,240
of queries you run him fresh again

366
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,000
another set of queries fresh again each

367
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:47,759
time he's going to be rejecting

368
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,800
probability half independently of the

369
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:53,440
other time so you'll just get like uh

370
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:57,360
you know that is rejected he's accepted

371
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:59,519
probability one over uh 2 to the K yeah

372
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,319
so just the verifiers it needs to repeat

373
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:05,439
the prover is not involved in this great

374
00:17:02,319 --> 00:17:09,039
great question guys any any other

375
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:13,520
questions what's the reference with this

376
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:16,640
thing I can put it I can put it in the

377
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:20,640
in yeah and I can put it in the in

378
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:24,839
canvas in the website a okay if I don't

379
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:26,919
remember remind me okay so um before we

380
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:29,240
move to crypto I just want to wrap up

381
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:33,440
kind of the information theory part and

382
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:36,440
say that in some sense I taught you

383
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,520
almost like okay so what what's missing

384
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:40,320
what did I what did you not get a chance

385
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:42,280
to see you didn't get a chance to see

386
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,799
the three query okay so you didn't get a

387
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,840
chance to see the recursion and the

388
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:49,760
Hadar and this nice way to get to

389
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:54,039
getting three pcps um there's another

390
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:57,520
beautiful beautiful result uh by uh Ryan

391
00:17:54,039 --> 00:18:02,720
gold and Roth Bloom and Roth Bloom from

392
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,720
20 18 18 16

393
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:10,840
yeah yeah okay well started in 16 uh and

394
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:12,679
since then there's work uh but

395
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:15,320
essentially here's the question this is

396
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:18,799
kind of a question that's still missing

397
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:23,240
um and here here's the question the

398
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:25,440
question is um you know we have

399
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,559
efficient doubly efficient protocol for

400
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,120
bounded

401
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:32,559
depth do can we construct doubly

402
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:35,360
efficient protocol for bounded space now

403
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:37,480
look we know that we cannot hope to have

404
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:40,360
doubly efficient or not dou efficient

405
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:44,000
for that matter for more than P space

406
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:45,679
like we know that IP equals P space so

407
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,919
you know that's you can't have

408
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:51,400
interactive proof of be the pro

409
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:54,559
efficient or not efficient for more than

410
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:56,400
P space okay so we're stuck with P space

411
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:58,360
now you can exchange you can go from

412
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,960
depth to space actually there's a way to

413
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:03,240
convert depth to space and vice versa

414
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:06,159
but it doesn't preserve efficiency so

415
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:08,039
you can go from bounded depth to bounded

416
00:19:06,159 --> 00:19:10,120
space now you must go because I showed

417
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:12,640
you a double bounded space if it

418
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,840
required more than poly space some

419
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,559
something in the world would go wrong

420
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,840
because we know IP equals P

421
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:21,799
space so the point is we do know we can

422
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:24,400
we can convert a bounded depth

423
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:27,840
computation to bounded space

424
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:30,480
computation but these this conversion

425
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:32,799
doesn't respect the efficiency of the

426
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,600
circuit so if you take a double A

427
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:37,320
bounded depth circuit and convert it to

428
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:39,720
a d to a bounded space circuit the

429
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:41,480
bounded space circuit or bounded space

430
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:44,080
computation I should say the bounded

431
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:46,840
space computation now will just be very

432
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,840
very long even if the bounded space the

433
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:50,600
bounded depth circuit let's say was only

434
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:53,640
size s

435
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,760
polinomial the bounded space computation

436
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,880
can be

437
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:58,880
exponential okay so it doesn't it

438
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,159
doesn't respect kind of the efficiency

439
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,919
of the computation when you do the

440
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:05,200
transition from bounded depth to bounded

441
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:07,640
space or vice versa so now there's a

442
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,280
question can you do let's say you have a

443
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:11,440
bounded space computation not a bounded

444
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:14,000
depth yeah you can convert a bounded

445
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:17,360
depth and pay a price but you don't want

446
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,200
to can you do a doubly eff can you do an

447
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:22,120
abounded space computation make it

448
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:25,520
doubly

449
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:29,120
efficient okay so here is kind of a

450
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:31,600
goal and those who who've been working

451
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:36,080
with me for a while may be traumatized

452
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,080
by this goal because I tormented

453
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:42,360
them I think this is one of the most

454
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:44,120
interesting problems out there it's

455
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,799
really frustrating to me that there's no

456
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:49,280
solution I'll give you an incentive in a

457
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:49,280
second but here's

458
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:56,520
the okay so here's my question if you

459
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:59,640
have

460
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:01,320
any time t

461
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:04,320
space

462
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,320
s

463
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:11,360
computation uh T of n s of

464
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,360
n here's the goal

465
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,799
goal we want an interactive

466
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:22,600
proof such

467
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:27,679
that prover

468
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:27,679
runtime is efficient poly t

469
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:34,360
we want verifier run time or let's start

470
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,600
okay verify run

471
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:39,640
time well the poor guy has to read the

472
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:42,000
input length so you know

473
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,720
X Plus times you know I'll be I'll be

474
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,960
nice with you times whatever it can be

475
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:48,600
even poly um I'm happy even with ply if

476
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:53,120
you want to put ply here I'll be

477
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:55,960
generous times ply and the

478
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:57,600
space not depending on T so he should

479
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:59,640
run it he can read the input and run

480
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,120
time the space

481
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:03,520
and usually we want the complex the

482
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:06,360
communication complexity to grow only

483
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,559
like poly space but if you want to put X

484
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:13,000
in there fine be my

485
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:15,360
guest this is what we want this is open

486
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,960
so we want a douly efficient interactive

487
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:21,640
proof for p space let me tell you what

488
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:25,640
Ryan golden the r Blom brothers did they

489
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:29,360
almost did this but here's this annoying

490
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:33,440
part the verifier run time

491
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:38,520
and the communication complexity is s

492
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:40,760
great but times t to the

493
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:42,279
Epsilon and this Epsilon has to be a

494
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:45,880
constant because the communication

495
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:47,600
complexity grows with like two to the

496
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,200
something oh till I think one over

497
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,640
Epsilon or something like that so

498
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,720
there's exponential growth in in in

499
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:58,960
epsilon so you can take you can maybe

500
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:02,799
take Epson like H one over log log or

501
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:05,480
log log log like log log log n over log

502
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:07,320
one over log log n think of it as

503
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:09,559
constant you don't really gain by trying

504
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:11,720
subc constant it's not giving you much

505
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:13,640
so they present their result as EPS

506
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:15,279
being a constant so this is really

507
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,760
annoying because now the verifier if T

508
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:19,440
is polinomial is super polinomial the

509
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:21,679
verify is not even efficient so this is

510
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,919
really for p

511
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,720
actually I want to get rid of this and

512
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:29,120
do for a big

513
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:32,400
T okay this is still an open question

514
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:35,480
okay now I need now okay I'm begging you

515
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:38,720
guys a plea for the smart all you smart

516
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:41,200
MIT students or Harvard or at bu nor

517
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:44,000
Eastern whoever you are this is a

518
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,400
personal favor can someone please solve

519
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:51,120
this and I know I need to give you guys

520
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:56,520
incentive so beyond probably you know a

521
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:56,520
a I don't know like a ACM PhD award or

522
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:01,760
whatever that's nothing but I'm willing

523
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:05,559
to give you a $500

524
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:06,919
prize okay so you're you're out biding

525
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:09,320
the

526
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:10,799
not we know didn't give a prize on this

527
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:14,000
right he gave like an FH Prize or

528
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:17,000
something but it was like

529
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
$15

530
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:23,960
okay okay so this you get rid of the tea

531
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,799
do this you can take pictures so you can

532
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:30,880
actually work on this please

533
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:33,360
okay let's uh um move on okay so this

534
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,720
essentially concludes the unit on

535
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,799
information Theory okay there's another

536
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:39,399
proof system that I didn't talk about

537
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:42,039
which is a multi- prooof interractive

538
00:24:39,399 --> 00:24:43,320
proofs uh the reason I didn't talk about

539
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:44,760
them is because they're really

540
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:47,000
equivalent the probabilistically

541
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:49,360
checkable proofs they're not much

542
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,120
different maybe I'll put something along

543
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,200
these lines in the homework I don't know

544
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,320
I need to think about it but uh that's

545
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,520
another thing we did not cover but

546
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:59,000
they're really an equivalent thing to to

547
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,480
PCP so

548
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,039
but it's another proof model that was

549
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:06,480
considered in the

550
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:08,320
literature okay so that concludes a

551
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,039
information Theory so that's all we know

552
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:14,640
we're stuck with P space uh actually we

553
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:16,880
don't even and okay and uh and we can

554
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,440
get like a very efficient verification

555
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,440
but then we have a very long proof like

556
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:23,440
the PCP you can verify things super

557
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:25,399
efficiently like uh fantastic but you

558
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,840
need to write somewhere this

559
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:30,960
gigantic uh PCP proof okay that the PCP

560
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:32,799
and note it's very important it's very

561
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,679
important that the

562
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:37,600
verifier like has that that this PCP is

563
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:39,480
written if the PCP is not written

564
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,399
somewhere and he's talking with theover

565
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:43,200
and tell him look you know I know you

566
00:25:41,399 --> 00:25:45,440
have a PCP written there somewhere can

567
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:48,120
you give me locations IJ and K a

568
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:51,399
cheating po will choose the locations

569
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:54,120
based on I and K and then for you know

570
00:25:51,399 --> 00:25:56,480
JK he'll put in location I zero and

571
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:59,679
maybe for I and J Prime K Prime he'll

572
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:02,399
then put location i1 and cheat so it's

573
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:04,840
very important that the PCP is written

574
00:26:02,399 --> 00:26:06,360
and now when you ask query I it's what's

575
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:09,559
written there it can't depend answer

576
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:12,039
cannot depend on query J or query K so

577
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:13,840
it's so it seems like it's very nice

578
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:15,320
model it's fantastic but where's this

579
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:18,720
huge thing going to be

580
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:20,559
written okay so uh like if we want at

581
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,480
the end of the day what here's our goal

582
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:26,799
really what what we're after really is

583
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:29,760
to take an actual proof like a witness

584
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:32,600
and drink it okay it's big I don't like

585
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:35,039
big shink make it small here now it's

586
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:37,039
smaller now of course we can't do it

587
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:38,520
right so like can't do it so now we

588
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:41,640
start changing them out say okay you

589
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:45,000
know what let's try interactive you know

590
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:48,480
what let's try PCP you know all these

591
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:51,039
are very nice but they all have really

592
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,799
strong problems okay like the

593
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:55,279
interactive proof one it's very very

594
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:57,200
specific it's an interactive proof I you

595
00:26:55,279 --> 00:27:00,120
know I can talk to Tina I can talk to Su

596
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,919
I can talk to but it's it's um it's per

597
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,600
person what if I want to give a proof to

598
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,039
the

599
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:08,760
world how I can do an interactive proof

600
00:27:06,039 --> 00:27:11,600
I want to post some on my

601
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:13,679
proof okay now I can do PCP I can post

602
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,039
that but it's really big so if I want to

603
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:19,120
make it sucin I

604
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:21,840
can't so I want to be able again my goal

605
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:23,399
to take a proof and just drink it and

606
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,559
put it

607
00:27:23,399 --> 00:27:29,240
somewhere now of course you're like okay

608
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:32,279
it's nice you know

609
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:34,520
it's good that you have desires well you

610
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:36,440
know it's good that you want but

611
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:38,559
actually what's really interesting is

612
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:40,799
that using the magic of cryptography we

613
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:42,559
can get these things so now what I'm

614
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:45,279
going to do next is we're going to dive

615
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:48,600
into the world of cryptography and see

616
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:50,080
how we can use cryptography to get like

617
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,480
uh towards kind of these suin

618
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:56,480
noninteractive proofs

619
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,480
Okay so

620
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:08,679
okay so let's start so the first way

621
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:12,000
we're going to change the proof model is

622
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:14,960
to say to consider what we call

623
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:18,600
computationally sound proofs also known

624
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:22,159
in the literature as arguments so let me

625
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:23,559
explain so instead of talking about

626
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,039
statistical proofs which is what we

627
00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:28,039
talked about so far we're going to think

628
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:28,039
about

629
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:35,840
computationally

630
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,840
sound

631
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:43,519
proofs okay so what is a computationally

632
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:45,760
sound proof it's a proof that has much

633
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:48,480
weaker guarantee soundness guarantees

634
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,880
than the standard one so it's it's the

635
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,519
completeness is the same it's a pro you

636
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:54,760
want to prove if you have if something

637
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:59,440
is true you succeed but that soundness

638
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:59,440
proof so this is also called an argument

639
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:04,919
so the

640
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:07,640
difference between a actual proof and an

641
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:09,559
argument is in soundness that's the only

642
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,880
different it's the soundness condition

643
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:14,480
so let me just tell you what the

644
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:17,919
soundness condition is here so the comp

645
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,919
it's a computational soundness

646
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:30,360
condition and what it says

647
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:33,159
is that so let's say for let's let's say

648
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:33,159
for some linguage

649
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:46,080
Al what it says is that for

650
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,080
any computationally

651
00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:50,519
bounded only if the approver is

652
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:56,320
bounded okay if you know that the

653
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:59,399
approver is bound resources are bounded

654
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:01,720
it's run it's runtime comput it's it's

655
00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:04,600
computationally bounded runtime so only

656
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:08,640
for a prover that's runtime is

657
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:11,519
bounded and for every X not in the

658
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:16,039
language the

659
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:18,080
probability that P star and V and X that

660
00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:21,960
the verifier

661
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:23,919
accepts is small okay let's say negl

662
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:26,600
Okay smaller than half

663
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:30,399
whatever usually usually in this in the

664
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:32,519
language of arguments we convert we

665
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:33,919
convert this constant to negligible and

666
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:36,960
non- negligible we'll talk about that in

667
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:38,519
a minute but we now we say you know what

668
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,760
how do we get around all these negative

669
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:44,519
results so the idea we say you know what

670
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:48,760
actually why do we care that there

671
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:51,840
exists a time two to the Thousand Prov

672
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:53,960
that can cheat nobody can run in that

673
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:58,000
time okay there's not enough molecules

674
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:59,399
in the universe like there's no so so

675
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,279
these things are they don't exist so why

676
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:05,559
do we care let's only consider provs

677
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:07,639
that run in Bound in time now you say

678
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:09,639
what is bounded we'll talk about that is

679
00:31:07,639 --> 00:31:12,799
bounded what there's an input length n

680
00:31:09,639 --> 00:31:15,760
is n and and Cubed two n well it's the

681
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:18,360
bound so yeah we each we'll talk how we

682
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:21,960
bound it but the first idea let's bound

683
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:24,720
his runtime let's consider aover that is

684
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:27,000
runtime we know is bounded now let's try

685
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,880
to to argue s this only against such

686
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,039
provs

687
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,480
okay so you take the bound to be

688
00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:34,279
something that you believe is realistic

689
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:37,519
you know yes do we have distribution

690
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:39,159
over X or no for any ex so yeah so the

691
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,320
question is this distribu no I want I

692
00:31:39,159 --> 00:31:42,760
still want to say look I don't even want

693
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:45,679
to I don't want to say that you can

694
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:47,559
cheat on any ex so I still want look I

695
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:49,120
want I want the same guarantee I want to

696
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:51,039
have the same sound guarantee say look

697
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:53,799
nobody can convince you of any false

698
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:58,159
statement but couldn't your just like

699
00:31:53,799 --> 00:32:00,720
memorize the proof of like some easy

700
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:03,000
okay okay think okay good good good I

701
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,799
right so you're saying wait where what

702
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,799
do you mean if if you have an act you

703
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:11,080
take a proof and you put it there let's

704
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:13,120
I'm defining here com yeah so okay so

705
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:15,440
you can't have the what you're saying is

706
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,200
you can't have this non-interactive

707
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,240
you're saying if you want a

708
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:20,399
non-interactive proof this is impossible

709
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:23,519
even computationally why I'm a cheating

710
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:25,440
prover I'm going to have one bad x x not

711
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:27,440
the language I'm going to hardwire one

712
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,919
bad proof because we assume it exists it

713
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:32,000
just hard to fine fine it's one so I can

714
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:34,159
kind of think of a non-uniform model

715
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,480
it's I'm going to hardwired it hardwire

716
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:39,159
it and now I'm going to give it you're

717
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:41,159
right we do not have

718
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:42,960
non-interactive proofs uh

719
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:46,039
computationally sound proofs but we

720
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:49,559
almost do almost so we'll talk about

721
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:53,159
what I mean by almost yes that one

722
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:55,559
V yeah exactly we okay so I I'll jump

723
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:57,320
I'll jump ahead and say the way we have

724
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:59,200
it is we assume some common random

725
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:01,279
string some common reference let's say

726
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,919
we all agree like there's some hash

727
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:05,240
function and we're going to use this

728
00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:07,840
hash function when we can talk the

729
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:09,960
proofs and now we're going to argue the

730
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:13,120
only way you can cheat is by breaking

731
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:16,919
this function so there we are going to

732
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:19,159
at the end get the exactly what we want

733
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:20,840
so this is kind of jumping ahead we will

734
00:33:19,159 --> 00:33:23,960
actually be able to construct these

735
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:26,039
succinct proofs okay and

736
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,960
non-interactive however we assume that

737
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:30,240
both the verifier and the pro kind of

738
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:32,600
agree on some common reference string

739
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,480
that both agree it's it's Universal

740
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:37,080
doesn't depend on X like it's a has

741
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:39,519
function and we all agree it's ch to 56

742
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:41,159
whatever any any kind of for those who

743
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,360
do cryptography and are familiar with

744
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:43,960
these kind of off the-shelf hash

745
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:45,159
functions for those who don't don't

746
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:47,039
worry whatever we agree on some

747
00:33:45,159 --> 00:33:50,000
reference string and now we're going to

748
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:52,000
argue that if a cheating prover can come

749
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,639
up with X not in the language and a

750
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:59,039
false proof it means he broke something

751
00:33:54,639 --> 00:34:03,120
about about the common reference string

752
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:04,799
so this kind of the idea is why so I I

753
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,159
already said it actually but when you

754
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:08,320
first think about it you want to say

755
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:11,359
look I want to get

756
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:13,359
around these imp like the fact that IP

757
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:16,000
is only P space all these kind of

758
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:18,280
barriers I want to be able to consu the

759
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,720
suing proofs now we know we can't so we

760
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:22,599
need to change the model and one way we

761
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:25,000
say you know let's let's consider

762
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:26,520
bounded provs why not let's assume I

763
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,480
approver runs in time less than two to

764
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:31,839
the 500 what anybody object is there any

765
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:34,040
pro the r time more than 2 to 500 no so

766
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:36,359
fine what we didn't lose anything the

767
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:38,679
question is what did we gain is it

768
00:34:36,359 --> 00:34:41,480
easier okay we we said the pooper has to

769
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:44,520
run time most two to the 500 so what

770
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:46,480
like how do we use that and the reason

771
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:49,079
we use that the way we use that is using

772
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:51,159
cryptography now we can say our approver

773
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:52,879
cannot break a cryptographic assumption

774
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:54,240
so we add the cryptographic Assumption

775
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:58,599
to our proofs and we can assume that the

776
00:34:54,240 --> 00:35:01,560
pro can break it now who Like A Whole

777
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:02,440
New World opened up to us and which we

778
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:06,119
can

779
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:10,400
use okay so what I'm going to show you

780
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:11,599
next it's actually how a to use so

781
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,760
here's a

782
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:16,880
theorem I'm first going to show an

783
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:19,119
interactive protocol okay still

784
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:22,599
interactive but very strong so here's

785
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:29,480
what I'm going to show you this is a a a

786
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:31,190
a theorem due to a a Kilian and mikali

787
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:34,160
92 and

788
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:37,320
[Music]

789
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:39,160
'94 which were really the kind of

790
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:42,400
results that kind of laid the foundation

791
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:45,640
for this field a and what they showed is

792
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,640
the following they showed how to take

793
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:49,640
any

794
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:50,960
PCP and some little cryptographic tool

795
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:53,760
called the collagen resistant hash

796
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:56,960
function I'll Define what that is and

797
00:35:53,760 --> 00:36:00,800
take these two and construct a succinct

798
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:03,599
form message so not unattractive for

799
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:06,520
message argument so computationally

800
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:08,800
soundproof so essentially what they show

801
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:12,520
is give me this long PCP that can be

802
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:15,040
efficiently efficiently a checked I'm

803
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:18,560
going to use cryptography to kind of

804
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:21,319
shrink this PTP put it in a little

805
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:24,160
box send it to the

806
00:36:21,319 --> 00:36:25,920
verifier and then convince the verifier

807
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:28,480
that what in this box is an accepting

808
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:31,680
proof so the use

809
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:34,200
cryptography together with PCP to

810
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:37,200
construct with the

811
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,200
following

812
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:44,359
assuming Collision resistant hash

813
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:47,000
function I'll Define in a minute A

814
00:36:44,359 --> 00:36:47,000
cryptographic

815
00:36:53,560 --> 00:37:00,560
Primitive for any language in NP

816
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:04,200
there

817
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:04,200
exists a for

818
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:10,720
message argument

819
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:17,240
system okay now let me

820
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:20,319
Define the argument system more formally

821
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:22,599
because here was just kind of a bit and

822
00:37:20,319 --> 00:37:22,599
now

823
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:28,520
I'm okay so

824
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:37,440
when we talk about once we use

825
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:39,880
cryptography when cryptography comes

826
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:42,160
along then we use some cryptographic

827
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:44,640
Primitives and these cryptographic

828
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:47,280
Primitives have some security parameter

829
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:49,240
associate with them the security

830
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:54,240
parameter intuitively tells

831
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:58,079
you how much so when when I say like I

832
00:37:54,240 --> 00:38:01,160
want let's say a 100 bits

833
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:04,319
of security we usually in cryptography

834
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:05,839
essentially what we mean as aover that

835
00:38:04,319 --> 00:38:09,119
runs in time two to the 100 cannot break

836
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:11,079
the scheme or in time depends on the

837
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:13,880
security cannot break the scheme so

838
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:17,280
whereas statistically we say when we say

839
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:19,319
you know we want a I don't know security

840
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,960
Epsilon we say probability of breaking

841
00:38:19,319 --> 00:38:22,319
any you can have whatever power you want

842
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,720
but the probabilties

843
00:38:22,319 --> 00:38:26,920
Epsilon once we're in crypto land

844
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:29,800
usually the security talks about the

845
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:33,079
runtime like what is

846
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:35,240
the bound you you place on the approvers

847
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:37,319
runtime and usually we think of the

848
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:40,079
soundness is like negligible okay so

849
00:38:37,319 --> 00:38:42,319
negligible meaning smaller than any

850
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:44,880
polinomial I I'll I'll explain in more

851
00:38:42,319 --> 00:38:46,720
in more detail but so when we talk about

852
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,800
A cryptographic Primitive It's

853
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:51,200
associated with the security parameter

854
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,640
and we don't like uh in practice when

855
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,599
they write things they write usually

856
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:57,480
they just set security parameter to be

857
00:38:54,599 --> 00:39:00,839
128 bits 256 bits they said they set

858
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:03,000
number but here we're in complexity land

859
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:05,160
so where we have a parameter Lambda

860
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,200
that's the security parameter and we

861
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:08,640
keep it as a parameter in real world you

862
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,800
said you know the people said it to

863
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:13,160
their heart's desire uh but we're going

864
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:16,720
to think of it as a parameter here okay

865
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:19,200
so um okay so here's the guarantee uh

866
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:22,720
the so uh so

867
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:24,800
the okay so this four message argument

868
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:27,800
system let me start with a complexity

869
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,800
actually

870
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:34,040
the Prov run

871
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:44,079
time will be poly n the instance length

872
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,079
and Lambda security

873
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,839
parameter and V

874
00:39:55,640 --> 00:40:00,680
runtime is going to be only poing

875
00:39:58,319 --> 00:40:00,680
security

876
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:10,480
parameter and also in our case also in

877
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:10,480
uh the plus v PCP

878
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,960
runtime so of course he needs to read

879
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,720
the input and he needs to behave like a

880
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:19,520
PCP verifier but the PCP verifier is

881
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:21,280
very efficient the problem is the Oracle

882
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:23,119
so now there's no Oracle but his runtime

883
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:28,160
is like the runtime of the PCP

884
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:28,160
verifier okay so uh

885
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:32,240
which

886
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:35,400
uses some

887
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:37,680
PCP okay you can think of the PCP the

888
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:40,720
PCP I just showed you poly Logan poly

889
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:43,119
Logan okay so we use some PCP so that's

890
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:45,880
the complexity okay it's four messages

891
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:48,720
the Pro run time is efficient and like

892
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:50,640
prob of course and and the verifier is

893
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:53,000
very

894
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:57,480
efficient well he generates oh oh oh

895
00:40:53,000 --> 00:41:00,839
sorry p uh yeah okay sorry uh P given X

896
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:02,920
and W and the witness yeah thank you the

897
00:41:00,839 --> 00:41:04,040
prover is giving X and the witness in

898
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:06,480
the

899
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:09,599
language and he's going to be efficient

900
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:12,280
he's going to run in time and and

901
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:13,800
Lambda let me just mention okay I'll

902
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:16,960
mention that in a second actually okay

903
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,960
so the completeness is

904
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:27,800
one just says that uh for every X and D

905
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:27,800
X and L and Witness

906
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:35,280
W the

907
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:37,839
probability that P with witness W and V

908
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:39,040
both of them have X and security

909
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:40,720
parameter there's some security

910
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:43,359
parameter

911
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:46,480
involved the probability that verifier

912
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:48,640
outputs one is one so the verifier

913
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:50,200
always always accepts if you're honest

914
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:52,400
if the prover is honest he has a witness

915
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:54,119
corresponding to x with any security

916
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:58,040
parameter he

917
00:41:54,119 --> 00:42:01,240
accepts okay actually a

918
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:01,240
almost it's

919
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:15,160
assuming no it accepts no no no ifs in

920
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:15,160
buts okay what about the

921
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:22,200
Sis Sis

922
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:27,079
says that for

923
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:27,079
any P star of size

924
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:34,839
okay now you can say for instance if SI

925
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:34,839
poly Lambda poly in the security

926
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:40,839
parameter then you can say let's say

927
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:43,880
that for every X not in the

928
00:42:40,839 --> 00:42:46,079
language the

929
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:47,240
probability that P star now he doesn't

930
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:49,319
have a witness because it's not in the

931
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:52,280
language this is a cheater I want to say

932
00:42:49,319 --> 00:42:55,319
for any P star that tries to cheat but

933
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:58,319
he's bounded he's poly Lambda and for

934
00:42:55,319 --> 00:43:01,559
every X not the

935
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:01,559
language the

936
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:11,880
probability on X in Lambda that the

937
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:11,880
verifier outputs one is very small it's

938
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:18,760
negligible in Lambda and negligible in

939
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:22,200
Lambda is just a way to say it vanishes

940
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:24,599
faster than one over poly for any poly

941
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:28,640
okay this just

942
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:33,280
means that for any poly

943
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:38,680
P there exists some Lambda star such

944
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:38,680
that for any Lambda bigger than Lambda

945
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:46,359
star P

946
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:46,359
Lambda a the

947
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:54,119
negligible is smaller than 1 over P

948
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:57,960
Lambda so it vanishes faster than any

949
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:59,839
poly if you go above some constant

950
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:02,800
okay so the negligible Advantage is

951
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:04,280
quicker than one over poly for any poly

952
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,240
okay that's the definition of negligible

953
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:09,280
yeah just what size means so we're

954
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,280
assuming all these things are

955
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:13,680
circuits oh okay yeah yeah yeah okay

956
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:16,319
good good good good yeah we're thinking

957
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:18,040
of usually in cryptography we always

958
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:19,960
allow the adversary our adversaries to

959
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:22,599
be non-uniform because they may get

960
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:24,880
advice so usually we model them as

961
00:44:22,599 --> 00:44:27,960
polinomial size circuits this is opposed

962
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:30,599
to saying P star that runs in time

963
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:32,680
poly Lambda So when you say he has signs

964
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:34,359
poly Lambda it's just to say he has it's

965
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:36,960
another words say you know he can he

966
00:44:34,359 --> 00:44:39,559
runs in time po Lambda but he may have

967
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:41,760
like advice okay we allow him to have

968
00:44:39,559 --> 00:44:45,480
some kind of fixed advice that's why we

969
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:48,599
say size yeah great great question yes

970
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:53,680
but if Lambda is like less than the size

971
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:53,680
of X how do you even fit in the X

972
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:01,839
bit good okay so okay the problem is

973
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:04,599
actually yeah the problem is we don't

974
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:06,200
okay what you're saying is look uh so

975
00:45:04,599 --> 00:45:09,119
that's why I have my red pen coming up

976
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:10,760
my red chalk you're saying if x is

977
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:14,960
smaller than let's say Lambda to the

978
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:17,640
Epsilon if x is of size even we allow P

979
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:19,839
to be size poly so what you're saying

980
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:22,280
the function wow wait that's weird

981
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:25,040
you're not even allowing the if L is

982
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:27,680
smaller than x p star can't even read

983
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:28,920
X he can't even read it like it's run

984
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:33,119
time is less than

985
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:36,040
x true if X is bigger than po Lambda any

986
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:38,200
po Lambda that's first right because he

987
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:40,000
can run in any time we allow P star to

988
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:44,839
run in time any po

989
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:46,839
Lambda so X can be size any kind of if

990
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:48,559
you take a sequence of x's that are each

991
00:45:46,839 --> 00:45:51,240
of sides kind of for any Lambda if you

992
00:45:48,559 --> 00:45:53,800
have X BL so I'm a cheating improver and

993
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:55,720
for any Lambda I have like x sub Lambda

994
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:58,440
that I'm going to cheat on and as long

995
00:45:55,720 --> 00:46:00,880
as these x sub Lambda are at most Lambda

996
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:03,359
to the 100 I can I can run time lamb to

997
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:06,640
the 100 here this is Theory land so I

998
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:08,480
can do that but sometimes we want to

999
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:10,599
actually have communication complexity

1000
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:13,040
which is like poly

1001
00:46:10,599 --> 00:46:16,200
login so now the security property need

1002
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:19,200
to be poly Logan and now you can't even

1003
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:19,200
read

1004
00:46:19,319 --> 00:46:26,119
so SEC science the reason we WR I wrote

1005
00:46:23,079 --> 00:46:27,520
sience po Lambda is because this will

1006
00:46:26,119 --> 00:46:31,000
allow us

1007
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:34,359
to have so the communication grows polom

1008
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:36,839
with Lambda if I allow the the approver

1009
00:46:34,359 --> 00:46:41,440
to run at most poly Lambda it will allow

1010
00:46:36,839 --> 00:46:43,400
me to rely the the I I can assume that

1011
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:45,319
my cryptograph my cryptography whatever

1012
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:47,040
I use here Collision hash function or

1013
00:46:45,319 --> 00:46:49,119
oneway function whatever whatever

1014
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:51,079
cryptographic assumption I use the

1015
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:54,400
assumption is a

1016
00:46:51,079 --> 00:46:57,400
polinomial time a pomal size cheater

1017
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:58,880
cannot break it but I can you know let

1018
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:01,440
me strengthen the Assumption I'm going

1019
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,440
to say that

1020
00:47:02,359 --> 00:47:07,839
it so I'm goingon to say for every piece

1021
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:10,760
tar of size you know 2 to the Lambda to

1022
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:12,559
the O of one you know as long as you're

1023
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:15,280
inun time at most two to the Lambda to

1024
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:17,079
epon to plus some

1025
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:22,440
Epsilon you

1026
00:47:17,079 --> 00:47:28,040
can't you can't break now you know it's

1027
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:32,119
you X can be like a poly l in

1028
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:35,319
Lambda the thing is now I'm assuming

1029
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:37,280
that a p St that runs in time this

1030
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:38,480
cannot break my cryptography with

1031
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,559
security parameter Lambda it's a

1032
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,680
stronger

1033
00:47:39,559 --> 00:47:45,920
assumption so there's a delicate issue

1034
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:48,000
here with soundness which I glossed over

1035
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,280
in the definition above where I said

1036
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:53,240
computationally

1037
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:56,160
bounded what's the bound so again the

1038
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:59,040
reason these computationally sound

1039
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:01,359
proofs are useful is because then we can

1040
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:03,440
use cryptography so now we say let's use

1041
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:05,319
cryptography in our proof system when we

1042
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:08,760
use cryptography there's a security

1043
00:48:05,319 --> 00:48:11,240
parameter Lambda now typically we we

1044
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:12,920
assume that so now what do we we want to

1045
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:15,599
say our cryptography cannot be broken

1046
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:17,880
and therefore our scheme is secure okay

1047
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:19,599
cannot be broken in what time so

1048
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:21,240
typically we would like to say oh in

1049
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:22,760
time poly Lambda cannot be broken that's

1050
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,880
kind of our polinomial assumption that's

1051
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:26,800
kind of what we think of standard

1052
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:28,599
assumptions in cryptography that uh some

1053
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,640
assumption with security parameter

1054
00:48:28,599 --> 00:48:31,680
Lambda cannot be broken time po Lambda

1055
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,800
we call that a

1056
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:37,000
polinomial uh

1057
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:39,240
assumption this is what we want but then

1058
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,839
you're right to say well it's weird

1059
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:44,559
because then if you want to think of

1060
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:45,760
Lambda as being like Po log n you know

1061
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:47,839
if you want at the end of the day we

1062
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:50,160
want suing proofs so we let's say we

1063
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:52,760
have X of size n and suppose we want the

1064
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:56,799
suing to be like polog in like in

1065
00:48:52,760 --> 00:49:00,040
gkr so now Lambda needs to be a size

1066
00:48:56,799 --> 00:49:02,839
poog in in a sense so it's like wait the

1067
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:07,599
cheating po can't even read x what a

1068
00:49:02,839 --> 00:49:09,000
weird kind of uh so I'm I'm the honest

1069
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:10,880
prover runs in time more than the

1070
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:15,359
cheating prover that's

1071
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:17,440
bizarre so the the answer is okay so so

1072
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:20,079
the answer is look it

1073
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:23,640
depends how

1074
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:25,559
um it depends on how how much risk

1075
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:27,319
you're willing to take okay what do I

1076
00:49:25,559 --> 00:49:29,400
mean how much risk

1077
00:49:27,319 --> 00:49:32,480
if you want to say look I'm very very

1078
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:35,079
conservative I'm not willing to assume I

1079
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:37,760
I don't my trust in cryptography is very

1080
00:49:35,079 --> 00:49:39,559
limited and I'm only willing to assume

1081
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:42,440
if I use a Lambda bit of security I want

1082
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:44,000
to my assumption is that a PO Lambda

1083
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:45,720
cannot break it I don't want to assume

1084
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,720
that a two to the Lambda person cannot

1085
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:49,319
break it two to to no that maybe he can

1086
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:52,319
I don't trust that

1087
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:55,280
assumption that's all I'm willing to

1088
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:57,559
assume now but here's the thing that

1089
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:59,520
once you once you bounce the cheating

1090
00:49:57,559 --> 00:50:03,000
Pro to be poly Lambda essentially what

1091
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:04,480
we're saying is that in the world

1092
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,559
there's no way you can run time more

1093
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:09,520
than poly Lambda if you can then this

1094
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:11,400
has no meaning in a sense you know so

1095
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:13,760
now we're saying look in this world you

1096
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:16,440
can't run more than this time whatever

1097
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:18,280
it is this this otherwise this this

1098
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:20,799
computationally bounded is like a bit

1099
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:23,839
meaningless so if that all the time you

1100
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:25,920
can run in the xsr can't be bigger than

1101
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:28,160
that in a sense because nobody can run

1102
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:29,319
in that time nobody can read that X so

1103
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:31,240
essentially what you're saying is you're

1104
00:50:29,319 --> 00:50:33,240
saying look I'm telling you I want a

1105
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:35,440
cheating Pro that runs in time more at

1106
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:37,520
most to the 500 you're saying well what

1107
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:40,160
if there's an input of links two to the

1108
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:42,520
Thousand okay look whatever he still can

1109
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:43,920
run time when most two to the 500 the

1110
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:46,640
fact I'm not going to give him more

1111
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:48,359
runtime it's ridiculous you know I still

1112
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:51,559
want to say for every ex but I don't

1113
00:50:48,359 --> 00:50:54,000
want to give now the PO more runtime no

1114
00:50:51,559 --> 00:50:55,880
in this world provs run in time at most

1115
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,119
on security this is this is about the

1116
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:59,599
world about the SEC security of the

1117
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:03,240
world like I give a bound on what I

1118
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:04,640
think is a reasonable runtime of like

1119
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:07,680
real world

1120
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:10,280
adversaries nobody can run in more time

1121
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:11,880
okay now you're saying well uh you know

1122
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:14,559
it's weird you're giving him less time

1123
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:16,440
than what if you know for an X that that

1124
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:17,920
is size two to the Thousand that honest

1125
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:19,760
Prov well there is no honest Prov that

1126
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:22,880
will prove something of about X of size

1127
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:25,880
two to the Thousand like so it's so we

1128
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:28,319
anyway we bound and even if they're like

1129
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:30,240
xes that are bigger than this yeah our

1130
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:33,040
poor can't run in time bigger than this

1131
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:34,559
still our poor guy needs to prove

1132
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:36,799
something about act that he cannot even

1133
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:39,119
read fine the point is in our world

1134
00:51:36,799 --> 00:51:41,000
these are our adversaries that's how we

1135
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:43,000
should think of

1136
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:46,240
it

1137
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:48,680
okay yeah so the reason we're giving the

1138
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:50,079
honest like this extra po event is that

1139
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:52,440
we're assuming that they have to do

1140
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:55,119
something with the witness exactly so

1141
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:56,799
the the prover the honest prover of

1142
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:58,160
course he needs to read the witness

1143
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:59,359
essentially you know he needs to look at

1144
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:01,000
the input he needs to read the witness

1145
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:03,160
he'll need to generate a PCP or whatever

1146
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:05,359
he needs to do something so the honest

1147
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:07,960
Prov of course he needs to run in time

1148
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:09,920
that depends on X but the point is you

1149
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:12,200
should think okay what if honest pober

1150
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:14,440
works with X and that is a size two to

1151
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:16,839
the Thousand yeah but it doesn't exist

1152
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:19,160
it's a theory it's um mental experiment

1153
00:52:16,839 --> 00:52:21,200
you know we don't have these things but

1154
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:23,200
yeah he would run and now he saying our

1155
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:25,240
adversary no he can't run because our

1156
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:28,920
adversary don't have that power nor do

1157
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:30,599
our Hest Pro they don't exist for that

1158
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:33,000
sizes

1159
00:52:30,599 --> 00:52:36,599
yeah so like before when we were talking

1160
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:38,720
about the information thetic uh IPS and

1161
00:52:36,599 --> 00:52:40,599
the sound is I mentioned that as long as

1162
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:42,280
the sound is less than like a half or

1163
00:52:40,599 --> 00:52:45,119
something you can just repeat it over

1164
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:49,520
over you get better better yeah same app

1165
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:52,720
here good yes so um yes the same applies

1166
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:57,160
here so you can ask in a sense why are

1167
00:52:52,720 --> 00:53:00,359
we uh like why why is here so

1168
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:03,599
okay let me it's yes but uh we need to

1169
00:53:00,359 --> 00:53:03,599
be careful

1170
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:10,799
uh in in a inactive argument you can if

1171
00:53:08,359 --> 00:53:13,680
the sound is here is only half you can

1172
00:53:10,799 --> 00:53:16,559
reduce soundness by repetition

1173
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:17,720
exponentially however you will need to

1174
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:20,680
do it

1175
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:22,960
sequentially okay so you'll need to do

1176
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:25,200
one interactive protocol after the other

1177
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:29,319
after the other after the other actually

1178
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:31,520
it was uh a open question for a while

1179
00:53:29,319 --> 00:53:33,079
was if you have an interactive argument

1180
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:35,200
and you just because people don't like

1181
00:53:33,079 --> 00:53:37,359
people care about round complexity they

1182
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:39,480
don't like protocols that take gazillion

1183
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:41,640
rounds so they say well why don't you

1184
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:44,079
repeat interactive if you take an

1185
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:45,720
interactive proof and you repeat it in

1186
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:47,359
parallel many times with fresh

1187
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:48,440
Randomness everything fresh you know

1188
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:50,880
just independently but repeat in

1189
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:53,520
parallel The Sounds go down

1190
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:55,119
exponentially like you want now you can

1191
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:58,319
say does the same thing hold for

1192
00:53:55,119 --> 00:54:01,240
argument so this was actually an open

1193
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:03,760
problem for a while and then at some

1194
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:08,240
point it was a long time ago was was a

1195
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:10,280
post uh probably 16 15 years ago uh he

1196
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:13,839
actually gave an

1197
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:16,720
example of oh sorry no no no there was

1198
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:20,960
sorry so there was an example I'm

1199
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:22,920
messing up the the uh by mon Na and two

1200
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:26,520
other people I don't remember now they

1201
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:29,319
showed actually no there is an example

1202
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:31,119
of an interactive argument that if you

1203
00:54:29,319 --> 00:54:34,319
repeat it in parallel soundness doesn't

1204
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:36,480
go down at all so you have to repeat it

1205
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:39,359
sequentially okay so when you repeat

1206
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:42,640
interactive arguments in parallel the

1207
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:45,160
crypto doesn't work in parallel as like

1208
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:46,920
a a it's not really true it's like there

1209
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:49,960
are contrived examples where you can

1210
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:51,640
show that the crypto soundness doesn't

1211
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:54,079
reduce like you would hope and therefore

1212
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:55,280
the sounds doesn't go down now the

1213
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:57,920
examples that we have are pretty

1214
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:59,599
contrived okay okay it's not like but

1215
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,960
there's no definitely it's not true in

1216
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:02,599
general it's not true in general that if

1217
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:04,520
you take an interactive argument and you

1218
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:06,799
repeat it in parallel with fresh

1219
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:10,319
Randomness many times sound does not go

1220
00:55:06,799 --> 00:55:12,359
down even though if show that there's a

1221
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:14,000
way to repeat it in parallel but you

1222
00:55:12,359 --> 00:55:16,640
need to be a little clever don't just

1223
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:20,480
repeat he like a very weird trick he had

1224
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:21,200
of like with someity you abort the ver

1225
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:23,440
said you know what I don't want to

1226
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:25,200
continue in this let's just like just a

1227
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:26,079
weird abort he added a weird abort

1228
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,160
condition and then all of a sudden

1229
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:30,880
things

1230
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:33,280
kind of the sound is vanished

1231
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:35,000
so okay so I guess my answer to your

1232
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:37,000
question if you repeat it in

1233
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,680
sequentially yes air goes down

1234
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,760
exponentially exactly like we would hope

1235
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:43,640
it goes from like s to s to the K if you

1236
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:46,359
repeat it K times if you repeat it in

1237
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:49,280
parallel naively no and there counter

1238
00:55:46,359 --> 00:55:52,240
examples yet there are ways to repeat in

1239
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:55,280
parallel a little less naively with some

1240
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:58,760
abort kind of thing uh that then it does

1241
00:55:55,280 --> 00:56:01,839
go down so I guess the short answer it's

1242
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:04,200
complicated okay but okay great but

1243
00:56:01,839 --> 00:56:05,760
typically we just write uh negligible

1244
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:10,160
because of this issue it's like we like

1245
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:11,720
to just we you know um we like to write

1246
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:14,000
when we talk in cryptography usually

1247
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:18,359
write like one minus negligible or one

1248
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:18,359
for completeness and then negligible for

1249
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:26,640
soundness okay so this is uh this is uh

1250
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:30,079
the the theorem any questions about I I

1251
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:32,640
need to define the the a what the

1252
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:35,880
Collision resistant hash function is but

1253
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:39,280
um any questions before I

1254
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:41,440
Define okay so by the way just from just

1255
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:43,880
so I know who I'm talking to how many

1256
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:45,880
people know what a collision and hash

1257
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:49,359
function

1258
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:52,400
is okay a lot okay uh but it's not uh

1259
00:56:49,359 --> 00:56:57,799
it's actually not important uh and I'll

1260
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:57,799
I'll Define it in a minute uh

1261
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:08,799
okay so uh let me just

1262
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:08,799
Define so a collision

1263
00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:20,039
resistant hash

1264
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:21,680
family it's actually a family it's not a

1265
00:57:20,039 --> 00:57:26,839
function

1266
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:26,839
H consists of two algorithms

1267
00:57:32,039 --> 00:57:37,599
okay first is Gen gen is an algorithm

1268
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:41,520
that generates a key to the hasch

1269
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:44,400
function so gen takes his input so gen

1270
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:48,039
is a PPT propos polinomial time

1271
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:48,039
algorithm it takes as

1272
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:56,640
input one to the security parameter so

1273
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:59,520
in crypto we have this Hack That we

1274
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:01,319
assume our algorithms take as input one

1275
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:03,520
to the security parameter instead of

1276
00:58:01,319 --> 00:58:05,039
security parameter which is you know

1277
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:06,680
it's a bit like I feel like a moreon

1278
00:58:05,039 --> 00:58:08,000
sync one to the security parameter the

1279
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:08,880
only reason we write it this way is

1280
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,640
because we want to think of our

1281
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:14,720
algorithms efficient poly time and poly

1282
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:17,440
is in the input and all our algorithm

1283
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:19,319
run in time poing the security parameter

1284
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:21,240
so to say that our algorithm are

1285
00:58:19,319 --> 00:58:23,520
efficient our poly time we always write

1286
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:25,319
the security parameter in unary okay

1287
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:26,839
because that's the input so it's just

1288
00:58:25,319 --> 00:58:27,640
kind of a hack to to make the theory

1289
00:58:26,839 --> 00:58:32,079
kind

1290
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:34,240
of nice okay and it

1291
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:38,039
outputs a hash

1292
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:39,960
key so this hash is a size poly Lambda

1293
00:58:38,039 --> 00:58:42,000
yeah because this algorithm is

1294
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:44,440
polinomial takes input Lambda and unary

1295
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:47,440
lamb so it can outp put something

1296
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:48,720
only uh F size poly Lambda and then

1297
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:51,160
there's the eval

1298
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:56,119
algorithm and the eval algorithm takes

1299
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:56,119
as input it's a polytime algorithm

1300
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:00,240
that takes his

1301
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:09,799
input hash

1302
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:09,799
key and X any X in Zer one

1303
00:59:11,079 --> 00:59:16,880
star and it outputs you can also

1304
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:19,640
restrict you can restrict the X to be

1305
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:23,440
let's say you can restrict it but let's

1306
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:23,440
think of any input and

1307
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:33,400
outputs a value V in 01 to the

1308
00:59:30,599 --> 00:59:34,520
Lambda okay what's important the way has

1309
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:36,480
use what's important about hash

1310
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:38,640
functions is that they're shrinking so

1311
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:40,799
you can think if it takes an an input

1312
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:43,720
any X you can think that it takes as

1313
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:45,440
input like something of size two Lambda

1314
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:46,880
like Tak two Lambda to Lambda you can

1315
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:49,599
even think Lambda plus one to Lambda if

1316
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:51,880
you want but let's think of so there's

1317
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:55,680
many ways people Define it let's let me

1318
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:59,839
go with star like any input okay and now

1319
00:59:55,680 --> 01:00:04,520
the the security says that a polinomial

1320
00:59:59,839 --> 01:00:08,599
time or a poly size algorithm that is

1321
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:11,440
given a hash key should not be able to

1322
01:00:08,599 --> 01:00:15,799
find two different X's that hash to the

1323
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:18,799
same value that's the Assumption yeah

1324
01:00:15,799 --> 01:00:18,799
caned

1325
01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:23,480
whated okay it can be the the empty

1326
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:26,280
string but then there's no it won't be

1327
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:27,799
secure and I'll explain why so uh uh

1328
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:29,000
it's a good question it's a good

1329
01:00:27,799 --> 01:00:30,440
question the question do we really need

1330
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,799
the hash key or can we just make that

1331
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:36,440
empty I'll uh

1332
01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:39,240
so it's a the answer is a bit it's again

1333
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:40,640
it's a modeling answer but I'll get to

1334
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:42,640
it I'll I'll answer your question in a

1335
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:44,640
second let me just write the the

1336
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:48,079
security and then we'll talk about it

1337
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:50,280
because it is a great question um okay

1338
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:50,280
the

1339
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:57,400
security the Collision resistance

1340
01:00:53,359 --> 01:01:00,440
requirement says that for any any poly

1341
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:05,039
poly Lambda

1342
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:09,480
size adversary a the

1343
01:01:05,039 --> 01:01:11,680
probability that a given hash key where

1344
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:14,880
hash key is

1345
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:18,920
chosen by

1346
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:20,240
gen the probability that it outputs x

1347
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:22,440
and x

1348
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:26,960
Prime that such

1349
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:29,359
that X is different not the same and

1350
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:35,200
and

1351
01:01:29,359 --> 01:01:38,520
eval of hash key and X is equal to eval

1352
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:42,880
of hash key and X

1353
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:49,680
Prime is negligible so so for every poly

1354
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:49,680
size a there exists a negligible

1355
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:59,720
function mu such that for every Lambda

1356
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:59,720
the security

1357
01:02:04,119 --> 01:02:11,960
parameter so maybe I'll write it

1358
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:11,960
better for any poly

1359
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:18,119
size for any poly size a there exists

1360
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:22,200
some negative function so a function

1361
01:02:18,119 --> 01:02:26,000
that vanishes faster than any polinomial

1362
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:28,559
such that for any security parameter

1363
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:30,440
if you generate a hash key using the

1364
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:33,319
security parameter you give the

1365
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:36,000
adversity the hash key his goal is to

1366
01:02:33,319 --> 01:02:38,279
Output two different inputs that hash to

1367
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:44,000
the same value the probability that he

1368
01:02:38,279 --> 01:02:47,760
does this is at most negligible in

1369
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:48,960
Lambda so as Lambda grows big this

1370
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:52,440
becomes

1371
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:55,200
tiny yeah is a size

1372
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:59,359
po good yes exactly when I say poly size

1373
01:02:55,200 --> 01:03:01,599
I mean poly input so poly Lambda

1374
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:04,640
okay that's the

1375
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:06,920
definition now I want to first answer

1376
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:08,440
your question which is do we really need

1377
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:10,279
a hash key can we just tell him this is

1378
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:12,599
the security parameter like why do we

1379
01:03:10,279 --> 01:03:14,880
need a hash key and the answer is

1380
01:03:12,599 --> 01:03:18,640
actually we don't it's interesting we

1381
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:20,720
don't quite need a hash key and actually

1382
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:24,079
the hash functions we use in practice

1383
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:26,319
don't have a hash key in a sense well

1384
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:28,599
they're fixed I okay is a different

1385
01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:32,640
story but the reason the reason why we

1386
01:03:28,599 --> 01:03:35,160
have a hash key is we allow it's a a

1387
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:36,960
question of modeling who's our adversary

1388
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:39,599
what kind of adversaries are we thinking

1389
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:43,480
about if we think about adversaries that

1390
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:44,880
are poly size that are circuits or or

1391
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:46,240
chewing machines that have some

1392
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:48,920
non-uniform

1393
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:51,359
advice then you know what if the

1394
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:53,480
adversary just has in his belly somehow

1395
01:03:51,359 --> 01:03:55,000
someone gave him advice x and x Prime

1396
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:56,240
that are different and hash to the same

1397
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,200
value

1398
01:03:56,240 --> 01:04:00,079
like someone gave him two xes that has

1399
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:02,119
to the same value then he'll just spit

1400
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:04,200
it of course he has collisions yeah I

1401
01:04:02,119 --> 01:04:06,839
mean collisions Exist by pigal principle

1402
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:08,880
I mean it's huge it goes to a small

1403
01:04:06,839 --> 01:04:12,079
these exist we want to say they're hard

1404
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:13,760
to find but if we think of a nonuniform

1405
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:15,720
adversity that has advice he may have

1406
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:18,079
this as advice and then he'll output it

1407
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:20,720
so if we think of a non-uniform model

1408
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:23,000
then we have to have a hash key another

1409
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:26,520
option to think of a uniform model let's

1410
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:28,720
think of a not as poly poly time he's

1411
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:32,359
uniform then we don't need to have a

1412
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:34,760
hash key we just because we can assume

1413
01:04:32,359 --> 01:04:36,680
that small axes don't Collide because

1414
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:38,960
you know uh we'll just make the hash

1415
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:40,680
function so they won't Collide and then

1416
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:42,559
big ones you can't you can't hold in

1417
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:44,880
your belly because you're bounded you're

1418
01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:48,240
your your uniform you have only constant

1419
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:52,760
size kind of your constant Siz

1420
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:56,200
description so so actually there have

1421
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:58,359
been works in the literature uh in

1422
01:04:56,200 --> 01:05:01,799
the theoretical cryptography literature

1423
01:04:58,359 --> 01:05:04,359
they talk about hash functions with no

1424
01:05:01,799 --> 01:05:06,000
keys but then they need to talk about

1425
01:05:04,359 --> 01:05:08,480
uniform

1426
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:10,559
adversaries and that's this is something

1427
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:13,720
that that is considered and talked about

1428
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:15,920
but the most standard is to talk about

1429
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:18,240
non-uniform adversaries and then we need

1430
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:23,279
to have keys

1431
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:27,480
yeah okay any any

1432
01:05:23,279 --> 01:05:30,920
questions Okay so oh time's up in five

1433
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:34,760
minutes okay so um good so now what I

1434
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:36,960
want to do is I want to give you uh I I

1435
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:38,920
want to prove this theorem and I want to

1436
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:41,559
give you a construction of a hash

1437
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:44,200
function that we use now let me tell you

1438
01:05:41,559 --> 01:05:46,799
we actually we use a hash function with

1439
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:48,240
an additional property for this theorem

1440
01:05:46,799 --> 01:05:50,480
we use a hash function with additional

1441
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:53,559
property we don't need to assume it

1442
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:55,640
because we can construct it from a hash

1443
01:05:53,559 --> 01:05:57,000
function so that's why I didn't I didn't

1444
01:05:55,640 --> 01:06:00,119
write it as an assumption because I can

1445
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:02,640
construct it but really the Primitive we

1446
01:06:00,119 --> 01:06:05,160
need for the

1447
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:08,359
theorem is we want an

1448
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:10,960
additional uh we want a hash function

1449
01:06:08,359 --> 01:06:13,240
with what we call local opening what do

1450
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:16,160
we mean by local opening here a hash

1451
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:19,359
function we say look there's an eval

1452
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:21,680
that takes a hash key X output a value

1453
01:06:19,359 --> 01:06:23,640
now if you want to check you I'll give

1454
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:26,039
you let's say I hashed a value I told

1455
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:27,799
you here's V now you're saying okay I

1456
01:06:26,039 --> 01:06:30,000
want to know what you committed to fine

1457
01:06:27,799 --> 01:06:32,520
I can give you my X and you can what you

1458
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:34,400
hashed sorry uh what you which value you

1459
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:35,440
hashed I'm like no problem here's my a

1460
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:38,079
and you can

1461
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:39,839
check but what I really want for this

1462
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:42,039
theorem and it's something I want from

1463
01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:44,160
this is a common uh primitive that we

1464
01:06:42,039 --> 01:06:46,359
need in many applications is I want to

1465
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:49,079
say Okay I hashed I took a hash function

1466
01:06:46,359 --> 01:06:51,240
I hashed a value I don't know I I want

1467
01:06:49,079 --> 01:06:52,880
to argue look I has the value I don't

1468
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:54,520
want to give you my entire value it's

1469
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:56,880
too big you guys are my the verifiers

1470
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:58,799
you can't even read everything I wrote

1471
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:01,240
in my I can't give you my what I hashed

1472
01:06:58,799 --> 01:07:03,200
it's too big I want to open one bit I'm

1473
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:05,799
going to tell tell you look I hashed a

1474
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:08,520
value but the I bit of the value I

1475
01:07:05,799 --> 01:07:10,680
hashed is

1476
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:13,000
zero how do I know how do you know that

1477
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:15,680
it's zero oh I'm going to convince you I

1478
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:17,279
can kind of give kind of a local opening

1479
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:20,640
to this

1480
01:07:17,279 --> 01:07:23,319
x this is what I want okay so what I

1481
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:25,880
defined here is just a hash function but

1482
01:07:23,319 --> 01:07:29,720
then I can Define another primitive

1483
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:29,720
which is a hash function with local

1484
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:37,920
opening and that's what we actually need

1485
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:37,920
for the

1486
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:56,440
theorem so a hash function with local

1487
01:07:53,279 --> 01:07:59,400
opening has two additional algorithms

1488
01:07:56,440 --> 01:08:02,480
corresponding to it there's an open

1489
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:04,520
algorithm which allows you kind of to

1490
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:06,720
open to show kind of a I think to give

1491
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:08,880
you a little proof that the I bit of

1492
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:10,319
what i hashed is a certain value and

1493
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:12,319
then there's a verify algorithm that

1494
01:08:10,319 --> 01:08:14,920
verifies

1495
01:08:12,319 --> 01:08:16,679
it okay since we have only two minutes I

1496
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:19,359
think I'll I'll skip I'll next time I'll

1497
01:08:16,679 --> 01:08:21,319
show you the the local opening but maybe

1498
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:26,480
I'll just say tell you one minute of

1499
01:08:21,319 --> 01:08:26,480
like the idea uh behind

1500
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:34,920
is my theorem hiding somewhere maybe

1501
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:38,480
here oh yeah sorry it's the opposite

1502
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:41,279
okay behind this theorem so the the idea

1503
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:43,920
is what what I want to do is the their

1504
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:46,199
idea the high level what they do they

1505
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:48,560
take the prover will take this ginormous

1506
01:08:46,199 --> 01:08:50,600
PCP he wants to give it to the verifier

1507
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:52,799
but the verifier can't hold it so what

1508
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:55,759
he's going to do he's G going to give

1509
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:57,040
him a hash of this PCP hey this PCP and

1510
01:08:55,759 --> 01:09:00,000
just give him the hash value just slam

1511
01:08:57,040 --> 01:09:04,520
the bits now the verer has this hash

1512
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:07,000
value now now in some sense now theover

1513
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:09,040
is now the pro now the hash Val now the

1514
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:11,480
verifier is going to tell him okay thank

1515
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:14,960
you very much I'm going to behave as a

1516
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:17,679
as a PCP verifier so I'm going to

1517
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:20,279
generate Randomness ask to look at

1518
01:09:17,679 --> 01:09:23,759
locations I want I to up the i in your

1519
01:09:20,279 --> 01:09:25,480
PCP give me opening show me show open

1520
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:27,960
don't give me the entire PCP I can't I

1521
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:28,600
hold it give me only location i1 I2 of

1522
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:31,880
to

1523
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:34,520
I now the prover wants to give here no

1524
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:37,000
problem it's B1 B2 of to BL but the

1525
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:38,679
verifier needs to be how does he know

1526
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,960
that it it's indeed the opening of of

1527
01:09:38,679 --> 01:09:43,359
the hash so we're going to use a hash

1528
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:45,279
function that you can open so he's going

1529
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:48,000
to give him the bits with opening that

1530
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:51,799
see here's a opening or a little proof

1531
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:54,320
that in location i1 is sitting B1

1532
01:09:51,799 --> 01:09:57,000
location I2 I have B2 B2 and so on so

1533
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:58,320
forth and then the verifier is just

1534
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:01,360
going to check the opening that they're

1535
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:04,920
good and accept if the PCP verifier

1536
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:09,600
accepts so essentially all the idea you

1537
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:12,719
combine this PCP with kind of this

1538
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:15,000
cryptography a technology that kind of

1539
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:17,520
smushes this PCP into a small thing and

1540
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:20,719
allows you to kind of look kind of only

1541
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:22,760
at spe allows the Prov in a sense to

1542
01:10:20,719 --> 01:10:24,360
look only at specific locations

1543
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:25,920
computationally like you can give him

1544
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:29,400
little proofs that open in specific

1545
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:31,560
locations and then and and that's it

1546
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:34,560
that's what you get so next time we're

1547
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:37,640
going to Define uh the local opening

1548
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:40,600
we're going to see the the

1549
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:42,520
interactive argument in detail and prove

1550
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:44,480
uh that it satisfies the guarantees

1551
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:48,280
written here okay so we'll see you next

1552
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:48,280
Friday thanks
