1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:06,640
so I'm sitting between uh you and a very

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:08,639
exciting session with our uh startups uh

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,040
you're going to hear uh four exciting

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,799
startups uh present some their

5
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:14,719
Technologies and solutions that they've

6
00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:16,640
been developing uh over the years uh but

7
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:19,400
before we do that I wanted to take some

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,720
time and uh talk about our Innovation

9
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,240
driven entrepreneurial ecosystem around

10
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:27,039
MIT and share with you a little bit how

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,599
it works and how we collaborate with uh

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,880
industry and others uh to to make this

13
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,480
work my name is Olivia Kad I'm a program

14
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:38,960
director at MIT uh in corporate

15
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:43,280
relations and um as you know MIT stands

16
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:46,960
as a hub for uh research and Innovation

17
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,760
and um it's only through Partnerships

18
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,920
that uh with industry and

19
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:53,520
entrepreneurial leaders like yourselves

20
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:56,320
that our Innovation ecosystem can create

21
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,879
meaningful impact and the word impact is

22
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,559
super important for us here at MIT you

23
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:03,160
see an aerial view

24
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:05,560
of the uh area of Cambridge we are

25
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:07,479
sitting in we are in Kendall Square so I

26
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,360
found out when I moved from uh Houston

27
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:11,680
to Boston that people at MIT get

28
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,479
offended when we say that MIT is in

29
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,280
Boston MIT is actually in Cambridge I

30
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:20,560
just want to point out uh right across

31
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,400
the Charles River from um from

32
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,320
Boston

33
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,280
um we we all know that Innovation often

34
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:31,119
happens where discipline disciplines uh

35
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:33,119
converge and disciplines meets and this

36
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:36,119
is very true in Kendall Square in what

37
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:38,159
you see around MIT and a few years ago

38
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:39,720
uh two of our faculties at the Salone

39
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,640
School of Management Professor Fiona

40
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,479
Murray and Dr Phil button uh did a study

41
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,719
to understand what makes that Innovation

42
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,640
ecosystem work and they identified five

43
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:50,159
key

44
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:54,159
stakeholders uh that are present around

45
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:56,680
Kendall Square uh that are extremely

46
00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:00,240
close to one another and connect with

47
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:02,200
each other all the time back to what I

48
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,759
mentioned before about the collaboration

49
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,759
between all those stakeholders that's so

50
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,239
critical we have entrepreneurs up on top

51
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:10,560
these are probably the most critical

52
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,400
piece of the puzzle and you're going to

53
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,920
hear about four of them uh a little bit

54
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:18,000
later after my talk access to risk

55
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:21,360
Capital Liz touched on that this morning

56
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,879
what we do at MIT we do tough Tech we do

57
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,519
things that are uh Capital intensive

58
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:28,480
typically and so we do have we do need

59
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:31,599
access to risk capital and there's quite

60
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,519
a bit of it around in our ecosystem

61
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,720
corporate big companies and smaller

62
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:39,280
companies that are in our Innovation

63
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:41,440
sphere ecosystem they can be directly in

64
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,760
Cambridge in kenel square or connected

65
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,800
through the industrialism program uh

66
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,879
connected to that ecosystem government

67
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,120
plays a key role around MIT I'll share

68
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,879
with you some numbers in a minute but

69
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,200
more than 80% of our research um is

70
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:59,200
sponsored by uh uh the government and

71
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,440
then univ University or I would say even

72
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,319
universities because MIT collaborates

73
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,280
and you heard Kathleen talk about this

74
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:07,360
the work we do with community colleges

75
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,280
uh around and uh and more of these

76
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,239
initiatives so what's unique about

77
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,640
Kendall Square and the the ecosystem it

78
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:17,000
is in MIT is in is the proximity and the

79
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,720
density within that ecosystem of those

80
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,480
five key uh

81
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,239
stakeholders I want to share with you

82
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,840
some numbers and and a lot of you being

83
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,959
from industry these numbers will

84
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,959
resonate but MIT is a

85
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:32,280
nonprofit organizations organization

86
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:33,920
that's managed by a privately appointed

87
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,239
board of directors and we call that the

88
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,640
MIT Corporation if you look at MIT as a

89
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:44,640
look at it as a company our operating

90
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:47,280
budget every year or last year was $4.6

91
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,720
billion and it's quite a big number but

92
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,239
in that number what's more interesting

93
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:55,680
is how it split 46% of that budget is

94
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:59,000
dedicated to uh research sponsored

95
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:02,599
research 34% of that budget is dedicated

96
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,239
to uh teaching and instruction and right

97
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:08,640
there you see the two main drivers of

98
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,280
MIT that are part of the mission of Mi

99
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,360
is to teach and to do

100
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,799
research and I wanted to share with you

101
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:17,199
these numbers because when you look at

102
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:19,400
the two billion spent on R&D on research

103
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,280
on sponsored research it shows really

104
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:24,600
the power of the Institute the power of

105
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:27,560
MIT out of those two billion a big part

106
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:30,240
of it comes from uh activity on campus

107
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,400
about $800 million is spent on on campus

108
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,919
on sponsored research and we have about

109
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:38,560
1.2 billion spent in our MIT Lincoln lab

110
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:41,280
in Lexington that's a federally funded

111
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,320
research and development center ffrdc

112
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:47,160
that works for National Security so

113
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:49,400
typically DOD type of uh type of

114
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:52,440
activity historically MIT has been

115
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:54,919
involved in uh many discoveries and many

116
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:57,080
in Innovations if you look at the uh

117
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:58,919
picture on the bottom left part of the

118
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,800
screen you're going to see two

119
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:02,759
researchers working on development of

120
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,440
the radar technology during the second

121
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:07,720
world war this is really a time where

122
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,720
MIT pulled together about 4,000

123
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,120
researchers coming from all over the

124
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:14,280
world and all over the US from different

125
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,120
institutions and companies and they

126
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,199
developed the radar technology that

127
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,560
helped the Allies uh win the second

128
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:24,360
world war what you see on the uh bottom

129
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,960
right corner is the work that MIT did uh

130
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,840
during the Apollo Mission AP poo program

131
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,000
where MIT developed the guidance

132
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:34,840
navigation and control system this was

133
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,240
our our moonshop uh project and program

134
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:39,240
and uh still something that today is

135
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:42,240
very very difficult to do to navigate a

136
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:46,400
spacecraft uh uh hundreds and thousands

137
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,800
of miles away fast forward to today uh

138
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:52,319
we see sponsored we see research project

139
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,800
at MIT touching the Biotech Industry and

140
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:56,639
what you see the picture on the left

141
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:59,120
hand side up upper left corner is

142
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:02,080
Professor uh Bob Langer working with his

143
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,039
uh student then Bob Langer is at the uh

144
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:07,120
Foundation of uh

145
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:09,319
modna on the top right hand side you see

146
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,039
the work we do with plasma Fusion

147
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:13,840
commercial plasma fusion with a startup

148
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:15,919
company Commonwealth Fusion system that

149
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,840
came out of MIT came out of the plasma

150
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:21,039
science and fusion Center psfc Lab at

151
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:25,199
MIT raised

152
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:27,520
$1.8 billion dollar in series B 1.8

153
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,960
billion so when I talk about t Tech and

154
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,360
capital intensive industry that's a

155
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:34,759
great example of that and today is on

156
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:38,240
part to demonstrate commercial Fusion uh

157
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:41,960
in 2026 with um a plasma Fusion reactor

158
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:44,599
they're building in uh devans U an hour

159
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:47,479
away from campus so these are just some

160
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:49,720
illustrations of the history of MIT and

161
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:52,800
the the kind of um impact that we're

162
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,280
having uh today we love numbers at MIT

163
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,720
so I wanted to share with you a few

164
00:06:54,280 --> 00:07:00,280
additional numbers we have over 177,000

165
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,080
employees a th000 professors and 12,000

166
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,599
students and an interesting

167
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,800
characteristics if you look at our

168
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:10,280
student body is 60% of them are at The

169
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,639
Graduate level 40% are undergrad so it

170
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,919
shows you also the the research capacity

171
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:18,479
that we have at MIT through our students

172
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:21,800
and oh by the way 91% of our undergrads

173
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:24,039
get involved in research projects that's

174
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,240
the the quality of students we um we

175
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:27,840
have at MIT there's a statistics we're

176
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,720
very proud of as well look at our

177
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,759
undergrad class our current class that

178
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:35,599
entered last August about a thousand um

179
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:38,199
people 49% women it's also an

180
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:41,120
illustration of the uh Testament of MIT

181
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:43,759
to push women in science and continue to

182
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,840
uh continue to do

183
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:51,560
that if we continue with a few uh

184
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:53,800
numbers um MIT launched back in 2013 an

185
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:56,560
initiative uh across a different schools

186
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,879
the five schools at the time um to

187
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,520
really enhance the uh institute's

188
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,240
culture of Innovation and

189
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,680
Entrepreneurship and at the time they

190
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,759
came up with an interesting definition

191
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,599
of innovation that's only one of the

192
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,800
many definitions you can you can think

193
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:13,319
of but we look at Innovation as a

194
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:15,720
process of taking ideas from inception

195
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:18,000
to impact what's interesting in that

196
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,680
definition the word technology is not

197
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,919
there and there's a reason for that

198
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,000
because we all understand that

199
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:25,400
Innovation goes well beyond technology

200
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,280
there's other components you need to

201
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,120
take into account and there's another

202
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,120
interesting aspect is when you when you

203
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:35,760
look at Innovation as a process you go

204
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:38,479
beyond the instant moment of invention

205
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,959
and you push towards the uh continuous

206
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,159
process sometimes highly nonlinear of

207
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:45,480
innovation and and this is this is a

208
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:48,360
definition that resonates well with our

209
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:50,560
researchers and scientists uh on campus

210
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:53,200
we have over 65 research Labs centers

211
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:56,120
and programs as I said we spent uh last

212
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,920
year about $800 uh million on sponsored

213
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:02,200
research 20% of that came from industry

214
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:04,959
and we have had uh 343 patents issued in

215
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:07,560
fiscal year 24 I realize this is only

216
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:11,040
one way of measuring the impact of MIT

217
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:13,000
what's a lot more um important for us is

218
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,200
the concept of technology transfer

219
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,720
that's really at the core of mit's

220
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,480
Mission to advance knowledge so Moving

221
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:22,880
Innovation from the from the lab into

222
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,040
the marketplace is really a driver that

223
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,880
you will see very strongly represented

224
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:30,360
within our researchers and faculty and

225
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:34,640
scientists at uh at MIT that's something

226
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:37,399
that really drives uh them and and also

227
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:41,120
is important for uh

228
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:43,519
students we we're very fortunate to um

229
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,160
have uh a very strong industrial yon

230
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,320
program at MIT this program was

231
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:50,160
established after the second world war

232
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:52,680
at a time where uh the United States uh

233
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:55,000
needed more collaboration between

234
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:58,079
universities and and uh in industry in

235
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,200
general and back in 1948 the industrial

236
00:09:58,079 --> 00:10:02,720
Ison program was established lished

237
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:05,160
today we have uh over 200 member

238
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:08,160
companies a lot of them represented in

239
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:11,200
this uh in this room and our mission is

240
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:14,160
very simple in the ILP um we're here to

241
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,560
connect industry to MIT and how do we do

242
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,640
that we do that by enabling large

243
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,079
organizations strategically engage with

244
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,440
mit's Innovation ecosystem that I just

245
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:26,360
talked about it's a fairly complex

246
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,320
Innovation ecosystem um companies need

247
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,079
some guidance to make sure they tap into

248
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,399
the right lab the right researcher the

249
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,760
right faculty and this this is really

250
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:39,079
what we do in our

251
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:41,880
program um the uh through the ILP uh

252
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:45,120
program companies can do um quite a few

253
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:47,480
things uh at MIT one of the ways to

254
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,839
engage with us is to use the program to

255
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,800
develop uh your talents and your

256
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,720
employees and we just touched on that in

257
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,959
the previous panel session how important

258
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:59,720
it is to stay up to speed on different

259
00:10:55,959 --> 00:11:03,480
Technologies like Ai and digital Etc so

260
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:05,519
using the ILP to have access to learning

261
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,399
Expeditions uh we do a lot of that for

262
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:10,000
companies access to our webinars

263
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:12,639
conferences like this one and others we

264
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,200
hold on campus uh this is something a

265
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:16,800
lot of Our member companies leverage and

266
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,800
use quite a bit the second piece is the

267
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,360
process of discovery and it's really

268
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:24,120
engaging with faculty and researchers on

269
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,519
campus talking about strategic problems

270
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,839
for your organization and and finding

271
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:30,839
Solutions together co-developing uh

272
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:32,320
Solutions together and then finally

273
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:35,000
networking that's what we're going to do

274
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,079
at lunch in a in in a few minutes uh

275
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,720
connecting with companies organizations

276
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:41,880
in the program but also connecting with

277
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:45,399
the more than 800 startups we have uh in

278
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:47,880
our startup exchange uh

279
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:50,200
program speaking of the MIT startup

280
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:52,000
exchange uh that program complements the

281
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,160
industrial isone program by connecting

282
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,560
companies with startups that our Prime

283
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,279
uh for collaboration this program was

284
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,920
created over N9 years ago um and

285
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,600
supports MIT connected startups in

286
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,760
growing expanding and solving the

287
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,399
world's greatest challenges and this is

288
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,800
what you're going to hear um in a few

289
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:13,560
minutes when we have those four startups

290
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,600
do doing their uh lightning

291
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:17,360
talks they they do that the startup

292
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,880
Exchange program does that through demo

293
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,320
days lightning talks at different

294
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:24,199
conferences the st25 program which is a

295
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:26,399
one-year program for uh handful uh of

296
00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:28,199
startups that are selected and that

297
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,560
program really Fosters relationship

298
00:12:28,199 --> 00:12:32,839
between industry and startups and and

299
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,920
these are sometimes difficult links to

300
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:37,560
establish these are almost two different

301
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,160
worlds that speak different languages

302
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:41,680
but the startup Exchange program really

303
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:44,160
brings those two together and that's uh

304
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,760
that creates meaningful impact and great

305
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:49,440
results so as you saw uh engaging with

306
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:51,760
MIT is isn't about accessing a single

307
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,279
resource or solving a single problem

308
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,440
it's really about becoming part of a

309
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,440
broader ecosystem that I just talked

310
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,800
about with the five key stakeholders

311
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,720
that I mentioned through programs that

312
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,800
the like the industrial isone program or

313
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,639
the startup Exchange program we aim aim

314
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:08,320
to contribute to those Partnerships by

315
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:10,240
offering early insights collaborative

316
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,800
opportunities and access to a community

317
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,880
of passionate and mission-driven

318
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:20,959
um researchers scientists and faculty to

319
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:20,959
solve tough problems and make an impact
