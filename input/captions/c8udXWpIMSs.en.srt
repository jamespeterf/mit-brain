00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,799
in the early 1980s Richard feeman

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,720
suggested that if we want to simulate a

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,679
Quantum system a task that's very hard

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,960
for a classical computer we should in

5
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:12,000
fact use a Quantum system to perform

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,440
that

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,720
simulation basically he was suggesting

8
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,400
we should build a quantum computer he

9
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,720
also noted that it's a very interesting

10
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,160
problem because it's not so easy and he

11
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,240
was right over the next decade or so

12
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,920
researchers thought about what kinds of

13
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,599
algorithms could potentially give a

14
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:31,039
Quantum Advantage for real world

15
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:33,079
problems of significance and also how

16
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,280
fragile Quantum States could ever be

17
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:37,840
used to implement such an algorithm the

18
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,800
answer started to come in the mid 1990s

19
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,680
with the discovery of shor's algorithm

20
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,520
developed by Peter Shore shor's

21
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,800
algorithm was not the first Quantum

22
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,840
algorithm to show Quantum Advantage but

23
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,199
it was the first that also addressed an

24
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,120
important practical problem namely the

25
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:56,000
factorization of large numbers for more
