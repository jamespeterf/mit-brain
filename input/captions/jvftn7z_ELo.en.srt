1
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,000
They often say it doesn't take a rocket

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,440
scientist, but what if it does? What

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,160
does it take to make a career in

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:19,119
launching vehicles into outer space?

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,039
>> Arrow Astro Professor Carrie Cowboy of

6
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,640
MIT tells her story about how she got

7
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,160
started and what she finds most

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:29,039
exciting.

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:32,719
So I was working in college and um I was

10
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:35,600
there on um federal work study. So I I

11
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,520
you know had to get funding to go to

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,600
college and didn't didn't have another

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,480
way to do it. Um and so I'd been working

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,040
in the libraries and I saw this

15
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,399
advertisement um for somebody needed an

16
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,480
undergraduate researcher to help with a

17
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,399
Mars rover program and that turned out

18
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,239
to be professor Steve Squires at Cornell

19
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,559
who ended up launching the the Mars

20
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:57,520
rover. So I started interning with him

21
00:00:54,559 --> 00:01:00,079
and um was working on Mars rovers with

22
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,920
Steve Squires for a while and then um I

23
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,600
was in electrical engineering and got

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,879
into satellites. Went to grad school in

25
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,799
that. So that's kind of how I got

26
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,240
involved. It was it seemed like a cooler

27
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,080
job. I love being in the library, don't

28
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,479
get me wrong. Definitely a book word. My

29
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,439
first my I'm a bookworm and my first

30
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,040
word was book, but like

31
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,799
but the rovers were were a lot of fun.

32
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,000
>> But but you love this. You love

33
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:24,720
satellites. Why?

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,280
>> It is challenging. Um, it is one of the

35
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,600
most mentally challenging, toughest

36
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,680
fields I've ever been in because when it

37
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:37,200
breaks, it is gone. And it is really

38
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,600
hard um to

39
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,840
obtain funding, get funding to do it,

40
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,520
get the hardware built, have it working,

41
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,759
get it to the rocket, have it to survive

42
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,320
the rocket launch, get up to orbit, and

43
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,640
then you're able to do things and get

44
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,320
perspectives that really there's no

45
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,840
other way to do it. And you're also able

46
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,840
to answer science questions um like for

47
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,280
astronomers and astrophysicists or

48
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,960
people who are doing remote sensing on

49
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,439
Earth that you can't get that data any

50
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,799
other way. Um so that and that part's

51
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,920
really rewarding. Watching a rocket

52
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,920
launch is worth a good five years of

53
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,599
working your butt off. I would say like

54
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,680
if I had to give the trade like just

55
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,720
having a rocket launch, feeling the

56
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,720
blast and watching knowing that you know

57
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,160
your spacecraft is on there and then you

58
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,840
have to run back and make sure it works

59
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,520
but like that it's on there and it's

60
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,520
going up is like one of the coolest

61
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,840
feelings ever. So there's a lot of joy

62
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,319
and pride and um skill building and

63
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,239
challenge in in in the field. So that

64
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:35,040
that's one of the reasons why why I why

65
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:38,160
I love it even though it's really

66
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,080
frustrating a lot of the time.

67
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,760
>> As you do your work here at MIT, can you

68
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,480
see what the next big thing is likely to

69
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,800
be?

70
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,400
>> Um it's it's exciting. You never know

71
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,400
what the next big thing is, but some of

72
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,080
the things that I think are exciting are

73
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,920
um the ability of satellites to

74
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,239
communicate directly to cell phones.

75
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,560
Now, I know um Aridium and the Aridium

76
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,280
phones have been a thing for a while,

77
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,440
but directing connecting directly to

78
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,959
existing consumer electronics without

79
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:07,200
modification, your iPhone um is

80
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,959
happening. And so they're essentially

81
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,400
showing um there are multiple companies

82
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,159
now who are starting to show that you

83
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,640
can actually take the technology that

84
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,480
are normal cell towers on the ground and

85
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,720
put them in lower Earth orbit and they

86
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,480
will work with your phone. And so we

87
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,319
have some search and rescue signals and

88
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,480
partnerships between um companies um

89
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,920
like Apple Global Star and there are a

90
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,000
few other companies that are working in

91
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,360
this space to do direct to cell phone.

92
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,720
Um I think that's going to be really

93
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,239
interesting um as as as time evolves um

94
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,959
especially as we have more autonomous

95
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,799
vehicles and people are you know needing

96
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,879
entertainment and data in in different

97
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:45,200
places because they they have more time

98
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:46,720
to use it. Um I think also on orbit uh

99
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,040
getting to the point where we have more

100
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:52,000
compute on orbit. Right now satellites

101
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,680
mostly are run by um not very

102
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,280
sophisticated computers. Um they're

103
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,799
they're getting better um and they're

104
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,760
starting to use more commercial

105
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:03,599
technology, more of the um Nvidia chips

106
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:06,879
and AMD chips on orbit. Um but when

107
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,799
we're developing it's really hard to

108
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,640
only just take pictures and then send

109
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,439
them all down to the ground. So you have

110
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,120
a lot of data that in the normal mode of

111
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,519
operations you take a lot of data and

112
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,359
you communicate it by radio usually

113
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,680
because of weather all down to the

114
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,919
ground and then you process it on the

115
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,639
ground and then you tell your satellites

116
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:28,320
what to do next. So there's a cycle of

117
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,400
getting data down to the ground and it's

118
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,240
hard to get data down to the ground. Um

119
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,759
getting frequency licenses is difficult.

120
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,080
It's expensive. Requires a lot of

121
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,880
management. Um requires a lot of power

122
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,120
on board. Um, so putting computers on

123
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:44,880
board that can survive on board and

124
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:47,919
running now some of the new AI models so

125
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,360
you can take the picture on board. You

126
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,880
have a model that can decide whether or

127
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,720
not what you wanted in the picture is in

128
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,080
the picture. If it's in the picture, it

129
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,360
prioritizes it. If it's not in the

130
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,199
picture, it throws it out. If it's a

131
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,040
cloudy picture, it throws it out and

132
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,600
saves only the things you really wanted

133
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,040
and then sends it back down. Um, also

134
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,120
getting the satellites to communicate

135
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,680
between each other so that they can tell

136
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,360
each other, hey, I finished this task,

137
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,360
here's the next in the task list, passed

138
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,360
back to you, kind of like playing tag

139
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,639
instead of waiting for that satellite to

140
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,120
tell the ground and the ground to tell

141
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:20,240
everybody what the new plan is. So being

142
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,680
able to replan, retask, um, and to be

143
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,080
able to make decisions about what is

144
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,080
good and bad data dynamically will be

145
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,000
new and exciting.

146
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,240
One of the things Professor Cowoy and

147
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,400
her team of grad students is working on

148
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,720
is a sort of robot that can be launched

149
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,800
into orbit and then assemble satellites

150
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,039
in space to avoid the rough and tumble

151
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,039
of the launch itself.

152
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:44,639
>> All right. So, um, so this is a project

153
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:47,360
that's called orbital locker. Um, one of

154
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,120
the challenges about space is that you

155
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,360
have to get everything to orbit. And to

156
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:55,199
get to orbit has to go in a rocket and

157
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:57,360
rockets are very vibrating, dynamic,

158
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,160
loud, they shake everything a lot. So

159
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,919
>> during the launch

160
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,120
>> during the launch, yeah, it's for those

161
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,120
first couple, it's only a couple

162
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,840
minutes, but they're very important

163
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,840
minutes. And so everything we do about

164
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,600
satellites, we pack them in tight. We

165
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,720
glue everything down. Everything's tied

166
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:16,080
down, latched down, you know, locked in.

167
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:18,319
so that nothing breaks um and most of

168
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,039
the time um when it's going up in the

169
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,960
rocket um and then when we get to orbit

170
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:25,039
the you know fairing opens we get to

171
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:28,160
orbit the satellites deploy it it's in

172
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:30,240
orbit the solar panels will unfurl um

173
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,039
but you basically have the thing you

174
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,600
built on the ground um what we were

175
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,520
thinking is wouldn't it be great if you

176
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:41,600
could put

177
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:44,319
a platform in orbit that

178
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,840
was packed with things that don't break

179
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,080
when they're on a rocket. So, very

180
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:51,039
simple components that you can just stow

181
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,199
away and you had these kind of robust

182
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:55,120
robots that can unpack it themselves,

183
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,120
but then they can build whatever they

184
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,960
want. Once they get up on orbit, there's

185
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,599
no shaking once you're on orbit. It's

186
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,479
very quiet.

187
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,720
>> So, it's a kit.

188
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,000
>> Yeah, it's like a kit. It's a kit where

189
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:08,160
the only thing that has to survive the

190
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,479
rocket launch are these um XYZ, so three

191
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,520
axis robots that move around and an arm

192
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:15,919
that snaps everything together. And um

193
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,639
as long as these elements are robust

194
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:21,440
enough to not get destroyed or damaged

195
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,520
in the launch um you can go up to orbit

196
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,039
and build something as big as you want.

197
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,720
>> But you have to program in advance what

198
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,599
the robot has to do assemble in what

199
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,599
order and things, right?

200
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,759
>> Yes. So there's a lot of algorithm work

201
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:34,319
and software work and that. But the nice

202
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,800
part about this is the platform on orbit

203
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,240
you can still talk to. You can reprogram

204
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,840
things on orbit. You can give it

205
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,759
different directions if you want to. You

206
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,199
just need to make sure you kind of know

207
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,639
what's in your warehouse. So it's kind

208
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:49,039
of like almost a a warehouse of hardware

209
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,120
that you could use on orbit to assemble

210
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:53,120
things and deploy them and make them as

211
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,759
big and as complicated as you want

212
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,560
without having to fit in the, you know,

213
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:01,280
the couple meters. Um, I think you know

214
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,199
if we get Starship up to six meters um

215
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,039
of space that you have in a rocket, you

216
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,440
could go well well beyond that and not

217
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,840
have to pre-plan everything to unfurl

218
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,160
and deploy. You could just build it the

219
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,120
way you wanted it as big as you wanted

220
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,479
um once you get up there.

221
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,800
>> Is this a prototype? Has this actually

222
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,639
been used?

223
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,440
>> This is a prototype. So this this has

224
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,360
been used um so this recently in May was

225
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,199
on a zero gravity launch. So the

226
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,000
graduate students, James and Laya, who

227
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:28,400
are working on it to get on one of those

228
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,440
um planes that do the parabolic flights.

229
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,360
And so you have microgravity for, you

230
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,959
know, a few seconds, 30 seconds at a

231
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,959
time. And so they had the robot working

232
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:40,479
there. And they they actually um learned

233
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:43,039
a lot about cord management. So wires

234
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,560
don't behave this. They don't lay down

235
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,160
like like this when they're in gravity.

236
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,519
Like they're kind of held down, but when

237
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,279
they're on orbit, they move around a lot

238
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,760
more. And so we had to um update our

239
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:54,399
wire management systems. Um and then

240
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:57,200
we'd like to get this to be a prototype

241
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,640
on orbit um on the space station so it

242
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,480
could be inside the station and we could

243
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,720
start to demonstrate it or on a free

244
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,360
flyer on its own satellite um later. So

245
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,120
that's that's kind of what we're hoping.

246
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,279
>> That does it for us here at Wall Street

247
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,360
Week. I'm David Weston. See you next

248
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:22,399
week for more stories of capitalism.
