1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,279
thank you all for inviting me here today

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:06,200
I'm excited to talk about the company so

3
00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:09,160
I'm Joyce Wang CEO and co-founder of

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:11,840
onlogic during my PhD in Neuroscience

5
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,599
here at MIT I encountered many technical

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,199
hurdles that prevented me from moving as

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,760
quickly as I wanted to in my research um

8
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:19,960
and these hurdles are actually common

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,720
throughout biotech and

10
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:24,359
Pharma um if you're not familiar with

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,119
this space essentially one of the most

12
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:28,080
challenging things you can do in the

13
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:30,359
discovery phase of research is to choose

14
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,399
which experiments to run right now to

15
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,559
Der risk your leads um the problem is

16
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:38,480
biology is hard so you wait for cells to

17
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:40,280
incubate or for animals to be born and

18
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,640
when every experiment takes a quarter to

19
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,079
run you have six tries to get it right

20
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,079
before your program is

21
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:50,039
cut even when your early experiments

22
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:52,359
succeed as program matures research

23
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:55,079
teams run into friction scaling up

24
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:57,520
especially around data management and

25
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:00,000
Analysis the practices that benefited

26
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,800
fast exploratory work in the early phase

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,239
are not built to handle the large

28
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,240
volumes of complex data that uh happen

29
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,360
further down the line and this is where

30
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,759
teams run into the most

31
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,040
problems for a bench scientist this

32
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:13,680
looks like relying more on the

33
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,400
bioinformatics team to analyze their

34
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,960
growing data backlog and longer riskier

35
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,560
experiment

36
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,759
timelines for a computational researcher

37
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,119
this looks like putting out urgent

38
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:26,960
one-off analysis fires instead of

39
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:30,200
developing a robust pipeline to track

40
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,960
and record data issues in the long run

41
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,720
and for a team leader this looks like

42
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:36,079
spending more time finding data than

43
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,720
leveraging it to guide the

44
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,920
program being unable to scale the

45
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,360
program could mean never getting to the

46
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,159
clinic because you couldn't show enough

47
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:47,399
proof in

48
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,159
time at onlogic we formalize data struct

49
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:51,320
infrastructure so that our customers can

50
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:53,880
make sense of their

51
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,799
science with our platform computational

52
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,159
researchers can develop novel analyses

53
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,520
in a browser based IDE and then quickly

54
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,880
cast their code into a reusable workflow

55
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,840
that runs on the cloud this frees them

56
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,479
up to focus on analyzing data for others

57
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:09,280
to build

58
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:11,200
on bench scientists can then use these

59
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,000
workflows with the click of a button no

60
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,160
more waiting on others for new code for

61
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,800
every new experiment they can now look

62
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:19,640
at the results directly and determine

63
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,840
how successful their experiment

64
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,040
was and by gathering the important

65
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,040
updates from these different data

66
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,760
sources it allows leadership to quickly

67
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,040
get the key insights from each

68
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,760
experiment all in one place now they

69
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,200
what they need to course correct the

70
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,160
company and make sure that those six

71
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,680
tries

72
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,560
count with these three functions onlogic

73
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,640
allows scientists to focus on the

74
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,680
science by automating the technical

75
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:46,159
infrastructure that is so often a hurdle

76
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,519
rather than a benefit and most

77
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:50,159
importantly our platform meets

78
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,159
researchers where they are it's almost

79
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:53,560
everything agnostic which means no

80
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:55,280
requirement for specific programming

81
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,840
language compute backend or

82
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,120
orchestration system it runs analyses

83
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,720
deploys code and tracks data right where

84
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,920
people need

85
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:06,519
it together these functions provide

86
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,200
flexibility at every stage of research

87
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:10,120
one of our users a cell biology

88
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,120
researcher ad of Emory was starting a

89
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,599
new experiment um she was facing a

90
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,200
massive time sync trying to troubleshoot

91
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,440
both her protocol and her analysis at

92
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,000
the same time with onic Alicia was able

93
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,680
to use a field standard analysis

94
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,280
pipeline all on her browser without

95
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,840
having to write any code running her

96
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,080
data through the platform right after

97
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,760
every experiment she estimates that onic

98
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,760
saves her 10 to 20 hours per month

99
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:36,319
our dedication to serving growing teams

100
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:38,360
is how we've chosen to Define our beach

101
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:41,000
Head Market we're working with assay

102
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:42,640
development teams in Pharma C and early

103
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,920
stage biotech companies to make sure

104
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,120
that they're scaling up their processes

105
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,120
well from the

106
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,879
beginning we know that our platform can

107
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,560
serve this Market because it is built by

108
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,040
and for scientists with software

109
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,519
engineering best practices from Google

110
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,959
and

111
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,360
Cisco today we're looking for design

112
00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:00,799
Partners in Pharma and biotech we work

113
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,239
with R&D teams of around 20 to 50 people

114
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,480
and would love to start a PC with your

115
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:09,360
group thanks for your time thank you

116
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:12,000
Joyce right um let me start by asking

117
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:15,040
what is the biggest problem that you are

118
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,320
encountering as as companies um look

119
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,759
into this yeah so as we all know um it's

120
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,280
kind of a hard time right now in biotech

121
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,160
and Pharma um as I'm sure we're all

122
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,960
familiar um people are sort of

123
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,440
tightening their belts and hoping that

124
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,040
the existing resources that they've

125
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,120
already invested in can yield the

126
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,600
returns that they expected um and and so

127
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,560
we basically help you make the most out

128
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,520
of your resources by um supercharging

129
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,280
the scientists that work already with

130
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,840
them so um we take the scientific data

131
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,360
that you already have and we track all

132
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,680
of it for you we automatically Trace

133
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,360
Providence and help you search through

134
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,919
the metadata for you to be able to find

135
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,400
the results um out of the things that

136
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,320
you already

137
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:53,199
have thank

138
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:56,440
you and what kinds of contacts in large

139
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:58,840
biofarma um would be helpful at this

140
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,320
point to connect with and how do you

141
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:04,479
adapt to like

142
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,840
custom um cases yeah so uh I'll answer

143
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,800
the first one first um we're mostly

144
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,800
focused on the Discovery phase of

145
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,440
research so this is uh before you go

146
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,520
into the clinic so pre-clinical work in

147
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,320
general um we tend to work best with

148
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,199
companies that are developing new assays

149
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,600
in Pharma companies so not necessarily

150
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:22,680
focus on a specific asset but uh trying

151
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,520
to make a method that advances the

152
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,720
capability of the entire company um if

153
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,759
that makes sense um and I'm happy to

154
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,440
talk more uh during the breakout rooms

155
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:33,479
if you have more questions um uh sorry

156
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,039
your second question was about um just

157
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:38,800
how you adapt to uh custom cases if you

158
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:41,960
can give an example so that's kind of

159
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:45,919
our biggest um strong suit our strongest

160
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:47,840
suit um yeah so as I said before um we

161
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,400
have uh in the example that I gave with

162
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,400
one of our customers um we gave her a

163
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,479
pretty field standard analysis tool um

164
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,039
but that's not the only thing that we do

165
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,120
we're not just providing a tool boox of

166
00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:58,560
existing code um our specialty is

167
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,039
working with custom data so any

168
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,560
programming language that you write in

169
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:03,639
anybody in your team who knows how to

170
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,919
code we basically work uh with them on

171
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:06,280
our platform so that they can

172
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:07,840
automatically package that into

173
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:10,400
something that is reproducible and easy

174
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,840
to use by everybody else so most of our

175
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,680
customers write their custom code on

176
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,199
onto logic and can easily share them

177
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:20,560
with everybody in the organization

178
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:20,560
immediately thank you Joyce
